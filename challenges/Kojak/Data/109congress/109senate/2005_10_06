I particularly thank those Members--especially Senators \nStevens and Inouye--who have worked so aggressively on the bill and who \nover the course of the day will continue to try to clear amendments on \nboth sides of the aisle. We will have votes over the course of the day \non those amendments.\n  We can and should push forward on this bill today and tonight and try \nto finish the bill. If necessary, we will be here tomorrow to complete \nour work for the week. There are a number of other issues that are \ncurrently being discussed, debated, and talked about, including the \nhomeland security conference report as well as pensions legislation, \nwhich I have mentioned regularly.\n  I hope we will be able to proceed with the cooperation of all \nSenators over the course of the day as we seek final passage of the \nDefense appropriations bill. The time does expire early in the morning \ntomorrow. Thus, we should work toward completing that bill this \nafternoon and this evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/06/senate-section/article/S11173-7", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11173-S11174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HUNGARIAN PRIME MINISTER\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, later this afternoon, several of my \ncolleagues and I have the honor of hosting Hungarian Prime Minister \nFerenc Gyurcsany in the U.S. Capitol.\n  The Prime Minister has served for just a little bit over 1 year. His \ncountry, as we all know, is a valued friend and ally of the United \nStates. Hungary's transition to a Western-style parliamentary democracy \nwas the first and smoothest of the countries formally under the \ndominion of the Soviet bloc.\n  In May of 1990, Hungary held its first free parliamentary election. \nIn the intervening years, Hungary has made tremendous strides in \nstrengthening its democratic foundation and becoming more integrated in \nthe Euro-Atlantic institutions. It became a full NATO ally in March of \n1999. Last spring, it earned full membership to the European Union, the \nEU.\n  Today, the United States and Hungary maintain a positive and a \nproductive bilateral relationship. Our two countries work closely \ntogether and through international organizations such as the EU and \nNATO. In particular, Hungary has been a steadfast ally for the United \nStates and NATO missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and in the Balkans. It \nis a member of the coalition that liberated Iraq. It also contributed \ntroops to Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and has played an \nimportant role in the training and equipping of the Afghan National \nArmy. Recently, Hungary offered to lead one of the provincial \nreconstruction teams to help stabilize Afghanistan.\n  Hungary is a brave nation. Hungary is a proud nation. On behalf of \nthe American people, I express my most sincere gratitude and respect \nfor the invaluable contributions it has made to the war effort.\n  Hungary is also playing another invaluable role in the spread of \ndemocracy. As a nation only recently emerged from decades of tyranny, \nHungary is sharing its unique lessons with today's emerging \ndemocracies. It has established an International Center for Democratic \nTransition to reach out and nurture the world's newest democracies. The \ncenter will act as a resource for countries in transition.\n\n[[Page S11174]]\n\nThere, they can gain insights into the obstacles and opportunities \nbefore them. I have no doubt that this new center will help democracy \ntake root, to grow, and to flourish, and will help the world's newly \nemerging democracies succeed.\n  During our talks this afternoon, I look forward to discussing these \nand many other issues of mutual interest with the Prime Minister. The \nUnited States and Hungary have worked hard to build a close, \ncooperative relationship. I am confident that through continued \nexchanges and dialog, we can deepen and solidify our bond as champions \nand defenders of freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/06/senate-section/article/S11174-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11174-S11186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2005\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to speak as in morning \nbusiness. If any other Senator comes and wants to speak about an \namendment on the underlying bill, I would be pleased to wrap up my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Speaking in my capacity as a Senator from \nAlaska and manager of the bill, I would agree to the unanimous consent \nthat the Senator may speak but would yield the floor in the event \nsomeone wishes to call up an amendment or speak on the bill. Is that \nagreed?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, I would.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized as in morning business.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I begin by thanking the Senator in the chair for his \nleadership in trying to help us move this Defense appropriations bill \nthrough the Congress. It is, of course, an extremely important bill, \nand it is a very difficult bill to manage because it is large and \ncomplicated and multidimensional and a great need. I thank the Senator \nfrom Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii for helping us to manage \nthrough this as we try to wrap up this week.\n  (Ms. Murkowski assumed the Chair.)\n\n\n                           Hurricane Katrina\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, one of the reasons I come to the floor \nthis morning is to speak about an issue that I brought up on the floor, \nnow many times, and so has the other Senator from Louisiana and Members \nof our delegation, as well as Members from the Gulf Coast States that \nhave been affected by Katrina, to try to see what we can do to get some \naid to our States, directly into the hands of people who can actually \nput that money to good use, so we do not leave here this weekend \nwithout having done something very clearly and very specifically.\n  Now, this Congress has acted with dispatch over the last 4 weeks to \nallocate and appropriate money to FEMA, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, that is tasked with the responsibility of managing \ndisasters such as this when they are of such a magnitude it is really \nimpossible for individual cities or individual counties or individual \nparishes or even regions to handle them.\n  This storm was just that. It was a category 5 storm, with a surge of \ntide that had the highest recorded level at 29 feet of water--a tsunami \nbasically of 30 feet, approximately--that slammed into the gulf coast \nabout 32 days ago and devastated the energy coast of this Nation--or a \nlarge part of the energy coast.\n  Assessments are being done by insurance companies, corporations, \nmultinational companies, small companies, law enforcement, cities, \nparishes, and counties to try to get a handle on the damage, but it is \nstaggering.\n  This special edition, which I have been reviewing since I picked it \nup yesterday, is done by National Geographic. It is a special edition \non Katrina and Rita. It was contributed to by the Times-Picayune, the \nDallas Morning News, the New York Times, and it truly is remarkable \nwork: ``Katrina, Why It Became a Man-Made Disaster'' and ``Where It \nCould Happen Next.'' It takes us through a series of not just the way \nthe hurricane formed and how powerful and devastating it was, but how \nthe levees could have been breached or how the levees might have \ncollapsed, because that assessment is still being made about how many \nhouses have been lost, about how many thousands of square miles were \nflooded in New Orleans, in Saint Bernard, in Saint Tammany Parish, in \nPlaquemines Parish, how the entire parish of Cameron, that had 10,000 \nstructures 8 days ago, now has one structure standing; a courthouse \nthat was built by the New Deal, the only structure standing in Cameron \nParish.\n  It talks about how the combination of these two killer storms, and \nthe neglect on the part of many--cost cutting that obviously did not \npay off--how it has now wrecked this economic powerhouse. It says, \nactually, the economic power has been brought to its knees. The center \nof that powerhouse would be the State I represent in the Senate, the \nState of Louisiana, that is home to the Mississippi River, the greatest \ndelta on the continent, the greatest river on the continent.\n  On that river are the largest ports in America. The eye of the first \nstorm, Katrina, went right over the Port of New Orleans, the South \nLouisiana Port, and barely missed the other large port, which is the \nPort of Baton Rouge, which hosts the energy industry, the petrochemical \nindustry, the refining industry, the agriculture industry, the \ncommercial industry, the maritime industry--the bulk of it in the \nNation. It was a direct hit to the heart of the energy coast.\n  Not only is Louisiana feeling this, with 2 million people along the \ngulf coast displaced--hundreds of thousands of people have lost their \nentire home, their entire business; the people of New Orleans, in large \nmeasure, and Saint Bernard and Plaquemines have lost their entire \nparish--but everyone in America is feeling this because of the higher \nprice of goods, the higher price of gasoline, and the higher price of \nnatural gas.\n  There are 9,000 miles of pipeline connecting oil and gas exploration \nin the Gulf of Mexico. We have been struggling to get those pipelines \nback up and running. The trade and commerce of the Port of South \nLouisiana, combined with the Port of New Orleans, dwarfs the Port of \nHouston, the Ports of New York and New Jersey, and the Port of \nBeaumont, TX, which was also hit and has some destruction from Rita--\nthank goodness, not the same level of destruction, thank goodness that \nwe didn't lose the Port of Beaumont or the Port of Houston.\n  Our ports, from the Port of Lake Charles, from the western side, to \nthe Port of Iberia, to the Port of Morgan City, to the ports along the \nMississippi River, to the Port of Fourchon, which is the only deepwater \nenergy port in the Nation right on the gulf, the damage has been \nextensive and tremendous. To this day, 30 days after--and we will be \nfor months and perhaps even years--we are struggling to stand up that \ninfrastructure.\n  The long-term building effort is going to be difficult and \ncomplicated. I am sorry to say this because we have been criticized for \nsaying it, but it is going to be expensive. There is no cheap or easy \nway out of it. How we pay for it, what revenues we assign, whether we \nraise revenues to do it, use revenues we have, assess new approaches, \nborrow the money, in some\n\n[[Page S11175]]\n\nway the Federal Government and State governments and industry have to \ncome up with the billions of dollars it is going to cost to restore the \ninfrastructure and the marshland that protects this infrastructure, \nthat services the economy of the Nation and the world.\n  Let me try to be as clear as I can on some of these points. There are \nonly a few ways to get grain out of Kansas and the Midwest. You can put \nit on railroads, put it on trucks, or you can put it on big barges. It \nis a little slower on the barges, but it is a lot less expensive. You \ncan move the grain that we supply and literally feed ourselves and the \nworld with it, but it has to go through on barges, down some rivers, \nand the Mississippi River is the River that we primarily use, that the \nMissouri and the Ohio run into down the Mississippi for trade around \nthe world. If this infrastructure is left vulnerable, as it has been by \nexposure to the hurricane, if we don't figure out a way to invest \nbetter and more wisely, the commerce of this whole Nation will be \nundermined, unless you want to put all the grain that comes from the \nMidwest and all the wheat and the corn on trucks and put thousands of \nmore trucks on a highway system that is already overcrowded, where \npeople are already wondering how are we going to survive the next few \nyears on a highway system like this, with trucks stacked up one after \nanother.\n  We better keep our river channels open. We better invest in our inner \nwaterways. We better start investing in more sophisticated lock and dam \nsystems along the Gulf of Mexico. If we are not going to, then the \nother alternative is to abandon the coast and move somewhere else. \nMaybe we should consider that. I think it is a foolish idea because you \ncouldn't accomplish it anyway. I don't know where we would move all the \nrefineries. We can't even get another State anywhere in the country, \nexcept maybe Arizona, to build a refinery. Nobody wants to build \nrefineries. Everybody wants to put gas in their car and turn the \nelectricity on, but we can't get anybody to lay a pipeline, build a \nrefinery, put up a petrochemical plant. I don't know how Texas and \nLouisiana and Mississippi would lift 40 percent of the industry and \nrelocate it somewhere in the United States, but if some people think \nthat is a cost-effective way, maybe we should do that.\n  Having studied this issue for a pretty long time and represented this \nState for over 25 years, it is a foolish and foolhardy suggestion. I \nhave a better one. The better one is a little bit of money every year, \nsmartly invested, to protect this infrastructure, to restore our \nwetlands, to protect one of the greatest cities in the world and the \nregion that surrounds it and the infrastructure that supports the \ncommerce and trade for the entire Nation--if we just do a little bit \nwell every year. Instead, we chose to do other things with our money.\n  This is a picture of the gulf. This is Mississippi. The title surge \nhit the gulf coast of Mississippi 30 feet high, cleared everything in \nits path for a half a mile back. We saw this kind of destruction with \nCamille. We hoped we would never see it again. But there are \nvulnerabilities living on the coast. When a hurricane hits you \ndirectly, this is what it looks like. Right here we had houses and \ncasinos. We also had a major shipyard that was damaged pretty badly. \nYou can't do a lot of shipbuilding inland. You have to have some \nwaterways and build your ships in a place where they have access to \nwater. Thank goodness we didn't have just one shipyard on the gulf \ncoast. Thank goodness we had two because the hurricane hit one and not \nthe other. Avondale is today up and running and building ships for our \nmilitary and the private sector.\n  I don't know if you can see this, but the Presiding Officer knows \nbecause she is from Alaska and they do some oil and gas drilling for \nthe Nation, we do most of it along the gulf coast. These are the \npipelines that support that industry, as we send fuel and gas and \nelectricity to Chicago, New York, California, the Midwest, and supply \nthe energy necessary to keep this economy functioning. We have laid \nthese pipelines for over 100 years. Maybe we could pick them all up and \nmove them somewhere else, but I don't think that is going to happen. We \ncan't even find the money to get a pipeline from Alaska--or figure out \nhow to get a pipeline from Alaska. How are we going to take up all \nthese pipelines and move them somewhere else? We don't have a choice.\n\n  We have to take some of our general fund dollars, more than we have. \nWe need to, as I have said for over 10 years, redirect a portion of the \noffshore oil and gas revenues that Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and \nAlabama contribute to the tune of $5 billion, actually $6 billion a \nyear last year, $155 billion since the 1950s, redirect some of that \nmoney into restoring our coast that protects this infrastructure and, \nworking in partnership with industries, large and small, have more \nsecurity around the energy infrastructure, whether it is pipelines, \npetrochemical plants, or refineries, not just for the protection of the \nindustry but for the safety of the people who live and work in this \nregion.\n  There is a beautiful series produced by Louisiana Public Television \nthat I will submit for the Record. It is not in written form but in \nvideo form. I am hoping there is some way that I can submit that \nofficially for the record. When Bienville and Niverville came and \nsettled Louisiana and claimed it as a colony, they didn't come to \nsunbathe on the Mississippi River. They didn't come to put up condos. \nThey came to secure the delta, the mouth of the greatest river in the \ncountry, for the strategic expansion and economic future of a nation. \nThey asked people to come to Louisiana in hot, mosquito-ridden \nterritory, not to sunbathe or to vacation. Who would vacation in a \nswamp with mosquitos? We leave the low-lying areas and leave the \nmosquitos when we want to vacation and go to the mountains. If you are \nlucky to be able to afford a tank of gas in your car, you don't stay in \nLouisiana to vacation. You go to Louisiana to work, even though a lot \nof people do come to New Orleans to enjoy themselves because it is a \nwonderful city. But down in the bayou, people fish, they trap, they \nhunt, they skin alligators, they drill for oil and gas, and they lay \npipelines. They build ships, they fabricate so that we can produce jobs \nfor people in America as well as ourselves.\n  For 300 years, we have been growing crops, growing sugarcane, growing \ncotton, growing soybeans, shipping goods around the world, drilling for \noil and gas, building ships and pipelines, and asking for a little bit \nof money, just a little bit, to help us invest in an infrastructure \nthat doesn't just save us from death and destruction but supports a \nnation's future. I have been on this floor so many times giving this \nspeech that I am positive that every Senator could give this speech \nbetter than I because they have heard it a thousand times. And they \nhave not just heard it from me. They heard it from Senator Breaux when \nhe was here. They heard it from Russell Long when he was here. They \nhave heard it from David Vitter since he has been here. How much more \nclear can we be? They heard it from Billy Tauzin when he was chairman \nof the Energy Committee in the House. They heard it from Charlie \nMelancon who represents this district now. They have heard it from Gene \nTaylor who has represented the gulf coast of Mississippi since he was a \nkid.\n  These are the kinds of people who live along the coast. They don't \nhave a lot. But they do have their pride and their dignity. They have \nwaited for 31 days now, but they have waited for decades actually for \nthe Federal Government to recognize they are not in condos, having \nlunch at a club, sipping tea on a balcony, watching the waves. These \npeople don't belong to a country club. They couldn't afford the monthly \ndues. They could barely afford gas in their automobile to get out when \nstorms hit. Why do they live there? No. 1, because they love it; 2, \nbecause they work; 3, because the jobs are there; and 4, you can't move \nthe jobs. Where would you put them?\n  Let me show you another picture of people. This is Charlene Veillon \nand her son Thearon. This is a sad picture to look at. This is a \npicture of them after being told that Charlene's daughter--I am \nassuming his sister--who had been driving from Tennessee to the gulf \ncoast to try to help her family, when no one else would come to help \nthem, this is when they learned that she died.\n  For a month and a half the people of the gulf coast have been crying \nfor\n\n[[Page S11176]]\n\nhelp, asking for help. I know that we didn't do everything right every \nminute of every day. But I can tell you one thing our delegation has \ndone: It has come down here year after year and laid the case. We are \nhappy to host the oil and gas industry, we are happy to build \nrefineries, we are happy to organize our ports to transport goods all \nover the world so everybody can benefit. We are even glad we don't have \nto take a lot of vacations--some of us couldn't afford to go--to those \nhighrises in Florida, anyway. But all we want is a little bit of \nsupport of money that we generate to protect us and to protect the \nNation from something such as this disaster.\n\n  I have to read news articles from some of the supposedly smartest \nmagazines in the world telling me the reason this happened is because \nthe levee board in New Orleans--I am not going to support everything \nthe levee board did, but I have to read in some supposedly elite \nmagazines the reason this happened is because the levee board took a \nfew hundred thousand dollars and built a fountain when they should not \nhave built a fountain, they should have been building a levee.\n  I don't know about the fountain, but I can promise you this: $100,000 \nor $200,000, or $300,000 for building a fountain when they should have \nput a few more sandbags on top of the levee would not have prevented \nthis disaster. What would have prevented this disaster is better \npriorities in spending, smarter investments, and a better partnership \nbetween a Federal Government that has decided it has other things to \ndo, such as building levees in Iraq, building schools in Iraq, and I \ncannot get 5 cents to build a school along the gulf coast.\n  Then I have to have magazines tell me the people in the South are not \nself-reliant; we don't know how to walk on our own two legs. I am going \nto show a picture of self-reliance. See this family. They may or may \nnot be related. They are of different colors of skin. Some people are \nrelated who have different skin color, but I don't know. This is how \npeople all over the gulf coast are living--helping each other out, \nsharing the two bedrooms they have, sharing the food they have, not \ncomplaining. But it is my job to complain. I represent them.\n  Before I keep talking about Louisiana, because people say the Senator \nonly cares about her State, let me tell you what the last page of this \nmagazine says, the National Geographic. It is the last page. Pick it up \nand read it.\n\n       The next Katrina? New Orleans was a hurricane tragedy \n     waiting to happen.\n\n  It describes why this was inevitable. We knew it during Betsy. We \nknew it again at 9/11. We have known it for a long time. We didn't do \nwhat we needed to do. But according to NOAA--which is a very excellent \norganization, I must say, out of the Commerce Department for which I \nhave a lot of respect--according to meteorologist Joe Golden, ``the \nfive places in the U.S. at greatest risk for calamitous hurricanes are: \nTampa Bay, Florida; Mobile, Alabama; Houston, Texas; New York City and \nLong Island, New York; and Miami, Florida.''\n  Wake up, delegations from these States. Many of these Senators have \nbeen helping. Many of these Senators understand the danger.\n  Why do we have to go through this again? Why do we have to go through \nit this time? You can't stop hurricanes, but you can protect yourself. \nYou can set up a communications system so families who are trying to \nhelp each other will have their cell phones work. You can help your \npolice officers by giving them radios that function. You can figure out \nhow to have more redundancy so if your electricity goes down, somebody \ncan get a message through.\n  The head of our National Guard from Alabama, during a CNN interview \nwith me on this subject, said the Senator is right; we are sending \nrunners in Alabama, as we did in the War of 1812, and it is 2005 and we \ndo not have a communications system that protects Americans.\n  I know times are tough in Baghdad. Times are tough on the gulf coast.\n  This is a picture of a man named Pete. He is holding a 1950s picture \nof his grandparents' home in Empire, LA. I think Senator Cochran from \nMississippi has fished off Empire. He knows it well. He fishes a great \ndeal and respects the environment.\n  When Pete's grandparents moved here in the 1950s, this camp--which \nwas in a vulnerable place even before the marsh eroded. It was \nvulnerable. I don't know if this was his grandparents' home where they \nlived or if they were shrimpers, trappers, or campers, or if this is a \ncamp, as we call them, where you go on the weekend to try to relax and \nget out of the city. Anyway, what you can see beyond this camp is a lot \nof marsh. They didn't go out in the middle of the water and build this \ncamp and come miles by boat to camp, although some do that, but very \nfew. Most of these camps were attached to land, or they were in the \n1950s. But 50 years later, there is no land around them because the \nsaltwater has intruded because we channeled the Mississippi River, and \nthe delta cannot replenish itself.\n  We laid 9,000 miles of pipeline, took all the oil and gas out of the \nground, and did not give anything back to keep the land stable so that \nPete could maybe have a place to take his grandchildren. Of course, the \nplace is gone.\n\n  On page 57 of the National Geographic, there is a great article that \nbegins ``How the Defenses Break Down.'' It talks about barrier islands. \nWe have barrier islands all around the coast. We are losing them \nrapidly off the coast of South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida, \nGeorgia, Alabama, and Dolphin Island because we don't take care of our \nbarrier islands, we don't protect our barrier islands, we don't invest \nin coastal erosion projects. We let them wash away into the ocean. Then \nwe wonder why, when hurricanes come, they destroy a whole region. Every \ntime a storm comes, we throw a little sandbag on the islands and say we \ndid something. We are not doing anything.\n  We used to have hundreds of miles of marshland between New Orleans \nand the ocean. Please don't insult the ancestors of my city to think \nthat they would put a major metropolitan area right on the coast. If \nanybody would get the map of the Mississippi River, they had to go up \nover 100 miles from the mouth of the river, and they found the highest \nground they could find, and they put the city of New Orleans there.\n  Amazingly, even in Katrina, Jackson Square did not flood. The \ncathedral is still there, and the statue of Jesus is still standing in \nfront.\n  They did not put the city on low ground. Three hundred years ago, \nthey went inland away from the coast to build a city to secure the \nwestward expansion of the Nation. Thomas Jefferson had the sense to \nborrow money from the Treasury, not to spend it on tax cuts, but to \ninvest it in the Louisiana Purchase at 3 cents an acre. Then Andrew \nJackson went there in 1803 and fought the British again. Not once; we \nfought them twice because they knew when we beat them in 1776, they \ncould come back and take New Orleans and take the country away, and we \nfought them again.\n  But we have a Federal Government for the last couple of years--I have \nmade some mistakes since I have been here, so I am not the only one; I \nam not saying I have not made mistakes. But we have a Federal \nGovernment whose only answer to any problem we have had, whether it is \na recession, depression, or irrational exuberance, a high stock market, \na low stock market, a war or no war, is to give tax cuts.\n  Let me ask something: Could anybody describe to me how this woman \ncould take advantage of any tax cut? What would she do? Do you think \nshe has any money in her IRA she could borrow to help her rebuild her \nhouse? Do you think maybe she could call her accountant and see if he \ncould figure out a strategy for her to save a few dollars on the next \nincome tax check she pays? I don't think so.\n  This woman--I don't know her name, but she looks a lot like my \ngrandmother before she died. There are grandmothers and grandfathers \nall over the gulf coast sitting in chairs just like one looking at \ntotal destruction, and they have to hear from this Congress that we are \nabout ready to pass yet another tranche of tax cuts, but we cannot send \nsomebody to help her pick up the debris.\n  And please don't tell me you are sending faith-based organizations. \nAnd I say that with the greatest respect. You know why? Because the \nchurch that used to be here does not exist any longer. I am certain \nsome church could\n\n[[Page S11177]]\n\ncome from New Jersey or come from New York or come from California, but \nthis woman's church does not stand any longer.\n  In my State--this may be Mississippi, I don't know--but in the State \nof Louisiana, the Catholic Church, which is the largest church in New \nOrleans, is basically telling me and our delegation and any leaders who \nwill listen that they may have to lay off thousands of workers at the \narchdiocese because their churches are destroyed and their schools are \ndestroyed. But yet we have a Government that wants to say: Let the \nfaith-based organizations do it. They are faith-based organizations. \nThey are the Catholic Church. They need help.\n  We have a bill we have been asking for--and the President has asked \nfor it as well--and we cannot get this Congress to move to give some \nhelp to some of the children who were in Catholic schools so they can \nget through this school year--70,000 of them. We cannot move that bill.\n  That is why I am on the floor today to talk about a lot of issues. As \nSenators come, they may want to talk about the Defense bill, but our \nwar is right here at home. Our war is right here in the gulf coast. \nThis debate is about the protection we seek, our security, our way of \nlife. Millions of people from the gulf coast have given their lives for \nthis country in war after war, in crisis after crisis, and now we ask \nfor help and we get $63 billion to FEMA, which cannot seem to function \nwell enough to get anybody help. So I have come to the floor to say: \nOK, let's catch a breath. FEMA is not working that well. Let's not \nworry about why now, let's try to fix the problem and take $10 billion \nof the $43 billion FEMA has that is sitting there, not getting to any \nof the people I showed, take it, and give it through whatever \naccountability mechanisms we can come up with, to give people health \ncare they desperately need, to give relief to our schools that are \nabout to stagger and collapse--elementary, secondary, and our \nuniversities that are also our major employers, that also have the \nbrain power that is going to help us rebuild this region; they are \nabout ready to close their doors--to give direct aid to our sheriffs, \nour police, and our firefighters who are desperately trying to keep the \ndoors open on the cities and counties and communities, large and small, \nthroughout the gulf coast. Give us a few of those billion dollars we \nhave given to FEMA, which cannot function, and let us use that money. \nAnd if FEMA needs more money down the line, we can always give them \nsome more.\n  But we cannot do that. All we can do is pass a Defense bill, argue \nabout Defense authorization, take care of the war in Iraq, rebuild \nIraq, but we cannot even focus on rebuilding the gulf coast where \nAmericans have paid taxes their whole life and cannot get the Federal \nGovernment to act effectively.\n  I compliment the Senator from Alaska for moving our Defense \nappropriations bill. It is an extremely important bill for our Nation, \nand he has been very gracious to allow me this time. I am looking to \nsee if another Senator shows up. I will be happy to end my remarks and \ntake some time later today. We are on the Defense bill, and we have to \nmove this bill and, of course, under the rules we only have 30 more \nhours of debate and we have to vote on that bill.\n  The bottom line, I guess, is this: We have been in negotiations with \nthe White House and with the Republican leadership to pass something \nbefore we leave, something that is substantive but also in some ways \nsymbolic, that somebody in Washington is hearing what people from the \ngulf coast are saying, which is, We know FEMA was funded, but we need \nhelp now.\n  FEMA is not well led, even though we have a new leader and he is \ndoing a better job than the former one. It is not well resourced. It is \nnot well organized, and it is not being that well coordinated at home. \nWe can fix that, I am confident, over time. I am certain we have \nlearned some of the mistakes that we have made with FEMA, and we can \nfix it; FEMA can be fixed, and we will have some time to do that. But \nright now, we need to get help to the people of Louisiana and the gulf \ncoast.\n  We have asked for $1.5 billion for our State and local governments so \nthat they can keep their doors open, not lay off their core workforce, \neither their police, their fire, their permitting offices, the support \nthat a city or county needs to function, so that over the next few \nmonths and few years, we can actually rebuild our towns.\n  Last night, from what I understand, the White House offered $300 \nmillion, but $300 million is not enough to help the towns that are \nabout to have to close their doors, including the city of New Orleans, \nwhich is struggling to stay open and to track people back to the third \nor fourth of the city that can function that is out of water.\n  The mayor announced yesterday that he has to lay off 3,000 people. We \ndo not need to be laying off people. We need to be hiring people. There \nis enough work to be done. Just imagine 90,000 square miles of \ndestruction. Does anybody doubt that there is not a lot of work that \ncould be done? We do not need to be laying off public employees and \nlaying off people in the private sector. We need to be stabilizing \nthose who are working now and then be smart, strategic, wise, careful, \nand accountable as we hire help to stand up a region that is not just \nfor the people who live there but for the whole Nation. Does anyone \ndoubt that there is enough work to be done?\n  Let me show a picture of New Orleans. This is what parts of it looked \nlike only a few weeks ago. It goes on for miles and miles, water \nstanding 6 feet, 8 feet, 10 feet, interstates underwater. Does anybody \ndoubt that there is a lot of work to be done? Why are we laying off \npeople anywhere? I will say why--because sales taxes cannot be \ncollected from empty buildings. Sales taxes cannot be collected from \npeople who no longer live in their house and there is not a WalMart or \na mom-and-pop store to shop within miles. How does a city with a $40 \nmillion monthly payroll exist for more than a month or two?\n  If somebody says, Well, they can borrow the money, let me talk about \nthat for a minute because I was a State treasurer. I know a little bit \nabout this issue. The constitution of the State of Louisiana smartly \ndoes not allow the State to borrow for operating expenses. Isn't that \nunique. We can only borrow money to build highways and invest in \ncapital infrastructure. It is a very smart and wise restriction because \nif there are not restrictions like that, we end up being like the U.S. \nGovernment, which borrows to give tax cuts to people who did not even \nask for them.\n\n  I am sorry we cannot organize a constitutional referendum in the next \n30 days. Even if we could organize a constitutional referendum in the \nnext 30 days, there are no polling places for people to vote, and if we \ntried to find our voters, we could not find them. So I am a little \nconfused about how we would do that.\n  The State of Mississippi does not have that same restriction. I \nunderstand they have borrowed $500 million. So this woman right here, \nwho I am pretty sure is from Mississippi--and I am not criticizing \nMississippi. They have their own plans, and maybe they are great. But \nthis woman will have to pay that $500 million back. I do not believe \nthat is a great idea. I do not think she has enough money to put food \non her table the next couple of months. If that is what they want to \ndo, I do not know how they are going to pay this $500 million back, but \nI promise they are either going to cut programs this woman benefits \nfrom or she is going to get charged directly for it. That might be a \ngood plan. I would not support something like that.\n  My State cannot borrow the money, and even if we could, we have a \nbillion-dollar shortfall at the Federal level because the income is not \ncoming in. The oil wells are not producing, so we do not get our \nseverance taxes. The ports are crippled, so we are not getting that \nrevenue. The sales taxes are way down, and the expenses are way up.\n  I have listened to the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the \nWall Street Journal tell me the people of Louisiana are not self-\nreliant. Why can't we just fix our own problem? First, it is not our \nproblem, it is the Nation's problem. The last time I looked, we were \nthe United States of America. I am not sure we are anymore, but that is \nwhat we were the last time I said the Pledge of Allegiance.\n  Either people want me to keep talking or they do not have anything to \nsay because nobody else is on the floor, so I will talk for a few more \nminutes and then I am going to sit down and just\n\n[[Page S11178]]\n\nhold my time. I will talk more about the general subject, but I wish to \nbe clear about why I am standing here and what we have asked for. We \nhave asked for some help, just anything that we can take home before we \nleave so that people will have some hope that somebody up here is \nlistening to them.\n  I have asked to pull up the Grassley-Baucus bill, which has been \nunanimously approved by Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, not a \nDemocratic bill--thank God led by a great Senator, a Republican from \nIowa who is the chairman of the Finance Committee. He understands, even \nthough he is not from Louisiana, how much people are suffering, and he \nwants to help. So he and Senator Baucus, leaders that they are, 3 weeks \nago, with the help of Senator Lincoln from Arkansas, put a good bill \ntogether. It cost about $13 billion. If there were some things \neliminated, we could scale it back to about $6 billion or $7 billion. \nWhen I say eliminated, there is some help for all the States. Maybe we \njust eliminate helping everyone else and help ourselves. We are trying \nto be generous. If other Senators want to try to help their States, who \nam I to say they cannot help their States. But if the Senate agrees to \njust help Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas, fine with me. \nThey put a bill together, we passed it unanimously, and we cannot get \nany action on that bill. So we have asked for that.\n  We have asked for some education money to keep our schools open. We \nare trying not to ask too much because every time we ask for something, \nwe are told we are greedy, we are looters, we are not self-reliant, how \ndare we ask on behalf of the people who have nothing for a little money \nout of the treasury, from their own money that they put in the \ntreasury, how dare we ask for it. I am not going to stop asking, and I \ndo not care how many editorials are written about me and my State at \nthis point. Just go ahead and keep writing them.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Louisiana yield for a question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. At the outset, I would like to say that I left the floor \nlast night, about 12 hours ago, around 11. Senator Landrieu of \nLouisiana was on the floor last night. As I left, I said that she has \nshown such a passion and commitment to the poor people of her State of \nLouisiana who have been through this hurricane. I know she has tried to \nwork within the system, she has tried to work within the Senate, and \nshe has tried to move things along in a peaceful, bipartisan way. I \nsensed in her appearance last night and her appearance on the floor now \nthat she is reaching a level of frustration and concern that this \nSenate is going to go home tonight or tomorrow and be gone for 10 days \nhaving done nothing to address the important issues she is raising.\n\n  What the Senator has brought to our attention is the fact that we \nhave a bipartisan proposal. Senator Grassley, a Republican of Iowa, and \nSenator Baucus, a Democrat of Montana, on the Finance Committee, have \ncome up with a proposal to provide basic health care for the evacuees \nand survivors of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, basic health \ncare. The Senator has come to the Chamber repeatedly--I have seen it--\ntrying to at least bring this to a vote. That is all she is asking for, \nbring it to a vote.\n  It is my understanding that at this moment in time, she has no \ncommitment from the Republican leadership in the Senate to even bring \nthis matter for a vote before we go home for 10 days on a break. I ask \nthe Senator from Louisiana if she could in the most general terms tell \nus what kind of health care she is trying to provide to these people. \nSome have characterized it as luxurious, over-the-top health care for \npeople who do not really need it. In fact, I heard on the floor last \nnight one of the Senators say: Well, they do not really need this.\n  Could the Senator from Louisiana spell out for us what she is looking \nto achieve, what this bipartisan proposal would mean to the poor people \nwho have lost their homes, lost their worldly possessions, seen their \nfamilies torn apart, and are living in shelters somewhere around that \npart of our country?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would be happy to, and I thank the Senator for his \nleadership because the Grassley-Baucus bill does a couple of important \nthings that are essential for the rebuilding and emergency needs of a \npopulation--not just the poor but the middle income and those who had \nprivate insurance the day before Katrina hit. The Baucus-Grassley bill \nallows the States to know that they are going to be reimbursed for the \ncare they are providing to people who have virtually no insurance. For \na State such as Louisiana, whose legislature may be meeting in the next \nfew weeks, with a billion-dollar shortfall looming, I say to Senator \nDurbin, it is critical that the States of Louisiana and Mississippi and \nAlabama and Texas have some idea now about what the Federal Government \nis going to do regarding their insurance. We share it 70/30. The State \ncannot put up a 30-percent match. This bill waives that match so that \nour States can start making good budget decisions at a very difficult \ntime, in addition to providing health care for those who are 200 \npercent or below of poverty--which in our State is only $18,000 or \n$20,000--to make sure that people have health insurance.\n\n  But for middle-income families, working families, and even wealthy \nfamilies that had health insurance, this bill allows them--even if \ntheir employers have gone under or taken bankruptcy or closed their \ndoors and laid them off--to keep their health insurance for a few \nmonths, for 6 months or 12 months, depending on their category.\n  A Senator said on the floor, Senator Durbin, that people can get \nhealth insurance, they can get health care. Yes, in some way; they can \ngo to an emergency room and wait for 3 days. But if they want to go to \ntheir doctor's office to whom they have been going for their whole \nlife, and take their child to their pediatrician and they now don't \nhave health insurance, unless we pass this bill, they can't go knock on \nthe door of their pediatrician, for example, unless they give them a \ncredit card or cash because there is no health insurance without the \nBaucus-Grassley bill. People who don't have a home, don't have a church \nor don't have a school now do not even have health care because we have \nto go home on a 10-day break and leave them wondering where they are \ngoing to get their medicine. That is what the bill does, I say to \nSenator Durbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Louisiana, through \nthe Chair, we have been through disasters before in America. We faced \n9/11, that terrible day in our history when 3,000 Americans lost their \nlives. I would like to ask the Senator from Louisiana, if I am not \nmistaken, didn't we say we were going to come in and help those \nfamilies who may have been in the same circumstance, where their place \nof employment just exploded and disappeared? Also, I would ask the \nSenator from Louisiana, when we had an earthquake in California, in \nNorthridge, didn't we step in and say we are going to provide housing \nvouchers to people displaced because of earthquakes?\n  I ask this of the Senator because I don't quite understand this \ndouble standard. Why, if the worst natural disaster in modern memory \noccurred a few weeks ago, are we in the midst of debating the most \nbasic things people need in crisis: health care, housing, cash so they \ncan buy the basic necessities of life? Why are we facing this double \nstandard, when America's heart was broken by the scenes we saw day \nafter day and night after night on the television screen, coming from \nyour hometown, your neighbors and their suffering?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I do not know, I say to Senator Durbin. That is a \npuzzlement for us. I do not have a good answer for that. All I can say \nis there are 2 million people displaced, many towns are destroyed, many \ncommunities, both urban and suburban, rural as well as highly dense. \nNeighborhoods of black and white, Hispanic and Asian, poor and middle-\nincome are wondering the same thing.\n  Why does Congress keep giving money to FEMA? FEMA is not functioning \nvery well. So when our Governors and our mayors and our sheriffs ask \nfor a little bit of help with health insurance and education and the \nbasics to turn running water on--we have had enough bottled water. \nPlease don't send us any more bottled water. We have plenty.\n  We need to turn the faucets on so water will come out so a small \nbusiness\n\n[[Page S11179]]\n\nthat wants to operate can actually function with some water. You cannot \nhave a business operating without water. That is what we need.\n  We have asked for these emergency things, to be told we do not have \nthe money. I am going to sit down. In this amendment, we are asking for \nfour or five things, for education, for health care, for immediate \nneeds, for help for some hospitals that stayed up. Three hospitals \nstayed up the whole time in the region. If we do not help them, these \nhospitals will close, employees will be laid off, and whatever modest \nhealth care system we have for the region will basically be \ndysfunctional.\n  But what we really want--we want those things, but what we want is \nsome action taken before we leave. We can vote on these individually. \nWe did get a commitment from the administration that they will do more \nthan $300 million. Because if we do not get more than $300 million \nbefore we leave here, the city of New Orleans, the Archdiocesan--the \nCatholic Diocese--or St. Tammany Parish, or some parts of it, or \nPlaquemines or St. Bernard or any number of other places, I say to \nSenator Durbin, will have to lay off workers who then will lose their \nhealth insurance, lose whatever means they have of keeping themselves \nand their families intact, and the situation will be spiraling \ndownward, not spiraling upward.\n  The Senator has been very gracious. I am going to reserve the \nremainder of whatever time I have, but that is what we are asking for, \nand I hope we can get something done before we leave for this week-and-\na-half break.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, we now have the preliminary scanning of \nthe amendments that have been passed by the Parliamentarian. We would \nbe pleased to share that information with any Senator who has an \namendment. The Senator from Louisiana does have the floor until someone \nis ready to offer an amendment or speak on the bill. We urge Members to \ncome and start the process. We are prepared to handle amendments. On \nsome amendments we will make a point of order as to germaneness, but we \nare trying to be as broad as possible in consideration of Members' \namendments so we can finish late today, if possible.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to yield to \nSenator Landrieu at a later moment when she comes to the floor, 30 \nminutes or more of the hour--30 minutes, I will yield to Senator \nLandrieu, postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n  Transportation, Treasury, HUD, and General Government Appropriations\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to urge the Senate \nleadership to call up H.R. 3058, the Transportation, Treasury, HUD, and \nGeneral Government appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006, once the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill is done.\n  We all want to make our country strong again. We all want to make our \ncommunities strong again. One way to do that is to invest in our \ntransportation infrastructure, in public housing, and in the other \npriorities that are part of that important bill.\n  Every day we go without a Transportation-Treasury bill is a day that \nwe fall short of making the investments we need to make to strengthen \nthis country. We are not talking about our physical infrastructure, we \nare talking about our own safety. As I will show in a moment, the \nfailure of the Senate to bring up the Transportation-Treasury bill \ncould actually be threatening the safety of every American who flies on \na commercial air carrier.\n  A floor debate on the Transportation-Treasury bill is long overdue. \nThe House of Representatives passed this bill more than 3 months ago. \nThe Senate Appropriations Committee reported this bill almost 2\\1/2\\ \nmonths ago. Today we are almost a full week into fiscal year 2006, and \nstill the Senate has been denied an opportunity to consider and debate \nand pass this important bill. The Senate needs to debate and pass this \nbill so we can avoid the unruly and unfair process of funding the \nGovernment through another Omnibus appropriations bill. The Senate \nneeds to debate and pass this bill so all of the Senators, not just \nthose on the Appropriations Committee, can have an opportunity to \nconsider and, if necessary, amend that bill. The Senate needs to debate \nand pass this bill so we can urgently address the critical needs of our \ntransportation and public housing sectors, including the pressing need \nto protect the safety of all of our citizens.\n  Mr. President, 2002 was the most recent year in which the \nTransportation appropriations bill was sent to the President as a \nfreestanding measure. I was chair of the subcommittee at that time. \nEver since then, the funding for the agencies under the subcommittee's \njurisdiction has been enacted as part of a series of unwieldy Omnibus \nappropriations bills. The process by which these bills were put \ntogether did not reflect well on the Senate. It did not reflect well on \nthe Congress as a whole.\n  Last year's process was the worst of all. Last year, the \nTransportation, Treasury, and General Government appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 2005 was never even debated in the Senate. Once the \nappropriations bill was reported by the Appropriations committee, the \nbill languished for months before Congress went home for an election. \nThen, just before Thanksgiving, Congress reconvened and tried, in 3 \ndays, to assemble a final conference report for dozens of major Federal \nagencies, even though the Senate had never even passed many of the \nappropriations bills that funded those agencies.\n  I think Members of all political stripes in both the House and in the \nSenate recognized how poorly the public and the Congress were served by \nthat process. In January, everyone said we will not do that again. We \nheard it from the leadership of both the House and the Senate and from \nthe new leadership of the House and the Senate appropriations \ncommittees. I am glad they said it back in January. But from where I \nsit as the ranking member of the Transportation-Treasury Subcommittee, \nit sure looks to me as though we are now heading toward another Omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n\n  The bottom line is this. The Transportation-Treasury bill has been \nsitting on this calendar, ready to be called up, for almost 2\\1/2\\ \nmonths. If we want to avoid another Omnibus appropriations bill, we \nneed to call up and pass that bill as soon as we are done with this \nDefense bill.\n  This process of sending bills approved by the Appropriations \nCommittee directly to conference without appropriate debate on the \nSenate floor is not just grossly unfair to Democratic Senators, it is \ngrossly unfair to all of the 72 Senators who do not sit on the \nAppropriations Committee. The appropriations bill that Senator Bond and \nI are recommending to the Senate was approved unanimously by the \nAppropriations Committee back in mid-July. It proposes to spend over \n$137 billion.\n  These are not just tax dollars that were collected in Missouri or \ncollected in Washington or collected in States represented by members \nof the Appropriations Committee, these are tax dollars that were \ncollected from all Americans. Since that is true, every Senator should \nhave the opportunity to debate this bill and pass judgment on our \nrecommendations. Every Senator should be given an opportunity to amend \nthat bill.\n  We need to avoid another Omnibus to ensure a fair process. There are \nalso some very practical programmatic reasons why we must call up and, \nimportantly, pass this Transportation-Treasury bill as soon as \npossible. Now the Government is functioning under a continuing \nresolution. Under the requirements of that resolution, programs that \nare funded in the Transportation-Treasury bill are all operating at \neither the lower of the funding levels passed by the House of \nRepresentatives back in June or at the level the program was funded in \nfiscal year 2005. Some observers have speculated we could be operating \nunder this continuing resolution until Christmas.\n  It would take hours for me to list all the programs and national \nneeds that will suffer if they are required to operate for any length \nof time under the funding restrictions of this continuing resolution. \nIf we do not get agreement soon to debate the Transportation-Treasury \nbill, I may well take up a lot of the Senate floor time to explain each \nand every one of them.\n  But today I want to focus on one topic and that is the topic of \naviation\n\n[[Page S11180]]\n\nsafety and what our failure to move this Transportation-Treasury \nappropriations bill means for millions of Americans who travel by air \nin this country today. Over the last few years, our national aviation \nenterprise--our airlines, our airports, and the FAA--have been under an \nunprecedented amount of financial pressure. We now have no fewer than \nsix airlines in bankruptcy. If jet fuel prices do not start declining \nsoon, that number could grow even higher.\n  In the interests of cutting costs, airlines on which you and I travel \nhave been cutting back on staff, have been renouncing their pension \nplans, and have been outsourcing an increasing percentage of their \naircraft maintenance.\n  I know many other Senators, including myself, travel home almost \nevery weekend, and we have all noticed the changes in the service the \nairlines offer. Staffing is leaner than ever and we have a lot of \nflight delays. Mechanical problems are on the rise. One important area \nof cost cutting has been the airlines' continuing efforts to contract \nout their aircraft maintenance activities to third parties, including, \nyou all should know, overseas vendors known as foreign repair stations.\n  In the past, airlines maintained their planes with experienced \nveteran unionized mechanics. Today, they outsource more than 50 \npercent, more than half of their maintenance work, to independent \noperators. Airlines such as Northwest send some of their aircraft as \nfar as Singapore and Hong Kong for heavy maintenance.\n  We have one major carrier, Jet Blue, that sends a large portion of \ntheir Airbus fleet to be maintained in El Salvador, Central America. \nThat is where their planes are maintained.\n  America West Airlines, now merged with U.S. Airways, does the same \nthing.\n  Many of us watched in fear a few weeks ago when a Jet Blue A-320 was \nrequired to make an emergency landing at the Los Angeles International \nAirport. As we all watched on television, we saw its front landing gear \nfacing sideways, at 90 degrees. That was not the first time the landing \ngear didn't engage correctly. In fact, it was not the 5th time, it was \nnot even the 10th time, it was the 14th time that the FAA learned of \nthe front landing gear of an A-320 aircraft not engaging correctly.\n  According to the FAA, these 14 dangerous and frightening mishaps have \noccurred as a result of 5 separate and distinct causes.\n  It is the job of the FAA inspectors to find out why these problems \nhappen and to force the plane's manufacturer to fix that problem. We \ncannot afford to have an understaffed or an overwhelmed FAA safety \noffice.\n  Our airlines are going through a period of dramatic and rapid change. \nThat puts an extraordinary amount of stress on the aircraft inspection \nfunction of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  We have received a disturbing series of reports from the DOT \nInspector General, from the Government Accounting Office, and the \nNational Transportation Safety Board citing deficiencies with the FAA's \ninspection effort.\n  In 2004, the NTSB found that deficient maintenance by an outside \ncontractor and inadequate oversight by the airline and the FAA \ncontributed to the 2003 crash of a commuter flight to Charlotte, NC. \nThat crash killed 21 people.\n  The DOT Inspector General first identified serious deficiencies with \nthe FAA's inspection efforts back in 2002. Just this past June, the IG \nreported that many of those deficiencies have still not been adequately \naddressed.\n  The IG found that the FAA focused too much attention on the airline's \ndwindling in-house maintenance function and not enough attention on the \noutsourced maintenance activities of their foreign contractors.\n  The IG found that the FAA inspectors were spending too much time \ninspecting maintenance facilities during the day, while a majority of \nthe maintenance activities are actually conducted at night.\n  The IG found the FAA was doing an insufficient job of its \nsurveillance of financially distressed or rapidly growing airlines. And \nthe IG found the FAA was not able to meet its own standards for \nfrequent inspections because it was short staffed.\n  In just the last few weeks, the FAA staffing shortage has become even \nmore critical. As these airlines enter bankruptcy, the FAA is \nautomatically required to step up its inspections of bankrupt carriers.\n  Today, the FAA must give heightened scrutiny to the six bankrupt \ncarriers, as well as four other carriers that are in merger \nproceedings.\n  Following the liquidation of Eastern Airlines several years ago, a \nnumber of dramatic and horrifying revelations came out regarding the \nmaintenance shortcuts that Eastern took in the interest of conserving \ncash in its waning days. The entire aviation community vowed that there \nwould not ever be a repeat of the Eastern Airlines experience.\n  I would think with the external recommendations and the record that I \nhave just cited, the FAA would now be rapidly hiring more inspectors to \nkeep up with its growing and challenging workload. Unfortunately, over \nthe course of the last year, the exact opposite has been the case.\n  Despite the fact that the Congress granted the FAA's inspections \noffice every penny that was sought in the President's budget for fiscal \nyear 2005, the office has been required to downsize by roughly 300 \ninspectors over the course of just this last year. That is right. As \nthe requirements on our FAA inspectors to maintain safety in our skies \nhas increased dramatically, the FAA has been downsizing its inspection \nforce each and every month.\n  This unacceptable situation is one that Senator Bond and I pursued as \npart of our hearings with Secretary Mineta this year--and the House \nAppropriations Committee did the same. I am proud to say that on a \nbipartisan and bicameral basis, both the Transportation-Treasury bill \npassed by the House and the bill that has been reported by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee seeks to rectify the situation.\n  The House Appropriations Committee provided this office with an \nincrease of $4 million over the President's budget request and \ncommitted those funds to the hiring of additional inspectors.\n  The Senate provided an increase of $8 million over the President's \nrequest, and we directed that funding be used to restore safety \ninspector staffing reductions that occurred during fiscal year 2005.\n  Personally, I still question whether we should be doing more in this \narea since we have now had two more airlines in bankruptcy since we \nmarked up that appropriations bill.\n  But still, these actions on the part of the House and Senate \ncommittees indicate that Congress, on a bipartisan and a bicameral \nbasis, is prepared to address this glaring safety vulnerability, even \nif the administration is not.\n  With that said, we can't make any progress in tackling this problem \nif we do not call up and pass the Transportation-Treasury \nappropriations bill.\n  Under the current continuing resolution, the agency can make no \nprogress in restoring the necessary FAA inspectors to a level that \ncould better protect us.\n  As I said, this was just one of several reasons it is imperative for \nthe Senate leadership to call up the Transportation-Treasury bill.\n  I again implore the Senate Republican leadership to call up the \nTransportation-Treasury bill immediately upon the completion of this \nDefense appropriations bill.\n  We have to have the opportunity to debate this bill, not just for the \nfairness of our colleagues and to maintain the integrity of the Senate, \nbut we must debate this bill and pass it so we can ensure the safety of \nour citizens.\n\n\n                          VAWA Reauthorization\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak about tbe Violence Against Women \nAct, which the Senate this week passed by unanimous consent.\n  For the last few months, we have been talking about reauthorizing the \nViolence Against Women Act, or VAWA, as it is better known.\n  Back in 1994, through this historic legislation, we created a \nnational strategy for dealing with domestic violence, establishing a \ncommunity-wide response. Since we took that historical step, VAWA has \nbeen a great success in coordinating victims' advocates, social service \nproviders, and law enforcement\n\n[[Page S11181]]\n\nprofessionals to meet the immediate challenges of combating domestic \nviolence. We can clearly see that VAWA has been tremendously effective.\n  But there is still work to be done to protect victims of domestic \nviolence--particularly when it comes to helping victims break the cycle \nof violence. And that is what I am here to talk about today--breaking \nthe cycle of violence.\n  Financial insecurity is a major factor in ongoing domestic violence.\n  Too often, victims who are not economically self sufficient are \nforced to choose between protecting themselves and their children on \none hand, and keeping a roof over their head on the other hand. It is \ncritical that we help guarantee the economic security of victims of \ndomestic or sexual violence who cannot pay the rent without their \nabusive partner, or who have been forced to leave their job because of \nabuse. Without our help, economic dependency will continue to force \nthese victims to stay in abusive relationships.\n  The purpose of the Violence Against Women Act is to reduce domestic \nviolence. The reauthorization legislation addresses several new issues \nthat will help prevent and reduce domestic violence. One such--way as I \nalready mentioned--is a national health care strategy. But the \nlegislation as introduced contained another important tool to helping \nreduce domestic violence--it contained provisions that would have \nallowed victims to take up to 10 days of unpaid leave per year to \naddress domestic violence.\n  Over 40 percent of American workers get no paid time off. They can't \nuse vacation time to address their abuse, and missing work puts them in \ndanger of losing their job.\n  This provision would have allowed these victims, and many others, to \ntake unpaid leave to get a protective order, see a doctor, or make a \nsafety plan to address their abuse. But sadly, amidst opposition and \ncomplaints of jurisdictional issues, these provisions were stripped \nfrom the bill during consideration in the Judiciary Committee.\n  The legislation that was reported out of committee--which the Senate \njust passed by unanimous consent--does not contain any economic \nprotections for victims.\n  I did not give up on these protections easily. After the leave \nprovisions were dropped, I asked the managers of this bill to include \nanother economic security provision, unemployment insurance. \nSpecifically, I asked them to provide victims of domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault, or stalking with unemployment \ninsurance if they have to leave their job or are fired because of \nabuse.\n  We know that a job is often the only way for victims to build up \nresources for themselves to eventually leave a violent relationship, \nbut abuse and stalking can make it impossible for a victim to keep a \njob.\n  We know of cases where abusers will deliberately sabotage a victim's \nability to work, placing harassing phone calls, cutting off their \ntransportation, showing up at the workplace and threatening employees.\n  When a victim loses a job because of violence, that victim should \nhave access to unemployment insurance compensation benefits.\n  Are you aware that a woman is eligible for unemployment benefits if \nshe has to leave her job because her husband had to relocate? But in \nmany States, if a woman has to leave her job because she is fleeing a \ndangerous situation, she cannot receive the same benefits. That is \nunacceptable.\n  Currently, 28 States plus the District of Columbia already provide \nsome type of unemployment insurance assistance for victims of domestic \nviolence. We can offer that same protection to victims in every State, \nand we have an obligation to do it. But, since this provision is not \nincluded in VAWA either, we need to do it here and now.\n  It is important to recognize that this violence goes far beyond the \nhome, too often following victims into the workplace, where it doesn't \njust hurt victims--it hurts their employers, too.\n  In fact, from decreased workplace productivity to increased health \ninsurance cost, the data shows that domestic violence is bad for \nbusiness. It has real and painful costs on employers. So for those \nMembers who want to weigh this measure against its economic merits, the \nfacts are clear.\n  Providing the tools that will allow abused women to escape abusive \nrelationships can help offset billions of dollars in costs that \ndomestic violence imposes on businesses.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have been working on the issue of \neconomic security for victims for many years. I have spoken with \nvictims and their advocates, and employers. In fact, just this past \nTuesday in my State of Washington, I held a roundtable discussion to \nmeet with stakeholders. I heard from an employer--and owner of a small \nbusiness in Snohomish County--who talked about the importance of \nflexible schedules and leave policies that allow employees to address \ntheir abuse. He said that helping them address their situations helps \nhis bottom line.\n  I also heard from someone who works at the employment security \ndepartment, who said that the numbers do not suggest that women are \nabusing unemployment insurance. And I heard from a survivor, who shared \nher story and talked about the crucial importance of these economic \nprotections.\n  These are the voices we must hear. And these are the stories we must \nlearn from and let guide our work here in the Senate.\n  I am going to keep coming to the Senate as many times as it takes, \nand I will tell these stories until my colleagues realize this is an \nissue that needs to be addressed. We need to provide these victims with \nthe economic tools to help escape their dangerous situation.\n  For a long time, violence against women was considered a private \nmatter. That attitude hurt women. Today, stopping domestic violence is \neveryone's business. That is in large part due to the Violence Against \nWomen Act which I was very proud to work on and help pass. For the \nfirst time, the Violence Against Women Act recognized domestic violence \nas a violent crime and a national public health crisis.\n  Economic protections are the next logical step in the progress we \nhave been making in fighting domestic violence. Unfortunately, many of \nmy colleagues have not realized the critical importance of providing \nthese economic protections. I brought this issue up last year when the \nSenate was considering the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. I tried to \namend that bill with my Security and Financial Empowerment, SAFE, Act, \nwhich contains all the economic protections I have talked about today. \nI was told then it wasn't the right time to address preventing violence \nagainst women. My amendment was defeated on a party-line vote. I am \nhere again talking about how the Senate is failing to address this \nissue and failing to help prevent domestic violence by overlooking \nthese economic provisions.\n  I reiterate to my colleagues that I will continue to come to the \nSenate and talk about how critical this issue is in helping victims get \nout of abusive relationships. I will continue to introduce legislation \nand offer amendments providing economic protections to victims. I will \ncontinue to ask whether the Senators in this Chamber are serious about \ntalking about the next crucial step to help victims of abuse. I urge \nthe conferees on the Violence Against Women Act to send the powerful \nmessage to victims that they understand how important these economic \nprotections are by including them in the conference report on VAWA.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is the Coburn amendment the pending \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthe Coburn amendment commence at noon and prior thereto there be a \nperiod of 10 minutes equally divided with no second-degree amendments \nin order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in the interim, if any Senator wishes to \ndiscuss an amendment, we are pleased to\n\n[[Page S11182]]\n\nproceed. We will accommodate any Senator with regard to amendments they \nwish to discuss. We discussed this matter last night with Senator \nCoburn, and he agreed we could initiate a vote on his amendment \nsometime around noon. We would like to proceed on that basis.\n  I once again urge Senators to present their amendments or work with \nus with regard to the package we are now discussing on amendments which \nwill be accepted without debate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I wish to announce to the Senate my intention to move to \nmake a point of order against all amendments that have been indicated \nby the Parliamentarian to be not germane commencing at 2 o'clock. So if \nany Senator wishes to discuss that category of amendments, we would be \npleased to discuss them either prior to this vote or after the vote. We \nwould like to have a decision made, if possible, as to how many more \namendments we will deal with today.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 1943, as Modified; and 1997, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send to the desk the first managers' \npackage for the day. I will present it now. We offer, for Senator Reed \nof Rhode Island, amendment No. 1943, a sense of the Senate on increased \npersonnel end strengths, and it has been modified; for Senator \nMikulski, amendment No. 1997, for laser marksmanship training. I ask \nunanimous consent that these amendments be considered en bloc.\n  Mr. INOUYE. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendments be agreed to en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendments are agreed to en bloc.\n  The amendments were agreed to en bloc, as follows:\n\n\n                    AMENDMENT NO. 1943, as modified\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on the transfer of amounts \n  for increased personnel strengths for the Army and the Marine Corps \n      from Additional War-Related Appropriations to the recurring \n                  appropriations for fiscal year 2006)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF SENATE ON TRANSFER OF FUNDS FOR INCREASED \n                   PERSONNEL STRENGTHS FOR THE ARMY AND MARINE \n                   CORPS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) A long-term increase in the personnel end strengths for \n     active duty personnel of the Army and the Marine Corps is \n     necessary in order to carry out the current missions of the \n     Army and the Marine Corps and to relieve current strains on \n     Army and Marine Corps forces.\n       (2) The cost of the increase in such end strengths is \n     foreseeable and should be included in the annual budget of \n     the President for each fiscal year, as submitted to Congress \n     pursuant to section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, in \n     order to provide a full and honest accounting to the American \n     people of the personnel costs of the Army and the Marine \n     Corps.\n       (3) The inclusion in the annual budget of the President for \n     each fiscal year of the costs of an increase in such end \n     strengths will permit the Army and Marine Corps to plan for \n     and accommodate the additional troops contemplated by such \n     increased end strengths without reducing other important \n     programs.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the additional amounts to be required for increases in the \n     personnel end strengths for active duty personnel of the Army \n     and the Marine Corps for fiscal year 2006 should be \n     transferred from amounts appropriated by title IX for the \n     Military Personnel, Army, Military Personnel, Marine Corps, \n     Operation and Maintenance, Army, and Operation and \n     Maintenance, Marine Corps, and Operation and Maintenance, \n     Defense-Wide, accounts to the amounts appropriated for the \n     applicable accounts in titles I and II.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1997\n\n(Purpose: To provide that, of the amount made available under title III \n for the Air Force for other procurement, up to $3,000,000 may be made \n         available for the Laser Marksmanship Training System)\n\n       On page 220, after line 25, add the following:\n       Sec. 8116. Of the amount appropriated by title III under \n     the heading ``Other Procurement, Air Force'', up to \n     $3,000,000 may be made available for the Laser Marksmanship \n     Training System.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2005\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, Senator Levin and I are currently \nconducting a hearing of the Armed Services Committee. Both of us \nbelieved it was imperative to come to the Chamber and express to the \nSenate our strong objection to the amendment offered by our \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Coburn. I give this by way of \nbackground.\n  The Committee on Armed Services for some time has been, frankly, \nencouraging the Department to take steps to try to put in place a \nsystem that would revise the older means by which travel was \naccommodated for members of the Department and others. It is a very \nextensive number of individuals who are affected. The Department did \nput in place a program, albeit rather slowly. Nevertheless, it is now \nin place.\n  Congress, through the years, has criticized the Department for not \nproviding better business practices, specifically for the inadequate \noversight of their travel programs. Criticism centered around a growing \nnumber of separate, nonintegrated travel systems which did not provide \nthe information required for DOD or congressional oversight. Therefore, \nthe Defense Travel System was created by the DOD to address these \ncriticisms and the desperate need to make this system work more cost-\neffectively.\n  Comparing the Defense Travel System to the legacy systems is \ninappropriate because the Defense Travel System performs different \nfunctions. The legacy systems are travel reservation systems. The DTS, \nas it is known, reengineers these legacy systems into a travel and \nfinancial management system which links 30 defense data and financial \nprocessing systems with the consequent lower transaction and processing \nfees and lower personnel costs. DTS is saving both people and money. A \nreturn to the legacy systems will require additional people, which is \nnot funded. As DTS is further implemented, additional savings will be \nachieved.\n  Our joint plea is to allow DTS to remain in place and give it a \nreasonable chance to function and prove its goals. According to the \nGAO, the ``continued use of the existing legacy travel systems results \nin underutilization of DTS and affects the savings that DTS was planned \nto achieve.'' This includes paying higher processing costs through the \nlegacy systems' manual travel vouchers as opposed to the processing of \nthe travel vouchers electronically through DTS.\n  The GAO and the Department of Defense have briefed the Armed Services \nCommittee staff that they believe DTS should be given a reasonable \nopportunity to continue to resolve the Department's travel programs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for his \ncomments.\n  This amendment does not eliminate DTS. It says that instead of \ncontinuing to pay $40 or $50 million a year for the 5.6 million \ntravelers who travel, we will pay a fee based on DTS's operations. The \nFederal Government doesn't own this program. In fact, anybody who looks \nat the development of this program will say it is way too expensive\n\n[[Page S11183]]\n\nto have been accomplished in the way it was accomplished. That is \nanother issue. That is contracting within the DOD, and there are \nproblems with that.\n  I remind the most distinguished Senator from Virginia, this doesn't \neliminate DTS. It allows it to continue to function. But what it says \nis we are not going to continue to pay money for a program we don't \nown, and we will start paying it on a per-travel basis.\n  What are the facts around it? Three hundred and seventy-five thousand \nout of 5.6 million travel vouchers last year went through the DTS \nsystem. That is $1,500 per episode, not including the travel. So what \nwe actually have is a system way more expensive than any system that \nhas been developed in the private sector.\n  I am not against using the DTS system. I am all for giving it a \nchance to save us money. We have invested in it. What this amendment \nsays is that we don't eliminate DTS; we just start paying on a per-\ntravel basis and a per-utilization basis. That way, we don't continue \nto spend $50 million a year for a program we don't own. We should own \nit for what we pay for it, and there shouldn't be any cost.\n  I would be happy to modify my amendment to what would meet with the \nneeds of the Senator from Virginia, but I don't believe we should \ncontinue to spend, in the contracting sequence this has gone through, \nthe same amount of money. If we allow DTS to continue to be out there \nand utilize the reporting capability of it but pay it on a per-ticket \nuse rather than a blank check for a contract, the taxpayer will get \nmuch more benefit from it. If it performs, the contractor will make \nmore money. If it doesn't perform, we will save a ton of money for the \ncountry. That is the purpose of the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We entered a time limit to have this vote occur at 12. \nIn view of the exchange that is going on--and another Senator also \nwants to talk--I ask unanimous consent that the vote take place at \n12:10 and the time between now and then be divided between Senator \nCoburn and anyone who wishes to speak on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I must say, I am impressed with the \nthoroughness with which our colleague has researched this issue and the \nfervor with which he speaks. But I pose this question: The Department \nof Defense estimates it will cause a 3-year delay and cost some $65 \nmillion to change the contract structure. I reiterate my strong \nopposition to the amendment because I don't think the Department has \nhad the time operating DTS to adequately prove the principles and the \ngoals they wished to achieve.\n  I recognize other colleagues wish to speak. I thank my colleague for \nthe opportunity to have a colloquy.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, 3 more years? We have spent 7 years and \n$500 million on this system. That is a half a billion dollars. That is \n$2 for every man, woman, and child in this country for a travel system \nthat you could have bought off the shelf for $150 million in 2 or 3 \nyears. The contracting issue is a different issue. If it is going to \ntake 3 more years at $50 million a year, that means we are going to be \nat $650 million for this travel system. That is unacceptable. I believe \nwe ought to say perform or don't perform and put it at a per-unit cost. \nWhy is it that only 370,000 out of 5.6 million travel episodes were \nused on this system at the end of 7 years?\n  We have a structural problem in contracting through the Defense \nDepartment, as well as many other departments in our Government. What \nstarted out to be a $60 million project is now going to end up being \n$650 million. It is the same issue we face with FEMA today in terms of \nbeing efficient.\n  I ask my colleagues to think about how this will still continue if we \ndo it on a per-travel basis. First, it will increase the stimulus to \nget the job done and completed because there will be more revenue, the \nmore people who use it. Two, it will limit the total amount of money \nthe taxpayers are going to end up having to pay for this system. Three, \nit will send a message to the contract officers at the Pentagon that \ncreep in terms of contracting is not acceptable. There are some real \nquestions on whether this process violated the contracting laws at the \nPentagon. I assure my fellow Senators, through the Federal Financial \nOversight Committee, if this continues, we are going to have some \nhearings to look at the issue of violation of the contracting laws at \nthe Pentagon. We should not have to do that.\n  Let's limit the exposure of the American people to the cost. I am not \nupset at the contractor who is doing this. The problem is, it is a big \ntask, but it has cost way too much. Let's provide some stimulus to \nfinish the job and make sure the job is done well rather than continue \nto throw money at it.\n  With that, I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I very much respect the Senator from \nOklahoma. He is a man who is a watchdog on the taxpayers' money, and so \nam I. I know he is very conversant on a variety of issues. It is one of \nthose occasions I must rise in opposition to the Senator's amendment.\n  Congress, several years ago, authorized the Defense Travel System \nwith the aim of saving taxpayers' dollars, and that makes a great deal \nof sense to make sure that travel administration by the Department of \nDefense has greater scrutiny. In fact, as I understand it, they have \nfound by doing it this way--and it is only being field tested; it is \nnot fully implemented--those who are traveling at first-class and \ntickets being paid for where travel wasn't used. This system is \nactually helping save the taxpayers money and also identifying when \nGovernment workers are flying at a higher cost than they ought to.\n  I am told that it is now used at a little bit more than half of the \nDepartment of Defense 11,000 sites by nearly 700,000 uniformed and \ncivilian personnel. It appears, from what I have looked at, that DTS \nhas not only met but exceeded its original objectives. It is not fully \nput in place. It is being field tested. As a practical matter, we would \nlike another year or so to see it fully implemented. I am told that it \nhas handled more than a million transactions, and it is well on its way \nto saving the projected $56 million a year for the American taxpayers.\n  As to efficiency and savings, any GSA solution will strip away what \nare planned savings and actually increase operations costs. This is the \ninformation I have been trying to gather on this since Senator Coburn \noffered the amendment. It would actually increase operation costs from \n$40 to $60 million annually. Senator Warner used the figure of $65 \nmillion. Regardless, there would be an added cost.\n  One thing the Senator from Oklahoma mentioned is that the Department \nof Defense does not actually own this software system and that what the \nDepartment of Defense, though, has done is it has appropriate license \nrights to the DTS software system in accordance with Federal \nacquisition regulations. While there are these allegations from outside \nparties that criticize the DTS program on the basis that the Government \nfailed to obtain title to the DTS software, what is ignored is that the \nFederal acquisitions regulations provide that in the vast majority of \nFederal contracts, the Government does not take title, but instead it \nis given a license to the software. And the Department of Defense has \nsecured appropriate license rights to all the developed software and \nthird-party software products used by DTS.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma stated that this contract may violate the \nvery laws that were put on the books to try to maintain competition in \ncontracting. I don't know whether it was an assertion or a conclusion.\n  I respectfully disagree. The legality of the restructuring of the DTS \ncontract has been challenged in court. From what our research has \nshown, no court has found that the entire restructured contract was \nillegal. It simply stated no part of the contract, as currently \nconfigured, has been found by any court to be illegal. Maybe it will be \nin the future, and we will see.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Let me finish and then the Senator can respond. I say to \nmy\n\n[[Page S11184]]\n\nfriend from Oklahoma, I do have a great deal of respect for him. He is \ntruly a steward of the taxpayers' money. I pride myself, also, in being \na good steward of the taxpayers' dollars. I know there have been \nhearings on this DTS program. We need to continue to examine this issue \nand, in fact, a lot of others. To cut funding right now for this \nprogram would be a hasty action and, from all the information I have \nbeen able to glean, would actually increase the cost to the taxpayers.\n  The Department of Defense does oppose this amendment. They called my \noffice a short time ago expressing this opposition. They promised to \nreview the GAO report as soon as possible. I do think the more prudent \napproach is to, of course, commend the Senator from Oklahoma for any \nkind of scrutiny. No spending should not be under the watchful eye of \nus as stewards of the taxpayers' dollars. But because of a lack of \nunderstanding on the part of the Senators on the floor and this \namendment, this should continue to be studied.\n  I will oppose this amendment and work, such as all of us, to study \nthis issue further. I hope my colleagues will oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I underestimated the amount of time needed. Senator \nLevin wishes to speak. I ask unanimous consent that the vote take place \nat 12:15 p.m. and that the additional time be divided between the \nSenator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, and the Senator from Michigan, Mr. \nLevin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Yes, I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I don't have any problems in putting a lid on this \ncontract, but let's have a little history. The reason the judge could \nnot find a violation in the Competition in Contracting Act was because \nthe Pentagon did not own the software. By design, they cannot have it \nif they do not own it.\n  It was interesting, before the hearing last week, the contractor \noffered to give the property rights to the Pentagon. In the testimony \nlast week, it was noted that DTS performs less effectively than almost \nevery other civilian e-travel system.\n  We are 7 years into it. We are going to spend another $150 million. \nAlso, in the history of the contract, this is another no-bid contract \nthat I know Senator Levin is very interested in. It is a cost plus--\n$43.7 million in the first year, that was not in the contract, and we \nwent on and paid it for anyway.\n  Based on what is happening with the contracting and how we are \ngetting around the Competition in Contracting Act, I believe we need \nsome real sunshine on this.\n  The fact is, we are going to spend another $150 million. If the \nDefense Department would guarantee me that we are not going to spend \nmore than another $100 million to get a travel system that we own, not \nlicensed, but we own, since we are going to pay $650 million for \nsomething that should have cost $150 million, then I would be happy to \nwithdraw this amendment. But you cannot get an assurance out of the \nPentagon what the cost is going to be because there is not any end in \nsight in the cost.\n  We don't own it. They have offered to because of that, but once the \nPentagon owns the contract and the rights to this, then the Competition \nin Contracting Act goes into force, and then there is a basis for the \nviolation.\n  So the reason the judge ruled the way he ruled was because we did not \nhave ownership to the property. So, therefore, there was no basis for \nthe claim. I understand that, but that is the reason that was not given \nto the Pentagon, that the Competition in Contracting Act could not be \nenforced.\n  I am happy to drop this issue if somebody will stand up and say there \nis a limit to how much we are going to spend. We have already spent \nfour times what the public should have spent on any system. No private \nbusiness would have spent this amount of money for this system. Nobody \nwould have.\n  We ought to look at it very hard. Give me the assurance that there is \nan end to this and that it is more efficient than anything we could \nhave done otherwise, and I will drop my look at it.\n  I believe the way to stimulate responsibility in this contract is to \nput it on a per-issue basis now to make it work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I reclaim my time and then I will yield. I \nalso share with my colleagues that the judge who reviewed this case did \nnot find a violation, for whatever technical reasons Senator Coburn may \nsay, but the adjudication was there is no violation. The judge also \nsaid that to start over would be a mistake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for one comment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 6 minutes. The Senator from \nOklahoma has 3 minutes 21 seconds.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be happy to claim my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator is seeking recognition on his time, I have \nno objection.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, are we going to have a judge decide on the \nbasis of economics whether we start over? What does that have to do \nwith adjudication? He is making an economic decision for us. That is \nour job. That is not the judge's job. It doesn't matter whether he says \nit will be more expensive; that is not his role. That is part of our \nproblem in the judiciary today. That is not his role. That is our role.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma. I do so with some reluctance, actually, \nbecause I have great admiration for the Senator from Oklahoma and his \nefforts to curtail waste in the Government. I have joined him on a \nnumber of those efforts. As a matter of fact, I very much admire his \nefforts and the efforts of the subcommittee he chairs to go after \nwaste. I think he is going too far in this particular case, and he is \ngoing after an effort to try to integrate the thousands--literally \nthousands--of financial management systems in the Department of \nDefense.\n  We had a chart a few years back with a box for each financial \nmanagement system in the Department of Defense, perhaps half the size \nof the curtain behind the Presiding Officer. There were thousands of \nboxes on that chart. We told the Department of Defense: You have to get \nyour house in order; you have to get some financial management in the \nDepartment of Defense so that we can tell whether your expenditures--so \nthat you can tell and then we, as oversight people, can tell--are those \nexpenditures authorized; do your managers know how much you are \nspending on what; is the payment automatic when these expenditures are \nmade?\n  For instance, for travel, when a ticket is purchased, is that ticket \npaid for automatically the way it should be by a computer if it is \nauthorized or is there going to have to be someone, as the status quo \nprovides, cutting a check for the travel? That costs money. It may not \nappear in the cost of the ticket of the one transaction that may be the \n``cheapest'' transaction, according to some system, but there is a cost \nto pay for that transaction.\n  We want the payment to be automatic when the transaction is \nauthorized. We want the ability of managers to know what is being \nspent, is the travel authorized, can you go back and track the travel \nautomatically?\n  Now we have thousands of systems out there, with thousands of \nmanagers, not integrated into a system, where the kind of management \nthat is so essential in the Pentagon can occur.\n  That is the problem with the amendment. It goes back to a focus on \nindividual transactions to purchase tickets rather than to make a \nsystem to buy the travel part of an integrated management system.\n  Look, we put a lot of pressure on the Pentagon. We have put a huge \namount of pressure on it to come up with some\n\n[[Page S11185]]\n\nfinancial management capability. They have been a failure at it. Now \nthey are trying to do it--they have not succeeded, by the way. This \nsystem has plenty of bugs in it. As the Senator from Oklahoma properly \npoints out, there are bugs in this system. But we don't kill the effort \nto try to get integrated financial management so there is some \naccountability for the funds that are spent by the Pentagon.\n  We do not want to go back to ground zero. We want to try to make this \nwork. And the problem with this amendment is that it goes too far \nbecause it says:\n\n       None of the funds appropriated by this Act may be obligated \n     or expended for further development, deployment, or operation \n     of any web-based, end-to-end travel management system, or \n     services under any contract for such travel services that \n     provides for payment by the Department of Defense to the \n     service provider--\n\n  Except for a fixed-fee transaction payment.\n  That puts us back to millions of individual transactions which are \nunaccountable and for which we cannot have proper oversight. That is \nthe problem.\n  I admire the Senator's goal in trying to come up with a system which \nis better than the one we are now proceeding to acquire. We are going \nto work out the bugs, hopefully, in that system. But I disagree to \ngoing back to ground zero because we have to get some integrated \nfinancial management at the Pentagon. That is the purpose of this DTS \nsystem.\n  It has not yet been achieved. I agree with the Senator from Oklahoma, \nit has not been achieved, but I don't think we ought to blow up the \neffort and go back to ground zero.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for his \ncomments. This does not go back to ground zero. This leaves the DTS \nsystem intact. What it says is we are going to pay a fee for every \ntransaction you do. We have spent $500 million on this and, as the \nSenator from Virginia said, we are up to $600,000 out of the 3.6 \nmillion transactions.\n  I can think of no better incentive to have the bugs worked out of it \nby the contractor than to get more of the 3.6 million transactions. It \ndoes not eliminate this. It does not take us back to ground zero. It \nleaves DTS intact. It says the way we are going to pay for it, from now \non, is on a per-transaction basis, rather than a fixed amount or $50 \nmillion plus cost that is going to run, which we see now is at least 3 \nyears, at least another $150 million.\n  We have 3.6 million transactions per year that are going to go \nthrough there. It does not do what the Senator claims. It does not \neliminate DTS. It does not cause any change in the implementation of \nthe program, other than pay for it on a per-transaction basis. The \ntaxpayers ought to be willing to say: Hey, if it is going to work, it \nis going to work, and we will pay for it as it works now. We have spent \nhalf a billion dollars.\n  I reserve my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 22 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, again, I thank my friend from Oklahoma. \nThis is a prohibition on spending any additional money to operate any \nWeb-based, end-to-end management system. That is what is in the \nlanguage. It says you cannot spend any more money. We can't get the \nbugs out, which is what we should do if you can't spend any more money \nto improve this system.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma goes back to an individual transaction \nsystem which does not provide the ability to determine whether travel \nis authorized, does not permit the people who are responsible to pay \nfor the travel to know whether it is authorized and to pay for it by \ncomputer automatically. We have millions of transactions that are going \nto have to be paid for individually instead of part of the end-to-end \nsystem.\n  So if the Senator had allowed for the correction of this system to \nwork out the bugs, that would be one thing. But it does not. This says \nyou cannot spend any more money on a Web-based system, and that is the \nmistake of this amendment. That is why it goes too far, although it is \nwell intended.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, will my colleague from Michigan yield \ntime? I wish to speak on this issue in support of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no more time to yield. The \nSenator from Oklahoma has 1 minute 20 seconds.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will speak for a short time and then \ngive my colleague from Minnesota a chance to finish, even though he \nopposes my amendment.\n  The Pentagon has the ability to set that transaction fee on a per \nbasis. They will be able to still fund it. If there ends up being a \nmillion people this next year and they charge $30 per fund, they will \nget $30 million out of it.\n  The point is, the Pentagon has the flexibility to do it that way.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I support the intent of what my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma wants to do. He wants to clean up this system. We had a \nhearing on this issue last week. The Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations had a hearing on this issue, and we have questions out \nto the DOD, out to the GAO, and we have a commitment from the Under \nSecretary of Defense to work with us.\n  I have said if we cannot get the right answers we should pull the \nplug, but now is not the time to pull the plug. We do oversight for a \nreason. We are in the process of oversight. Let us get answers to the \nquestions, but clearly then we want to have the right kind of system. \nSo I agree with the intent of what my colleague is trying to \naccomplish, but this is not the way to do it or the time to do it. Let \nus finish our investigative work. Let us get the answers, and then we \ncan bring this issue up at another time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. On behalf of Senator Inouye and myself, I move to table \nthe amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1896), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Child and Family Assistance Benefits for \n     Members of the Armed Forces.--\n       (1) Additional amount for operation and maintenance, \n     defense-wide.--The amount appropriated by title II under the \n     heading ``Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide'' is hereby \n     increased by $60,000,000.\n       (2) Availability of amount.--Of the amount appropriated by \n     title II under the heading ``Operation and Maintenance, \n     Defense-Wide'', as increased by paragraph (1), not less than \n     $60,000,000 shall be made available as follows:\n       (A) Not less than $50,000,000 shall be made available for \n     childcare services for families of members of the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (B) Not less than $10,000,000 shall be made available for \n     family assistance centers that primarily serve members of the \n     Armed Forces and their families.\n       (b) National Guard Counterdrug Support Activities.--\n       (1) Additional amount for drug interdiction and counter-\n     drug activities.--The\n\n[[Page S11187]]\n\n     amount appropriated by title VI under the heading ``Drug \n     Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities'' is hereby \n     increased by $40,000,000.\n       (2) Availability of amount.--Of the amount appropriated by \n     title VI under the heading ``Drug Interdiction and Counter-\n     Drug Activities'', as increased by paragraph (1), $40,000,000 \n     shall be available for the purpose of National Guard \n     counterdrug support activities.\n       (3) Supplement not supplant.--The amount available under \n     paragraph (2) for the purpose specified in that paragraph is \n     in addition to any other amounts available under title VI for \n     that purpose.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank Senator Stevens for his support and assistance in \nthis matter. I thank him and the ranking member and members of the \ncommittee and acknowledge in every one of these three areas the Senate \nCommittee on Appropriations has added funding already above the \nPresident's recommendation. I recognize, also, that the committee is \ndealing with the budget constraints that were imposed upon it by the \nSenate budget, but conditions in the real world do not always conform \nto those constraints. This funding is essential to address these \ncritical areas, beginning with an additional $40 million for the \nNational Guard counterdrug efforts which would enable State \ncoordinators to increase their border security, to increase \nreconnaissance, and to expand their effort to interdict the flood of \nillegal drugs into our country.\n  These National Guard antidrug efforts are under the control of the \nGovernors and Adjutant Generals so they do not violate Federal passe \ncomitatus laws. Yet they are essential to our national security.\n  Other than international terrorism, there is no greater threat to the \nsafety, the health, and the well-being of our citizens than the \nincreasing flow of illegal drugs into our country, into our \nneighborhoods, into our schools, and into our homes. They are \ndestroying lives, they are destroying families, and they are destroying \ncommunities.\n  In my home State of Minnesota I am told by local law enforcement \nleaders there are direct pipelines of illegal drugs now, especially \nmethamphetamine from Mexico, right into the State of Minnesota.\n  Border security is not just a Southern State crisis or a Northern \nState problem. Homeland Security is not just a Federal agency with \nincreased priorities.\n  As I listen to local law enforcement officials throughout Minnesota, \nthey say we are losing the war against these narcotics terrorists. We \nare losing because our resources are being overwhelmed by their \nresources. These are battles that are going on not halfway around the \nworld but right here at home, right within our own country, every day \nand every night.\n  These are narcotics terrorists. They are drug-dealing gangs. They are \ndangerous predators. They are preying on Americans, young and old, rich \nand poor. They are pouring highly dangerous, very addictive, and \ncorrosively expensive drugs into our country and our citizens' lives, \nand we are letting then get away with it.\n  In many cases they get away with it entirely scot-free and leave the \ncountry with millions and millions of our dollars. These are very \ndangerous, destructive, evil people who are winning the war on drugs in \nthis country because we--all of us, collectively, all of us Americans \ncollectively--do not have enough good guys out there on our behalf who \nare fighting them. My amendment brings more money for the good guys to \nwin this terribly destructive battle.\n  Second, $50 million would go to increase the childcare services for \nmilitary families. Again, I commend the committee, Chairman Stevens, \nfor increasing the President's recommendation in this critical area. My \namendment would add another $50 million because the Office of the \nSecretary of Defense currently estimates that 38,000 children of \nActive-Duty military families are not able to access military childcare \nbecause of the lack of spaces and facilities. This is especially \ncritical because so many of these family members are being deployed for \n12 or 18 months, leaving their spouses as single parents, financially \nstrapped, needing to work and therefore needing quality childcare even \nmore than before.\n  Finally, my amendment adds $10 million for family assistance centers \nand personnel who are responding to the increased needs of military \nfamilies--Active-Duty, Reserves, and National Guard, whose families are \nbeing seriously and severely impacted by the increased number of \ndeployments for extended periods of time.\n  The stresses of those long separations, the constant anxieties and \nuncertainties about the well-being of their loved ones abroad, the \nfinancial pressures, the difficulties emotionally of single parenting \nall add up and have put additional needs for these family assistance \ncenters and their personnel for families while their loved ones are \nserving and after they have returned. And some wounded and seriously \nmaimed are causing enormous family stress and strains for the next \nnumber of years.\n  I thank, again, the chairman, and I thank the ranking member for his \nwillingness to consider taking this amendment into the managers' \npackage. I commend them for their leadership in these very important \nareas. I hope this amendment will be seen as constructive to that, and \nI hope the conference committee will see fit to include these increases \nbecause I can assure all the Members that it will be very much needed \nand very well used.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the situation with regard to when we vote on \nthis amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote is scheduled to occur at 2:15.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that time be changed to 2:30 \nwith no amendments in the second degree in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is the Senator suggesting the additional time be equally divided?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Now I address the Senator, the sponsor of the amendment. \nSenator Mikulski wants 15 minutes between now and 2:30. Does Senator \nDayton have any objection to that?\n  Mr. DAYTON. No, I have no objection.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will take a few minutes before that time, and Senator \nMikulski would have from 2:15 until 2:30.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have provided $25 million to respond \nin this bill for the National Guard counterdrug program. We already \nhave $20 million for childcare, $20 million for family counseling, $18 \nmillion for National Guard and assistance centers, for a total of $58.6 \nmillion.\n  The Senator's amendment adds $60 million for childcare and $20 \nmillion for family assistance centers but, as he said, we have already \ngone in excess of the President's request. We have tried to balance the \nrequirement to fight the war on global terrorism and maintenance for \nour technological advantage against potential rivals and the care of \nour servicemembers and their families.\n  We have worked closely with the Department of Defense to identify \nthese requirements. We believe the Senator's amendment is subject to a \npoint of order.\n  We raise a point of order under section 302(f) of the Congressional \nBudget Act that the amendment provides for spending in excess of the \n302(b) allocations under the fiscal year 2006 concurrent resolution on \nthe budget.\n  Having raised that, does the Senator wish to waive that point of \norder?\n  Mr. DAYTON. I do.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator moves to waive the point of order. I ask for \nthe yeas and nays on the motion to waive the point of order that I have \nsubmitted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will occur at 2:30 on the motion to \nwaive.\n  Mr. STEVENS. For the information of Members, we hope we will have \nanother amendment ready to be considered at 3 o'clock. Senator Hatch \nhas asked for 30 minutes beginning at 2:30 to speak on a matter that is \nnot pertinent to this bill, but he has that right to speak under his \nallocation of time.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Hatch have 30 minutes from 2:30 to 3 \no'clock. He has had a terrible disaster in his office. One of his close \npersonal friends on his staff has passed away. He wishes to speak about \nthat person for\n\n[[Page S11188]]\n\n30 minutes starting at 2:30. We want to put the vote to 3 o'clock. So I \nmove we move the vote to 3 o'clock so Senator Hatch can speak at 2:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the floor to Senator Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as I noted under the request made by the \nchairman of the Senate Defense appropriations, I have time at 2:30. I \nknow it is a minute or two earlier, but I ask for the ability to \nproceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n\n\n                               Gas Prices\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know we are considering the Defense \nappropriations bill, and we congratulate the leadership of the \nsubcommittee of which I am a proud member. Senators Stevens and Inouye \nhave brought an excellent appropriations bill to the Senate.\n  I rise about another security issue which is the high price of \ngasoline. I rise today to urge President Bush to convene a White House \njawboning session of the American oil and gas companies to urge them to \nbe good corporate citizens and lower the price of gasoline, home \nheating oil, and natural gas.\n  I think it is swell the President is agreeing that conservation is an \nimportant goal. But it is very little and very late. Yes, we do need \nconservation. But wearing sweaters just will not be enough. The \nPresident needs to call on CEOs of the oil and gas companies to be \npatriots. It is time for the oil and gas company CEOs to be looking at \nthe ways they can help the American people, not only their profits.\n  These sky-high prices have created a crisis for American families and \nbusinesses--from families that must commute to work, to small \nbusinesses that deliver flowers, to truckers that deliver food, and \nwatermen in the Chesapeake Bay who are paying $4 a gallon to take their \nboats out. This is going to have a tremendous inflationary pressure on \nour economy. We in Maryland are feeling it very severely. Maryland has \nthe third highest gas prices in the country, at more than $3 per \ngallon. It has been a 30-percent increase in little more than 1 month.\n  Maryland is not the only State affected. The national price for a \ngallon of gas is now as high as it has been in 20 years. Some are \nsaying: Well, gas prices are going down. Well, they have been going \ndown a penny or two, but they are still very high.\n  As people go to the gasoline pump, they feel this great anxiety. \nPeople are nervous about getting gas. As for what that means to \nfamilies, I have seen on our local TV a soccer mom filling up her \nminivan, and seeing that it cost $90, she just put her head down on the \nwindow crying about what her family was going to do?\n  That is why I have asked the President today to convene a White House \n``jawbone'' session. There is precedent for this. Forty years ago, Jack \nKennedy felt that big steel was really pushing up the prices. Some \ncalled it price gouging. He called in the CEOs of the steel industry to \nthe White House. He made the case for the American people. He said the \nsteel industry action was unjustified and irresponsible and not in the \npublic interest. President Kennedy publicly pressed them hard. Guess \nwhat happened? Roger Blough and the steel industry decreased their \nprices.\n  I am asking President Bush to follow President Kennedy's example and \ncall in these oil and gas CEOs. He has called in the oil and gas CEOs \nbefore to help write the energy policy. Well, now we need a new energy \npolicy. We need one based on conservation. We need one based on \ninnovation, to come up with new ideas on alternative fuel supplies. We \nneed a new energy policy to look at what we can do to rebuild the gulf. \nAnd we understand oil and gas has suffered some damage there. But we \nalso need them to take a look at the prices they are charging and the \nconsequences to our economy. So we feel if they could write a national \npolicy a few years ago, they can come in and write a new national \npolicy.\n  So I have sent this letter to the President, signed by many Senators. \nI would hope the President would think about how we can engage the \nprivate sector to come to grips with what is happening here. He should \nalso reach out to get their advice on innovation, to get their advice \non boosting our supplies, to get their advice on what to do about \nhaving more refining capacity and, at the same time, meet some of our \nenvironmental constraints.\n  We understand we are at a crossroads in this country. Now is the time \nto bring them together, but bring them together as patriots. I believe \nthey will be able to make profits and be patriots at the same time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter to the \nPresident, dated October 6, 2005, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 2005.\n     President George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Sky high gas prices have created a \n     crisis for American families and businesses. As Americans \n     struggle to fill their gas tanks, the oil and gas companies \n     are filling their pockets with historic profits. Bold and \n     decisive Presidential leadership is required. We urge you to \n     convene immediately a summit at the White House of oil and \n     gas company CEOs to call on them to be good corporate \n     citizens by reducing their prices.\n       The price for a gallon of gas is now the highest it has \n     been in more than twenty years. It jumped 12 cents in just \n     the last week and now averages almost $3 a gallon, with many \n     Americans paying as much as $3.50 for just one gallon of gas. \n     These prices are hurting everyone, from families getting \n     children to school and commuting to work to small businesses \n     like the florist delivering flowers and our larger employers \n     trying to get goods to their stores. Meanwhile, the oil and \n     gas company profits continue to soar, with projected earnings \n     growth for 2005 ranging from 50% to more than 100%.\n       This all comes at a time when America is facing a crisis \n     caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In response, we have \n     seen an outpouring of generosity and selflessness throughout \n     the nation. Many families and companies are putting the needs \n     of hurricane victims first and opening their hearts, homes \n     and wallets.\n       In times of national crisis, corporations have been called \n     upon to act in the national interest. In 1962, as our country \n     faced an economic crisis at home and foreign policy crises \n     abroad from Berlin to Vietnam, the steel industry jacked up \n     prices. President Kennedy called the CEOs of the steel \n     industry to the White House. He forcefully made the case for \n     the American people: he said the steel industry action was \n     ``wholly unjustified and an irresponsible defiance of the \n     public interest.'' President Kennedy publicly pressed them \n     hard--and prices decreased.\n       We urge you to follow President Kennedy's example. Call in \n     the oil and gas CEOs and tell them to cut their prices. Tell \n     them that profiteering at a time of national need is \n     unacceptable.\n       We have never before had a President, Vice President or \n     Administration as close to the oil, gas and energy industry \n     as yours is. This was demonstrated when, at the beginning of \n     your administration, you convened a White House energy task \n     force to draft a national energy policy. As we now know, \n     large parts of that policy were drafted by your friends, \n     allies and supporters in the oil, gas and energy industries.\n       Mr. President, if you can call on the oil, gas and energy \n     industries to write national policy that benefits them, then \n     you can certainly call them to the White House on behalf of \n     the American people at this time of national need. America \n     needs your leadership to prevail upon them to reduce gas \n     prices and other fuel prices now.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Barbara A. Mikulski.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, may I proceed for 7 or 8 minutes as in \nmorning business between now and the time Senator Hatch comes at 2:30?\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have no objection to that. The Senator is entitled to \nspeak on any matter he wishes, using his own time. But we have time set \nfor Senator Hatch to begin at 2:30.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n\n    President Bush's Speech to the National Endowment for Democracy\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today, in his speech to the National \nEndowment for Democracy, President Bush gave a vivid and, I believe, \ncompelling description of the threat to America and to\n\n[[Page S11189]]\n\nfreedom from radical Islamic fundamentalism. He made, in my view, a \npowerful case for what is at stake for every American.\n  Simply put, the radical fundamentalists seek to kill our citizens in \ngreat numbers, to disrupt our economy, and to reshape the international \norder. They would take the world backwards, replacing freedom with fear \nand hope with hatred. If they were to acquire a nuclear weapon, the \nthreat they would pose to America would be literally existential.\n  The President said it well. The President is right that we cannot and \nwill not retreat. We will defend ourselves and defeat the enemies of \nfreedom and progress. But in order to know where we are going to go \nfrom here, we have to understand, in my view, how we got to this point \nin the fight. Unfortunately, the many fundamental mistakes this \nadministration has made over the past 4 years have dug us into a hole \nthat is making it harder for us to get out.\n  First, the administration took our eye off the ball in Afghanistan \nand diverted our attention and resources to Iraq prematurely. As a \nresult, while we made progress in Afghanistan, violence in Afghanistan \nis now worse than it has been since the war, and the Taliban, al-Qaida, \nand the warlords are, once again, on the move in Afghanistan.\n  Meanwhile, we have captured some al-Qaida leaders, but many others \nhave risen to take their place, and the terrorist threat has literally \nmetastasized to many other countries. Around the world, terrorist \nattacks are on the rise, not decline.\n  Second, this administration turned unilateral military preemption \nfrom the option it has always been into a one-size-fits-all doctrine in \nthe war on terror. We forgot that the power of our example is as \nimportant as the example of our power, that our ideas and our ideals \nare among our greatest assets. We forgot to draw on the totality of \nAmerica's strength in order to be able to deal with the hearts and \nminds of 1.2 billion Muslims around the world.\n  Third, once we decided to focus on Iraq, we went to war too soon. We \nwent without the rest of the world, and we went under false premises.\n  This administration told us we would be greeted with open arms, that \nwe had enough troops to stabilize the country, that Iraqi oil would pay \nfor the reconstruction. They were wrong on each of these counts and \nmany more.\n  The result is a terrible irony. Iraq now risks becoming what it was \nnot before the war: a haven for the very radical Islamic \nfundamentalists who would do us such harm.\n  But today the President of the United States seemed to recognize some \nof this self-inflicted damage. That is a good thing, and I applaud him \nfor it. He said: ``the terrorists have now set their sights on Iraq''--\nfinally acknowledging that they did not before the war.\n  He said that in the broader fight against the radical fundamentalists \nand in Iraq itself, we can't succeed alone, that we need partners--\nfinally acknowledging what many of us on both sides of the aisle have \nbeen saying for years.\n  He implied that while our military might is essential, it is not \nsufficient--finally acknowledging that we can and must call on the \ntotality of America's strength, including our economic and political \nmight and the power of our example.\n  He said that the fight for freedom is long term and that democracy \ncan't be imposed by force--finally acknowledging that we can't simply \ntopple tyrants and leave, that we have to work day in and day out to \nsupport moderates and modernizers and build the institutions of \ndemocracy.\n  And he said that much more sacrifice will be required--finally \nacknowledging the difficulty of the challenge and the burden every \nAmerican must bear.\n  So the President said some very important things today. But there are \nalso a lot of things he did not say that leaves me, and I suspect many \nothers, feeling frustrated. He told us broadly what we have to do, but \nhe said virtually nothing about how he plans to go about doing it and \nwhat the American people can expect.\n  Consider what he said, and what he did not say, on Iraq.\n  Yes, we have to train Iraqi forces, as he said. But we still do not \nknow how many of those forces must be capable of operating on their own \nor with minimal U.S. support before we can begin to reduce our military \npresence in Iraq. And we do not have any idea when those numbers might \nbe reached.\n  Yes, we have to support the creation of a strong Iraqi political \nsystem that enjoys legitimacy with all the major groups, as the \nPresident said. But we still do not know what the plan is to overcome \ndeep Sunni hostility to the constitution and to reconcile the growing \nsectarian differences that threaten to divide Iraq, not unite it.\n  Yes, we have to engage the international community to stabilize Iraq, \nas the President has said. But we still do not know what concrete \nactions the administration is taking to do just that. We still do not \nknow why it will not organize a contact group of leading nations to \nshow a united international front. We still do not know the plans for \ngetting Iraq's neighbors to act responsibly, as we did in the Balkans \nand in Afghanistan.\n  Yes, we have to continue to help the Iraqis rebuild, as the President \nsaid. But we still do not know what the administration is going to do \nto actually deliver more electricity, to clean up the sewage, to get \nthe oil flowing.\n  My colleagues remember, right after we went in, Mr. Bremer laid out a \ngame plan. He said: By August we will have X number of megawatts and \npump Y numbers of barrels of oil; and by December we will have--and \nthere were goals. If you notice, we have not heard a thing, not a \nsingle thing about any of that. We have no idea what the \nadministration's timetables or goals are, other than generically to \nhelp them rebuild.\n  What do we need to do to turn the tide on delivering basic services? \nAnd when can we expect them to succeed? Because in each of these areas, \nIraqis today, as I speak, are worse off than they were before the war.\n  The President today was eloquent, and he was determined. But \neloquence and determination, although necessary, are not sufficient.\n  The American people need--and our troops deserve--a clear plan for \nthe way forward in Iraq, which has now become the central front in the \nwar against radical Islamic fundamentalism.\n  As I have said many times before, the American people need this \nadministration to speak openly and forthrightly about its plan for \nsuccess in Iraq, for no foreign policy can be sustained--as we are \nnoticing by the numbers--without the informed consent of the American \npeople. They must be informed.\n  The American people also need--and our troops deserve--not the \nassertion that we finally have a comprehensive strategy in the fight \nagainst the fundamentalists but a detailed explanation of what that \nstrategy is and the steps the administration is taking to build it.\n  It is precisely because all of us recognize what is at stake for our \ngeneration and those who follow that we will continue to speak out and \ninsist that our Government act not only with determination but with \neffectiveness, not only with conviction but with wisdom.\n  Finally, though I continue to have differences with the President \nabout how he has gone about prosecuting the war on terror--and I have \nspoken out as forcefully as I know how--let our enemies make no \nmistake--make no mistake at all--Americans are united in the struggle \nfor freedom. We stand together in our determination with the President \nto fight the forces of tyranny and terrorism. In this right, America \nwill prevail.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Delaware, if he \nwishes to speak further, we will be happy to extend him more time, if \nhe wishes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. No, I am fine. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1896, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification to \nSenator Dayton's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S11190]]\n\n       (1) Availability of amount.--Of the amount appropriated by \n     title II under the heading ``Operation and Maintenance, \n     Defense-Wide'', up to $60,000,000 may be made available as \n     follows:\n       (A) Up to $50,000,000 may be made available for childcare \n     services for families of members of the Armed Forces.\n       (B) Up to $10,000,000 may be made available for family \n     assistance centers that primarily serve members of the Armed \n     Forces and their families.\n       (b) National Guard Counterdrug Support Activities.--\n       (1) Availability of amount.--Of the amount appropriated by \n     title VI under the heading ``Drug Interdiction and Counter-\n     Drug Activities'', up to $40,000,000 may be available for the \n     purpose of National Guard counterdrug support activities.\n       (2) Supplement not supplant.--The amount available under \n     paragraph (2) for the purpose specified in that paragraph is \n     in addition to any other amounts available under title VI for \n     that purpose.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the modified \namendment be considered and that it be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1896), as further modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote and to lay the motion on \nthe table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That cancels the vote for 2:30, correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The bill is still subject to amendment. No other Senator \nhas asked us to consider an amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the much awaited speech by President Bush \nthis morning about the challenges we face in Iraq and Afghanistan was \npromised to be a new perspective. It was promised to offer the \npossibility that at least we would be considering a new approach.\n  I was disappointed. The President has offered the American people a \nfalse choice between resolve and retreat. The real choice should be \nbetween a strategy of accountability and the vague generalities which \nwe continue to hear from this administration. We have to move beyond \nthe policies of fear to a plan of forceful commitment to protecting \nAmerica and our values.\n  The most telling line in President Bush's speech this morning about \nthe threat of terrorism was this:\n\n       There is no alternative.\n\n  Once again, the President tells us there is no alternative but to \nstay the course in Iraq. But he fails to answer the most basic \nquestions that more and more Americans are asking every single day: How \ndo we know that progress is being made? How do we measure success? How \nmuch longer will America, with its best and bravest men and women in \nuniform, be facing this insurgency, killing, and the terrible \nconditions which we find in Iraq? Most importantly, what is President \nBush's plan to ensure that our troop commitment in Iraq does not \ncompromise our safety here at home? The White House promised us new \ndetails in this speech. We did not receive them, just old generalities.\n  All Americans are committed to our troops, make no mistake about \nthat. When we take a look at the appropriations bills that come before \nthis Congress to provide the resources for the troops in Iraq, one \ncould not pick out which Senators voted for or against Iraq in terms of \nthe invasion. All Senators--Democrats and Republicans--regardless of \ntheir feeling about the wisdom of this strategy are committed to our \ntroops and committed to the resources they need to come home safely. \nThat is not the question. The question is, What is President Bush's \nplan to achieve the goals that he states over and over? He failed to \nanswer that question today.\n  Once again, we are presented with false connections between why we \nare in Iraq and why we were attacked on September 11. The implication \nis distorting. It is false. The 9/11 Commission put that allegation to \nrest. They found no operational relationship between Iraq and what \nhappened in America on September 11, 2001.\n  But now, 2\\1/2\\ years into Iraq, the war has not made us safer from \nterrorism. It has altered the strategic environment to our \ndisadvantage. Today we have fewer allies in Iraq than we did when this \nwar began. We have less credibility.\n  The search for Osama bin Laden has been diverted. The President \nquoted Osama bin Laden today. I think it is time to capture Osama bin \nLaden, as we have been promised so many times would happen.\n  We have fewer options dealing with Iran and North Korea, and the \nadministration knows it. Our army is strong and brave and resilient, \nbut it is being pushed to the limit. Our National Guard and Reserves \nand their families are loyal and courageous Americans. They have \ncarried an extraordinary burden in this war in Iraq, and there is no \nend in sight.\n  The President gave a rousing speech, but we learned nothing about how \nwe will either win the war in Iraq or the war on terror. The choice in \nIraq is not to stay the course or withdraw tomorrow. That is a false \nchoice. We don't want or need to retreat and allow that part of the \nworld to descend into chaos politically. We need to implement a \nstrategy that gives the Iraqis a chance to build a government that \nstands on its own. That is the only government that can succeed in \nIraq.\n  This morning, the Department of Defense reported that we have 148,810 \nsoldiers in Iraq; 1,945 Americans have died since our invasion; 14,902 \nhave been wounded. How many innocent civilian Iraqis have been killed? \nIt is anyone's estimate at this point, but some say between 20,000 and \n40,000 Iraqis have lost their lives since the invasion.\n  We owe it to our men and women in uniform, we owe it to those who \nbelieve in America to let them know what our path for success will be. \nAnd we certainly owe it to America's taxpayers who are spending $1.5 \nbillion a week in Iraq to let them know what our strategy will be.\n  Last week in Washington, a piece of information came out that had \nbeen protected and classified for a long period of time. I had heard \nabout it, but we were not allowed to speak about it. Then Generals \nCasey and Abizaid came to testify in an open and public hearing and \nconceded the fact that out of over 100 battalions of the Iraqi Army in \nthat country, only 1 out of the 100 were battle ready; 1 out of 100 \nprepared for battle to stand and fight on their own. That is a shocking \ndisclosure--the billions of dollars we have put into Iraq, the amount \nwe have invested in the premise that once the Iraqi Army was up and \nready to fight, we could come home, and then to learn after all of this \ntime that only one battalion stands ready to fight.\n\n  This week, we addressed a letter to the President--some 40 Democratic \nSenators joined together--and asked the President critical questions \nwhich we think need to be answered, questions which were not answered \ntoday. Here are the questions:\n  How many Iraqi forces must be capable of operating without U.S. \nassistance or with minimal U.S. support before we can begin reducing \nour military presence? When will that number be reached? When can we \nstart bringing American soldiers home?\n  The next question: What specific measures does the administration \nplan to take before and after this critical October 15 constitutional \nreferendum to forge the necessary political consensus and reconcile the \ngrowing differences, sectarian and religious, in the nation of Iraq? If \nsuch consensus is not reached, what policy changes will be required?\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the President of Iraq came to visit us in the \nCapitol. He is a man of Kurdish ethnic origin. It was interesting \nbecause his entire delegation he brought with him was Kurds. His \nclosest aide and his security detail were all Kurdish. The interesting \nthing about that is, we are talking about an Iraq where all factions \nare coming together, and yet it appears their leaders are traveling in \nthese little enclaves that represent their sect, their ethnic \nbackground. There is not an indication\n\n[[Page S11191]]\n\nthat Iraq is viewing the prospect of nationhood in the way these top \nofficials are conducting their public lives. How are we dealing with \nthat?\n  Another question the President and the administration must face: What \nefforts have they made or will they make to obtain broader \ninternational support, including engaging Iraq's neighbors and other \nnations, particularly Muslim nations, in an effort to stabilize Iraq?\n  There is no question that many in Iraq resent our presence. They view \nus as an occupying force. When the generals brief us, they tell us \nbluntly: We cannot defeat the insurgency. It will take political and \neconomic forces. We cannot do this militarily. And yet our force is \nthere. Our sons and daughters, those in uniform whom we love, are there \nwith their lives at risk every single day.\n  What is this administration doing to change the face of that force \nthat stabilizes Iraq until they can control their own fate and their \nown future? What are they doing, if anything, to bring in troops from \nMuslim nations so that we no longer face the criticism that we are \nsomehow invading this Muslim country? It is an important question to be \nanswered.\n  How should the American people, we ask the President, assess the \nprogress in reconstituting Iraq, in reconstructing it? What are the \ntangible results of the billions of dollars America has provided for \nIraq's reconstruction? Does the administration have a plan to ensure \nthat those who misuse taxpayers' funds will be held accountable? How \nmuch more will taxpayers be asked to contribute to Iraq's \nreconstruction? What steps is the administration taking to ensure that \nfuture investment will not be misused?\n  We continue to hear that when it comes to the basics of life, there \nis less electricity today for the families and people of Iraq than \nthere was before the invasion. We know they are struggling with the \nbasics of life--water, sewage, safety in the streets, safety for \nchildren to go to school.\n  What we are saying at this point is this administration--every \nadministration--must be held accountable for its policies. We must be \nable to measure whether progress is being made and whether staying the \ncourse will result in the kind of success the President is looking for.\n  None of these questions were answered today. We have no clearer \npicture of where we go from here than we did yesterday. At this point, \nthe President has a special responsibility to the American people--not \nto convince us of the danger of global terrorism; we are convinced. We \nlived through 9/11. We know that these people who are engaged in that \nterrorism are looking for an opportunity to strike again. But the \nPresident has a responsibility to explain to the American people why \nIraq, which was not the testing grounds for terrorism before our \ninvasion, has become that, why it has become a magnet for these \nterrorists to come from all over the Middle East and around the world \nto detonate car bombs and to attack our troops, and what we are doing \nto bring it to an end.\n  Those are the questions the American people still face. I know why \nthe President held this press conference. He knows as well as I do, \nwhen you speak to people across this country, they have serious \nmisgivings, not about the bravery of our troops, not about the need to \nmake America strong, but that this strategy this administration is \npursuing will bring us to a conclusion where America and its values are \ntruly protected.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, because we are at this point postcloture, \nI want to speak on a subject unrelated to the bill. I ask unanimous \nconsent to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          The Price of Energy\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to speak about the price of oil and \ngasoline. I know there are a lot of discussions around this country \nabout many issues of public interest. The American people are concerned \nand interested about a lot of challenges we face. We have the biggest \nbudget deficit in the history of this country. I know people say it is \ngetting better. The fact is, it is not. They show a little smaller \nbudget deficit by using the Social Security surpluses to make it look \nsmaller. We also have the largest trade deficit in the history of the \ncountry. The trade deficit and the budget deficit combined are over $1 \ntrillion this year. We have challenges there.\n  We have challenges in Iraq dealing with foreign policy. We have our \nmen and women wearing America's uniform in harm's way. Our hearts go \nout to them and our prayers are with them.\n  We have a lot of issues. The gulf coast was hit by a devastating \nnatural disaster, by Hurricane Katrina followed by Hurricane Rita. \nHundreds of thousands of Americans have lost their homes. Many of them \nhave lost everything, living still today in shelters with a bleak \nprospect ahead. And our country is coming together to try to say to \nthem, You are not alone. We face some challenges.\n  Let me speak about one other challenge; that is, the challenge of the \npeople who drive up to the gas pump this afternoon and buy 15, 16, or \n18 gallons of gas, put it in their tanks, and discover it costs over \n$50. There are a whole lot of families in this country who cannot \nafford that. While people drive to the gas pump and put in 15 or 18 \ngallons and have a $50 bill to pay, the major integrated oil companies \nin the country have reaped the highest profits in their history. These \nmajor integrated oil companies are bigger, stronger, more powerful and \nmuscular than they have ever been.\n  Thanks to megamergers that have occurred in recent years, all these \noil companies fell in love with each other, started dating, got \nhitched, and now, instead of two companies, it is one company. It is \nExxonMobil. It used to be Exxon and Mobil, but it is now ExxonMobil. \nThe list goes on. So we have bigger, stronger, and more powerful \ncompanies that have more impact in the marketplace, and they are more \nprofitable than ever in their history.\n  Let me use a few statistics.\n  In January of last year, the average price of oil was $34.5 a barrel \nin this country. At that rate, the major integrated oil companies made \nthe largest profits in their history--Exxon earned $25 billion. What \ndid they do with it? Nearly $10 billion went to buy back their stock \nanother story I will talk about in a moment. At $34.5 a barrel, the \nintegrated oil companies had the highest profits in their history. Add \n$30 a barrel to that. Then ask yourself, What are the profits going to \nbe this year? You have the answer. Profits are windfall, excess profits \nfar above anything justified.\n  We use 21 million barrels of oil a day in this country. The world \nuses 84 million barrels of oil every single day. We use a fourth of it. \nThink about that. We use a fourth of the oil pumped out of the ground \nevery day in this country. Sixty percent of it we buy from other \ncountries, and 40 percent we produce in this country.\n  People say--well, those who support the oil industry; there are \nplenty of them here--it is fine for them to be making $60 or $65 or $70 \na barrel. That gives them a chance to invest in more production and \nrefineries. Let me show you what was printed in Business Week in June \nof last year entitled ``Why Isn't Big Oil Drilling More?''\n\n       Rather than developing new fields, oil giants have \n     preferred to buy rivals--``drilling for oil on Wall Street.''\n\n  There ain't no oil on Wall Street. Wall Street is about big finance, \nhigh finance, buying and selling. There is no oil.\n  ``Why Isn't Big Oil Drilling More?''\n\n       Oil has been over $20 a barrel almost continuously since \n     mid-1999. That should have been ample incentive for companies \n     to open new fields, since new projects are designed to be \n     profitable with prices as low as the mid-teens. Nevertheless, \n     drilling has lagged.\n\n  This is Business Week. This isn't some liberal rag. This is Business \nWeek, a conservative business journal.\n\n       Far from raising money to pursue opportunities, oil \n     companies are paying down debt, buying back shares, and \n     hoarding cash.\n\n  While the American people pull up to the gas pumps to pay $50 for \ngas, where\n\n[[Page S11192]]\n\nit is going? Is it going into the ground to look for more oil or build \nrefineries? No, it is not. The pain of the person at the gas pump is \nthe gain of the treasury of the major integrated oil companies. It is a \nfat treasury on the one hand and enormous pain on the other.\n  Katrina and Rita hit this country, and we have people here who say \nthat is what is causing this angst about the price of gasoline and oil. \nNot true. The fact is, oil was in the mid-60s a barrel before Hurricane \nKatrina was bearing down on the gulf coast. The price of oil was well \nabove $60 a barrel. This isn't about the hurricane.\n  Others of my colleagues say this is a free market in oil.\n  I was on one television program--I think a CNBC segment--and the \nmoderator, a real thoughtful gentleman he was, said: You are a \nsocialist because you want to take the windfall profits that exist and \ntax them and use that money to give a rebate to consumers. This is \nsocialism, he said. I was tempted to say: Grow up. But he was a \ntelevision commentator, so I didn't do that. But the point is, there is \nno free market in oil. There is no free market. Some OPEC oil officials \nthat sit around the table and make decisions about supply and price to \nsome extent can influence it.\n  Then what you have are the now giant integrated oil companies that \nhave been made larger by blockbuster mergers in recent years. In \naddition to that, you have the futures market which is supposed to \nprovide liquidity for trading which has become an unbelievable bazaar \nof speculation. So those are the elements that tell me there is no free \nmarket here.\n  You have a market in which the price of a gallon of gasoline is \ndelivered. In fact, nobody ever sees it. It shows up at the gasoline \npumps, you pump it into the tank of your car, and the money goes from \nyour wallet. There are a lot of hard-working families in this country \nand low-income people who can't afford it--from their wallet into the \ntreasury of the major integrated oil companies.\n  Then the question is, Why isn't big oil drilling more? I made a \nproposition. I introduced a piece of legislation, along with my \ncolleague, Senator Dodd, and others, to say anything above $40 a \nbarrel--incidentally, $40 a barrel is the price at which the oil \ncompanies had the largest profits in their history by far--if you are \nnot using it to drill for more oil or build more refineries, you get \nhit with a 50-percent excise tax on those windfall profits, and all of \nthat money is used to give rebates to consumers. It is not money for \nthe Federal Treasury. It takes the money back from the oil companies \nthat are soaking people at the gas pump and returns it to consumers. \nThere is a huge cry about that--interfering with the market, we are \ntold.\n\n  Let me refer to this article from the New York Times. This is \nFebruary of this year. This goes back 8 months or so.\n\n     . . . the worlds 10 biggest oil companies earned more than \n     $100 billion in 2004, a windfall greater than the economic \n     output of Malaysia. . . .Their sales are expected to exceed \n     $1 trillion for 2004, which is more than Canada's gross \n     domestic product.\n       Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil \n     company, earned more than $25 billion last year and spent \n     $9.95 billion to buy back its own stock; Royal Dutch/Shell \n     Group . . . pledged to hand out at least $10 billion as \n     dividends to shareholders this year.\n       Last year, the largest integrated oil companies spent 24 \n     percent of their cash on dividends, 12 percent on share buy-\n     backs, and 12 percent on paring debt . . . As a share of \n     exploration and production expenses, spending on exploration \n     has declined over the last decade, and now accounts for 20 \n     percent of the total.\n\n  There was an interesting piece in a newspaper just days ago. Most \npeople know what AAA is, the American Automobile Association--headline:\n\n       Finger-pointing Begins After Gas Prices Jump 24 Cents in 24 \n     Hours; Exxon Dealers--\n\n  These are the gas station dealers--\n\n     --Say They Are Chafing Under Higher Prices Decreed From Atop.\n       A growing chorus of Exxon dealers in the Washington metro \n     area are raising their voices and accusing the world's \n     largest oil company, Exxon Mobil, of profiting from the \n     exorbitant prices at the pump in the wake of Hurricane \n     Katrina . . . In candid conversations with AAA Mid-Atlantic, \n     a handful of local dealers accused the oil giant of raising \n     their wholesale price to service stations by 24 cents in a \n     24-hour period.\n       The disgruntled dealers say the steep price increases put \n     them on the horns of a dilemma . . . By raising their prices, \n     they risk losing their loyal customer base, which has taken \n     them years to build. By raising their voices against Exxon \n     Mobil's practices, they risk losing their contracts.\n\n  Question: What is happening here? What is going on? It is really an \ninteresting dilemma. The inclination, I suspect, of most people here in \nthe Congress is to do nothing. Go to ``parade rest'' is the most \ncomfortable position for politicians. It has always been and perhaps \nalways will be. But we not only see prices at the gas pumps coming from \nthe price of a barrel of oil, now $30 above last year's prices and \nrecord profits, we are now heading into a winter season where folks \nfrom my home State, the State of North Dakota, folks from the home \nState of the Presiding Officer, the State of Minnesota, and others will \nbe paying 70 percent more for natural gas.\n  We had a vote yesterday on the low-income home heating assistance \nprogram. We lost that vote. We will come back and have it again. We \nwill eventually have that vote. We don't have a choice. Low-income \nfolks have to heat their homes, and heating a home in winter is not a \nluxury.\n  But this is not just about them. What about the other folks, the \nfolks who are in the middle-income ranges who are still trying to \nfigure out how to make ends meet? How do we buy school clothes for our \nkids and pay for gas for our car and pay our mortgage, buy the \ngroceries each week, and do all the things we need to do for our \nfamily, and then pay a 70-percent increase in the cost of heating our \nhomes for winter? What about those people? Does anybody here care, or \nare we just content to thumb our suspenders and light our cigar under \nthe glare of klieg lights? God bless the free market. Let it all go. \nWhat utter, sheer nonsense.\n  There is no free market in oil. I know people with suits that cost a \nwhole lot more than mine are going to be cranky about this statement. \nThere is no free market. They will say: Of course there is a free spot \nmarket. There are people trading right now as you speak, Senator \nDorgan. There are people trading back and forth, and of course there is \na market.\n  Totally absurd. There are the OPEC ministers, there are the larger \nand more powerful through blockbuster mergers integrated oil companies, \nand then there is rampant speculation in the futures market. They are \ncombined to make a pretty interesting dance, but there is no free \nmarket.\n  There is substantial pain in this country at the price of gasoline, \nsubstantial pain that will occur this winter with a 70-percent increase \nin natural gas prices, a 40-percent increase in home heating fuel \nprices, and people are going to ask the question, Why is this \nhappening? Who is on my side? Why do we have a circumstance where the \nbiggest in this country, the largest economic enterprises, make record \nprofits and smile all the way to the bank while all the rest of the \nfolks are bearing the pain?\n  I have often spoken about the Texas Playboys, a band from the 1930s \nthat had the refrain in their song, ``Little bees suck the blossom, but \nthe big bee gets the honey. The little guy picks the cotton, and the \nbig guy gets the money.'' If ever those lyrics meant something, it \nmeans something now in this circumstance with respect to the pain and \nthe gain in this energy policy.\n  So I introduced a piece of legislation. It is very simple. It says \nthat at oil prices above $40 a barrel, if the windfall profits accrued \nfrom those prices are not being used to explore for more oil and \nnatural gas and if they are not being used to build refineries and add \ncapacity, then they shall be taxed at 50 percent, and all of the \nproceeds will be used to provide rebates to American consumers. It is a \nform of revenue sharing from the oil companies that are experiencing \nwindfall profits to the folks who are pulling up to the gas pumps and \nthe folks who are going to try to pay a heating bill that is \nexorbitant.\n  I don't have any idea whether this Senate will act on this \nlegislation. It is more likely the Senate will do what it usually does \nin areas of controversy: it will stand with those who have the most \neconomic clout. The question of whose side are you on, regrettably, at \nleast in recent years, the Senate has\n\n[[Page S11193]]\n\ndemonstrated that it is not on your side. It is not on the side of the \nlittle guy, that is for sure. We can pretend and act as if we have our \nhands over our eyes for some months and say it just didn't work out \nthat we could do anything, really. So the market system works. If it \ncosts $50 to fill your tank, that is the way the market is. God bless \nyou. See you tomorrow. Good luck, by the way.\n\n  Or when you find the 70-percent increase in your home heating fuel \nand it is 30 below zero and the wind is blowing 40 miles per hour--and \nyes, it does in some parts of our country--and you are cranking up the \nfurnace to make sure there is enough heat in the house for you, the \nfamily, and the kids, so you can go to bed and not freeze, and those \nwho say this is just the free market, good for you, God bless you, keep \nthat furnace high, but you have to make it a priority to pay the \nheating bill. It is not our fault the heating bill is so high. Congress \ndecided not to do anything.\n  By the way, now it is December and the Congress is not in session \nanymore, and it is, you know, good luck to you. God bless you. Go back \nand forth to the post office and visit a little bit about how high the \nprices are, but nobody is going to help you much.\n  I don't believe we are a country that can do without oil. We produce \noil in my State. I support the oil industry in many areas. I believe we \nought to produce more in this country. I believe we are dangerously \naddicted to foreign oil. It is unusual, to say the least, that one-\nfourth of the world's oil is consumed in this country every day. We \nshare this globe with 6.5 billion people, and in this country alone we \nhave a claim on one-fourth of all the oil that is consumed.\n  It is a peculiar thing that somehow given how this planet is put \ntogether, there is this little area halfway around the world covered \nwith sand where most of the oil deposits exist, and the largest \ndeposits are in countries called Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Iraq. That is \na curious and strange thing and one that is also dangerous for us.\n  We have become so dependent on that supply of oil--and now I am not \ntalking about the price and windfall profits of domestic companies; I \nam talking about the dangerous addiction we have to foreign oil. If we \ndo not as a country decide we will try to find a way to break this \naddiction--I am not suggesting we will not always dig and drill--but if \nour energy policy is just digging and drilling, that is a ``yesterday \nforever'' policy and it is one that is destined for failure.\n  We have to become independent in terms of our energy needs, \nparticularly of those troubled countries in the Middle East. I find it \nfascinating we have such a relationship with the Saudis. The Saudis \nhave the largest reserves of oil in the world. Under their sands exist \nthe world's largest oil reserves. Because of that, even our foreign \npolicy is altered.\n  I have spoken in the Senate many times about the 28 redacted pages in \nthe 2002 December report about the September 11 terrorist attack in \nthis country. Fifteen of the 19 terrorists were Saudi citizens. The \ncombined Intelligence Committees of the House and the Senate did this \nfirst investigation of September 11. They sent it to the White House. \nThe White House published the book, but 28 pages were redacted. What \nwere they? Twenty-eight pages, according to published reports and \naccording to my colleague Senator Graham, in his book, had to do with \nthe Saudis. Why? Because all that we do with the Saudis, all we do with \nthem in foreign policy, even with respect to this issue of terrorist \nattacks, has to do with our incredible dependence on Saudi oil and on \nMiddle East oil.\n  This is dangerous for our country. We have to remove ourselves from \nthat, remove that addiction. How do we do that? There is a wide range \nof things. We passed energy legislation in this Congress. It is not \ngreat, but it is not bad. I voted for it. It moves us in the right \ndirection. That is the immediate term. In the short term, we are \nconfronted with this unusual price for a barrel of oil which converts \nto an unusual price for a gallon of gasoline. Every American driving up \nto the gas pump today understands the shock value of having to pay \nthese prices. Every American trying to heat their home this winter will \nunderstand the same shock value.\n  They will and should ask the question, Is anybody doing anything \nabout this, or is this an appropriate form of a new market system we do \nnot understand? The answer is, the Congress should do something about \nit. Again, let me say there are all kinds of reasons and excuses and \nespecially distortions that are moved around on these subjects. Let me \ngive an example of one.\n  We have people who say, look, the reason we did not have more oil \nflowing, which would relate to supply and demand, with the supply-\ndemand curve, if you have more supply going in against a fixed demand \nor an increasing demand, a greater supply means lower price. The reason \nwe do not have that is because of the eggheaded environmentalists, they \nwould claim. They have prevented oil companies from building \nrefineries, so shame on them, that is the problem today. We do not have \nenough refineries.\n  We hear that in the Senate and the House and all political debate, \nover and over. It is a branding technique, the notion if you say it \noften enough, people will start believing it: 150 refineries have been \nclosed in the past 25 years and no new refineries have been sited in \nthe same period.\n  The fact is most of the evidence points to the oil companies \nthemselves as making the decisions about closing refineries. They have \ndecided to shut down existing refineries and decrease output as a \nbusiness matter. They do that following big mergers and also \nrestructuring. The big integrated oil companies control a majority of \nthe Nation's refined oil and gas products. In many cases, they control \nthis process from the point of pulling oil from the ground to pumping \nit into your gas tank.\n  The fact is, there is an interesting amount of evidence about this \nissue of refineries. We had an Energy Committee hearing about this. We \nhad three experts who knew about all this. Why are there not more \nrefineries being built? Because the margins are not higher, is why. \nThat is from the experts. It has nothing do with environmentalists. The \nmargins are not higher. So when oil companies restructure and merge, \nthey close refineries because they want to. The fact is there is a \nwealth of information about this refinery issue that suggests this is \nnot about environmentalists; it is about the oil companies deciding in \ntheir own interests how much refining capacity they want and what kind \nof margins they want from refining.\n\n  My point is very simple. We have a serious problem in this country \nwith an energy crisis. It is not getting better. We have a dislocation, \nterrible pain, for a lot of working folks, a lot of low-income people, \nnot just to drive their cars but also to heat their homes as we \napproach this winter. And they will ask the question, and should, is \nanyone going to care about this? Will somebody do something about it? \nWill someone be on our side and stand for us?\n  We will have some people say this is the free market and if you do \nnot like it, tough luck, we do not intend to intervene in a free \nmarket.\n  Then there are others, such as me, who say that is nonsense, this is \nnot a free market, this is not fair competition. A free market economy \nis about competition. Easy entry, easy exit, competition around price. \nThere is no free market here. We have OPEC, oil companies, and rampant \nspeculation. They have created a distortion of so-called market prices.\n  The American people deserve a Senate that will stand in at times when \noil prices reach $60 and $70 a barrel and we have profits that \nrepresent the biggest profits in the history of corporate America. The \nAmerican people deserve a Senate that will stand up and say, We are on \nyour side and we will do something about it when the market system does \nnot work.\n  America can do better. The fact is we can do better on energy policy. \nWe can do better on policy I just described. We owe it to people to \nintervene in circumstances where we must intervene. The Senate should \nmake it a priority to consider this kind of legislation.\n  We have meandered our way through this year. There has been no \ndiscernible pattern, no discernible journey that makes much sense to \nme. But in this Congress we have wandered\n\n[[Page S11194]]\n\naround, place to place. We did not pass our appropriations bills, \nintervened in a whole range of issues, including the Terri Schiavo \ncase. I could go on and on and on. We intervened in all the other \nissues.\n  The key things most people are concerned about in their daily lives, \nthat they talk about at the supper table when they sit around and have \nsomething to eat together--this is one of those key issues. What is the \nprice of energy? Can we afford it? If not, what do we do?\n  The proposal I have offered with some of my colleagues for a windfall \nprofits recapture would not injure any major integrated oil company \nunder any set of circumstances because they would not have to pay it. \nThey would choose not to pay it if, in fact, they are using their \nwindfall profit to explore for more oil and build more refineries; and \nif not, they would choose to repay part of that profit in a form of \nrebate back to their consumers.\n  My hope remains in these coming days as the Congress lurches toward \nthe end of this year, that Congress and the Senate, particularly, will \nfind time to do what is the bull's eye, the agenda the American people \nwant, to deal with things that affect them every day in a very \nsignificant way.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Repeal Law\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Last Friday I was in the Senate briefly and indicated we \nwere introducing legislation that repeals the law that was passed in \nthe emergency response to Hurricane Katrina that took the limitation on \nthe credit cards carried by Federal employees from $2,500 to $250,000. \nThat is right, the bill that responded with emergency funding for \nKatrina also included a provision that increased the limit on Federal \ncredit cards that are carried by some 300,000 Federal workers, \nincreased the top limit from $2,500 per purchase for $250,000 per \npurchase.\n  When I discovered that, I thought, that is not right, that cannot be \nbelievable. It, in fact, was. I discovered the White House had \nrequested that increase in the limit on Federal credit cards be \nprovided.\n  In fact, the person who came down to brief the Congress on that was \nMr. Safavian, top procurement officer at the Office of Management and \nBudget, who was arrested 2 weeks later by the FBI and now has been \nindicted. But all this happened some weeks ago. The credit card limit \nwent from $2,500 to $250,000 on the credit card that is carried by a \nFederal worker, and there are 390,000 or so around.\n  I introduced with my colleague Senator Wyden a bill that would \nrestore it back to the $2,500 limit. My point was, this is nuts. It is \ngoofy to put a $250,000 limit on a credit card. It is unbelievable. I \npointed out the Inspector General's reports and also the GAO reports \nabout abuse of credit cards by some Federal employees.\n  One Federal employee put breast enlargements for his girlfriend on a \nFederal credit card. Buying liquor, trips, guns, unbelievable \nexpenditures in the abuse found by the GAO, and we will increase the \ntop limit on the credit cards to $250,000?\n  I introduced that legislation and I am pleased to say on Monday of \nthis week the Office of Management and Budget and the White House \nannounced they support the legislation to take this back to $2,500. So \nit is actually $2,500 plus an emergency $15,000 post September 11, that \nhappened after September 11, which is what we would take this back to. \nThe White House has said they want to rescind the $250,000 and take it \nback to $2,500.\n  That is the legislation I have introduced with my colleague Senator \nWyden. My hope is at the first opportunity, given the support of the \nWhite House, that I can offer this as an amendment, perhaps not to this \nbill, because I think we are limited in amendments and we are probably \non auto pilot with respect to the amendments. The very next piece of \nlegislation, it would be my intention to offer that.\n  As I said, that will have the support of the White House. Without it, \nof course, the law still exists. It was put in law at the request of \nthe White House to take the top limit from $2,500 to $250,000. I want \nto take it back. The White House says they want it back. So let's \ndecide here in the Senate to put it on a bill and get it to conference \nand get this sort of thing done.\n  Let me also say to OMB and the White House, I appreciate their candor \nand their willingness to do the right thing. Everyone understood what \nwas requested was a mistake. It should not have been requested. The \ndecision now is to change the law and to make it where it ought to be, \na $2,500 limit on the credit cards.\n  Yes, we have to respond in a significant way to Hurricane Katrina. \nSometimes that might encourage somebody or require somebody in certain \ncircumstances to have a larger purchase, but there are plenty of ways \nto accommodate that without risking the waste, fraud, and abuse that \nwill go with having credit cards with $250,000 limits.\n  Our legislation is pending. I make the point I appreciate the \nadministration deciding to do a U-turn on this policy. We will offer \nthis legislation in the Senate as soon as we are eligible to offer it \non perhaps the next piece of legislation brought to the floor.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom South Dakota be entitled to introduce a bill and have time as \nthough in morning business, with the clock on cloture continuing to \nrun.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thune pertaining to the introduction of S. 1840 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the hour is now almost 4:30 p.m. We have \nwaited and waited and waited for Senators to bring their amendments. No \nfurther amendments have been noticed to either side.\n\n\n            Amendments Nos. 1981, 2053, 2054, 2055, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have a managers' package which I send \nto the desk for Senator Chambliss, amendment No. 1981, literacy on \nmilitary installations; an amendment for myself on advisers for the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff; an amendment for Senator Frist on certain youth \norganizations; and an amendment for Senator Byrd regarding Hurricane \nKatrina relief.\n  I ask these items be considered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will consider \nthe amendments en bloc.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that the Senate consider the \namendments and adopt them en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto, en bloc.\n  The amendment (No. 1981) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Monday, October 3, 2005, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  The amendments were agreed to, en bloc, as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2053\n\n  (Purpose: To increase the rate of basic pay for the enlisted member \n serving as the Senior Enlisted Advisor for the Chairman of the Joint \n                            Chiefs of Staff)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S11195]]\n\n     SEC. __.

Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress); and\n       (2) shall remain available until expended.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr President, I rise today in favor of the amendment I \nam offering to H.R. 2863 that will establish pilot projects regarding \npediatric early literacy on military installations.\n  Reach Out and Read, ROR, is a program that trains doctors and nurses \nto advise parents about the importance of reading aloud to their \nchildren. The program provides books for all children from the age of 6 \nmonths to 5 years receiving a check up at participating pediatric \ncenters. From the start, the purpose of ROR was to encourage parents to \nread to their children and provide them with the tools to do so. This \npremise is the basis for the ROR model utilized by 2,337 program sites \nacross the United States today.\n  Currently, the program sites are all located at clinics, hospitals, \noffice practices and other primary care sites serving more than 2 \nmillion children distributing more than 3.2 million books annually. \nWhile I am pleased that the program has a strong presence in Georgia, \nwith over forty participating sites, I am also aware that none of the \nparticipating sites are on any of our thirteen military installations.\n  It is important that the children growing up on our Nation's military \ninstallations are allowed the option to\n\n[[Page S11196]]\n\nparticipate in the same federally funded programs that are offered to \nnon-military families and children. Initially, Reach Out and Read began \nas a collaboration between pediatricians and early childhood educators. \nBy working together, these two groups found that pediatricians and \nnurse practitioners were in a unique position to promote early literacy \nbecause they enjoyed and had regular contact with young children and \ntheir parents through well-child check-ups. Reach Out and Read builds \non the unique relationships between medical providers and parents, and \nhelps families and communities encourage early literacy skills so that \nchildren will enter school better prepared for success in reading.\n  ROR plans to launch 300 new program sites per year for the next 5 \nyears, which will double the number of children receiving books and \nguidance. My amendment will establish Reach Out and Read pilot programs \non a limited number of military bases across the country. I ask for \nsupport of this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, again I say, we have told our colleagues \ntime and time again we were waiting for amendments. No amendments have \nbeen noticed on either side.\n  I ask for third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I object. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may debate.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my 1 hour of \ntime of debate be yielded to Senator Landrieu from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask to speak for as much time as I may \nconsume. I understand there will be other amendments that may be \noffered. We are trying to debate and pass the Defense appropriations \nbill. I thank the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii for \ntheir good work in trying to move this bill through because they have \ndone an outstanding job.\n  I find myself in a very unusual position because, of course, I voted \nfor cloture because I want to pass this bill. We absolutely have to \npass a Defense appropriations bill. Unfortunately, we have had 48 \nsoldiers from Louisiana die, many more wounded. Families are still \nmourning those losses and we have to figure out a way to get the job \ndone over there, and get it done right and get our soldiers home.\n  We need to move on with this bill. As my colleagues know, at about \n4:30 this morning this bill will pass under the cloture rules and we \nare going to go on. But I have decided to take some time until 4:30 \nthis morning to talk about a war that is going on at home and that is a \nwar we are fighting on the gulf coast to stay alive, to protect our way \nof life, to keep the American flag flying over Louisiana, Mississippi, \nand Alabama.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time does the \nSenator have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Louisiana yield for a \nparliamentary inquiry?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time does the Senator from Louisiana have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 94 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I probably will not take all 94 minutes \nat this moment, but I will probably take that and even some more as we \nmove through the evening trying to get some closure on a subject we \nhave now been talking about, unfortunately, it seems, with no end in \nsight, or no resolution on the horizon to try to get some real money--\nnot photo ops, not promises, not press conferences, not visits, but \nsome real money to some real people in Louisiana who need help, our \ncities that were devastated, our parishes that have been crippled, our \nlaw enforcement that has been set back on its heels. Three hospitals \nstayed open the entire time in the New Orleans metropolitan area to \nprovide desperately needed emergency health care in a region of almost \n1.5 million people. Heroically, they stayed up, and because they did, \none of those hospitals cannot claim insurance because the only way they \ncan claim it is if they closed down. They stayed open so they may lose \ntheir hospital if we do not try to get some money.\n  The reason I do not feel the least bit guilty standing here asking \nfor it on this bill is because the underlying Defense bill--if the \nstaff will bring me the final numbers of this bill--has a tremendous \namount of money we are spending in Iraq for our defense and for the \nstanding up of Iraq. While I have questions about some of the things we \nare doing, some of the things we have done, and how we are going to get \nourselves back home after stabilizing it, I have to say when I went on \nthe Web site today, it was hard to actually read. The people of \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama are going to be quite surprised if \nthey go on this U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Web site and pull up this \ngulf region division because they might think this is about the gulf \nregion right here in the United States. But it is not. It is about the \ngulf region in Iraq.\n  In the underlying bill we are passing, and we need to pass, I am \ntrying to get the administration--the leadership here to at least agree \nto take $1 billion of the FEMA money we have already allocated, $62 \nbillion, and send to Louisiana to begin some construction projects and \nsome standing up of some critical programs to keep cities, parishes, \nand law enforcement whole as we begin our rebuilding program from the \nlargest natural disaster that ever occurred. That is all we are trying \nto do is give $1 billion to the cities and parishes so they can hold \nheart and soul together, so as we pass additional help, whether it \ncomes from levee construction, or whether it comes from small business, \nor whether it comes from health care, the entities of the government, \nthe parish presidents, the cities, the sheriffs, the police officers, \nand the fire departments are there to help us build a region.\n  I was surprised to see on the Web page that this is the goal we have \nin Iraq: to establish a government, provide security, enhance basic \nservices to the Government of Iraq. It sounds like something we are \ntrying to do in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama--provide security, \nenhance basic services, and keep our cities, our police forces, our \nfire departments operating through the worst and largest natural \ndisaster in the history of the United States.\n  We are getting ready to send billions of dollars to Iraq, finance \nbillions of tax cuts for other people, finance billions for programs. \nWe have already given $62 billion to FEMA that everyone says does not \nwork, and I can personally testify to that, having been in the State \nnow almost every day since this hurricane. We cannot seem to get an \nagreement to get $1 billion for the people of the gulf coast to keep \ntheir security open, their basic services operating, their electricity \nrunning, and their water turned on.\n  We have been working for weeks diligently on these 815 projects in \nIraq for ports of entry, military facilities, police facilities, fire \nfacilities, prisons, and courts. The last time I checked the New \nOrleans court system, we did not even have a court operating. The last \ntime I checked, the supreme court had moved to Zachary. The supreme \ncourt used to be operating in New Orleans until Katrina came. The whole \nsupreme court went to Zachary, LA. They do not even have a court \nbuilding to operate in.\n\n[[Page S11197]]\n\n  I am all for this bill. To my knowledge, I have never voted against a \nDefense appropriations bill and do not intend to tonight, but because \nSenator Vitter and I have been asking for some money directly, not even \nnew money, not even money out of this bill, for the House of \nRepresentatives to send us a commitment, for the President to send us a \ncommitment of $1 billion to our sheriffs, to our police force, to our \nfirefighters for 3 months, to keep them operating, is it any surprise \nthat I cannot sit in my chair and smile while we are sending all of \nthis money to stand up public works in Iraq--354 planned projects in \nwater treatment, sewer projects, buildings for health and education; \n1,091 projects, including schools, primary health care centers, \nhospitals, and public buildings?\n  This is what my city looks like. Actually, this is not New Orleans. \nThis is probably Waveland or Bay St. Louis, but it could be New \nOrleans. It could be Slidell.\n  This is what the gulf coast of the United States looks like today. \nMost of it is gone. These are the cities Senator Vitter and I and our \ndelegation have been trying to get help to. I do not see any houses \nhere, but maybe someone does. I do not know how we collect ad valorem \ntaxes to pay for police and fire protection. There are no stores people \ncan shop in to generate the sales tax necessary to keep the mayor and \ncity hall functioning. When we pass tax credits, which we might want to \ndo and have already done to entice businesses to come back, where would \nthey go to get a permit? When they file their plans for construction, \nwho would review them? When they have to file their plan to meet the \nEPA standards that would be required before they could build here, who \nwould be there to take their application?\n\n  This photo is what my constituents look like. I wouldn't be surprised \nif this man was in the Army or the Navy. Maybe he is a Reserve officer. \nI wouldn't be surprised at all because I have thousands of them who put \nthe uniform on and went to Iraq and came back, and this is what they \nhave come back to. I have an administration that is going to pass this \nDefense bill to put electricity in Baghdad, build schools in Baghdad, \nand will not give the Louisiana delegation $1 billion--out of $62 \nbillion that has already been allocated so it wouldn't cost anybody a \npenny--to help keep the lights on in the cities that were destroyed.\n  This is what my people look like. I don't know how many times they \nhave to cry. I am sorry she doesn't have a lobbyist to send to \nWashington. I happen to be her lobbyist.\n  Here is one for the books. ``Here lies Vera. God help us.'' I think \nthis grave is in New Orleans. I am not certain. But neighbors in the \nmiddle of the flood, when no one would come to get them, took this 65-\nyear-old woman who was killed in the flood and built a grave for her \nand wrote ``Here lies Vera. God help us,'' before they left.\n  This is a picture of a woman who the news media does not think a lot \nof--not all of them, but a lot of them don't think she is self-reliant. \nWe don't have self-reliant people in Louisiana because we have the \nnerve to come up here and ask for money. That is our money that we put \nin the Treasury. We don't have self-reliant people, one of the \nnewspapers said, in Louisiana.\n  Our people put money in the Federal Treasury thinking they belonged \nto the United States of America, so when one county or one parish or \none State is hurt, the other 49 might come to their aid. That is what \nthe United States is about.\n  This woman looks pretty self-reliant to me. She does not have much, \nbut you know what. She has her two children in her arms. And if she had \nthree, I am sure she would have figured out how to bring the other one \non her back. She brought them to safety.\n  This woman may be complaining, but I can tell you I have seen a lot \nof people who have been through a lot of stuff, and they still come up \nto me and say: Senator, we appreciate everything everybody is doing for \nus. I just wish you would hurry up.\n  Not everybody is complaining. But let me put it down right now: I am \ncomplaining. This Senator is complaining about the treatment that our \npeople have received.\n  I tried to be patient. I tried to say: Fine, FEMA is not working. I \nunderstand it. We all made a mistake. We all messed up. We put it where \nit can't work. We put someone in charge who didn't know what he was \ndoing. We gave them money, they can't spend it, so let me just have $1 \nbillion of the $62 billion that they have. There is $43 billion sitting \nthere they cannot even use. Let me just please get it to my firemen, to \nmy police officers, to the mayors to let them operate for 3 more \nmonths.\n  I have to be told: Senator, I am sorry. We want to go home on a \nbreak. You know what. We are not leaving until 4:30 in the morning. We \nmight go home on a break, but it will be 4:30 tonight.\n  Right after the storm, a lot of people didn't have electricity. After \nhurricanes you don't have a lot of electricity, so people are used to \nit. After about a week or 2 weeks, the electricity comes on, but of \ncourse a lot of things are ruined in your house. But I still have \nplaces with no electricity. How do you get businesses to come back if \nthey don't have electricity? I still have places that don't have \nrunning water.\n  Please stop sending us bottled water. We have enough. It is not the \nbottles we need, it is the faucets that need to get turned on. But we \nare going to stand here and pass a bill delivering on power for Iraq.\n  A total of 2,760 megawatts of power have been added to the grid in \nIraq to service more than 5 million Iraqi homes, and I can't get $1 \nbillion to help keep electrical workers on the ground in New Orleans \nturning on the power in Louisiana, Mississippi, or Alabama.\n  We never have any money for anything, but here in the Corps of \nEngineers budget here is $4.3 billion allocated from supplemental \nappropriations for general system improvements for electricity. The \nWorld Bank estimates the total necessity to be $12 billion, so I am \nsure we are going to come up with the other $8 billion to turn the \nlights on in Iraq. But the people who produce the electricity in the \nUnited States of America to turn on lights everywhere in the country, \nfrom Chicago to New York to California, can't get the lights turned on \nin their own backyard because nobody around here can find $1 billion to \ngive to us.\n\n  They say: Senator, how do you know FEMA is not working? I have been \nhome just about every day and have been to most of the shelters, talked \nto most of my mayors, talked to my sheriffs, talked to everybody at \nhome, trying to be patient, understanding they are working little kinks \nout. But let me tell you what comes into our office on a daily basis.\n  Phone calls to my office:\n\n       The attached pages are records of some [underline some] of \n     the calls received in the last few days. Nearly all of them \n     from constituents who have not received any assistance from \n     the Federal Government or Red Cross.\n       Some of the first calls were for search and rescue, and in \n     the 35 days since Hurricane Katrina made landfall, countless \n     Louisianans are in no better shape than they were on the day \n     the hurricane hit.\n\n  I am sure Senator Vitter has a stack at least this thick, if not \nthicker, as has every member of our congressional delegation, and even \nsome of our neighbors from the neighboring States. They have calls \nrecorded--names, phone numbers.\n  When people say, Senator, how do you know FEMA is not working, I do \nhave an idea it might not be working very well. So we could take $1 \nbillion from FEMA, send it through an already existing program called \nthe Community Disaster Loan Program that worked in New York, that \nworked in Puerto Rico, that has worked everywhere in the country when \ndisasters strike, and transfer some of that money there and just give \nit to our cities, our sheriffs, our law enforcement, and the three \nhospitals that stood up. Not the 21 other hospitals that are closed, \nnot all the other needs that we have, from levees to environment to \nhousing to education to health care--none of that. We can wait for that \nuntil we get back. Just keep us operating while we are on vacation.\n  We have yet to hear from the White House, from the House of \nRepresentatives. I know the Senate would pass such a proposal, but the \nreason I cannot accept the passage from the Senate is because all that \nwould be is a Senate-passed bill.\n  I am sure the Senate would pass it unanimously, but it would pass and \nit\n\n[[Page S11198]]\n\nwould sit and no one in Louisiana or Mississippi would get help because \nuntil the House of Representatives acts, until the President says that \nhe will do this, it cannot be done.\n  I know the President wants to help. He has been down to the State. He \nrecognizes that FEMA is having some problems. He has said he wants to \nhelp. But we just cannot keep waiting. So I am going to stay here \nthrough the evening. I am going to continue to negotiate. I am going to \ncontinue to talk with the Senators handling this bill. I am going to \ncontinue to have telephone calls and meetings with anybody who would \nlike to talk about this subject and see what we can do to get this \nmoney committed, in real dollars, in any bill in any way for this one \ncommunity disaster assistance program.\n  Then we need a commitment when we get back to have a vote on \nGrassley-Baucus, a bill that gives emergency health care that this \nSenate has already approved in a bipartisan way, and three amendments \nto that bill. They would cover some emergency education for elementary \nand secondary grades and emergency education for our universities that \nare teetering on the brink of collapse--all of them, public and \nprivate, and historically black colleges included. If we can have a \nvote when we come back--the Senate can vote no, the House can vote no, \nor you know what--the President can veto the bills. But at least I will \nthink I did everything I could to try to get people help. If the \nPresident wants to veto the bills, fine. If the Senate wants to vote \nthem down, fine. If the House wants to vote them down, fine. But at \nleast we can get a commitment to get votes on those bills, get the $1 \nbillion now, and we will come back.\n  I assure you we will be working on this not for weeks but for months, \nfor perhaps years--until we stand up this region.\n  I am not one who doesn't believe in nation building. Some people \ndon't think we should be engaged in it. I happen to be inspired by the \nidea that maybe the United States has some things we could share in a \npositive way and help countries to achieve what we have achieved, which \nis remarkable in the history of the world. But I have to tell you, the \nfirst nation we need to be building is our own. We have had the largest \nnatural disaster in the history of the country, Katrina, followed by \nRita, which was a vicious and very tough storm, and in between those \nthings a disastrous collapsing of a levee system that put the Nation's \nenergy coast underwater--or a large segment of it. It put 10 feet of \nwater in a major American city and virtually has shut it down and shut \ndown the surrounding areas.\n  I have to walk around the Senate for 31 days pretending. Are people \nsaying to me, What can we do to help? We have laid down many things \nthat can help. Many committees have responded. Yet the only thing that \nhas happened for 31 days is that we have given FEMA money, and they \ncan't seem to get it out. So we need to try something a little \ndifferent. We need to try something a little different.\n  I wish FEMA was the way it used to be, and maybe it will be again. \nBut it is not today, and it won't be next week, and it won't be next \nmonth. We can't keep waiting for FEMA to organize itself. We are the \nCongress of the United States. We are Senators. We understand these \nthings. We have been through them before. And to just keep doing the \nsame old thing and expecting different results is crazy. It doesn't \nmake any sense. It is not right.\n  Let us figure out a way to take $1 billion out of FEMA, transfer it \neither through this bill or through another vehicle, and send the money \nto our parishes, to our cities, to our police, to our fire for 3 months \nof operation, which is already authorized in the law. But the reason it \ncan't be done administratively is because there is a legislative cap of \n$5 million. The budget for the city of New Orleans alone, salaries \nonly, is $20 million a month. Why would anybody think that a program \nthat only allows you to borrow $5 million would help them? We have to \nfind $1 billion, approximately, to keep these entities up and running, \nor by the time we get back in 10 days they might have already had to \nlay off police, fire, and critical personnel. How do you start building \nup again once you have closed down your city hall, shut down your fire \ndepartment, shut down your police department, and people have had to go \nout and search for jobs elsewhere? How do you recruit them to come \nback? How do you get them back after you have broken their spirits and \nlaid them off is beyond me.\n  Let me correct myself. No matter what Congress does, having \nrepresented this State for a long time, I want to say that you are not \ngoing to break our spirit. It has been around a long time. We are a \npretty old place. We were here before the country and are worth saving. \nWe will figure it out.\n  But people in Louisiana are having a hard time figuring out how we \ncan spend weeks on the Defense appropriations bill, which is doing more \nthan supporting our troops, which is building up Iraq, actually, with a \ngulf coast region. I want to repeat, gulf region division. We don't \neven have a gulf region division of the Corps of Engineers in the \nUnited States of America today. We have a New Orleans district which \ncovers the southern part of Louisiana. We don't even have a gulf coast \nregion. That would be an advancement. But we have one in Iraq. \nMeanwhile, the gulf coast of this United States, the heart of the \nenergy industry, looks something like this with the water down.\n  As I said many times, while there is a lot of vacationing that goes \non in the gulf coast, particularly along the coast of Mississippi, we \nhave enjoyed that beautiful coastline for years, and we have enjoyed \nthe beautiful sandy beaches in Alabama. Most of the people in the coast \nof Louisiana and many in Mississippi and Alabama work at the ports. \nThey work at shipbuilding. They are shipbuilders or they are commercial \nfishermen who put food on the table that everybody in America eats, and \naround the world. They light up Chicago, and they are proud of it.\n  Do you know what the National Geographic said about it? I think this \nis a very reputable publication, and it is written, I am very proud to \nsay, with the help of the Times-Picayune, our newspaper which has been \nin the city I think as long as the city has been there, evacuated \nitself. They are writing the paper in Baton Rouge and printing it in \nHouma. We don't even have a newspaper in the city of New Orleans, not \nthe major newspaper. We have several other good publications, and they \nare all struggling to stay in business. But with nobody in the city, \nwhere would you deliver your paper and to whom would you sell the \nadvertising? There are no businesses in the city that are operating \nvery well. But our newspaper, thank goodness, is still working. They \ncollaborated with the National Geographic and the Dallas Morning News \nand put together this amazing report on Hurricane Katrina, ``Why It \nBecame a Manmade Disaster and Where It Could Happen Next.'' I highly \nrecommend it for reading here and around the country.\n  On page 49, it talks about an economic powerhouse brought to its \nknees. We are not a charity case in Louisiana. We are an economic \npowerhouse, and we have been so for over 350 years. I reminded my \ncolleagues today, thank God for President's like Thomas Jefferson who \nunderstood borrowing money and what you borrow it for. He borrowed \nmoney from the Treasury and bought the Louisiana Purchase for 3 cents \nan acre because he knew that this country could not grow and meet its \ndestiny, that western expansion and getting to the West was impossible \nwithout the Mississippi River.\n  Andrew Jackson went down there after he fought one war and defended \nit again. Why? Because after he won the first war, the British tried to \ncome and take New Orleans because if they could take New Orleans, we \ncould never be the country we are. Thank God Andrew Jackson knew about \nit, and thank goodness the storm didn't topple his statue, which is \nstill in Jackson Square.\n  An economic powerhouse brought to its knees. Eight hundred manned and \nthousands of unmanned platforms are in the Gulf of Mexico. The largest \nplatform, Mars, is teetering on its side. They cannot produce oil and \ngas. We are trying to get it stood up again.\n\n  If anybody wants to know why the price is going up, it is because \nthis monster hurricane hit the heart of the oil and gas industry. \nDespite our best efforts to protect these infrastructures, despite \nbegging for decades--decade after decade after decade--to restore\n\n[[Page S11199]]\n\nour marsh, to protect the investment this country has made, for 200 \nyears we have been turned down time and time again. So now it is time \nto pay the piper. And I am sorry if it is going to cost $40 billion. I \nam sorry that is what it is going to cost over the next 10 to 20 years \nto stand this powerhouse up again. If anybody wants to check the \nfigures, just come to the Hart Building on the 7th floor, and I will go \nover every single dollar with you.\n  Do you know what the biggest ports are in America? It is not New \nYork, it is not Seattle, and it is not Houston. It is the Port of South \nLouisiana, the Port of New Orleans and the Port of Baton Rouge. We \ndwarf the other ports. We dwarf them. Our port comes up here and asks \nfor some money, and they get told they are a charity case. They have \nbeen taking grain out of Kansas for 200 years. We have been draining \nthe whole continental United States for 200 years. We have been \nshipping everything--goods--all over the world for 200 years. And I \nhave to hear that when our port comes here for help, maybe not even a \ngrant, just a loan to get them through the next 3 or 4 months until \nthey can get back up on their feet, that there is something un-American \nabout them, they need to be more self-reliant.\n  Over 9,000 miles of pipeline connect the gulf with the Eastern United \nStates. We have laid pipelines. No one in America wants them, but we \nhave been laying them down for a long time. Why? Because we have oil \nand gas. We believe in energy, energy independence. We don't think we \nshould get everything from Saudi Arabia. We would like America to be \nmore independent, so we produce some oil and gas, and we make no \napologies for it. But when you lay these pipelines and do not invest in \nthe marsh in which you lay them down and you let it erode and the \nsaltwater comes in and you levee your rivers for channelization and you \ndon't invest in the technology and science that we know would protect \nour marsh, catastrophes happen.\n  Unfortunately, as in every case, the poor have suffered the worst. \nBut they are not the only ones who have suffered. Middle-class \nfamilies, very successful, money in the bank, house paid for, children \nthrough college, looking forward to the next 10 or 15 years, 20 years \nmaybe, and they deserve it; they have worked hard all of their lives, \nthey have paid their taxes, they have kept up with their interests, \nthey go to church every week, and this is what they look like today. \nThey are told to be more self-reliant? I do not know how much more \nself-reliant people can be.\n  I will continue to explain why our region is an economic powerhouse, \nwhy it needs to be so again, why we need to rebuild it, and why, \nunfortunately, it is going be more expensive than it should have been \nbecause of the things we should have been doing for the last 40 years \nand haven't, the investments the Federal Government should have made \nand didn't, even when they knew that this was inevitable. Yet there are \nsome things that we didn't do at our State level. And yes, there are \nsome things we didn't do at our city level.\n  But again, this river does not serve only the 4.5 million people who \nlive in Louisiana, it serves the 300 million people who live in this \nNation and the billions of people who live in this world and depend on \ntrade for prosperity and for commerce and for peace, because the more \nwe trade with each other, the more we know each other, the more we can \nrely on each other in a mutually respectful way, the greatest chance we \nhave for peace.\n  These levees do not just protect the people who live in the \nneighborhoods around them. They protect billions and billions of \ndollars in investment made by this country over a long period of time. \nAnd a levee system failed. We have struggled to keep the levees up. We \nhave spent a lot of money keeping them up. But we needed more help from \nthe Federal Government. We could have been more efficient on our end as \nwell. We could have taxed our people more. But it gets hard on all of \nthose fronts. People want tax relief. They don't really want to face \nthe expense of what we have to do. We are not always disciplined about \nthe way we build.\n  But again, it is not impossible if we make some decisions now to get \nsome emergency money to our cities, to our sheriffs, to our law \nenforcement officers, and to our very basic health care in the region. \nThis is not just New Orleans, this is all through south Louisiana and \nMississippi and Alabama. This would cover all of them. Under current \nlaw, that is no help to them right now--or very little help. We can \ncover some places in Texas if they need help. I don't know if they need \nas much help as we do in Louisiana or as we do along the gulf coast in \nMississippi which I am more familiar with than I am the coast of Texas, \nalthough of course I have been there. I really grew up on the coast of \nMississippi, as well as on the coast of Louisiana, so I am more \nfamiliar with it. But I can tell you that these cities that look a lot \nlike this throughout the gulf coast are going to have a hard time \nmeeting payroll.\n  Some cities have money in the bank, but the needs are so great and so \noverwhelming and FEMA has not been, as I said, very efficient. If we \ncan't get them just a bridge loan, if you will, for 3 months a lot of \nour cities won't operate.\n  Now, I understand--and this is a Mississippi coast. You can tell \nbecause they have white beaches. We don't have beaches. Our coastline \nis marshy. I am pretty sure this is Mississippi. In Mississippi, I \nunderstand their legislature has borrowed $500 million so their cities \ncould get some money, and that might be a solution for them. The \nproblem with Louisiana is that our Constitution prevents us from \nborrowing money for operating expenses. And that is, in my view as a \nformer State treasurer and current Appropriations Committee member, not \na bad rule, if you will. You don't want to borrow money for operating \nexpenses. If you are going to borrow money and have people have to pay \nit back, you want to invest it in that which will return to you \nsomething in the future. So you borrow money to build ports, to build \nhighways, for capital improvements. So our State cannot borrow money at \nthe legislative level to give out to our cities for operating expenses \nor to our firefighters and police. The FEMA law today only allows the \npayment of overtime. So while we can get overtime paid, we can't get \nstraight time paid. We can't get regular time paid. Even if we would, \nthey can't lend them more than $5 million. And as I said, the operating \nbudget in the city of New Orleans is $20 million a month, so $5 million \nwill not do us very much good. If I thought we could organize a \nconstitutional amendment in 30 days and have a vote, I might suggest \nthat. But the polling places have been washed away, and I am not sure \nhow we would find all of our people to vote since there are people in \nall 50 States, and we have no mechanism right now to do that, to my \nknowledge.\n  So we cannot borrow money at the State level to help them. The cities \ncan't go to the capital market. We are restricted by the Constitution. \nFEMA has $63 billion, with $43 billion sitting there, and Senator \nVitter and I and our delegation have asked for $1 billion to keep the \nlifeline until we get back from our vacation, and we are told we can't \nafford it, but we are going to stay here and pass a bill to stand up \nthe country of Iraq by building schools, health care facilities, \nelectric grid, sewer and water, water treatment plants.\n  Well, I can understand, you all can understand why the people of my \nState would want me to stand here and try to make this case. So we will \nbe standing here, I will be standing here until 4:30 in the morning \nuntil we get a resolution on what we are asking for. I am asking for $1 \nbillion of real money anyway, outside of FEMA or take the $1 billion \nfrom FEMA. Let us keep our lifeline going until we get back, and when \nwe get back have a vote on Grassley-Baucus, which this Senate has put \ntogether in a bipartisan way, with three amendments for emergency \nfunding for our schools and our universities, for health care, and \nhousing.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S11200]]\n\n                            Vote Correction\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, on rollcall vote 252, I voted ``yea.'' \nThe official record has me ``absent.'' Therefore, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the official record be corrected to accurately reflect my \nvote. This will in no way change the outcome of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I understand that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, wishes to continue her speech. I ask \nunanimous consent that I may speak briefly for not to exceed 10 minutes \nand that she then be recognized to continue her speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would object to that. The Senator from Louisiana has \nnot asked for time. The Senator does not have to ask for time. He is \nentitled to an hour right now at his own request. So we do not have to \nhave any consent. But I do not object to the Senator speaking as long \nas he wishes. But I do object that only the Senator from Louisiana can \nbe recognized when he is finished. And Senator Hatch, by the way, is \nhere. He had a very sad thing occur in his office, and he wants to \nspeak when the Senator is finished.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska, and I thank \nthe distinguished Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. President, last night, in a closely divided vote, the Senate \nrejected an attempt to add much of the Defense authorization bill to \nthe Defense appropriations bill. Each of these bills is vitally \nimportant to the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces but for \ndifferent reasons. Inasmuch as I am a member of both the Senate \nAppropriations Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee, the \nimportance of each of these bills is very clear to me.\n  The Defense appropriations bill contains the funds that are needed to \nkeep our military running. This bill contains $440 billion that is \nrequired to, among other things, pay, train, and equip our troops for \nthe next 12 months. It is often said that our troops are the best \ntrained, the best equipped, and the most capable military force in the \nworld. In large part, this is true because Congress has appropriated \nthe moneys that are needed to create this outstanding fighting force. \nThat, in a nutshell, is the importance of the Defense appropriations \nbill.\n  The Defense authorization bill also has an important purpose. That \nbill is intended to establish in law critical defense policies. The \nDefense authorization bill contains provisions that relate, among other \nthings, to the setting forth of the number of military personnel that \nthe United States is to maintain; expanding health care options for our \ntroops and their families; and increasing pay and compensation for \nactive-duty, National Guard, and retired servicemembers. The bill also \nincludes many complex technical provisions, such as changes to military \nacquisitions policy. The authorization bill is important to our troops, \nbut it is a very different bill from the Defense appropriations bill.\n  Last night, I opposed the effort to fuse these two bills into one. \nThat move, had it been approved, would have resulted in a delay in our \ntroops getting the appropriations that they require. It also would have \nresulted in less attention to the policy matters in the authorization \nbill that affect our troops in so many ways.\n  The Senate owes our troops and their families a conscientious, well-\ninformed debate on such important authorization matters as improving \nhealth care benefits for the National Guard, among other things. The \nAmerican people need to know what their elected representatives in \nWashington are doing when it comes to defense policy. The American \npeople have given their sons and daughters to fight for their country. \nCan't the Senate give a few days to them? Can't the Senate give them a \nfew days of debate to inform them about what the Congress proposes to \nmake the law of the land concerning defense policy?\n  Many believe that the Senate could debate, amend, and approve the \nDefense authorization bill within a week, plus or minus a few days, if \nit were brought before the Senate for open debate and amendment. \nPassing the authorization bill in that way would serve our troops far \nbetter than keeping that legislation on the shelf, where it has been \nfor several months now.\n  The Senate will pass the Defense appropriations bill later today. \nSurely--surely--Senators can spare the time required to finish action \non the Defense authorization bill. Our troops are overseas. They are \nserving in harm's way and need both of these bills to be debated, \npassed, and signed into law.\n  The Senate has spent all too much time conjuring up complex \nparliamentary procedures instead of facing the real issues confronting \nour military servicemembers. The Senate should call up the Defense \nauthorization bill and let the sun shine on our deliberations and \ndebate.\n  We are the servants of the people. We are the servants of the people, \nnot their masters. We owe the people a public accounting of decisions \non such important matters, instead of a fast shuffle that avoids \ndifficult issues and difficult votes.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. President, on another matter, next week, the people of Iraq will \ngo to the polls and cast a critical ballot. They will decide whether to \nendorse the constitution as drafted by their political leaders. It is \nan important day, and I pray that it goes well.\n  No matter how well the vote goes, whether or not the constitution is \nratified, it appears that the men and women of our Nation's Armed \nForces will be in Iraq for a long time to come.\n  I applaud those men and women. Our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen, \nour marines, our National Guard, our Reserves--our troops--have \ndisplayed unique courage in the face of great trials. My support for \nthem has never--and will never--waiver. They have earned the respect \nand thanks of this Nation.\n  But even more than laudatory words, our troops deserve a plan for \nIraq from their Commander in Chief. The American people deserve the \nsame. We must have a plan with measurable goals and objectives, a plan \nthat gives some surety to our military as well as to the people of this \nNation.\n  Today, in a speech to the National Endowment for Democracy, the \nPresident talked a great deal of why we have forces in Iraq, but the \nPresident did little to provide any plan for success.\n  The American people want to know how we will measure progress. In \nresponse, the President said:\n\n       We never back down, never give in and never accept anything \n     less than complete victory.\n\n  No specifics, no plans, no way to measure success.\n  Maybe the President did not offer specifics because the specifics are \nnot very encouraging.\n  Consider the Iraqi troops. For a new American soldier, basic training \ntakes 9 weeks to complete--9 weeks. The United States has, for more \nthan 2\\1/2\\ years, been training a new Iraqi military. Basic training \nfor all Iraqis, and specialized training after that--2\\1/2\\ years.\n  In June, the Senate was told by the Department of Defense that 3 of \n100 Iraqi battalions were fully trained, equipped, and capable of \noperating independently--what the Defense Department calls ``level one \ntrained.'' Two and a half years: three battalions--three battalions.\n  Between June and the end of September, one would assume that we would \nbe growing that number. Yes, one would assume that we would be growing \nthat number. We are training more Iraqi forces, so more Iraqis should \nbe ready to stand up and defend themselves.\n  Yet, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on \nSeptember 29--just a few days ago--GEN John Abizaid, the Commander of \nthe U.S. Central Command, poured cold water--cold water--on hopes for \nprogress. Between June and September,\n\n[[Page S11201]]\n\nthe number of ``level one trained'' battalions went from three to one. \nHow about that? Instead of moving forward, we are going backward.\n\n  Perhaps the reason that the President did not tell the American \npeople how to gauge success is because he does not have success to \nreport. I must admit, I listen to every address--every address--about \nIraq with great skepticism. And it is because of the track record of \nthis administration. Don't just take my word for it. The record is \nreplete with examples that cause one to look askance at the White House \nclaims.\n  One example is from this past May. Vice President Cheney was asked \nabout progress against the insurgency by CNN. He responded:\n\n       I think they're in the last throes, if you will, of the \n     insurgency.\n\n  The Vice President was confident. The Vice President was unwavering. \nThe Vice President was wrong.\n  Again, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee last \nThursday, GEN George Casey, the Commanding General of the Multinational \nForce in Iraq, explained that the ``last throes'' was a rosy scenario.\n\n       The average counterinsurgency in the 20th century has \n     lasted nine years. Fighting insurgencies is a long-term \n     proposition, and there's no reason that we should believe the \n     insurgency in Iraq will take any less time to deal with.\n\n  Now, those are the words not of Robert C. Byrd, but they are the \nwords of General Casey.\n  Whom should the American people believe? What should the American \npeople believe? It is time for the deceptions and the distortions and \nthe misrepresentations to end. The American people deserve the truth.\n  Instead of broad platitudes, the American people deserve the facts. \nMost importantly, the American people deserve a plan. When will the \nIraqi people be able to defend themselves? When will the Iraqi military \nbe able to fight the insurgency without the American forces? When will \nthe Iraqi police forces be able to control the streets? What is the \ntimetable for reconstruction? What is the target for constant \nelectrical power in the major cities? For communications? For safe \ntransportation? What is our strategy for preparing the Iraqi people to \nbe able to defend themselves?\n  We seem to have no strategy--no strategy--with benchmarks for \nsuccess, no plan for progress. How will we know victory if we cannot \neven define it? What is the plan for our heroes in Iraq? What is the \nplan to stabilize that nation? The American people and the Iraqi people \ndeserve to know the answers.\n\n       The people of the United States must know not only how \n     their country became involved, but where we are heading.\n\n  That is the end of the quotation. I agree with those words. But they \nare not mine. Those words belong to a Congressman from the State of \nIllinois in August 1965. Those words belong to our current Secretary of \nDefense, Donald Rumsfeld. And they echo as true today as they did in \nthat summer 40 years ago.\n  I urge the Bush administration to level with the American people. \nMoreover, I urge the White House to level with itself. Face the facts. \nStop the spinning. Get a grip on the situation. Then please, please, \noh, please, explain to us all where we are heading in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I thank all Senators and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                      tribute to shawn m. bentley\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise with a heavy heart to announce the \nuntimely passing of one of the Senate's own, our long-time staffer and \nformer colleague, Shawn Bentley.\n  What can you say about a 41-year-old man who died: That he was \nbrilliant and talented; that he was a loving family man, a wonderful \nfather to Katie and Samantha, and a devoted husband to his wife, Becky; \nThat he loved James Joyce and William Shakespeare and Elton John; and \nthe law; and the Senate; and life.\n  Shawn worked for the Judiciary Committee for a decade, from 1993 to \n2003. Starting as my counsel, in the minority, Shawn worked on a \nvariety of legal issues, from healthcare antitrust, to radiation \ncompensation, to the balanced budget amendment. He rose through the \nranks, ending his Senate tenure as the majority's chief intellectual \nproperty counsel and deputy chief counsel to the committee, one of the \ntop jobs in the Senate.\n  Although we were sad to see him leave the Senate, I was so proud of \nhim when he joined Time Warner as vice president of intellectual \nproperty and global public policy.\n  In the Senate, the major bills Shawn helped write are among the most \nimportant laws in the intellectual property world: the Satellite Home \nViewer Improvement Act; the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the \nAmerican Inventors Protection Act, the Patent Fee Integrity and \nInnovation Protection Act, the Anti-Counterfeiting Consumer Protection \nAct, and the Trademark Dilution Act, just to name a few.\n  Shawn was so bright and so accomplished a lawyer, that we did not \nhesitate to assign him any subject. And it was such a joy to work with \nhim, because all knew he was a model of decency, humility, and \nspirituality. As the Elders' Quorum President of his church \ncongregation, and man of remarkably strong faith, Shawn lived a life of \nservice to his fellow man and woman. In whatever he did, Shawn handled \nthe matter with both talent and a remarkable good humor.\n  In all the years that Shawn worked for me, I cannot recall one time \nwhen he was not warm and engaging. Even when he was a little \nfrustrated, as all of us are sometimes, Shawn still had a smile on his \nface. In fact, Shawn had a calmness about him that was almost serene. \nYet, he had a very sharp sense of humor that made him a delight to be \naround.\n  Shawn was among the brightest and most informed. Yet, he was never \narrogant, a rare quality in one so talented, especially on Capitol \nHill!\n  Shawn was more than the chief intellectual property counsel to the \nJudiciary Committee, he was our in-house professor of arts and \nhumanities. Visiting Shawn's office was not like visiting a typical \ncounsel's office on the Hill. Visiting Shawn was more like visiting \nyour favorite classics professor at his desk with his exquisite \nfountain pen in hand.\n  To be fair, Shawn's lair in the Hart Building had the requisite \ncongressional directories, codes and public laws. But he also had a \nvast book collection of classics, poetry, Shakespeare anthologies, \nfirst edition novels, and British history books. And did I mention the \nminiature busts of philosophers and great thinkers?\n  Then, there was the collection of CDs ranging from Creed and \nMetallica to Beethoven to Brahms to Mozart and Bach. While his book \ncollection in the office was impressive, we knew there had to be a much \nmore extensive collection at home.\n  Pressed about his office supply of nonlegal books, Shawn admitted \nthat it was growing because his wife Becky had imposed a moratorium on \nbringing any more books to their home, so the overflow ended up in the \noffice. When Shawn found out that a colleague lived near the used book \nstore in Bethesda where he often located some treasures, he enlisted \nher to pick us some volumes from time to time, thus saving him the trip \nand the explanation of a voyage to Bethesda. That was probably Shawn's \nclosest thing to a vice: sneaking a volume of poetry into his \ncollection.\n  Shawn was the only heavy metal enthusiast I know who also loved to \nread Shakespeare and could discuss both topics with equal enthusiasm \nand knowledge. Indeed, it was this respect for the importance of \ncreativity in helping shape culture that may have attracted Shawn to \nIP--intellectual property--law and policy. He helped me with so many \nimportant IP issues, many of which I listed before, it is hard to \nsingle out Shawn's most important work.\n  One event does stand out in my mind. In 2000, as chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, I scheduled a hearing on peer-to-peer copyright \ninfringement. Shawn arranged to have witnesses from Metallica, Lars \nUlrich, the Recording Industry Association of America, and several \nInternet company executives testify on the same panel. To demonstrate \nhow P-2-P services worked, Shawn suggested I download from the Internet \nthe rock band Creed's then-hit ``With Arms Wide Open.''\n\n  Just then, the bells rang for a vote and committee members started to\n\n[[Page S11202]]\n\nleave. I'll never forget looking back as I left Hart 216 and seeing the \nalmost surreal scene of Senators mixing with media and staff, talking \nto Internet pirates and heavy metal band rock stars with rock music \nplaying in the background. It was a scene that only Shawn could have \npulled off.\n  Shawn did all this--he succeeded at all he undertook--without \nboasting or calling attention to himself. He knew there were more \nimportant things in life than a battle of wills and, as a result, he \nwon the respect and trust of people on both sides of the aisle.\n  There is not one person on the Hill or in business who would call \nShawn an adversary or enemy. Those who worked with Shawn learned a lot \nmore from him than the other way around.\n  Two other fond memories of Shawn from early in his career come to \nmind. When the Senate was debating the constitutional amendment for a \nbalanced budget, the BBA, I asked Shawn to develop some materials \nsupporting the need for the amendment.\n  With customary good staffing, Shawn put together a very impressive \nset of volumes which he drove out to my home the weekend before the \ndebate. I was astounded by the depth, and to be truthful, the volume of \nthe materials. ``Shawn,'' I said, ``I'm just overwhelmed by the amount \nof material you developed. You didn't need to do all that.'' Shawn \nthought a moment, paused, and said, ``With all due respect, Senator, \ncould you have told me that yesterday?'' That was the wit of Shawn \nBentley. Quickly recovering, I replied, ``Shawn, I don't need all those \nmaterials if I have you sitting by my side. That's good enough.''\n  And I meant it. I could always count on Shawn to be well-prepared, \nsuccinct, and oh-so-witty. But Shawn was Shawn. So, then we got to the \nfloor with the BBA.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I was managing this \nconstitutional amendment's debate on the floor with Shawn right there \nbeside me. One of the most contentious issues was over how the \namendment would affect the Social Security fund.\n  Senator Fritz Hollings, then the junior Senator from South Carolina, \nfor some 40 years I might add, was recognized by the Chair to speak in \nopposition. Knowing his remarks were long, I took that opportunity to \ngo to the cloakroom and make a phone call. I asked Shawn and another \ncapable staffer, Larry Block, to please take notes and write down five \npoints to respond to Senator Hollings.\n  The trouble was that with his deep South Carolinian accent, neither \nShawn nor Larry had absolutely any idea what Senator Hollings said. \nAfter about five minutes, my two staffers were getting pretty nervous \non the floor anticipating my return. Suddenly, Shawn gave a big smile. \n``I've got it,'' he said. ``All we need to do is write down five points \nsupporting the BBA and why its enactment would not have a negative \nimpact on Social Security.''\n  I soon returned and read the talking points, adding several points of \nmy own. All went well. Only later did I realize what Shawn had \nintuitively grasped. If we could not understand Senator Hollings, no \none else could either!\n  The moral of this story: As President Andrew Jackson opined many \nyears ago, ``Take time to deliberate, but when the time for action \narrives, stop thinking and go in.''\n  Shawn was probably one of the most deliberate lawyers ever to have \nworked on the Judiciary Committee. On Capitol Hill, where the emphasis \ntoo often seems to be on getting there first, Shawn's primary concern \nwas always getting it right first. I could count on him to have the \nright answer to my questions, and if he did not know the answer, he \nwouldn't guess--he would do the work and get it right and then make his \nrecommendation to me.\n  I cannot say enough good things about Shawn Bentley. Indeed, his loss \nis a loss to the Senate family, to his family, and indeed the Nation.\n  As we head into this season of Autumn, as the leaves change colors \nand the temperature turns, some verses from Ecclesiastes 3 seem so \nappropriate:\n\n     There is a time for everything,\n     And a season for every activity under heaven:\n     A time to be born and a time to die,\n     A time to plant and a time to uproot,\n     A time to tear down and a time to build,\n     A time to weep and a time to laugh,\n     A time to mourn and a time to dance,\n     A time to embrace and a time to refrain,\n     A time to search and a time to give up,\n     A time to tear and a time to mend,\n     A time to be silent and a time to speak, and\n     A time to love and a time to hate.\n\n  Let us take comfort in those words, knowing that it was God's will \nthat this be Shawn Bentley's time. But we can still rejoice in his \nlife, and embrace all that was good about Shawn Bentley, the son, \nhusband, father and friend we all loved so dearly. And may his family \nfind comfort in the lasting memory of this great man, Shawn Marion \nBentley, who indeed lived his life by the words of ``With Arms Wide \nOpen'':\n\n     ``If I had just one wish\n     Only one demand\n     I hope he understands\n     That he can take his life\n     And hold it by the hand\n     And he can greet the world\n     With arms wide open . . .''\n\n  Shawn Bentley's untimely passing is this Nation's loss.\n\n  On behalf of the Senate, let me say that our hearts go out to the \nBentley family--to his loving wife Becky, their beautiful daughters \nKatie and Samantha, his parents DeAnna and Marion, and his five \nbrothers Jared, Derek, Justin, Christopher and Gavin.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah and I are here to \ntalk about something where somebody's schedule has been terribly \nchanged, the schedule of his whole family. I am talking about Shawn \nBentley and how all of us who knew him are offering our deepest \nsympathy for him.\n  Certain people on the Senate Judiciary Committee are like family, and \nShawn had most Senators and staff among his many friends. He was \nextremely well liked on both sides of the aisle, both for who he was \nand for what he did.\n  In his decade as a senior intellectual property counsel to my friend \nfrom Utah, Senator Hatch, he touched every significant piece of \nlegislation that we undertook: The Satellite Home Viewer Act, the \nDigital Millennium Copyright Act, the Federal Trademark Dilution Act. \nThose were the significant ones. There are a lot of others, important \nones, that he was intimately involved with. But he touched us not only \nwith his skill as a lawyer, his devotion as a public servant, his \ngenerosity as a colleague, but especially just his innate decency as a \nhuman being.\n  I know that he was a loving and devoted husband, father, and son. \nLeaving behind a young family makes it even more tragic. I hope his \nfamily, his young daughters who did not begin to get enough time to \nknow their father, will know that those of us in the Senate mourn his \nloss. It is a tragic one.\n  My wife Marcelle and I will keep him and his loved ones in our \nprayers.\n  I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Utah for arranging the \ntime for us to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am grateful to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Vermont for the kindness that he has shown here today and the \nfriendship that he has shown to me and to the family of Shawn Bentley. \nI am very grateful to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask the Senate focus on a matter of real \nurgency and real importance for the people I represent in Louisiana \nand, indeed, for all of the victims of Hurricane Katrina along the gulf \ncoast. We are dealing with so many new and enormously challenging \nsituations because of the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. One of them \nis the fact that in Louisiana and in certain counties in Mississippi, \nin the truly devastated areas, we have areas that have been knocked off \nthe map economically. There is truly no viable economic activity going \non in those about six parishes in Louisiana and about three counties in \nMississippi for the time being.\n  We will come back. Businesses will come back. Things will get back to \nnormal over time, but it will take some time. So one of the primary \nchallenges we have is absolutely no economic activity for now.\n  What does that mean? It means absolutely no local tax revenue for now \nto support local governmental entities, including crucial services such \nas fire and police and hospitals. This is an enormous and growing \nchallenge in southeast Louisiana as we speak. Literally, we have \ncrucial governmental entities that are trying to provide those very \nbasic services--not a full-blown local government, not their normal \nbudget as it was 3 months ago but those basic services, fire and police \nand hospitals, in order to form the basis of recovery. Because, indeed, \nif you do not have those essentials, you have nothing and no one will \nreturn; jobs and businesses cannot grow.\n  To help southeast Louisiana through this very torturous time, I have \nworked with the entire Louisiana congressional delegation to try to \nfashion some very focused relief to get funds through a loan program, \nwhich I will describe in a minute, to these local governmental entities \nso they can meet their core ongoing needs, their crucial emergency \nservices, crucial necessary services such as fire and police and \nhospitals over the next few months until we can stabilize.\n  I have been working for over a week on this, getting into the \ndetails, if you will, with the Senate leadership. Let me compliment the \nSenate leadership and the majority leader in particular for being so \nfocused on this issue, and working so hard on it, devoting significant \nstaff to it.\n  I have also worked very hard on this issue with the White House and \nthe administration, including the Office of Management and Budget. We \nhave worked through the numbers and worked through various calculations \nof what that specific need for local government and essential services \nmay be. I thank them and compliment them for that work.\n  I have also had significant discussions with the leadership of the \nHouse, and certainly House Members of the Louisiana delegation have \ndone the same. We have thought through, worked through, talked through \nall of these issues.\n  The product of all of that work is a proposed piece of legislation \nwhich I have circulated to all Members of the Senate. Under that \nproposed piece of legislation, we would offer some immediate help, \nwhich we need to do now, before we recess for next week, to allow these \nlocal governmental units to survive and provide the basic police, fire, \nhospital, and related services they need to continue to provide if \nthere will be any platform on which to build a full recovery.\n  I have circulated this proposed bill. It is a $750 million bill that \nwould work through an established loan program in the Department of \nHomeland Security. It is called the Community Disaster Loan Program. It \nhas gotten great support through the Senate. In fact, there has been no \nobjection on the majority side.\n  There is some objection on the minority side, but as yet, at least in \nterms of my knowledge, that objection has not been clearly identified \nor described to me or to anyone who can work out the problem and work \nout the objection.\n  Because of this enormously pressing need, because these units of \nlocal government are literally on the brink and can teeter either way \nwith their mandate to provide essential services--fire protection, \npolice protection, hospital access--I ask all Members of the Senate to \ngive me their indulgence and focus on this proposal, and if they have a \nquestion or an objection, simply to see me or other knowledgeable \nMembers about it as soon as possible. I will be here all night, as long \nas it takes. In fact, I will be presiding, starting in 7 minutes, for 2 \nhours. I will be happy to have conversations on the side with any \nMember who wants to pose questions or set forth any objections they may \nhave to the proposal. But I ask the focus and the indulgence of all \nMembers of the Senate to do just that, so we can come together in a \nbipartisan way and actually get something important and concrete done \nfor the true victims of Hurricane Katrina and begin to move on.\n  Again, this is a very time-sensitive matter so I urge Members who \nhave questions or objections to do this tonight so we can solve these \nproblems, pass the bill through the Senate, and make sure we pass this \nenormously vital and crucial legislation before the Congress leaves \nWashington, DC for the October recess.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. VITTER. I am happy to.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. If the Senator will yield for a question and comment, \nlet me thank my colleague from Louisiana for his extraordinary \nleadership on this issue. He has been in meetings all week, literally \nfor weeks, as I have, and on the phone with everybody you can talk to. \nOf course, the time he spent in the House in Louisiana has served him \nwell because he knows how much our needs are. But I want to ask him a \nfew questions because he and I are committed to stay tonight until we \nget some kind of resolution.\n  Is it the intention of the Senator, the junior Senator from \nLouisiana, that these loans be in the same line as the current \nlegislation, which gives discretion on the part of the administration \nto forgive them or not? Or is it the intention of the Senator for us to \nleave current law and absolutely make it certain, when no one else has \nbeen required to do so, that these loans would have to be repaid under \nall and every circumstance?\n  Mr. VITTER. Under the proposed legislation I am talking about, there \nis new language that would tighten up, if you will, the repayment \npossibilities of these specific loans. It would not change all of the \nStafford Act, in terms of this loan program in general. That new \nlanguage would simply apply to these specific loans.\n  That language is included in the proposed legislation for a very \nsimple reason, and that reason is that, based on literally dozens of \ndiscussions with various folks, including in the House, it is very \nclear to me, in fact it is crystal clear to me, this will not pass \ntonight or tomorrow through the process without this language in the \nlegislation.\n  Having said that, I have also gotten assurances from several people \nin the administration that they are very understanding of the \nextraordinary situation these local governments are in, in terms of \ntheir financial condition and their ability to pay, and they will be \nextremely open to working out that situation as it pertains to these \nliens over the period of the loans.\n  Personally--and I am only speaking for myself--I feel very \ncomfortable with those assurances. Personally--and again, I am only \nspeaking for myself--I am completely confident that without the \nlanguage you are alluding to, this legislation will not pass the House \neither tonight or tomorrow. So that is the sole reason, that focused \nlanguage\n\n[[Page S11204]]\n\nwhich applies only to these loans and does not change the Stafford Act \non this issue otherwise, in terms of other situations--that is the only \nreason that language was included.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I can appreciate that. If you don't mind me pursuing \nthat line of questioning. I can most certainly appreciate what the \njunior Senator is saying about the reluctance of the House of \nRepresentatives and the administration at this point because I have yet \nto receive any letter or assurance, but it is right now the House of \nRepresentatives that basically would be willing to make loans to the \ndevastated cities in the gulf coast, but would insist that those loans \nbe paid back, when not insisting on that for other loans that have been \ngiven to Puerto Rico, and to Florida, and to Alaska, and to other \nplaces, which were waived.\n  I understand the House of Representatives, while allowing others to \nborrow this money and then ask for forgiveness, would not allow \nLouisiana that same privilege. I understand the position of the Senator \nis that we be treated the same, as a first-class State, not a second-\nclass State. I know that is your position. But it does concern the \nsenior Senator that we would have to be dictated to by the House of \nRepresentatives, that we would have to be treated in some second-class \nfashion.\n  I am also appreciating that, while the administration has given you \nan assurance that they do not intend to treat us as second-class \ncitizens, I would feel better, before we left tonight, if we had \nsomething in writing from the administration that they think Louisiana \ndeserves the same treatment. For that reason, Louisiana, Mississippi, \nAlabama, and Texas--that we would deserve the same treatment as other \nStates.\n  That is why I am in a situation here where I want to commend you for \nthe compromise we have tried to reach today. It is, indeed, tempting. \nBut we are going to have to go home, if we do not get something from \nthis administration, and say we have agreed to a second-class status, \nand our people have been hurt and offended and left by a FEMA that is \nnot operating very well. That is my concern.\n  I know you and I agree about that, but do you want to go ahead and \nanswer?\n  Mr. VITTER. I will offer two further points of explanation. First, I \nhave been working to address these issues specifically with Members of \nthis body, including Senator Jeffords of Vermont, who had this specific \nconcern about any permanent and global change to the Stafford Act. We \nhave worked through that issue very constructively. I thank him for \nbringing that concern to me so we could work it out. I am asking all \nMembers who have a concern to do just that, to identify themselves, to \nbring their concern to me.\n  Second, I am very comfortable with all the assurances I have received \nfrom the administration.\n  If there is any different language that would apply to these loans, \nperhaps it is partly explained by the fact that the size of these loans \nis well beyond anything that has ever occurred in this loan program \nbefore. So we are truly breaking new ground in terms of the size and \nthe capacity that we are asking to be allowed to have access to because \nof the enormous need for this on the ground in the six devastated \nparishes in southeast Louisiana.\n  My final point is, it is very clear to me we either do this or we do \nnothing. One thing I am not in favor of is doing nothing. One thing I \nam not in favor of is giving speeches but going home with absolutely no \nconcrete help for these desperate units of local government which have \ndone heroes' work in terms of providing police and fire protection, \nhealth services, and hospital access. They need the help now. They \ncannot wait until 10 days or 2 weeks from now.\n  So given this is our situation, I believe this compromise is not only \nfair and just but absolutely essential that we strike today and \ntomorrow.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. If the Senator will yield, I can most certainly \nappreciate that perspective. I definitely agree it is extremely \nimportant to not just give speeches but to get something that is real \nfor our people. But because we have no written commitment from the \nadministration, and no resolution, and no letter, and no written \ncommitment from the House, no assurance, no resolution, no promise to \npass the legislation that you have presented and outlined, I am not \nsure even if you and I could manage--because there is not very much \ndisagreement between the two of us; but our colleagues have some \ndisagreements--if we could pass this legislation in the Senate that it \nis actually really going to do anything for people at home other than \nsay the Senate has come together.\n  It would not be the first time the Senate has come together, as the \nSenator knows, because this Senate is ready to pass emergency health \ncare legislation, and this Senate is ready to pass emergency education \nlegislation, and this Senate is ready to pass--and already has passed--\nhelp for small businesses. So it is not the Senate, as the junior \nSenator----\n  Mr. VITTER. Senator, I----\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Just 1 minute. Let me finish.\n  The Senate is not necessarily the problem. We have been amazingly \nbipartisan. Our committee chairs and ranking members, as the Senator \nknows, have done yeoman's work. And in the Small Business Committee \nthat you and I serve on, we have already passed that legislation. But \nthe senior Senator remains concerned that we still do not have any \nwritten assurance or a resolution or something we could take home to \nour mayors, et cetera.\n  Let me say one other point. I have read carefully the proposed \nlanguage about lending Louisiana and Mississippi and Texas this money, \nand then making us pay it back when no one else in the country has been \nforced to do that. I have read that language. I have also read the \nlanguage about who is eligible.\n  I ask the junior Senator, are you confident in the language--and I do \nnot have it in front of me, but I can call it up, not that it is \nfiled--that the sheriffs of Louisiana would be included in this \nproposed compromise? Is the Senator from Louisiana indicating that the \nsheriffs of our State are absolutely, positively included?\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes, I am completely confident of that.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. OK.\n  Mr. VITTER. If the Senator will yield?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Go right ahead.\n  Mr. VITTER. A couple points: I think this is a very useful exchange \nbecause I take it from the Senator's comments that the senior Senator \nis, in fact, one of the folks who has expressed an objection to this \nmoving forward tonight.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I have not yet expressed an objection, but I am \nconsidering it on the grounds--I am not yet expressing objection, but I \nam considering it, respectfully, having complimented the junior Senator \nfor the great work he has done, because I am hesitant to accept terms \nof aid that are applied only to us and to no one else, and not because \nthe junior Senator objects or other Senators, but because the House of \nRepresentatives, which is in control of the Republican leadership, has \ndecided that the only way that they will amend the law is to force us \nalone, uniquely, to have to agree to pay it back, when no one else in \nAmerica, in the past or the future, will be required to do so. That is \na hard thing for the senior Senator to agree to, but I am considering \nit, if maybe that is our only option.\n  But you can understand why I might be a little bit exercised about \nthe House of Representatives saying to people who are desperate--like \non the front page of the National Geographic--we know you are \nsuffering, we know you need help, there is no question you have no \nmoney to pay your bills, there is no question that we have lent other \npeople money and forgiven their loans, there is no question that this \nis the worst natural disaster in the history of the country--but the \nonly way we will compromise with you, Senator Landrieu and Senator \nVitter and Senator Frist and Senator Reid, is if your desperate people \npromise to pay the loan back. And, by the way, we are only making the \nlaw for you.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. If I could ask----\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Hold on. I will not yield at this moment. If someone--\n--\n  Mr. STEVENS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana controls the time.\n  Mr. VITTER. Reclaiming my time, I would wonder if the Senator objects \nto the fact that under this proposal we\n\n[[Page S11205]]\n\nwould also expand in terms of amount and number and capability the \nability to get these loans? We are getting more of these loans than \nanyone in any other situation would have gotten before. I wonder if the \nSenator would object to that change?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Can I answer that?\n  Mr. VITTER. No.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Can I answer that?\n  Mr. VITTER. Again, reclaiming my time, I would simply ask directly if \nthe Senator could either object or not object--let me know--and also \nhelp us identify any specific objections that may exist on the minority \nside.\n  But in closing, Mr. President, I would just say, again, it is very \nclear to me, having spent a week working on this, that we either do \nthis today and tomorrow or we do nothing and go home for 10 days and \ngive no relief to these communities and these parishes which so \ndesperately need the help. I vote for doing something. I vote for \nleading. I vote for helping in a meaningful and concrete way the people \nof southeast Louisiana and urge all my colleagues to please join me in \nthat effort.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there are discussions going on concerning \nthe future of this bill and what time we may be able to vote and \ndispose of the bill. I did try to go to third reading to make sure we \nwould not have amendments coming in here at the last minute that would \nrequire Members to come back into the Senate to vote at this time.\n  I want to state that I do not have any problem with the exchange \nbetween the Senators from Louisiana. They do have a very difficult \nproposition. I am not going to get into that at this time. But I will \nsay this: The arrangement that the junior Senator has made is much \nbetter than we got after the great earthquake in Alaska in 1964. I \nthink people ought to realize that while the numbers of people involved \nin this great disaster from Katrina and the disaster of Rita--we have \nhad massive disasters such as our earthquake and our great flood and \nthe typhoons in Hawaii. This is not something that is new. The number \nof people may be greater, but the type of disaster is not any greater.\n  I would hope we would have a chance to finish the conversations that \nthe leadership is having and we can find some way to deal with this \nsituation and let people know what time, and if, we are going to be \nallowed to vote on this very important bill that should go to \nconference before we go home.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with \nthe calling of the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/06/senate-section/article/S11205-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, OCTOBER 7, 2005\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, it has been a very long day. I am \nhoping, as this day continues into the evening hours, as we continue to \nwork on the underlying bill, which is the Defense appropriations bill, \nto have an amendment dealing with Hurricane Katrina in a way this \nCongress might respond to this urgent need. I thank the Senator from \nAlaska for his patience through this day because the issue that is \nbefore us really is not an amendment on the Defense bill. It is a \nseparate issue but needs to be handled before we leave, in my opinion.\n  That is why I have stayed here throughout the day and have been here, \nof course, throughout the week, in many meetings and phone calls, and \nnow in time on the floor throughout the day, to try to find a way to \nget some immediate help to our cities and parishes and counties along \nthe gulf coast. It looks like there is a possibility that still might \nbe the case.\n  But because of the lateness of the hour, really for the staff that \nhas been here so long, I am going to agree to continue to work through \nthe night, allow the staff to take a recess, and spend some time on \nthis, as I have throughout the last few hours, working with my \ncolleagues, particularly Senator Levin from Michigan, who has put in a \ntremendous amount of time, other Senators, Senator Carper from \nDelaware, Senator Clinton, Senator Durbin, Senator Reid. And Senator \nFrist has been here for a while. Of course, Senator Vitter was here \nearlier trying to get through this process, with the specific focus of \nmine being to try to get our State in the same situation that other \nStates have been put in when they needed help.\n  We are not quite there yet, but we may yet get there by the time we \nclose the debate in just a few hours. But, really, the staff has done \nmore than they should be asked, to stay this late.\n  We have tried four or five different compromises in the last 8 hours, \nand we are not quite there yet. But we may be there in the morning when \nthe Senate comes out of recess.\n  I am going to continue to work through the evening to see if we can \nfind some sort of solution so that our four States--Louisiana, \nMississippi, Alabama, and Texas--can be treated in the same way with \nthe same respect as other States have in disasters in the past.\n  I thank the Senator for his patience throughout the evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/06/senate-section/article/S11205-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11205-S11206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit to encourage employers to offer flexible and phased work \nopportunities to older workers, to expand the credit for dependent care \nexpenses to cover eldercare expenses, to extend COBRA coverage for \ncertain older workers who lose health insurance coverage due to a \nreduction in work, to improve older workers' access to job training \nservices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that will \ngreatly affect our Nation's aging population, workforce, and economy: \nthe need to expand opportunities for older Americans to continue \nworking into their later years if they so choose.\n  As older Americans live longer and healthier lives, many are planning \nto work longer. According to a recent survey, 80 percent of baby \nboomers expect to work past traditional retirement age. Some may \nrecognize the physical and mental benefits of work, while some may need \nthe additional income to remain financially secure. Whatever the reason \npeople decide to stay on the job, it's time to change the way our \nNation thinks about retirement. A one-size-fits-all retirement will no \nlonger match the very different plans that seniors and baby boomers \nhave for their later years.\n  Rethinking retirement is also vital to our Nation's economic future. \nBy 2030, businesses could face a labor force shortage of 35 million \nworkers, and the projected slowdown in labor force growth could \ntranslate into lower economic growth and living standards. However, we \ncan soften the potentially serious impact of these trends if we develop \npolicies that expand opportunities for older Americans to work longer.\n  Today, we are taking a first step by introducing The Older Worker \nOpportunity Act. This legislation addresses a variety of issues that \naffect older workers and employers: workplace flexibility, pensions, \nhealth insurance coverage, job training, and caregiving needs. Back in \nApril, as ranking member of the Aging Committee, I chaired a hearing on \nolder workers which identified barriers and disincentives to working \nlonger. This legislation specifically targets those.\n  First, today's workplace rarely offers flexible and part-time work \narrangements for older workers. Most older workers would choose to work \npast traditional retirement age, but would prefer to gradually \ntransition into retirement instead of fully retiring at a traditional \nretirement age.\n  To encourage employers to offer flexible and part-time work \narrangements, we propose a tax credit for employers that give their \nolder workers such opportunities while protecting them from the loss of \nhealth or pension benefits. Our aim is to encourage more workplace \nflexibility, which would benefit both older workers and employers \nthrough increased productivity and job retention.\n  Second, the bill provides an extra safety net for older workers who \nreduce their work but whose employers do not keep them on their health \nplan. In those cases, of course, the employer would not qualify for the \ntax credit we are offering. However, we would extend COBRA coverage \nfrom 18 to 36 months for their workers from the age of 62 until they \nare eligible for Medicare.\n  Third, one major reason why older workers exit the workforce is the \nneed to care for aging family members. Older workers who are also \ncaregivers often face a significant loss of earnings and retirement \nincome, and their employers lose up to $29 billion per year in lost \nwork time and productivity. To help older workers balance the demands \nof work and caregiving, and to help employers by increasing \nproductivity and reducing turnover costs, we propose expanding the \ndependent care credit to cover the care of chronically ill family \nmembers.\n  Fourth, as GAO has found, job training programs are often discouraged\n\n[[Page S11215]]\n\nfrom enrolling older workers because their effectiveness is measured in \npart by participants' earnings. Older workers tend to seek part-time \nwork and receive lower earnings when they get new jobs. As a result, \nolder workers do not have access to the training services they need to \ndevelop their technological skills and increase their productivity. We \npropose adjusting older workers' lower earnings when measuring the \nsuccess of job training programs in order to more accurately reflect \nthe value of job training programs to the older workforce. We also ask \nstates to collect more data on the success of our current job training \nprograms in meeting the unique needs of older workers.\n  Fifth, it is clear that the barriers this bill addresses are not the \nonly barriers facing older workers. This bill is just the beginning. \nTherefore, we propose a ``Task Force on Older Workers,'' composed of \nexperts from all relevant federal agencies, to further identify \nbarriers and disincentives in current law, and recommend solutions.\n  We face an historic challenge, and with it, an historic opportunity. \nWe need a 21st century workplace that is a win-win for both older \nworkers and their employers--and an effective strategy for retaining \nour competitive advantage against other countries facing the same \ndemographic tidal wave. We need to usher in a new age of work and \nretirement in which seniors are not limited to a choice between one or \nthe other. We need to empower seniors to make the continued \ncontributions we all know they can to our economy and our communities.\n  Many older Americans and employers have already begun to pave the \nway. More older Americans are willing and able to continue making a \ncontribution to the workplace and our economy, and more employers are \nbeginning to recognize the value of older workers. We must incorporate \nthis new mindset into our national culture, and develop policies that \nreflect this reality. Our seniors deserve it, and our economic future \nmay well depend on it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record, and that the attached letters of endorsement \nalso be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1826\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Herb Kohl,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: It is a privilege to support Senator \n     Kohl's proposed ``Older Worker Opportunity Act of 2005.'' As \n     an agency that has been providing employment services to \n     older workers for over 25 years, Interfaith Older Adult \n     Programs has first hand knowledge of the value of retaining \n     older workers in the workplace. As stated in the Act, our \n     country is facing a great labor shortage. Terry Ludeman, \n     Chief Economist for the State of Wisconsin, has estimated \n     that in our State by 2017 there will not be enough 18-year-\n     olds to replace workers turning 65.\n       The proposed tax credit would provide incentive to \n     encourage employers to offer more flexibility in the \n     workplace and encourage support for older individuals who \n     want to stay in the workforce longer. It will also allow \n     work/life balance that is a very important value to \n     individuals as they age.\n       Extended COBRA coverage would also be a great encouragement \n     to mature workers wanting to cut back but not leave the \n     workforce. Providing the extended COBRA might be just the \n     incentive a 62-year-old needs to continue working part time. \n     The extended COBRA could help employers and older workers \n     transition gradually to full retirement at a later age.\n       A tax credit for eldercare would be a wonderful benefit to \n     seniors that are balancing the responsibilities of work and \n     taking care of a non-dependent individual with significant \n     health issues. Employers will benefit from having employees \n     that are more productive because they are worrying less about \n     family responsibilities of direct caregiving.\n       Interfaith strongly supports the creation of a separate set \n     of performance measures for the older worker under the \n     Workforce Investment Act. Statistically, mature workers stay \n     with an employer longer than their younger co-workers, take \n     fewer sick days, and are less likely to have an on the job \n     injury. This results in increased productivity and decreased \n     cost to employers. Retention outcomes should actually be \n     enhanced because of the older workers' work ethic, the pride \n     they take in their work and their loyalty to their employer.\n       We are faced with the unique opportunity to expand the use \n     of the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) \n     through a strong attachment to the Older Worker Opportunity \n     Act.\n       A Federal Task Force on Older Workers could be very \n     helpful, especially one that would include private sector \n     employers, governmental agencies, older worker service \n     providers and older workers themselves.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carol Eschner,\n       Executive Director.\n     Patricia Delmenhorst,\n       Employment Services Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Goodwill Industries\n\n\n                              of Southeastern Wisconsin, Inc.,\n\n                                Milwaukee, WI, September 29, 2005.\n     Hon.

(Goodwill) is pleased to support your Older \n     Workers Act of 2005.\n       As you may know, Goodwill has a long history of supporting \n     and promoting older workers. Our designation as an ``Elder \n     Friendly Workplace'' with the Wisconsin Department of \n     Workforce Development, demonstrates our commitment to this \n     remarkable group of workers.\n       Goodwill, as a leader in the area of workforce development \n     and training, recognizes that the nation's workforce is about \n     to experience a major change. As the ``boomers'' move closer \n     to retirement, employers across the nation will need to find \n     creative ways to keep these individuals engaged. Your \n     proposed legislation offers many viable solutions that would \n     encourage both employers and older workers to continue their \n     relationship well past the customary retirement age.\n       Thank you for recognizing and supporting the tremendous \n     value of the older worker. Goodwill is pleased to support you \n     in this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John L. Miller,\n     President and C.E.O.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           AgeAdvantAge, Inc.,\n\n                                     Madison, WI, October 1, 2005.\n     Hon. Herb Kohl,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: AgeAdvantAge, Inc. would like to extend \n     our full support of your proposed legislation; The Older \n     Worker Opportunity Act of 2005.\n       AgeAdvantAge is an Area Agency on Aging overseeing the \n     provision of services funded by the Older Americans Act (OAA) \n     throughout southern and western Wisconsin. We welcome any \n     effort to improve the lives of older people, be it through \n     expansion of aging services, or the opportunity for those we \n     serve to achieve economic self-sufficiency through \n     employment.\n       We recognize with a rapidly aging population, efforts must \n     be made to keep America's older workers on the job. The \n     potential loss of workers, as Baby Boomers begin to retire, \n     has frightening implications for business, government and the \n     economy.\n       Keeping older workers employed is crucial to keeping \n     America strong and competitive in the global market. \n     Demographics show the older worker is the workforce of the \n     future, and we believe the experience, work ethic and \n     dedication to quality of the older worker, will have a \n     positive impact on business.\n       Government also needs older workers to remain employed and \n     contributing to the tax base, rather than become consumers of \n     public benefits and services. As an example, an older worker \n     who remains employed may also delay drawing Social Security \n     benefits, while at the same time continuing to contribute to \n     the fund through payroll withholdings.\n       We also know that older people who remain active, both \n     physically and mentally, live longer and healthier lives. \n     Healthier individuals are in less need of publicly funded \n     health care services. Older people who are employed are also \n     less likely to need assistance from other social service \n     programs such\n\n[[Page S11219]]\n\n     as meal programs, food pantries, subsidized housing, food \n     stamps, and energy assistance.\n       These programs are already faced with rising demand and \n     shrinking budgets, and extending employment for older \n     Americans can help delay, or at least reduce, the need for \n     these services.\n       With the many benefits of keeping the older worker employed \n     in mind, we would like to address each of the five key points \n     of your proposal;\n\n                          Employer Tax Credits\n\n       The Baby Boom generation will have a significant impact on \n     both the workforce and the workplace as they continue to age. \n     Employers will need to accommodate the unique needs of this \n     cohort, with a key issue being flexibility.\n       When an older worker leaves their job, they take with them \n     years of knowledge and experience. This sudden loss of \n     expertise negatively impacts an organization's productivity, \n     and therefore their bottom line. To prevent this, older \n     workers need to be offered incentives to remain in their \n     jobs.\n       Employers need to consider such concepts as flex time, job \n     sharing, compressed work weeks, telecommuting, part-time \n     employment with pro-rated benefits, and phased retirement. \n     Many of these new work modes can be implemented at little or \n     no cost to the employer. All of them will benefit the \n     employer through a skilled, experienced, and stable \n     workforce.\n       Using tax credits as an incentive to employers may bring \n     about change, if the credit is attractive, and comes with \n     minimal paperwork.\n       As further incentive to creating an ``older worker \n     friendly'' workplace, the tax credit should be based on the \n     number of flexible options an employer offers, and employers \n     who hire older workers should receive additional tax credits.\n\n                      Extension of COBRA Coverage\n\n       As you have noted, current COBRA law allows for only 18 \n     months of continued coverage if group policy coverage is lost \n     as the result of a reduction in hours. Under many other \n     circumstances, coverage can be extended to 36 months.\n       Older workers who are no longer able to work full-time, \n     typically due to health reasons, often opt for early \n     retirement at age 62. This results in a loss of insurance \n     benefits, and an increased reliance on publicly funded health \n     care systems.\n       Extending COBRA coverage until age 65 may accommodate an \n     older worker's need for both reduced hours and insurance, \n     thereby delaying their need for Social Security and publicly \n     funded heath care.\n\n                          Eldercare Tax Credit\n\n       Today, employees of any age are often times faced with \n     choosing between working and the needs of someone dependent \n     upon them for care. This is increasingly true for the older \n     worker.\n       Many older workers find they are not able to remain \n     productive at work because the demands of caretaking have \n     become so great. Often times they will leave their job to \n     devote their time to the care of another. At times, their \n     loss of productivity could result in their termination. In \n     either instance, their employer has lost the benefit of \n     their knowledge and experience, and they have lost the \n     many benefits of being engaged in gainful and meaningful \n     employment.\n       However, studies show older workers who receive assistance \n     with their caretaking responsibilities, can maintain their \n     productivity, and therefore remain employed. A tax credit to \n     help offset the cost for adult day care, in-home care or \n     respite, will help the older worker balance their life and \n     work needs.\n       Further, employers will increasingly be asked to provide \n     assistance for employees tending to the needs of another. \n     This legislation should consider extending the eldercare tax \n     credit to employers who offer adult day care subsidies or \n     services.\n\n              Access to The Workforce Investment Act (WIA)\n\n       As a provider of employment services to older adults, we \n     can attest to the fact that older job seekers are routinely \n     excluded from participation in programs funded by the WIA. \n     WIA service providers often view the older job seeker as a \n     potential threat to program performance, as they may only be \n     seeking part-time employment.\n       Though more than 60% of our current customers are between \n     the ages of 55 and 64, and seeking full-time employment with \n     benefits, a separate set of performance measures for older \n     job seekers, may alleviate WIA provider's fears, and result \n     in improved access to WIA services.\n       Performance measures in the WIA, particularly those \n     regarding full-time employment and earnings increase, need to \n     be modified for an older job seeker. Placement into \n     employment, whether full- or part-time, should be considered \n     a positive outcome, and the earnings increase measure should \n     be removed altogether.\n       This legislation should also consider an often overlooked \n     employment and training program serving older job seekers, \n     the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP). The \n     SCSEP is funded under Title V of the Older Americans Act of \n     1965 (OAA). Administered jointly by the Administration on \n     Aging (AoA) and the Department of Labor (DOL), this unique \n     program provides a lower-income, older adult with the \n     opportunity to learn new skills, and build the experience \n     necessary to transition into employment.\n       The SCSEP is unique from all other employment and training \n     programs in many respects. It serves only those aged 55 or \n     older. It provides paid training, intensive case management, \n     and supportive services to all eligible individuals. And, \n     training activities result in services that benefit the \n     general welfare of the community.\n       The SCSEP is also unique in that it takes a ``whole \n     person'' approach in providing assistance. As a SCSEP \n     operator. we understand that an older person often times has \n     needs other than, or in addition to, employment. Being \n     part of the aging network, we are able to link our \n     customers with the programs and services they need to \n     address non-employment issues.\n       Over the past decade, the SCSEP has experienced a shift in \n     the balance between aging services and employment services. \n     The AoA has admittedly distanced itself from administration \n     of the program, effectively yielding its authority to the \n     DOL. As a result, less value is placed on the community \n     service aspects of the program, the connection to the aging \n     network and aging services is almost nonexistent, and the \n     program has actually become less accessible to older job \n     seekers.\n       With the upcoming reauthorization of the Older Americans \n     Act, perhaps now is an opportune time to revisit the intended \n     purpose of the SCSEP and explore ways to strengthen its \n     services and expand its use. Because it is unique from other \n     programs funded under the OAA, and equally unique from the \n     WIA, perhaps the SCSEP is better placed among the unique \n     concepts described in the Older Worker Opportunity Act of \n     2005.\n\n                      Task Force on Older Workers\n\n       Finally, the creation of a task force to address the on-\n     going needs of the aging workforce will be vital in assisting \n     business and government in implementing the changes necessary \n     to keep older workers working.\n       A task force comprised not only of governmental units, but \n     also of business, service providers, and older workers \n     themselves, will prove a great asset as we face the \n     challenges and opportunities presented by an aging workforce, \n     and the need to keep them employed.\n       Senator Kohl, thank you for the opportunity to comment on, \n     and support The Older Worker Opportunity Act of 2005. We also \n     thank you for your support of the older worker as is \n     evidenced in this progressive and forward-thinking proposal.\n       If we can be of any further assistance, please do not \n     hesitate to call.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert Kellerman,\n       Executive Director.\n     Michael Krauss,\n       Older Worker Program Coordinator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Committee for Economic\n\n\n                                                  Development,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 28, 2005.\n     Hon. Herb Kohl,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: on behalf of the Committee for Economic \n     Development (CED), I commend you for your leadership in \n     addressing issues related to the aging of the American \n     workforce with your bill, the Older Worker Opportunity Act.\n       CED stated several years ago that expanding opportunities \n     for older workers would be crucial to continued prosperity. \n     Our 1999 policy statement, ``New Opportunities for Older \n     Workers,'' argued that demographic change would reduce the \n     growth of our labor force well below current rates, absent \n     significant changes in behavior and policy. We noted that \n     many workers retire totally and abruptly because they have no \n     viable option to continue working, perhaps at reduced hours \n     that would be more suitable and would provide a phased \n     beginning to retirement. We urged that the business sector \n     and the federal government change perceptions and attitudes, \n     and where necessary laws and rules, to make it easier and \n     more attractive for older workers to achieve a gradual rather \n     than an immediate retirement.\n       We are gratified to see that your bill would address many \n     of the problems that we identified in our 1999 statement. We \n     believe that your recommended changes in law would allow \n     workers to phase into retirement without the financial \n     penalties, in retirement income and health coverage, that now \n     can force people into unwilling retirement. With such an \n     improved incentive to work, our economy might suffer less of \n     a loss of labor-force growth, and might make the transition \n     to the retirement of the baby-boom generation more easily.\n       We appreciate your efforts on this important issue, and \n     stand ready to help in building public understanding of the \n     vital and growing role of older workers.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                Charles E.M. Kolb,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeMINT (for himself, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 1827. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe public disclosure of charges for certain hospital services and \ndrugs; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill that would \nrequire hospitals to disclose their charges for the most common \nprocedures and drugs.\n\n[[Page S11220]]\n\n  This bill recognizes that consumers seeking routine hospital services \nneed to know what they are paying so they can make educated decisions \nabout their own health care. This legislation aims to give Americans \nthat information in a user friendly format.\n  Specifically, the bill would require hospitals to regularly report to \nthe Secretary of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services the \namount they charge for the 25 most commonly performed inpatient \nprocedures, the 25 most common outpatient procedures, and the 50 most \nfrequently administered medications. The Department would then post \nthis information on the Internet for easy access.\n  Under the current system, patients often have no idea what they will \nbe charged until they receive a bill. This is a problem because \nhospital charges vary significantly based on facility and procedure. \nSome hospitals charge one-hundred and twenty dollars for a chest x-ray \nwhile others charge more than fifteen hundred. Uninsured patients and \nthose who pay with cash are often surprised with unexpected hospital \ncharges because there is no way for them to know what they will be \ncharged up front.\n  No other industry expects consumers to commit to buying before they \nknow the true cost. Patients should have access to price information \nbefore they commit to a procedure.\n  This bipartisan bill is good for the uninsured and for consumer \ndriven healthcare. Individuals cannot be expected to get comfortable \nmaking their own health care decisions unless they know how much they \nwill be expected to pay for different services.\n  I am grateful to Senators Richard Durbin and John Cornyn for joining \nme as original cosponsors of this bi-partisan legislation. I am also \npleased that Representatives Bob Inglis and Dan Lipinski have \nintroduced companion legislation in the House. They recognize that \ninformation is power, and this bill is an important step in empowering \nAmericans with the tools to be smart consumers. I urge my Senate \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1827\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve and \nsecure an adequate supply of influenza vaccine; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. Clinton. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce the \nInfluenza Vaccine Security Act with Senator Roberts.\n  In recent months, our public health professionals have been sounding \nthe alarm about the increasing incidence of avian influenza. Since \nDecember 2004, 70 cases of avian influenza have been confirmed in \nIndonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia--and 27 of these cases have \nbeen fatal. In countries across Asia and Europe, farmers have been \nculling their poultry stocks because of fears of infection.\n  Various agencies--from the Department of State to the Department of \nHealth and Human Services--have begun to mobilize in preparation for \nwhen--not if, but when--avian influenza hits our shores.\n  What is particularly worrisome to me, when thinking about our \nNation's ability to face the threat posed by pandemic or avian \ninfluenza, is the fact that we aren't even prepared to deal with the \nseasonal influenza epidemic that we face every year.\n  Last fall, we witnessed senior citizens lining up for hours to obtain \nflu vaccine, unscrupulous distributors attempting to sell scarce \nvaccine to the highest bidder, and millions of Americans delaying or \ndeferring necessary flu shots.\n  This wasn't the first time that our vaccine production and \ndistribution system has failed. Since 2000, our Nation has experienced \nthree shortages of influenza vaccine.\n  Fortunately, we had a relatively mild influenza season this past \nyear, but we cannot count on such luck to save us every time we have a \nflu vaccine shortage.\n  Approximately 36,000 Americans die of the flu each year, and these \ndeaths are largely preventable--we could stop them if we increased \nimmunizations, if we had a secure vaccine market, and if we made sure \nthat everyone understood the importance of vaccines.\n\n[[Page S11221]]\n\n  For several years now, I've been asking the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to undertake reforms to fix our flu vaccine supply \nproblems, and the legislation I'm introducing with Senator Roberts \ntoday provides a mechanism through which we can develop a stable supply \nand distribution system for our seasonal flu vaccine.\n  There is a great deal of risk involved with developing an annual flu \nvaccine. Because the dominant strain changes from year to year, \nmanufacturers must develop doses on an annual basis, without being able \nto store or resell any excess vaccine the following year. There's also \nno steady demand for a flu vaccine, largely because shortages have \nconfused so many of us as to when we should or shouldn't get \nvaccinated.\n\n  This legislation will help create a stable flu vaccine market for \nmanufacturers by increasing coordination between the public and private \nsectors, so that we can set targets and procedures for dealing with \nboth shortages and surpluses before they hit.\n  Stabilizing the vaccine market will also require increasing demand \nfor vaccination. This bill increases the funding for the CDC's \neducational initiatives, and sets up grants through which State and \nlocal health departments, in collaboration with health care \ninstitutions, insurance companies, and patient groups, can increase \nvaccination rates among all Americans, but, in particular, priority \npopulations.\n  Another major problem with our national influenza supply mechanisms \nis that we rely on production methods that haven't kept pace with our \nother biomedical advances. In order to make a vaccine, strains of \ninfluenza virus are cultivated in chicken eggs, a non-sterile \nenvironment. Many of the contamination problems we have seen with \nvaccine result when problems arise in this cultivation process.\n  Although we've got to rely on this technology for the time being, we \nneed to increase research into safer, faster, and more reliable methods \nof vaccine production. This legislation would provide the National \nInstitutes of Health with increased funding for research into \nalternative forms of vaccine development.\n  Of course, vaccine does us no good if it can't get to the people who \nneed it, and in last season's epidemic, we had problems matching \nexisting stocks of vaccine to the high priority populations, like \nsenior citizens, who were in need of vaccine. It took weeks before we \ncould determine how much vaccine was actually in communities, and where \nit was needed. We wasted lots of time and resources--valuable public \nhealth resources--in trying to track this vaccine.\n  This bill sets up a tracking system through which the CDC and State \nand local health departments can share the information they need to \nensure that high priority populations in all parts of the country will \nhave access to vaccine.\n  Improving our system for vaccine manufacture and distribution will \nnot only help us in the event of a pandemic, but will help us every \nwinter when senior citizens, children, and chronically ill individuals \nneed to get a flu shot to protect them from the virus.\n  I hope that the legislation Senator Roberts and I are introducing \ntoday will call attention to the immediate needs of our priority \npopulations, and I look forward to working with our colleagues in the \nSenate on both seasonal and pandemic prevention initiatives.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing the \nInfluenza Vaccine Security Act with Senator Clinton today because I \nbelieve this legislation is critical to strengthening our public health \npreparedness here in the U.S. The experiences of the flu vaccine \nshortage last year made us all aware that our system needs improvement. \nThis legislation takes a comprehensive approach to addressing the root \ncauses of seasonal flu vaccine shortages by creating stability in the \nU.S. vaccine market.\n  Our legislation requires the Department of Health and Human Services \nto set annual production targets for the flu vaccine, to stockpile up \nto 10 percent of the vaccine each year in the event of a shortage, and \nto create a vaccine buyback program to provide market guarantees for \nour vaccine manufacturers. This legislation also provides a much-needed \nframework for public health officials to track vaccines and provides \nincreased education and outreach about getting an annual flu vaccine.\n  I now want to turn to some of the provisions in this legislation that \ndeal with an issue I believe deserves our utmost attention: pandemic \ninfluenza. I think we can agree that we all learned a good lesson from \nHurricane Katrina: government at all levels must be prepared to deal \nwith a large-scale public health emergency. Unfortunately, our \ngovernment is not currently not prepared to deal with pandemic \ninfluenza. Our legislation seeks to address this by strengthening the \nunderlying public health infrastructure to heighten our ability to \nrespond to both seasonal and pandemic flu.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a member of both \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee and Senate Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions (HELP), I take the threat of an influenza pandemic very \nseriously. I view it as not only a public health concern, but a \nnational security concern. The timing for a large-scale worldwide \ninfluenza outbreak is ripe. Many experts believe the next flu pandemic \nwill come in the form of avian flu.\n  Unlike the seasonal flu, humans have no natural immunity to avian \nflu. A routine flu shot for more common influenza viruses won't protect \nagainst the deadly avian flu. The Department of Health and Human \nServices is working with vaccine manufacturers to develop a vaccine, \nbut it is unclear when and how many doses will be ready.\n  Other than a vaccine, the only defense against a new flu strain such \nas avian flu is an antiviral medication such as Tamiflu. Currently, the \nUnited States currently only has enough pills to treat less than one \npercent, or about 2.3 million people.\n  This is why experts believe the effects of avian flu in the U.S. and \naround the world could be devastating. Some have predicted the loss of \nlife could reach as high as 160-200 million. A pandemic might infect a \nthird of the U.S. population and cost more than $100 billion alone in \nmedical treatments. A pandemic of this sort could also have \ncatastrophic economic or social effects.\n  It is for these reasons I am pleased our legislation addresses some \nof the underlying public health infrastructure concerns that can help \nus effectively respond to pandemic flu. Our vaccine industry here in \nthe U.S. is extremely fragile and our manufacturers need the necessary \ntools to effectively produce and deliver vaccines in the event of \neither seasonal or pandemic flu. First and foremost, our legislation \nensures vaccine manufacturers and health care providers are not held \nliable in the event of a public health emergency involving pandemic \ninfluenza. Without this necessary liability protection, the ability to \ndevelop or deliver a vaccine during an outbreak could be significantly \nhampered.\n  Our legislation also encourages improved technologies for influenza \nvaccine development by providing additional funding for NIH research \ninto alternative methods of vaccine development, such as cell-based \ncultures and a permanent flu vaccine. Currently, flu vaccine production \nis a strenuous process and takes several months, leaving us extremely \nvulnerable in the event of a large-scale outbreak and a subsequent need \nfor a mass production of vaccines.\n  Our legislation encourages more companies to enter the U.S. market \nwith domestic-based production facilities and to improve the ability of \nthe current manufacturers to remain in the market. Manufacturers \ncurrently do not have the capacity to simultaneously produce enough flu \nvaccine for seasonal flu and an avian flu vaccine in the event of an \noutbreak. We must assist our manufacturers in increasing production \ncapacity.\n  Aside from vaccines, our legislation also requires the government to \npurchase and store additional antiviral medications, such as Tamiflu, \nto protect against an influenza epidemic.\n  Finally, our legislation provides a framework to identify public \nhealth professionals that can provide services in the event of a public \nhealth emergency through the use of a medical personnel registry linked \nat the Federal, State and local levels.\n\n[[Page S11222]]\n\n  I am pleased to introduce the Influenza Vaccine Security Act with \nSenator Clinton today. We need to fix our seasonal flu vaccine \nproduction and distribution problems not only to prevent future \nshortages, but also to strengthen our public health infrastructure in \ncase of pandemic.\n  As Senator Clinton knows, the HELP Committee will soon be considering \nlegislation to develop countermeasures to protect the U.S. from \ndeliberate and natural public health threats. This legislation, known \nas Bioshield II, will present a great opportunity to build on the first \nsteps we take in this legislation to protect against pandemic flu. I \nlook forward to working with Senator Clinton and my other colleagues on \nthe committee to deliver a comprehensive package to ensure we are \nprepared and can respond to all types of public health threats.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman) (by request):\n  S. 1829. A bill to repeal certain sections of the Act of May 26, \n1936, pertaining to the Virgin Islands; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Akaka) (by \n        request):\n  S. 1830. A bill to amend the Compact of Free Association Amendments \nAct of 2003, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman) (by request):\n  S. 1831. A bill to convey certain submerged land to the Commonwealth \nof the Northern Mariana Islands, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I join my colleague, the Ranking \nmember of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Senator \nBingaman, in introducing three bills, by request, to make necessary \nchanges to law regarding the U.S.-affiliated islands.\n  Briefly, the bills include: First, legislation requested by the \nAttorney General of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands \n(CNMI). This bill accomplishes two objectives--to provide the \nCommonwealth with the same ownership and jurisdiction over offshore \nsubmerged lands as has been provided to other United States territories \nand to provide a less formal mechanism for the Governor of the CNMI to \nraise issues with the Federal Government than the procedures under \nsection 902 of the Covenant that established the Commonwealth in \npolitical union with the United States.\n  The legislation also provides a general authorization for the \nCommonwealth to raise issues arising under provisions of the Covenant \nwith the Secretary and for the Secretary to resolve those issues with \nassistance from other agencies as appropriate. This would provide a \nless formal approach than the more elaborate procedures for issue \nresolution set forth under section 902 of the Covenant which require, \namong other items, the formal appointment of negotiators. Section 902 \nis unique to the Commonwealth and legislative approval of a less formal \napproach may serve to improve Federal-commonwealth relations and the \nability of both sides to reach agreements. As with the submerged lands \nissue, further legislation may be required, but such legislation will \nlikely be easier to achieve if both sides are not either tied up in the \nprocesses of 902 or at opposite sides in court.\n  The second bill, requested by the House Delegate from the United \nStates Virgin Islands, Representative Donna M. Christensen, came as a \nresult of Federal court rulings which invalidated many of the Real \nProperty tax provisions of the Virgin Islands Code. The bill would \nrepeal sections l401-l401e of Title 48, of the United States Code to \nprovide the Government of the United States Virgin Islands the ability \nto fully regulate real property tax matters in the territory.\n  Finally, the last bill would make several changes to the Compact of \nFree Association Amendments Act (CFAAA) of 2003 P.L. 108-188, which was \nenacted in December, 2003. Because of the 2003 deadline on the term of \nthe original Compact assistance, several issues were left unresolved. \nOne of these unresolved issues was whether the Republic of the Marshall \nIslands (RMI) and the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) would \ncontinue to receive disaster assistance from FEMA. Since the passage of \nP.L. 108-188, the Administration has transmitted language to Congress \nthat would provide authority for the RMI and FSM to obtain disaster \nassistance. In addition to this new authority, the bill makes several \ntechnical changes to P.L. 108-188\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues, the Administration, and \nofficials from the RMI, FSM, and the U.S. Virgin Islands to move these \nbills through the process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1829\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I join my colleague and the \nchairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Senator \nDomenici, in introducing three bills, by request, to make necessary \nchanges to law regarding the U.S.-affiliated islands. As chairman and \nranking minority member of this committee, Senator Domenici and I have \na special responsibility for matters relating to our fellow U.S. \ncitizens who live in the territories of the United States. While the \npeople\n\n[[Page S11224]]\n\nof the territories are U.S. citizen or nationals, they lack full voting \nrepresentation in the U.S. Congress. Their problems and concerns are \njust as deserving of attention as are those of U.S. citizens who live \nin the 50 States, and it is the committee on Energy and Natural \nResources which has the responsibility for considering island issues \nthat are brought to our attention, and for making recommendations, as \nappropriate, to the full Senate.\n  The committee is also responsible for authorization and oversight of \nU.S. financial assistance to the freely associated states of the \nRepublic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic \nof the Marshall Islands--three sovereign nations that were formerly \nadministered by the U.S. as districts of the United Nations Trust \nTerritory of the Pacific Islands. While not under U.S. sovereignty, \nthese nations enjoy a unique relationship with the U.S. which developed \nfollowing the Pacific battles of World War II and which continues to be \nbased on our mutual interest in security, democracy, and economic \ndevelopment.\n  The first bill being introduced, the Compacts of Free Association \nAmendments Act of 2005, would make several changes to the Compact of \nFree Association Amendments Act, CFAAA, of 2003, (Public Law 108-188) \nwhich was enacted in December 2003. That law continued the close \nrelationships that were established in 1986 between the U.S. and the \nFederated States of Micronesia, FSM, and between the U.S. and the \nRepublic of the Marshall Islands, RMI by revising and extending U.S. \nfinancial and program assistance until 2023. Final consensus was not \nreached in 2003, however, on continuation of U.S. disaster assistance \nprograms and services to the FSM and RMI. Instead, section 105(f)(1)(A) \nof the CFAAA directed the Secretary of State, in consultation with \nFEMA, to negotiate disaster assistance agreements with the FSM and RMI, \nreport to Congress on the outcome of the negotiations, and make \nrecommendations to Congress on any necessary changes to law.\n  On August 19, 2004, the State Department transmitted new agreements \nregarding disaster assistance to Congress along with the legislative \nlanguage needed to bring them into effect. Generally, these agreements \nprovide that FEMA and USAID will jointly consult on disaster damage \nassessments and on disaster declaration recommendations; FEMA will \nprovide all disaster recovery funding consistent with past policy and \npractice and transfer those funds to USAID which will then administer \nall disaster response and recovery activities. In addition to approving \nthese new disaster assistance agreements, this bill would make several \nother conforming, clarifying, and technical amendments to the CFAAA of \n2003. The second bill being introduced today would convey submerged \nlands, out to 3 miles, to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \nIslands, CNMI, and hopefully resolve a long standing dispute between \nthe U.S. and the CNMI over the extent of the CNMI's territorial limit.\n  The CNMI became a U.S. territory in 1976 pursuant to the covenant \nbetween the U.S. and CNMI, as approved by Public Law 94-241. However, \ninterpretation of the covenant regarding the CNMI's territorial limit \ncame into dispute, and then became the subject of discussions under the \nformal government-to-government consultation procedures of the \ncovenant. The U.S. executive branch took the position that the CNMI had \nthe same territorial limit as the other territories--that is 3 miles--\nwhile the CNMI claimed a 200-mile exclusive economic zone. After \ndiscussions deadlocked, the CNMI pursued their claim in Federal court. \nEarlier this year, the Federal Appeals court upheld, in Northern \nMariana Islands v. United States, 399 F. 3d 1057, the district court \ndecision that the CNMI not only did not have 200-mile jurisdiction but \ndid not have a 3-mile limit either. Establishing Federal ownership up \nto the mean high-water mark has compromised local authority to manage \nactivities in the near-shore areas, such as shoreline permitting \nactivities that are normally handled by State and local authorities. \nThe District Court is allowing the local government to continue to \nexercise near-shore jurisdiction temporarily.\n  On June 6, 2005, the attorney general of the CNMI wrote to Chairman \nDomenici and myself requesting that legislation be enacted to establish \na 3-mile territorial limit for the CNMI--the same distance granted the \nother territories. This bill would grant the CNMI's request without \nprejudice to their right to further appeal their claim, and would allow \nthe local government to continue management of near-shore areas.\n  A second provision in this bill, also requested by the attorney \ngeneral of the CNMI, would support an alternative process for the \nresolution of disputes between the U.S. and the CNMI. As mentioned \nabove, there is an existing, but very formal, consultation process \nestablished under the covenant which requires the President and the \nGovernor to designate official representatives to hold formal meetings. \nThese procedures have generally been ineffective because their \nformality makes compromise difficult, particularly for those \nrepresenting the CNMI. This proposed provision would offer a less \nformal alternative by indicating that Congress expects the Secretary of \nthe Interior to take initial responsibility for seeking to resolve \ndisputes. It would encourage the Secretary, in consultation with the \nother agencies involved, to settle any claim arising under the \ncovenant, and it authorizes appropriations for any settlement. It would \nalso allow the Secretary to use other funds that may have been \nappropriated under the covenant for the settlement of a dispute, if \nagreed to by the CNMI. For example, article VII of the covenant \nprovides annual direct spending for capital construction projects. \nDisputes that may arise and be addressed under this new less-formal \nprocess include those relating to leases of land for defense purposes, \nconstruction of infrastructure, eligibility for Federal programs, or \npayments due the CNMI.\n  The third bill being introduced today is requested by the delegate \nfrom the United States Virgin Islands, USVI, Donna Christensen, on \nbehalf of herself and the Governor of the USVI. This bill would repeal \nsections of the United States Code that were enacted in 1936 to \ndetermine how real property taxes would be assessed in the USVI. These \nsections were thought to have been effectively repealed in 1954 with \nenactment of the Virgin Islands Organic Act--a law that substantially \nexpanded the scope of local self-government. Last year, however, the \nThird Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the 1936 law remains in \neffect. The court ruling has, therefore, effectively overturned 50 \nyears of local tax law. The simple solution to this situation, which \nthis bill proposes, is to repeal the 1936 provisions as soon as \npossible. This approach is consistent with the intent of the 1954 law, \nand it is consistent with our general Federal territorial policy of \ndelegating local real property tax policy to the local government.\n  Consideration of these bills is important to meeting our Nation's \nresponsibilities to the governments and residents of the islands. I \nlook forward to working with Chairman Domenici, the representatives of \nthe island governments, the administration, and the other members of \nthe committee in considering these bills and reporting our \nrecommendations to the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. Coburn):\n  S. 1832. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to lease \noil and gas resources underlying Fort Reno, Oklahoma, to establish the \nFort Reno Management Fund, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I proudly rise to introduce the \n``Fort Reno Mineral Leasing Act''.\n  Fort Reno was established as a frontier cavalry post in 1874, and it \nplayed a key role in the settlement of the west. It is a historic site \nof National significance and it is listed on the National Register of \nHistoric places. Over 9,000 visitors view the fort each year.\n  In 1948 the U.S. Army turned its lands and buildings, at Fort Reno, \nover to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Today, the original site \nremains intact as a complete frontier post. Dozens of buildings \nconstructed by the military, as early as the 1880's, still stand around \nthe Historic District.\n\n[[Page S11225]]\n\n  The Agricultural Research Service administers the fort site which \nincludes the Grazinglands Research Facility, the Fort Reno Historic \nDistrict, and the Fort Reno Science Park.\n  Many of the historic buildings are in desperate need of restoration. \nA small agency like the Agricultural Research Service is not \nfinancially able to keep up with the continued costs of maintenance of \nso much aged infrastructure. Independent studies show that over $18 \nmillion is now needed to restore the most important of the many old \nofficers' quarters and other key buildings.\n  I have been an active supporter of Fort Reno and its facilities. For \ninstance, several years ago I helped secure a Save America's Treasures \nGrant of $300,000 to assist a local historical organization with the \ncosts of stabilization of exteriors on those deteriorating buildings \nthat are most in need of renovation. In fiscal year 2004, I arranged \nfor an appropriation of $2.1 million for construction of two \ngreenhouses for use in research on forage grasses that is conducted by \nthe Agricultural Research Service at the Fort Reno site.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will provide a revenue-\nneutral, non-appropriated source of funding which will be adequate to \nrestore the historical buildings of Fort Reno, so that they will be \nhere for future generations.\n  In addition, this bill authorizes the development of the oil and gas \nthat lies beneath Fort Reno's 6,737 acres and places those funds in a \nspecial account in the U.S. Treasury that will be utilized for \nrestoration and maintenance of those facilities. These funds will also \nbe used to assist with handling visitors to the fort, historic \ninterpretation and related activities. The remaining funds will be used \nto pay down the national debt.\n  The Fort Reno Mineral Leasing Act is fully supported by State \nlegislators, local municipalities, the Chamber of Commerce, farm \ngroups, the USDA, and the ARS Administrator at Fort Reno.\n  I look forward to seeing this Oklahoma-specific legislation enacted \nand am proud to have Senator Coburn as my original cosponsor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                              City of El Reno,\n\n                                  El Reno, OK, September 29, 2005.\n     Hon. James Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: As you know, the citizens of the City of El \n     Reno and others from across Oklahoma have long maintained a \n     strong interest in restoring the military buildings and other \n     historic features at Fort Reno. Fort Reno serves as a focal \n     point for many of this community's cultural and historical \n     events, and it is visited by thousands of tourists each year.\n       As vital as Fort Reno is to our community and the State of \n     Oklahoma, it has much more potential as a national historic \n     site. That potential cannot be realized until the historic \n     buildings are restored. Cost to restore this site will be \n     considerable. Not restoring this site will cause Americans to \n     lose a significant piece of our nation's history. When you \n     consider the importance of saving this site for generations \n     to come, the cost is insignificant by comparison.\n       The citizens of El Reno are thankful that you have \n     graciously agreed to consider drafting legislation that would \n     provide financial support for restoration and maintenance of \n     Fort Reno's aged buildings. You are to be commended for \n     acknowledging it is our responsibility to preserve our past \n     for future generations. I sincerely appreciate your respect \n     for our past and vision for our future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Debbie Harrison,\n     Vice Mayor, City of El Reno.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  City of El Reno,\n\n\n                                   Office of the City Manager,\n\n                                  El Reno, OK, September 29, 2005.\n     Hon. Jim Inhofe,\n     Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The purpose of this letter is to express my \n     appreciation for your efforts on behalf of the citizens of \n     the City of El Reno, particularly as relates to restoration \n     of historic buildings at Fort Reno. We are grateful that you \n     assisted with the Save America's Treasures grant that \n     recently allowed work to begin on restoration of one of the \n     Fort's officers quarters, built before 1890. Fort Reno is one \n     of our city's most important resources, and we have long \n     looked forward to seeing it restored to its former glory.\n       We understand that you intend to introduce legislation that \n     could allow more progress to be made toward complete \n     restoration and future maintenance of the Fort's buildings \n     and other historical assets. I urge you to do so. The \n     benefits will be considerable, not only for the people of \n     this city, but for the state of Oklahoma and the Nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Douglas D.

James Inhofe,\n     Russel1 Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe. On behalf of my constituents and all \n     citizens of Oklahoma, I wish to thank you for assisting with \n     efforts to obtain funding for restoration of historic \n     buildings at Fort Reno. When they learn of it, many people in \n     my district will be grateful for your support. I and others \n     in the Legislature have worked hard to assist those who \n     operate the Fort Reno Visitors Center, but the level of \n     funding required to rescue and maintain these old structures \n     and other historical resources at the Fort is beyond our \n     abilities.\n       Restoration and continued maintenance of the Fort's \n     buildings are of critical importance to all Oklahomans. Fort \n     Reno is a primary historic site in our area, and it attracts \n     over 9,000 visitors annually. It has great potential for \n     tourism and economic development, and that potential cannot \n     be realized until it is properly restored. I admire and \n     appreciate your willingness to introduce legislation that \n     will insure that Fort Reno's historic buildings are preserved \n     and maintained for future generations of Oklahomans.\n       Please let me know if I can assist with this important \n     effort in any way.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Mike Johnson,\n     Oklahoma State Senate, District 22.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       El Reno Chamber of Commerce\n\n\n                                        and Development Corp.,\n\n                                  El Reno, OK, September 29, 2005.\n     Hon.

Fort Reno is the \n     principle historic site in our area and it attracts almost \n     10,000 visitors to our city annually; however, it is badly in \n     need of repair and maintenance.\n       As you know, the costs required to complete a restoration \n     project of this magnitude far exceeds the capabilities of any \n     state, local organization or entity. We appreciate your \n     willingness to assist us with legislation that will insure \n     that Fort Reno's historic buildings are preserved and \n     maintained, and made available for the benefit of both \n     Oklahomans and our out-of-state visitors.\n       Please let us know if there is anything we can do to help \n     with this effort by calling (405) 262-1188.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Karen Nix,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Oklahoma Farm Bureau,\n\n                               Oklahoma City, OK, October 4, 2005.\n     Hon. Jim Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: We appreciate your ongoing support for \n     the Ft. Reno Agricultural Research Service Station. As you \n     know, at one time the physical ARS facility had suffered from \n     neglect and the reorganization of ARS. Now the physical \n     facility is much improved, and the research staff are doing \n     great work. It is truly an operation in which many of us take \n     great pride.\n       I appreciate that you have an interest in helping the \n     citizens of Oklahoma to preserve the historical buildings of \n     Fort Reno. Funding is badly needed to restore and maintain \n     these buildings, many of which were built as early as the \n     1880s. I understand you are willing to introduce legislation \n     that will ensure that these historic buildings are not lost, \n     but are preserved and maintained and made available for \n     viewing and use by future generations of Oklahomans.\n       I understand the historic area of the Fort has a lot of \n     local support from the community, and that you support a \n     revenue-neutral approach to financing the restoration of Fort \n     Reno without increasing our tax burden. Our much missed state \n     board member, Henry Jo VonTungeln, was an active proponent of \n     using a revenue-neutral approach to funding the restoration \n     of the Fort.\n       Your willingness to carry legislation to implement this \n     approach is greatly appreciated. The success of the \n     legislation will mean a great deal to Oklahomans and \n     Americans, as well as the thousands of people who visit Fort \n     Reno each year.\n       Thank you for your consideration in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Steve Kouplen,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Oklahoma Farmers Union,\n\n                            Oklahoma City, OK, September 30, 2005.\n     Hon. James Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: On behalf of Oklahoma Farmers Union \n     and the 100,000 family\n\n[[Page S11226]]\n\n     farmers, ranchers and rural citizens our organization \n     represents, we appreciate your dedication to Oklahoma and \n     your current efforts to preserve, restore and maintain Fort \n     Reno here in the heart of our great state. This historical \n     location and buildings, built in the 1800s, remains an \n     attraction to thousands of Oklahomans and out-of-state \n     tourists each year.\n       Thank you for your interest, and more importantly, your \n     efforts to ensure much needed funding for this project. The \n     legislation you are currently working on in regards to Fort \n     Reno will ensure these buildings and this historic site will \n     not be lost, but instead will be available for generations to \n     come. We sincerely appreciate the revenue-neutral approach to \n     financing the restoration of Fort Reno, without increasing \n     our tax burden.\n       Again, thank you for your active role in preservation of \n     Fort Reno and all your efforts on behalf of our great state.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ray L. Wulf,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Sarbanes and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 1834. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development to make grants to States for affordable \nhousing for low-income persons, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, over the past several weeks, in the wake \nof two hurricanes, we have felt the heartbreak of Americans forced from \ntheir homes with no return in sight. Safe and affordable housing is not \nsomething we should take for granted.\n  Today I am introducing the Affordable Housing Preservation Act of \n2005. I am proud to be joined by my colleagues, Senators Paul Sarbanes \nand Mark Dayton. This bill provides federal matching funds for the \nacquisition and rehabilitation of existing federally-assisted or -\ninsured affordable housing properties that are in danger of being lost \nfrom the affordable housing inventory.\n  There is a great need for affordable housing. All across the country, \nhousing is becoming less attainable for more and more families. In my \nown State of Vermont, renting--let alone owning--a home is becoming \ndifficult if not impossible for many families. The minimum wage in \nVermont is seven dollars. However, a family must earn almost $28,000 in \nyearly income to afford a two-bedroom apartment, which requires a wage \nof over $13 per hour. For example, in Vermont, a two-bedroom apartment \ncosts about $698 per month, and a minimum wage earner can afford no \nmore than $364 for rent. This trend is not unique to Vermont. \nNationwide, the wage needed to afford a two-bedroom apartment is over \n$15 an hour. Approximately one-quarter of the U.S. earns less than $10 \nper hour. There are some communities where affordable housing was never \na concern before, but are now facing a shortage growing ever more \nsevere. I ask unanimous consent to have a chart compiled by the \nNational Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC), ``State Ranks Based on \nTwo Bedroom Housing Wage'', inserted in the Record. As my colleagues \nread this chart, I encourage them to refer to the NLIHC report issued \nlast year, ``Out of Reach'', for a more comprehensive overview of \nhousing prices and diminishing affordability. I found this report \nparticularly alarming and eye-opening.\n  There are several strategies to consider in combating the affordable \nhousing crisis. A comprehensive plan of economic and community \ndevelopment and revitalization--from public and private sector \nsources--is one strategy that has proved successful. Some of the \nincreasing need for affordable housing is met with the construction of \nnew units. But in many communities, a stock of affordable housing \nalready exists, and there is a desire among local leaders to preserve \nit. My bill helps States, localities, and other entities do just that.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the Affordable Housing Preservation \nAct of 2005, represents an effort to complement the good work being \ndone throughout the country on Section 8 initiatives, and it strives to \npreserve existing affordable housing. Specifically, this legislation \nwould conserve federally-subsidized housing units by providing matching \ngrants to states and localities, who then may work with other housing \nentities, seeking to preserve privately owned, affordable housing.\n  The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, would make \ndeterminations for the grants based on a number of factors, including \nthe number of affordable housing units at risk of being lost and the \nlocal market conditions in which displaced residents would have to find \ncomparable new housing options. States and localities could use the \nfunds to acquire or rehabilitate housing, which may be done by working \nwith established not-for-profit organizations that specialize in \nproviding affordable housing. They could use the funds, in part, for \nadministrative and operating expenses. Properties with mortgages \ninsured by HUD, Section 8 project-based assisted housing, and \nproperties that are being purchased by residents would all be eligible \nfor the matching grant funds. I believe that flexibility with the \nfunding would make this program more efficient and cost effective, and, \nmost importantly, more helpful to the recipients themselves.\n  What's more important to a family than a place to call home? \nAffordable, quality, and safe housing is the foundation, literally and \nfiguratively, that communities are built upon. As the Senate crafts a \ncomprehensive federal response to the housing crisis, including \nemergency housing assistance for those affected by the hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita, I am eager to work with my colleagues to integrate \nthe principles of housing preservation into affordable housing, \neconomic and community development and revitalization initiatives.\n\n              STATE RANKS BASED ON TWO BEDROOM HOUSING WAGE\n                     [Higher Rank = Less Affordable]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Housing\n                                                               wage for\n           Rank                          State               two bedroom\n                                                                 FRM\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n52.......................

A bill to provide for reconstruction, replacement, and \nimprovement of infrastructure in the Gulf Coast Region; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Gulf Coast \nInfrastructure Redevelopment and Recovery Act of 2005 on behalf of the \nminority side of the EPW Committee. We have introduced three bi-\npartisan bills to date in our committee's jurisdiction. One of them \neven passed the Senate last week. Those bills, which I would \ncharacterize as tweaks to existing authorities, were good first steps \nand are included in the package we introduce today.\n  But, we feel that the breadth and the magnitude of the damage after \nHurricane Katrina demands a more significant response. As I look at the \npictures of the damage in the areas hit hardest by Hurricane Katrina, I \nthink of the visitors from Terrebonne Parish that visited me in my \noffice to seek support for flood control projects in Louisiana. At the \ntime, I was struck by the vulnerability of this community to the \neffects of nature. Today, we are seeing those effects firsthand. I have \nthought\n\n[[Page S11227]]\n\noften in the past month of the strong spirit shown by those who visited \nmy office, and I know, that while it is almost unimaginable today, in a \nfew years, there will be thriving communities in Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama once again.\n  The bill I am introducing today is not intended to address every need \nof every person in the Katrina-affected area. It is a bill that seeks \nto take action for those agencies within the jurisdiction of the EPW \nCommittee to ensure that they have the authority and the direction they \nneed. I am a big believer in a single coordinated Federal disaster \nresponse process through the Stafford Act. Our bill complements the \nsingle, coordinated approach, yet recognizes the unique conditions in \nthis case.\n  FEMA has shown itself to be ineffective, in my opinion, largely due \nto the bureaucracy of the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA's \nlack of independence. At the time of the creation of DHS, I said: I \ncannot understand why, after years of frustration and failure, we would \njeopardize the Federal government's effective response to natural \ndisasters by dissolving FEMA into this monolithic Homeland Security \nDepartment. I fear that FEMA will no longer be able to adequately \nrespond to hurricanes, fires, floods, and earthquakes, begging the \nquestion, who will? (November 20, 2002)\n  Today, unfortunately, we know the answer--no one.\n  The Federal aid provided for Katrina must be coordinated in a wise, \ntargeted manner. To perform this task, our bill creates a Federal \ninfrastructure Task Force to make spending decisions and establish \nFederal investment standards.\n  There have been large storms before--in 1965 Hurricane Betsy hit \nalmost this same area. There will be large storms again. This bill \nrecognizes that and establishes National Preparedness Grants and \nseveral readiness studies to update emergency response plans, resolve \ninadequacies, and identify infrastructure vulnerabilities.\n\n  To speed economic recovery, the bill provides 200M to both the \nEconomic Development Administration and the Delta Regional Authority.\n  Part of the long-term recovery of the region will be the clean-up of \nthe environmental damage. Our bill provides direction to EPA to ensure \nthat adequate sampling is performed, that the public knows the results, \nthat drinking water and wastewater services are restored, and that \ncleanups are prioritized.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers has a lot of explaining to do after the \nlevee failure in New Orleans. The Corps also has a lot of clean up to \ndo and a lot of rebuilding to do. The flood control system in place \ntoday was built in the wake of the damage caused by Hurricane Betsy in \n1965. I believe it is critical that we fully evaluate the entire Corps \nprocess to determine what changes should be made. This bill takes only \na first step to be sure that we don't simply rebuild what was already \nin New Orleans without thinking. The bill requires the Corps to assess \nall projects in the area and repair or modify them with one \ncomprehensive approach.\n  We establish a National Levee Safety Program in this bill, similar to \nthe Dam Safety Program to be sure our nation's levees can be counted \non.\n  Finally, our bill allows communities that provide incentives for the \nuse of public transportation or ridesharing after a disaster to seek \nFederal reimbursement.\n  What doesn't our bill do? Our bill does not waive environmental \nstatutes. Since the Stafford Act was passed in 1974, there have been \nthousands of declared disasters. Never before have we faced a proposal \nto haphazardly waive environmental statutes across the Nation in the \nname of economic recovery in one devastated area. In the last few weeks \nseveral proposals have been introduced to give the President or EPA \nbroad waiver authority in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. These \nproposals put human health and the environment at risk throughout the \nNation by allowing permanent waivers to environmental or other laws, \nanywhere in the Nation, to be granted with few or no criteria, and no \npublic involvement.\n  The consequences of such an action could be significant. For example, \nnew refineries or power generating facilities could be built while \nexempt from the Clean Air Act, causing long-term air quality impacts. \nCongressional offshore drilling bans could be waived to alleviate a \nfuel shortage. Safe Drinking Water Act regulations could be changed to \nwaive limits on pollutant levels in an effort to speed reoccupancy of \nhurricane-affected areas, putting public health at risk. Protections \nfor minorities or low-income people such as OSHA safety regulations or \nthe minimum wage could be waived.\n  I want to help the people of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. The \npeople of my home State of Vermont are appalled at the state of affairs \nthere and want to help. But, I cannot accept a proposal this broad \nwhich will put human health and the environment throughout the Nation \nat the mercy of one President or appointed official with no time \nlimits, no consideration of human health or the environment, no public \nparticipation, and no guidance. Such as effort will only hurt the \npeople of an already devastated region in the long run, not help them.\n  We must not just act to help the victims of Katrina. We must act in a \nthoughtful, meaningful, positive way.\n  The Gulf Coast Infrastructure Redevelopment and Recovery Act of 2005 \nmeets that test. I urge my colleagues to co-sponsor this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 1837. A bill to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act to add Rhode Island to the Mid-Atlantic Fishery \nManagement Council; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Rhode Island \nFishermen's Fairness Act of 2005. This legislation would address a \nserious flaw in our Nation's regional fisheries management system by \nadding Rhode Island to the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council \n(MAFMC), which currently consists of representatives from New York, New \nJersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina.\n  The MAFMC manages the following 13 species, all of which are landed \nin Rhode Island: Illex squid, loligo squid, Atlantic mackerel, black \nsea bass, bluefish, butterfish, monkfish, scup, spiny dogfish, summer \nflounder, surfclam, ocean quahog, and tilefish.\n  In 2003, the most recent year for which final data are available, \nRhode Island fishermen brought in 30 percent of MAFMC landings by \nweight--more than any of the MAFMC member States except New Jersey, \nwhich is responsible for about 60 percent of total MAFMC landings.\n  If Rhode Island fishermen are responsible for a large percentage of \noverall MAFMC landings, these species make up an even larger proportion \nof landings within Rhode Island every year. Between 1995 and 2003, \nMAFMC species represented between 32 percent and 56 percent of all \nfinfish landed in Rhode Island annually, for an average of 44 percent \nof total landings by weight. In eight of the years between 1990 and \n2003, squid, Illex and loligo, was the number one marine species landed \nin Rhode Island, with a value of between $11.6 million and $20.1 \nmillion annually.\n  Yet Rhode Island has no voice in the management of these species.\n  Following council tradition and Federal fisheries law, the Rhode \nIsland Fishermen's Fairness Act would create two seats on the MAFMC for \nRhode Island: one seat nominated by the Governor of Rhode Island and \nappointed by the Secretary of Commerce, and a second seat filled by \nRhode Island's principal State official with marine fishery management \nresponsibility. The MAFMC would increase in size from 21 voting members \nto 23.\n  There is a precedent for this proposed legislation. In 1996, North \nCarolina's representatives in Congress succeeded in adding that state \nto the MAFMC through an amendment to the Sustainable Fisheries Act. \nLike Rhode Island, a significant proportion of North Carolina's landed \nfish species were managed by the MAFMC, yet the State had no vote on \nthe council. Today, Rhode Island's share of total landings for species \nmanaged by the MAFMC is more than six times greater than that of North \nCarolina.\n\n[[Page S11228]]\n\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to restore a measure of \nequity to the fisheries management process by passing the Rhode Island \nFishermen's Fairness Act. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1837\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rhode Island Fishermen's \n     Fairness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ADDITION OF RHODE ISLAND TO THE MID-ATLANTIC FISHERY \n                   MANAGEMENT COUNCIL.\n\n       Section 302(a)(1)(B) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \n     Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1852(a)(1)(B)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``Rhode Island,'' after ``States of'';\n       (2) by inserting ``Rhode Island,'' after ``except North \n     Carolina,'';\n       (3) by striking ``21'' and inserting ``23''; and\n       (4) by striking ``13'' and inserting ``14''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1838. A bill to provide for the sale, acquisition, conveyance, and \nexchange of certain real property in the District of Columbia to \nfacilitate the utilization, development, and redevelopment of such \nproperty, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the ``Federal \nand District of Columbia Government Real Property Act of 2005,'' a bill \nto authorize the exchange of certain land parcels between the Federal \nGovernment and the District of Columbia. This proposal was submitted to \nCongress by the administration with support of the District.\n  As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement, the Federal Workforce and the District of Columbia, I \nunderstand the special relationship shared with the Federal Government \nand the District. Because of this relationship, Congress shares in the \nresponsibility of ensuring that the Nation's capital remains a \nsocially, economically, and culturally vibrant city.\n  Under this legislation, the Federal properties to be transferred to \nthe District of Columbia will be put to better use. This will free up \ntax dollars being used to maintain the underutilized land to be spent \non more important needs facing our Nation. The vast majority of the \nconveyance is contained in three large properties at or near the \nAnacostia River: Popular Point, Reservation 13, and several acres of \nNational Park Service land near Robert F. Kennedy Stadium. The bill \nalso would transfer buildings and property located on the west campus \nof St. Elizabeth's Hospital and several smaller properties from the \nDistrict of Columbia to the Federal Government.\n  Conveying these properties will allow the Federal Government to \nbetter manage its properties. Additionally, the District gains the \nability to spur economic development in Southeast Washington, better \naddress the needs of its citizens, and increase the local tax base. I \nurge all of my colleagues to support this legislation and I am \nconfident that it can be enacted this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1838\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal and District of \n     Columbia Government Real Property Act of 2005''.\n\n    TITLE I--REAL PROPERTY CONVEYANCES BETWEEN THE GENERAL SERVICES \n              ADMINISTRATION AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to amend section 340B of the Public Health Service \nAct to increase the affordability of inpatient drugs for Medicaid and \nsafety net hospitals; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the rising cost of prescription drugs has \nsqueezed not only the budgets of American consumers but also the \nbudgets of America's health care providers. The rural hospitals in my \nState of South Dakota serve as a lifeline to thousands of constituents \nliving in medically underserved areas. They cannot afford to have the \ncost of their inpatient and outpatient drugs rising faster than the \nrate of inflation.\n  In 1992, Congress created the 340B program to lower the cost of drugs \npurchased by a limited number of entities serving a high number of low-\nincome and uninsured individuals, such as federally qualified health \ncare centers and nonprofit hospitals providing care to a \ndisproportionate share of Medicaid patients.\n  Under the 340B program, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to \nprovide eligible 340B entities discounts on outpatient drugs as part of \nthe manufacturers' Medicaid participation agreement. The rising cost of \nprescription drugs has created the need to modify the 340B program and \nextend these discounts to the inpatient side of disproportionate share \nhospitals, as well as to critical access hospitals.\n  Today, I and my colleague from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, are \nproviding relief on the cost of drugs purchased by America's health \ncare providers by introducing the Safety Net Inpatient Drug \nAffordability Act.\n  Our bill extends the 340B discounted drug prices to inpatient drug \npurchases of disproportionate share hospitals and allows critical \naccess hospitals to participate in the 340B program. This not only \nsaves hospitals money on the cost of drugs, it relieves them from the \nburden of carrying two different inventories for inpatient and \noutpatient drugs.\n  Our legislation also generates savings for the Medicaid program by \nrequiring hospitals that participate in the 340B program to rebate \nMedicaid a percentage of their 340B savings on inpatient drugs \nadministered to Medicaid patients. Specifically, the Safety Net \nInpatient Drug Affordability Act would require disproportionate share \nand critical access hospitals to determine the acquisition cost of \ndrugs used on Medicaid patients and apply the minimum Medicaid rebate \npercentages applicable to outpatient-dispensed brand name and generic \ndrugs.\n  Extending the 340B program to critical access hospitals also helps \nreduce expenditures in the Medicare Program. Critical access hospitals \nare a vital part of the rural health care delivery\n\n[[Page S11231]]\n\nsystem. They provide emergency outpatient and limited inpatient care to \nindividuals in remote rural areas. Out of the 61 hospitals in my State \nof South Dakota, 37 qualify as critical access hospitals.\n  Outpatient care in critical access hospitals is reimbursed by \nMedicare at 101 percent of reasonable costs. Allowing critical access \nhospitals to participate in the 340B program will lower the cost of \ndrugs in the outpatient setting and ultimately lower the cost of care \nprovided by these hospitals. Decreasing the cost of care in critical \naccess hospitals lowers the amount the Medicare Program expends on \nreimbursement.\n  The Safety Net Inpatient Drug Affordability Act is commonsense \nlegislation that reduces the cost of drugs for health care providers \nserving society's most vulnerable citizens. Lowering the cost of care \nin these settings means lowering the cost of health care for all \nAmerican taxpayers. I look forward to working with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle in getting this bipartisan legislation passed \nand signed into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. \n        Harkin):\n  S. 1841. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide extended and additional protection to Medicare beneficiaries \nwho enroll for the Medicare prescription drug benefit during 2006; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues and cosponsors Senators Stabenow and Harkin as we introduce \nthe Medicare Informed Choice Act of 2005. This bill provides additional \nessential protections for Medicare beneficiaries during the first year \nof implementation of the new Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  Medicare beneficiaries are understandably concerned and confused \nabout the new benefit. They face a number of private plan options and \nsorting through these plans will be complicated. Medicare beneficiaries \nwill have to make many difficult decisions about what is the best \ncourse of action for them.\n  Choosing the right plan will be a challenge for all beneficiaries, \nbut it will be most difficult for those who are frail and living with \nproblems like dementia. The task will be virtually impossible for \nHurricane Katrina victims who do not have permanent addresses and, \ntherefore, won't even be able to obtain Part D materials. Yet, \nbeneficiaries who do not act by the May 15, 2006 deadline and who \nenroll at a later date will face a substantial financial penalty.\n  In response, we are introducing this legislation which will provide \nadded protections for beneficiaries during the first year of the new \nprogram. By delaying late enrollment penalties and giving every \nbeneficiary a chance to change plans once during the first year, we can \nmake sure that our constituents are not forced to make hasty decisions \nthey may later regret.\n  The Medicare Informed Choice Act of 2005 contains three important \nprotections:\n  1. Delays late enrollment penalties: The bill expands the existing \nsix-month open enrollment period to the entire year of 2006. This will \ngive people added time to do the research and make the best decisions \nfor themselves.\n  2. Protections against bad choices: The bill gives every Medicare \nbeneficiary the opportunity to make a one-time change in plan \nenrollment at any point in 2006. Given the importance of the decision \nthey make, it is appropriate to give beneficiaries a one-time chance to \ncorrect an initial mistake made during the first year of \nimplementation.\n  3. Protections for employer-provided retiree benefits: This provision \nwould protect employees from being dropped by their former employer's \nplan during the first year of implementation, so that beneficiaries \nhave time to correct enrollment mistakes.\n  The Medicare Informed Choice Act is a small, time-limited step that \nwould help ease the pressure of the first year of this new drug \nprogram. It is also critical for all those beneficiaries who face \nhurdles in obtaining Medicare Part D materials or are unaware that they \nwill be penalized by failure to act. We urge all of our colleagues to \njoin us in this effort to help protect Medicare beneficiaries during \nthe benefit's implementation period.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1841\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote remediation of inactive and abandoned \nmines, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to make a statement regarding an \nimportant bill I am introducing today. It is a bill that is meant to \nprovide a straightforward and commonsense fix to a nettlesome problem \nthat plagues communities throughout the west: pollution from abandoned \nmines.\n  The bill simply says that we should make life easier for Good \nSamaritans. Surprisingly, that is not currently the case.\n  The Western United States is pockmarked with old mines and mining \nresidues, and many of these sites continuously pollute the water, the \nland, and the air. Our rivers and streams suffer particularly from this \ntype of pollution.\n  In many cases, no one alive is legally responsible for cleaning these \nsites. In other cases, those who are legally responsible lack the money \nor other resources necessary to clean them up, and the pollution \ncontinues.\n  Fortunately, some people and some companies are willing to clean up \nmine sites in whole or in part, even though they are not legally \nresponsible. These are Good Samaritans.\n  They act for many reasons. Some are people who live nearby and suffer \ndirectly from the pollution. Others are companies that want to perform \na service to the community and to address less fortunate aspects of the \nhistory of the mining industry. Still others act for other reasons.\n  Unfortunately, though, our environmental laws create great risks of \nbroad, long term, and very expensive liabilities for anyone who acts at \na mine site, even if they act only as Good Samaritans. This problem \nunderstandably dissuades Good Samaritans from cleaning mine sites.\n\n[[Page S11233]]\n\n  My bill is designed to fix this problem. It is written to encourage \nmeritorious projects to proceed provided they have the full approval of \nthe governments involved and full participation by the public--all to \nbenefit the environment.\n  This bill intentionally is simple and intentionally straightforward. \nNo Good Samaritan project will proceed unless it creates a true, \noverall environmental benefit. No project will gain approval unless the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the state involved, and local \nauthorities affected agree that it is a good thing. The public will be \nfully involved in the process from the very beginning.\n  And, finally, the permit system and the standards in the bill are \nintentionally uncomplicated, so that permits for simple projects can be \nissued using simple proceedings.\n  My idea is to make clear that the work of Good Samaritans is very \nwelcome. Some cleanup of the environment in these circumstances is far \nbetter than none at all.\n  The bill encourages Good Samaritans to clean pollution by freeing \nthem from the large environmental liabilities that ordinarily burden \nanyone who acts to fix the pollution.\n  The bill applies to the cleanup of non-coal inactive and abandoned \nmines anywhere in the United States.\n  Its approach--which wraps all environmental requirements for a Good \nSamaritan project into a single permit that must be agreed to first by \nthe Federal Government, the affected State, and local communities--is \nstraightforward.\n  Its inclusion of the states and local communities as well as the \naffected publics--including by assuring that State and local \nauthorities have a say in the provision of any permit--are based on the \nbest traditions of the west.\n  And its impact is clear--only projects that benefit the environment \nwill be permitted, and the work done pursuant to that permit will be \nafforded clear legal protection.\n  I am proud of this bill. It is the result of a series of meetings I \nheld around my state earlier this year. And it is endorsed by the \nNational Mining Association, the Colorado Mining Association, and the \nGreat State of Colorado.\n  It is the right thing to do, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to ensure its enactment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1848\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cleanup of Inactive and \n     Abandoned Mines Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Federal Government and State governments encouraged \n     hard rock mining in the United States through a wide variety \n     of laws, policies, and actions;\n       (2) the mining activities that took place disturbed public \n     and private land, and those disturbances led to considerable \n     environmental pollution;\n       (3) many areas in which hard rock mining took place in the \n     United States are now inactive and abandoned mine sites;\n       (4) many inactive and abandoned mine sites pollute the \n     environment today and will continue to do so indefinitely \n     unless remediated;\n       (5) adits and other tunnels will continue to drain \n     pollutants to surface and ground water through gravity flow;\n       (6) surface runoff will continue to pick up pollutants as \n     the runoff moves over disturbed ground and transports \n     pollutants to surface waters; and\n       (7) tailings and other materials left exposed to the \n     elements will continue to blow in the wind and pollute the \n     atmosphere and soils;\n       (8) many of the individuals and corporate owners and \n     operators of those mines, who caused this pollution, are no \n     longer alive or in existence;\n       (9) some of the remaining owners and operators who remain \n     do not have resources that are adequate to conduct \n     remediation properly under applicable environmental laws, for \n     all practical purposes leaving no one responsible for the \n     cleanup of pollution from those sites;\n       (10) inactive and abandoned mine sites are located in areas \n     of known economic mineralization;\n       (11) modern mining activities often take place on or in the \n     vicinity of the area in which historic hard rock mining \n     activities took place;\n       (12) from time to time, individuals and companies are \n     willing to remediate historic mine sites for the public good \n     as Good Samaritans, despite the fact that these individuals \n     and companies are not legally required to remediate the mine \n     sites;\n       (13) Good Samaritan remediation activities may--\n       (A) vary in size and complexity;\n       (B) reflect the myriad ways that mine residue may be \n     cleaned up; and\n       (C) include, among other activities--\n       (i) the relocation or management of tailings or other waste \n     piles;\n       (ii) passive or active water treatment;\n       (iii) runoff or run-on controls; and\n       (iv) the use or reprocessing of, or removal of materials \n     from, mine residue;\n       (14) the potential environmental liabilities that may \n     attach to those Good Samaritans as a result of the \n     remediation can dissuade those Good Samaritans from acting \n     for the public good;\n       (15) it is in the interest of the United States, the \n     States, and local communities to remediate historic mine \n     sites, in appropriate circumstances and to the maximum extent \n     practicable, so that the environmental impacts of the sites \n     are lessened into the future; and\n       (16) if appropriate protections are provided for Good \n     Samaritans, Good Samaritans will have a greater incentive to \n     remediate those sites for the public good.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to encourage partial or complete remediation of \n     inactive and abandoned mining sites for the public good by \n     persons who are not otherwise legally responsible for the \n     remediation;\n       (2) to provide appropriate protections for Good Samaritans \n     under applicable environmental laws;\n       (3) to ensure that remediation performed by Good Samaritans \n     creates actual and significant environmental benefits;\n       (4) to ensure that remediation by Good Samaritans is \n     carried out--\n       (A) with the approval and agreement, and in the discretion, \n     of affected Federal, State, and local authorities and with \n     review by the public; and\n       (B) in a manner that is beneficial to the environment and \n     all affected communities; and\n       (5) to create an efficient permit process under which the \n     cost and complexity of obtaining a permit are commensurate \n     with the scope of remediation work to be completed and the \n     environmental benefits from the work;\n       (6) to avoid permitting for ongoing, for-profit businesses \n     that specialize in multiple Good Samaritan projects that are \n     designed to be permitted outside otherwise applicable \n     Federal, State, and local environmental laws; and\n       (7) to ensure that the protections for Good Samaritans \n     provided in this Act are interpreted in accordance with the \n     purposes of this Act and to enhance the public good.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 268\n\n       Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski was born in Boston, \n     Massachusetts on September 6, 1908, the 31st anniversary of \n     the death of Lakota leader Crazy Horse;\n       Whereas, although never trained in art or sculpture, \n     Korczak Ziolkowski began a successful studio career in New \n     England as a commissioned sculptor at age 24;\n       Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski's marble sculpture of composer \n     and Polish leader Ignace Jan Paderewski won first prize at \n     the 1939 New York World's Fair and prompted Lakota Indian \n     Chiefs to invite Ziolkowski to carve a memorial for Native \n     Americans;\n       Whereas in his invitation letter to Korczak Ziolkowski, \n     Chief Henry Standing Bear wrote: ``My fellow chiefs and I \n     would like the white man to know that the red man has great \n     heroes, also.'';\n       Whereas in 1939, Korczak Ziolkowski assisted Gutzon Borglum \n     for a brief time in carving Mount Rushmore;\n\n[[Page S11238]]\n\n       Whereas in 1941, Korczak Ziolkowski met with Chief Henry \n     Standing Bear who taught Korczak more about the life of the \n     brave Lakota leader Crazy Horse;\n       Whereas at the age of 34, Korczak Ziolkowski temporarily \n     put his sculpturing career aside when he volunteered for \n     service in World War II, later landing on Omaha Beach;\n       Whereas after the war, Korczak Ziolkowski turned down other \n     sculpting opportunities in order to accept the invitation of \n     Chief Henry Standing Bear and dedicate the rest of his life \n     to carving the Crazy Horse Memorial in the Black Hills of \n     South Dakota;\n       Whereas on June 3, 1948, when work was begun on the Crazy \n     Horse Memorial, Korczak Ziolkowski vowed that the memorial \n     would be a nonprofit educational and cultural project, \n     financed solely through private, nongovernmental sources, to \n     honor the Native Americans of North America;\n       Whereas the Crazy Horse Memorial is a mountain carving-in-\n     progress, and once completed it will be the largest sculpture \n     in the world;\n       Whereas since his death on October 20, 1982, Korczak's wife \n     Ruth, the Ziolkowski family, and the Crazy Horse Memorial \n     Foundation have continued to work on the Memorial and to \n     continue the dream of Korczak Ziolkowski and Chief Henry \n     Standing Bear; and\n       Whereas on June 3, 1998, the Memorial entered its second \n     half century of progress and heralded a new era of work on \n     the mountain with the completion and dedication of the face \n     of Crazy Horse: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate recognizes--\n       (A) the admirable efforts of the late Korczak Ziolkowski in \n     designing and creating the Crazy Horse Memorial;\n       (B) that the Crazy Horse Memorial represents all North \n     American Indian tribes, and the noble goal of reconciliation \n     between peoples; and\n       (C) that the creation of the Crazy Horse Memorial, from its \n     inception, has been accomplished through private sources and \n     without any Federal funding; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that the Citizens' Stamp \n     Advisory Committee should recommend to the Postmaster General \n     that a commemorative postage stamp be issued in honor of \n     sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski and the Crazy Horse Memorial, \n     commemorating his 100th birthday.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 269--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT A \n      ``WELCOME HOME VIETNAM VETERANS DAY'' SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED\n\n  Mrs. BOXER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a resolution today \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that a ``Welcome Home Vietnam \nVeterans Day'' should be established. I join Representative Linda \nSanchez in this effort and applaud her for previously submitting this \nresolution in the House of Representatives. Establishing this day would \nbe an appropriate way to honor members of the United States Armed \nForces who bravely and faithfully served during the Vietnam War.\n  During the course of the Vietnam War, over 58,000 U.S. troops lost \ntheir lives. In addition, more than 300,000 were wounded. To date, more \nthan 1,800 members of the United States Armed Forces remain unaccounted \nfor in Vietnam and Southeast Asia.\n  Those who did return home from Vietnam did not have the traditional \nwelcome home ceremonies. And they continue to face many problems, \nincluding health problems related to Agent Orange exposure, prolonged \nrisk for post-traumatic stress disorder, and homelessness. Of the \n250,000 veterans who are homeless every night, the Department of \nVeterans Affairs estimates that 47 percent of them served during the \nVietnam era.\n  Veterans of the Vietnam War, and all veterans, are entitled to the \nbest care and treatment the U.S. Government can provide. It is \nimportant that we honor and respect their service. It is especially \nimportant to do so now, at a time when we have so many new veterans \nreturning home from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  By honoring those who have served before, we show these new veterans \nhow committed we, as a country, are to them and how much we value the \nsacrifices they make on our behalf. Establishing a ``Welcome Home \nVietnam Veterans Day'' is one way we can accomplish this. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 270--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n    INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND SHOULD INVESTIGATE WHETHER CHINA IS \n  MANIPULATING THE RATE OF EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE CHINESE YUAN AND THE \n                          UNITED STATES DOLLAR\n\n  Mr. BAYH (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Schumer) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 270\n\n       Whereas the global current account deficit of the United \n     States has already reached almost $800,000,000,000 and is \n     growing rapidly;\n       Whereas the global current account surplus of the People's \n     Republic of China is likely to reach $150,000,000,000 and is \n     also growing very rapidly;\n       Whereas China has intervened massively in the exchange \n     markets to artificially block appreciation of China's \n     currency;\n       Whereas China has been increasing its competitiveness by \n     riding the dollar down against other currencies, therefore \n     achieving a trade-weighted depreciation of about 10 percent \n     over the past 3 years;\n       Whereas it is the responsibility of the International \n     Monetary Fund to take the lead in promoting correction of \n     such huge, costly, and potentially destabilizing imbalances \n     in the world economy;\n       Whereas the International Monetary Fund's Articles of \n     Agreement enjoin member countries to ``avoid manipulating \n     exchange rates or the international monetary system\n\n[[Page S11239]]\n\n     in order to prevent effective balance-of-payments adjustments \n     or to gain unfair competitive advantage over other member \n     countries'';\n       Whereas the International Monetary Fund has identified \n     ``protracted, large-scale interventions in one direction in \n     the exchange markets'' as indicating a need for International \n     Monetary Fund discussion with the offending country; and\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China has engaged in such \n     manipulation and intervention: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     President should instruct the United States Executive \n     Director to the International Monetary Fund to bring a \n     general complaint under the International Monetary Fund's \n     Articles of Agreement against the People's Republic of China \n     for not complying with Article IV of the Articles of \n     Agreement and manipulating the rate of exchange of its \n     currency against other currencies to gain an unfair trade \n     advantage and to prevent effective balance of payment \n     adjustments.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 57--RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF \n AFRICAN-AMERICAN BASKETBALL TEAMS AND PLAYERS FOR THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS, \nDEDICATION, AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SPORT OF BASKETBALL AND THE NATION\n\n  Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Mr. Levin) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 57\n\n       Whereas, even though African-Americans were excluded from \n     playing in organized White-only leagues, the desire of \n     African-Americans to play basketball could not be repressed;\n       Whereas, unlike baseball, which had Negro leagues, \n     basketball had no organized Black leagues, thus forcing \n     Blacks to take to the road out of necessity;\n       Whereas among the most well-known black barnstorming teams \n     that found their beginnings in the 1920s were the New York \n     Renaissance (or Rens), the Harlem Globetrotters, the New York \n     Enforcers, the Harlem Clowns, the Harlem Road Kings, the \n     Harlem Stars, the Harlem Ambassadors, and the Philadelphia \n     Tribunes;\n       Whereas, despite the racism they faced, Negro basketball \n     teams overcame great obstacles to play the game before Black \n     players were allowed to play in the National Basketball \n     Association in the early 1950s;\n       Whereas the New York Rens became one of the first great \n     basketball dynasties in the history of the game, compiling a \n     2,588-539 record in its 27-year existence, winning 88 \n     straight games in the 1932-33 season, and winning the 1939 \n     World Professional Championship;\n       Whereas the Harlem Globetrotters proved that they were \n     capable of beating professional teams like the World Champion \n     Minneapolis Lakers led by basketball great George Mikan in \n     1948;\n       Whereas the barnstorming African-American basketball teams \n     included exceptionally talented players and shaped modern-day \n     basketball by introducing a new style of play predicated on \n     speed, short crisp passing techniques, and vigorous defensive \n     play;\n       Whereas among the pioneers who played on Black barnstorming \n     teams included players such as Tarzan Cooper, Pop Gates, John \n     Isaacs, Willie Smith, Sweetwater Clifton, Ermer Robinson, Bob \n     Douglas, Pappy Ricks, Runt Pullins, Goose Tatum, Marques \n     Haynes, Bobby Hall, Babe Pressley, Bernie Price, Ted Strong, \n     Inman Jackson, Duke Cumberland, Fat Jenkins, Eddie Younger, \n     Lou Badger, Zachary Clayton, Jim Usry, Sonny Boswell, and \n     Puggy Bell;\n       Whereas the struggles of these players and others paved the \n     way for current African-American professional players, who \n     are playing in the National Basketball Association today;\n       Whereas the style of Black basketball was more conducive to \n     a wide open, fast-paced, spectator sport;\n       Whereas, by achieving success on the basketball court, \n     African-American basketball players helped break down the \n     color barrier and integrate African-Americans into all \n     aspects of society in the United States;\n       Whereas, during the era of sexism and gender barriers, \n     barnstorming African-American basketball was not limited to \n     men's teams, but included women's teams as well, such as the \n     Chicago Romas and the Philadelphia Tribunes;\n       Whereas only in recent years has the history of African-\n     Americans in team sports begun receiving the recognition it \n     deserves;\n       Whereas basketball is a uniquely modern and uniquely \n     American sport;\n       Whereas the Black Legends of Professional Basketball \n     Foundation, established by former Harlem Globetrotter Dr. \n     John Kline of Detroit, Michigan, honors and highlights the \n     significant contributions of these pioneers and their impact \n     on professional basketball today; and\n       Whereas the hard work and efforts of the foundation have \n     been instrumental in bringing African-American inductees into \n     the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, \n     Massachusetts: Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That\n       (1) Congress recognizes the teams and players of the \n     barnstorming African-American basketball teams for their \n     achievement, dedication, sacrifices, and contribution to \n     basketball and to the Nation prior to the integration of the \n     White professional leagues;\n       (2) current National Basketball Association players should \n     pay a debt of gratitude to these great pioneers of the game \n     of basketball and recognize them at every possible \n     opportunity; and\n       (3) a copy of this resolution be transmitted to the Black \n     Legends of Professional Basketball Foundation, which has \n     recognized and commemorated the achievements of African-\n     American basketball teams, the National Basketball \n     Association, and the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/06/senate-section/article/S11239-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2053.

Camporees at the United States \n     Military Academy for Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts provide \n     similar training opportunities on a smaller scale.\n       (2) Support.--Section 2554 of title 10, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(i)(1) The Secretary of Defense shall provide at least \n     the same level of support under this section for a national \n     or world Boy Scout Jamboree as was provided under this \n     section for the preceding national or world Boy Scout \n     Jamboree.\n       ``(2) The Secretary of Defense may waive paragraph (1), if \n     the Secretary--\n       ``(A) determines that providing the support subject to \n     paragraph (1) would be detrimental to the national security \n     of the United States; and\n       ``(B) reports such a determination to the Congress in a \n     timely manner, and before such support is not provided.''.\n       (d) Equal Access for Youth Organizations.--Section 109 of \n     the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. \n     5309) is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence of subsection (b) by inserting \n     ``or (e)'' after ``subsection (a)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Equal Access.--\n       ``(1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `youth \n     organization' means any organization described under part B \n     of subtitle II of title 36, United States Code, that is \n     intended to serve individuals under the age of 21 years.\n       ``(2) In general.--No State or unit of general local \n     government that has a designated open forum, limited public \n     forum, or nonpublic forum and that is a recipient of \n     assistance under this chapter shall deny equal access or a \n     fair opportunity to meet to, or discriminate against, any \n     youth organization, including the Boy Scouts of America or \n     any group officially affiliated with the Boy Scouts of \n     America, that wishes to conduct a meeting or otherwise \n     participate in that designated open forum, limited public \n     forum, or nonpublic forum.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2055.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Before we recess, I will yield to the Senator from \nLouisiana for 5 minutes before we close.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, it has been a very long day. I am \nhoping, as this day continues into the evening hours, as we continue to \nwork on the underlying bill, which is the Defense appropriations bill, \nto have an amendment dealing with Hurricane Katrina in a way this \nCongress might respond to this urgent need. I thank the Senator from \nAlaska for his patience through this day because the issue that is \nbefore us really is not an amendment on the Defense bill. It is a \nseparate issue but needs to be handled before we leave, in my opinion.\n  That is why I have stayed here throughout the day and have been here, \nof course, throughout the week, in many meetings and phone calls, and \nnow in time on the floor throughout the day, to try to find a way to \nget some immediate help to our cities and parishes and counties along \nthe gulf coast. It looks like there is a possibility that still might \nbe the case.\n  But because of the lateness of the hour, really for the staff that \nhas been here so long, I am going to agree to continue to work through \nthe night, allow the staff to take a recess, and spend some time on \nthis, as I have throughout the last few hours, working with my \ncolleagues, particularly Senator Levin from Michigan, who has put in a \ntremendous amount of time, other Senators, Senator Carper from \nDelaware, Senator Clinton, Senator Durbin, Senator Reid. And Senator \nFrist has been here for a while. Of course, Senator Vitter was here \nearlier trying to get through this process, with the specific focus of \nmine being to try to get our State in the same situation that other \nStates have been put in when they needed help.\n  We are not quite there yet, but we may yet get there by the time we \nclose the debate in just a few hours. But, really, the staff has done \nmore than they should be asked, to stay this late.\n  We have tried four or five different compromises in the last 8 hours, \nand we are not quite there yet. But we may be there in the morning when \nthe Senate comes out of recess.\n  I am going to continue to work through the evening to see if we can \nfind some sort of solution so that our four States--Louisiana, \nMississippi, Alabama, and Texas--can be treated in the same way with \nthe same respect as other States have in disasters in the past.\n  I thank the Senator for his patience throughout the evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/06/senate-section/article/S11242-4", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.
