Mr. President, this morning we will have a brief period \nfor closing remarks prior to the 10 a.m. vote on the Marriage \nProtection Amendment. That vote will be on a vote for cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to S.J. Res. 1.\n  Following the 10 o'clock vote, the Senate will recess in order to \nattend a joint meeting with the House for the President of the Republic \nof Latvia, who will be addressing both Houses at 11 o'clock this \nmorning. Senators should remain in the Chamber following the vote so we \nmay leave at approximately 10:40 for that joint meeting.\n  When we return at noon, we have set aside debate times on two issues. \nFirst, from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock, we will be debating the motion to \nproceed to the repeal of the death tax. A cloture motion was filed on \nproceeding to the death tax repeal. That vote will occur tomorrow \nmorning. We have also set aside debate from 3 o'clock to 6 o'clock on \nthe motion to proceed to the Native Hawaiians measure. The cloture vote \nwill occur on that motion to proceed during tomorrow's session, as \nwell.\n  I add that this week we have other matters to consider, including \nsome nominations. We hope to reach agreements to consider Sue Schwab to \nbe U.S. Trade Representative, the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine \nSafety and Health, and several available district judges who are on the \nExecutive Calendar. We will be scheduling those for consideration \nthrough the remaining days this week.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                                 Voting\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my only response would be on this side of \nthe aisle, we will be voting on the estate tax.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we will shortly be voting on what will \npresumably be the 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution. We all know \nthe outcome of that vote. The amendment will fall well short of the 60 \nvotes required for cloture, let alone the 67 votes required to pass a \nconstitutional amendment, so it will fail, as it did 2 years ago. I am \npleased that the Senate will reject this amendment.\n  I am heartened so many Senators have come to the Senate to speak out \nstrongly against this misguided proposal, but I am saddened that once \nagain the Senate has spent several\n\n[[Page S5518]]\n\ndays on such a divisive and unneeded proposal, a proposal that pits \nAmericans against one another. I think it appeals to people's worst \ninstincts and prejudices.\n  The arguments made by supporters of the amendment simply do not hold \nup under scrutiny. Supporters argue that Federal courts are basically \non the brink of recognizing same-sex marriage and that States may be \nforced to recognize same-sex marriage performed in other States. Of \ncourse, neither of these things have happened, and no one has explained \nwhy we should do a preemptive strike on the basic governing document of \nthe country to address a hypothetical future court decision.\n  Supporters talk about traditional marriage but in some ways have very \nlittle respect for the traditional role of the States in regulating \nmarriage. If they did, they would not be trying to impose a restrictive \nFederal definition of marriage on all States for all time. The \nsupporters argue that this amendment will not effect the ability of \nState legislatures to extend benefits to same-sex couples or enact \ncivil unions, but as I tried to point out in some depth yesterday, even \nthe legal experts who would support this constitutional amendment \ncannot even agree about its potential effect and scope. We are not \ntalking about putting together a statute; we will put this into the \nConstitution.\n  Supporters rail against activist judges. But if this vaguely worded \namendment ever passes, it will result in substantial litigation. What \nare the legal incidents of marriage? Is a civil union a marriage in all \nbut name and therefore subject to the amendment? Judges would have to \nanswer these and other questions that the supporters of the amendment \nhave so far failed to resolve. There is certainly a rich irony in that.\n  We have heard moving speeches, and I do not doubt the sincerity of \nthe speakers, about the central role and volume of marriage in our \nsociety. What I still do not understand, and what the supporters of the \namendment have failed to demonstrate, is why we should prevent States \nfrom deciding to open this institution to men and women who happen to \nbe gay and lesbian all over the country.\n  Married heterosexual couples are shaking their heads and wondering, \nhow, exactly, the prospect of gay marriages threatens the health of \ntheir marriages.\n  This amendment would make a minority of Americans permanent second-\nclass citizens of this country. It would prevent States, many of which \nare grappling with the definition of marriage, from deciding that gays \nand lesbians should be allowed to marry. It may even prevent States \nfrom offering certain benefits of marriage to same-sex couples through \ncivil union or domestic partnership legislation. And it would write \ndiscrimination into a document that has served as a historic guarantee \nof individual freedom.\n  Gay Americans are our neighbors, our friends, our family members, and \nour colleagues. Millions are loving parents in strong and healthy \nfamilies. Let's not demonize them. Let's not play upon fears. Let's not \nuse them as scapegoats for perceived social problems. Let's allow--in \nfact, let's encourage--States to extend rights and responsibilities to \nthese decent, loving, law-abiding families. We can start today by \nrejecting this unnecessary, mean-spirited and poorly drafted \nconstitutional amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask the time during the quorum call be \nequally divided on both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. How much time is remaining on our side of the aisle?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask when 7\\1/2\\ minutes have been used, I be \ninformed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will inform the Senator.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if Members of the Senate vote as their \nStates have voted on this amendment, the vote today will be 90 to 10 in \nfavor of a constitutional amendment. Forty-five States have defined \nmarriage as the union of a man and a woman.\n  I want to show my colleagues an outdated map. It shows the number of \nStates that have weighed in on the topic of marriage. Yesterday, \nAlabama voted by 81 percent to define marriage as the union of a man \nand a woman. The dark green States are those that have already passed; \nlight green are those where it is pending, and only five States have \nnot defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman. So if \nSenators would represent their States, this amendment would pass 90 to \n10. It would pass with the definition of marriage as the union of a man \nand a woman. And if anybody wants to define it otherwise, it will have \nto go through the State legislature, not the courts.\n  So there is nothing to oppose in this amendment. If your State wanted \nto go at it by a different route, it says it has to go through the \nlegislature. It can't be forced by the court. What is wrong with that?\n  I find it a sad prospect that we might not be able to pass this 90 to \n10. Marriage is a foundational institution. It is under attack by the \ncourts. It needs to be defended in this way by defining it as the union \nof a man and a woman as 45 of our 50 States have done. If it is going \nto be defined otherwise, it must be done by the legislatures and not by \nthe courts.\n  This morning we are going to vote on a constitutional amendment to \ndefine marriage as the union of a man and a woman. This is about who is \ngoing to determine the definition, whether it is the courts or the \nlegislative bodies. The amendment is about how we are going to raise \nthe next generation. How are they going to be raised? It is a \nfundamental issue for our families and for our future. It is an issue \nfor the people. It is not an issue that the courts should resolve. \nThose of us who support this amendment are doing so in an effort to let \nthe people decide.\n  There has been a lot of eloquent debate about this constitutional \namendment. I have been on the Senate floor most of the time. I have \nheard very little debate against the amendment. I have heard a lot of \npeople complaining that we ought to take up something else, that this \nis not so important. I look at it and say, we have this many States \nthat have deemed it important enough that they would put it on their \nballots. This is important. We have had basically one, two, maybe three \nspeakers say they really question the amendment, but most of them say \nwe shouldn't spend our time on this amendment. We shouldn't spend our \ntime on the estate tax. They don't mention the native Hawaiian bill \nthat is coming up, or suggest that we should not spend our time on \nthat.\n  We are going to have this vote. People are going to be responsible \nfor this vote. We are making progress in America on defining marriage \nas the union of a man and a woman, and we will not stop until it is \ndefined and protected as the union of a man and a woman. We have far \nmore States now that have voted on this issue than the last time we \nvoted on it. We now have far more court challenges taking place to this \nfundamental definition of how we look at the union of marriage.\n  Marriage is about our future. I continue to be struck by the \nopponents of this amendment who say it is an effort to promote \ndiscrimination. The amendment is about promoting our future, our \nfamilies, how we raise that next generation, and about allowing a \ndefinition of a fundamental institution to be made by the people rather \nthan by the courts.\n  I have shown a number of charts demonstrating that the best situation \nfor our children to be raised is in a home with a mother and father. \nChildren need these two parents. It is not\n\n[[Page S5519]]\n\nthat you can't raise good children in a single-parent household; you \ncan. Many struggle heroically to do so. Yet we know from all the data \nthat the best place is with a mother and father. Children do best \nacademically and socially, and they are more likely to be raised in \nfinancially stable homes when a mother and father are both present.\n  More importantly, they have the security of knowing there are two \npeople in their lives who provide security and stability, two people \nwho provide something, each differently, but that is very important.\n  These two people become one. They are united. They become one bonded \ntogether. This past weekend, my mother-in-law and father-in-law \ncelebrated 56 years of marriage. While often they may disagree with one \nanother--sometimes pretty heatedly, sometimes one could call it almost \nbarking at each other--they are inseparable. They are one. It is a \nbeautiful thing to see. It is the way that we should uphold these \ninstitutions. Their children and their grandchildren and great-\ngrandchildren get to see these two people, two old trees leaning \nagainst each other, holding each other up, physical bodies not anything \nnear what they used to be, but supporting and helping and setting a \nfoundation for all future generations to look at and say: That is the \nway it ought to be done.\n  Life hasn't always been easy for them. There have been difficulties \nthrough time. They have had some hardships, working together. My \nfather-in-law has done very well, served in Korea, during which time \nthey were separated by many miles.\n  My parents have been married over 50 years. You look at them and say: \nThat is the way it should be, where two become one. Out of that union \ncomes more people, more children, raised with a solid set of \nfoundational values that you hope can be good citizens. We are all \ngoing to have difficulties and problems, but isn't that something that \nwe can do and we should do for the next generation?\n  We have an important issue in front of us, the definition of \nmarriage. We have a country that is watching and that knows what they \nbelieve marriage should be defined as, the union of a man and a woman, \nas 45 States have defined it. The courts are moving otherwise. We say \nlet the legislatures decide, and that it is an important issue, \nmeritorious of our vote.\n  To those who oppose this amendment, I think they will have to explain \nto a lot of people why they oppose marriage as the union of a man and a \nwoman and why they don't think the State legislatures should be the \nones responsible for defining this but, rather, that this should be \ndefined by the courts. I don't think their position is across America.\n  This is important. I hope my colleagues support this constitutional \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the majority leader \nand the 32 cosponsors of S.J. Res. 1, the Marriage Protection \nAmendment. I thank the Senator from Kansas for his leadership, courage, \nand for standing in support with me of marriage.\n  We as Senators are called to duty to debate this issue today out of \nrespect for the democratic process. The voice of the people has been \nheard loud and clear. Marriage is the union of a man and a woman.\n  It has been heard in the 20 States with constitutional amendments \npassed by an average of over 70 percent of voters. It has been heard in \nthe 26 States with statutes protecting traditional marriage. It has \nbeen heard in 45 States and in this Congress.\n  Unfortunately, dissatisfied with the outcome of the democratic \nprocess, a handful of activists have launched a carefully coordinated \ncampaign to circumvent the democratic process and redefine marriage \nthrough the courts.\n  As a result, I introduced S.J. Res. 1, an amendment to the \nConstitution, that simply defines marriage as a union of a man and a \nwoman, while leaving all other issues of civil unions or domestic \npartnerships to the States. I am pleased the issue has this week been \ndebated in a democratically elected and deliberative body--where it \nbelongs.\n  Throughout the course of the past 2 days, I have heard countless \narguments in favor of marriage from both sides of the aisle. \nSurprisingly, many of the same people making those arguments will not \nvote for our amendment to protect marriage.\n  Equally as surprising, notwithstanding their opposition, I heard few \narguments opposing my amendment on the merits. Instead, most of those \nopposed to the amendment shifted the debate to issues other than the \npending business. I suspect these shifts were meant to divert attention \naway from their intent to vote differently than an average of 70 \npercent of their constituents do when they vote on the issue of same-\nsex marriage at home.\n  While other issues are without a doubt very important, the Senate has \nand continues to devote considerable time and will likely devote even \nmore time to debate on these important issues this year. With the \noverwhelming support that was voiced on this floor for the institution \nof marriage, one would think that addressing the nationwide attack on \nmarriage that is underway would warrant at least 1 full day of debate \non the issue.\n  The one tack taken by those opposed to the amendment most closely \nresembling an argument on the merits came in the form of States rights. \nWhile well meaning, the argument is unfounded.\n  First, my amendment actually protects States rights. Same-sex \nadvocates have, through the courts, systematically and successfully \ntrampled on laws democratically enacted in the States. My amendment \ntakes the issue out of the hands of a handful of activist judges and \nputs it squarely back in the hands of the States.\n  Secondly, the process to amend the Constitution is the most \ndemocratic, federalist process in all our government. It is neither an \nexclusively Federal nor an exclusively State action. It is the shared \nresponsibility of both. Once passed by the Congress, legislatures in \nall 50 States will have the opportunity to debate and decide this issue \nfor themselves.\n  Finally, under my amendment, States remain free to address the issue \nof civil unions and domestic partnerships. Citizens acting through \ntheir State legislatures can bestow whatever benefits to same-sex \ncouples they choose. The real danger to States rights would be to do \nnothing and to acquiesce to the recognition of unenumerated \nconstitutional rights in which the States have had no participation.\n  The truth is, the Constitution will be amended whether we pass this \nbill or not. The only question is whether it will be amended through \nthe amendment process or by unaccountable activist judges. If we fail \nto redefine marriage, the courts will not hesitate to do it for us.\n  I, for one, believe the institution of marriage and the principles of \ndemocracy are too precious to surrender to the whims of a handful of \nunelected activist judges. I urge my colleagues to join me in my stand \nfor democracy and marriage by voting yes on S.J. Res. 1, the Marriage \nProtection Amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, one of the first things a Member of the \nSenate should learn is humility, humility when it comes to some of the \ndocuments that guide our Nation. We certainly understand the \nConstitution we are sworn to uphold and defend is a treasured document \nwhich has guided us for over two centuries. I, for one, come to the \nsubject of amending this Constitution with real humility. I think it is \nbold of some of my colleagues to believe that their handiwork, their \nwords, could stand the test of time, could be measured against the work \nproduct of Thomas Jefferson and the greats in American history.\n  This matter before us today is an attempt by some of my colleagues to \namend the Constitution, to change the document which has guided America \nfor so long. I have seen a lot of these amendments come and go as a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee. Some of them, frankly, couldn't even \nmake it\n\n[[Page S5520]]\n\nthrough the committee, let alone on the Senate floor or be sent to \nlegislatures for approval.\n  But still Members come forward with a variety of ideas. Today, we \nconsider the so-called Marriage Protection Amendment. My friend, my \ncolleague from Colorado, Senator Allard, the lead sponsor of it, says \nthis amendment will not infringe on the rights of States to determine \nthe status of different relationships. Yet let me read the language of \nhis amendment:\n\n       Neither this Constitution, nor the Constitution of any \n     State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the \n     legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other \n     than the union of a man and a woman.\n\n  So if my State of Illinois decides to establish a domestic \npartnership law and say that two people of the same gender can live \ntogether and share health insurance and can be in a relationship where \nthere would be a guarantee that they would have access to visit one \nanother in times of hospitalization and sickness, where property rights \ncould be established, is that a legal incident of married life? Most \npeople would say yes. Clearly, this language says it would be \nprohibited. So what we have here goes far beyond the concept of \nmarriage. We have to take care not to put language in this Constitution \nthat will come back to haunt us.\n  I step back, too, and look at this debate and wonder, why are we here \non the floor of the Senate doing this? Why are we debating this issue \nabove all others? Why are we taking virtually a week of Senate business \ntime to debate the issue of gay marriage? I think it goes back to a \nstatement made by President Bush a couple weeks ago on the issue of \nimmigration. This is what he said:\n\n       We cannot build a unified country by inciting people to \n     anger, or playing on anyone's fears, or exploiting [an] issue \n     . . . for political gain.\n\n  He was referring to the issue of immigration, but the standard is a \ngood one. We have a responsibility to unite America and not divide it.\n  Mr. President, I wish you could hear the telephone calls to my \noffice. The people calling in support of this amendment--many of them--\nare very courteous and ask me to vote for the amendment. But, sadly, so \nmany of them call spewing their hatred and bigotry of people of \ndifferent sexual orientation. You think to yourself, is this good for \nAmerica? Is it good for us to have this sort of angry display brought \nout by our actions on the floor of the Senate at a time when we know \nthis constitutional amendment will not be enacted by the Senate? Nobody \nbelieves it will receive the 67 votes that are necessary for final \npassage, and few believe it will even come close to the 60 votes \nnecessary on a cloture motion. Yet we come today, as we have times \nbefore, to bring up this issue.\n  This debate is not about the preservation of marriage. This debate is \nabout the preservation of a majority. The Republican majority believes \nthat if they can bring these issues which fire up their political base \nto the floor, they will have better luck in the November election. So \nat the risk of dividing America, at the risk of putting language in the \nConstitution that could not stand the test of time, they will take the \ntime of the Senate and engage us in this debate. That is unfortunate \nwhen you think of so many other things we should be dealing with.\n  Would this not have been a great week to deal with energy policy and \nreducing our dependence on foreign oil, to make America less dependent \nupon the Middle East and the foreign powers that push us around because \nwe need their oil to propel our economy? Would this not have been a \nperfect week to debate affordable and accessible health care for every \nsingle American? Would this not have been a perfect week for us to \ndecide what in the 21st century we need to do to make sure our schools \nprepare our citizens to continue to lead in this world? Would this not \nhave been an important week for us to come together and have a \nmeaningful debate on the war in Iraq which has claimed 2,476 of our \nbest and bravest young men and women?\n  No. The Republican majority said no. They said this is a perfect week \nfor us to come together and discuss a flawed amendment to the \nConstitution, for us to come together on an issue that, sadly, divides \nus rather than unites us as Americans, and to take that time off the \nSenate calendar. I think it is very clear that this is not a voter \npriority. It is not an American priority. When the American people were \nasked in a Gallup Poll in April, ``What do you think is the most \nimportant problem facing this country today,'' this issue came in at \nNo. 33. But for Senator Frist and the Republican majority, it is No. 1 \nthis week. I think most people realize there is political motivation \nhere and that is what it is all about.\n  We should also consider the reality that this is clearly a State \nissue. States have always established the standards for marriage. That \nhas been the tradition in American law, a tradition which would be \nupset and voided by this amendment. Each State may have slightly \ndifferent standards.\n  A few years ago, under a Democratic President, Congress passed the \nDefense of Marriage Act. The Defense of Marriage Act said that no State \nwould be compelled to recognize the standards of another State when it \ncame to same-sex marriage. Now, that means in the State of \nMassachusetts, where gay marriage is allowed, they can make that \ndecision. The people in that State can validate that decision and \ncourts can approve that decision, but they cannot impose that decision \non Kansas, Colorado, Illinois, or Alabama.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act has never been successfully challenged, \nnever been overturned, and it is the law of the land. But it is not \ngood enough for those who propose this amendment. They want more. I \nbelieve that is unfortunate. It is unfortunate when we consider that we \nare taking the precious time of the Senate on an issue which we should \nnot be considering at this moment. The Republican leadership ought to \nlisten to First Lady Laura Bush. She was asked about this amendment \nlast month on ``FOX News Sunday''--the fair and balanced FOX, remember \nthat? This is what she said:\n\n       I don't think it should be used as a campaign tool, \n     obviously.\n\n  That sentiment was echoed last month by the daughter of Vice \nPresident Cheney. This is what she said:\n\n       I certainly don't know what conversations have gone on \n     between Karl [Rove] and anybody up on the Hill, but . . . \n     this amendment . . . is writing discrimination into the \n     Constitution and . . . it is fundamentally wrong.\n\n  Now consider the wise words of another former Senator, a loyal \nRepublican, John Danforth of Missouri--a conservative man, but he \nopposes this amendment. He said this in a recent speech:\n\n       Some historian should really look at all of the proposals \n     that have been put forth throughout the history of our \n     country for possible constitutional amendments. Maybe at some \n     point in time there was one that was sillier than this one, \n     but I don't know of one.\n\n  In fact, over 11,000 constitutional amendments have been proposed by \nMembers of Congress throughout our history. Only 17 of them actually \npassed into the Bill of Rights. Why? Because amending our Constitution \nshould take place under only the most extraordinary circumstances. We \nshould amend it only when it is essential to protect the rights and \nliberties of the American people.\n  I am joined in this belief not only by Democrats but by Senator \nDanforth, the Vice President's daughter, the First Lady, and by many \ntrue conservatives.\n  Listen to what Steve Chapman, a libertarian writer from the Chicago \nTribune, wrote:\n\n       If there is anything American conservatives should revere, \n     it's the U.S. Constitution, a timeless work of political \n     genius. Having provided the foundation for one of the freest \n     societies and most durable democracies on Earth, it shouldn't \n     be altered lightly or often.\n\n  As United States Senators, we take an oath. We solemnly swear to \nsupport and defend this Constitution. I believe part of that oath \nrequires us to take care when it comes to changing the Constitution.\n  I have listened to some of the debate on the floor. The Presiding \nOfficer from Kansas spoke yesterday about marriage in America. I think \nit is a legitimate concern. America's strength is its families. The \nfamily of Americans has been the model--the goal, really--and the \nleadership of our Nation. But to argue for this amendment, suggesting \nthat the increase in births to unmarried women is somehow\n\n[[Page S5521]]\n\nlinked to gay marriage--I don't understand that connection in any way \nwhatsoever. To suggest that lower income level people are less likely \nto marry and that has something to do with gay marriage--I don't \nunderstand that connection, either.\n  If we are truly going to strengthen the American family, would we not \nwant to increase the minimum wage in America, which hasn't been \nincreased by this Republican Congress in 9 years? Would we not want to \nprovide basic health insurance to families so they can have peace of \nmind when their children get sick? Would that not strengthen families? \nWould we not want to make sure we have good-paying jobs in America that \ncreate opportunities so people can look ahead with optimism? Would that \nnot strengthen families and our country? Instead, we have the gay \nmarriage amendment.\n  In the State of Kansas, the former Republican State chairman has \ndecided to become a Democrat. He said he was tired of the culture wars \nthe Republican Party tended to always want to fight. We saw it here in \nthe Congress last year when the House Republicans were in trouble and \nthey brought up the tragic case of Terri Schiavo--an invasion of the \nFederal Government into the most personal, private decision a family \ncould face. Now, again, facing political difficulty, they bring up this \nFederal marriage amendment. It will not pass today. We must set it \nbehind us and move forward on the important agenda the American people \nsent us to Washington to work on. Let us do it in the spirit that \nPresident Bush reminded us of a few weeks ago--building a unified \ncountry, not inciting people to anger or playing on anyone's fears or \nexploiting an issue for political gain.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing amending the \nConstitution, despite the best efforts of those who bring this issue \nbefore us today in S.J. Res. 1. This does not merit inclusion in the \nmost treasured and important document that guides America and its \ndemocracy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate is once again debating an \namendment which proposes to establish a Federal definition of marriage \nin the U.S. Constitution. Only 2 years ago, the Senate rejected a \nsimilar effort.\n  One stated reason for considering this amendment is to protect States \nfrom having to honor the decisions of other States regarding marriage \nlaws. This is unnecessary because 10 years ago this body overwhelmingly \npassed, and President Clinton signed into law, the Defense of Marriage \nAct, DOMA, which I supported, which states that ``No State . . . shall \nbe required to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial \nproceeding of any other State . . . respecting a relationship between \npersons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of \nsuch other State . . . or a right or claim arising from such \nrelationship.'' The Defense of Marriage Act has clearly already defined \n``marriage'' as ``only a legal union between one man and one woman as \nhusband and wife.''\n  Proponents of this amendment argue that it is only a matter of time \nbefore the Federal courts become involved with marriage law, and they \nraise the fear that the Defense of Marriage Act could be struck down by \nso-called ``activist'' judges and courts. However, this simply has not \nbeen the case. This same argument was made in the Senate in 2004, but \nthe Defense of Marriage Act still stands and remains law.\n  Since 2004, DOMA has been upheld three times in Federal courts. In \n2004, a Washington Federal judge upheld DOMA in a case where a couple \nhad obtained a Canadian marriage license. In 2005, a Florida Federal \ndistrict court upheld DOMA as constitutional in a case where a couple \nmarried in Massachusetts sought recognition of their marriage in \nFlorida. And only last month, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld \na lower court decision dismissing a challenge to DOMA in California. \nThere is no particular reason to believe that another pending challenge \ncurrently in district court or future challenges to DOMA will be \nsuccessful.\n  I believe that the laws regarding marriage are matters to be dealt \nwith by the States. My State of Michigan, for example, enacted a \nconstitutional amendment in 2004 which provides that marriages and \nother similar unions shall only be recognized as being between one man \nand one woman. DOMA continues to protect each State's right to define \nmarriage.\n  The language of the proposed constitutional amendment contains a \nnumber of other problems. The amendment reads ``Marriage in the United \nStates shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman. Neither \nthis Constitution, nor the constitution of any State, shall be \nconstrued to require that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be \nconferred upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman.''\n  The principal sponsor of this amendment, Senator Allard, states that \nthis amendment will give ``State legislatures the freedom to address \ncivil unions however they see fit,'' even though this is a power the \nStates already possess. In fact, the very language of this \nconstitutional amendment would make it unconstitutional for the States \nto create civil unions or domestic partnerships in their constitutions \nwith any of the same legal benefits currently afforded to marriage.\n  Our Constitution should not be altered lightly. It has been amended \nonly 17 times since the enactment of the Bill of Rights over 200 years \nago. As former Republican Congressman Bob Barr, the author of the \nDefense of Marriage Act, stated in testimony before the House Judiciary \nCommittee 2 years ago, ``We meddle with the Constitution to our own \nperil. If we begin to treat the Constitution as our personal sandbox, \nin which to build and destroy castles as we please, we risk diluting \nthe grandeur of having a Constitution in the first place.''\n  The Constitution has been amended in the past to broaden and affirm \nthe rights of Americans and never to narrow the rights of a group of \nAmericans. Amendments to our Constitution have freed enslaved Americans \nand given women the right to vote. And it is the first 10 amendments, \nour Bill of Rights, which protect our most cherished freedoms like the \nfreedom of speech.\n  For all these reasons, I will oppose the adoption of this \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, for the past 3 days, the Senate has been \nbogged down debating a constitutional amendment on gay marriage.\n  You might ask yourself, why now? What's the constitutional crisis \nthat needed to be addressed this week? Did the Republican leader bring \nthis legislation to the floor in response to a marriage crisis in the \nUnited States?\n  States, which have had the responsibility of setting marriage laws \nfor two centuries, have taken action on gay marriage as they've seen \nfit. No crisis there.\n  No, this amendment is front and center in the Senate in response to a \npolitical crisis: a crisis in the Republican Party.\n  What is most outrageous to Americans is the cost of this debate in \nopportunities lost to address very clear and present crises in our \ncountry. Debating the constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage \ndisplaces Americans' real priorities--dealing with gas prices and our \ndangerous dependence on foreign oil, providing health care to the 45 \nmillion uninsured, lowering health care costs, advancing stem cell \nresearch, securing our ports, bringing our troops home from Iraq, and \nensuring our returning veterans have the support they need.\n  Why the sudden call from so-called conservatives to take the power to \nregulate marriage away from the States? The Federal Government does not \neven have the jurisdiction to regulate marriage. Since this country was \nfounded, States have had the authority to regulate marriage and other \nfamily-related matters. Currently 49 States limit marriage licenses to \nheterosexual couples, and 18 States have adopted State constitutional \namendments banning same-sex marriages. For over 200 years, this balance \nof power has worked.\n  The Federal Government is not in the business of issuing marriage \nlicenses or dissolving marriages. Congress does not dictate the age at \nwhich people can get married or the grounds for seeking an annulment or \ndivorce. I do not believe the Federal Government even has the power to \nlegislate such things.\n  Should this amendment pass, it would be the first time that the \nConstitution is amended to deny rights to\n\n[[Page S5522]]\n\na particular group of Americans, singling them out for discrimination. \nThe discrimination would not be limited to actual marriages either. The \nwording of the amendment could limit rights afforded under civil \nunions. When similar State amendments were adopted in Ohio, Michigan, \nand Utah, domestic violence laws and health care plans for couples--gay \nand straight--were taken away.\n  In the past, we have amended our Constitution to protect groups of \ncitizens suffering from discrimination, to ensure that everyone enjoys \nthe same basic civil rights. I strongly oppose any effort by the Senate \nto change the course of history in such a dramatic way, and I \nparticularly resent that this is being done for raw political purposes.\n  In 2004 when this amendment was brought up, only 48 Senators \nsupported it. The outcome of today's vote is no surprise. Instead of \nspending 3 days debating a doomed constitutional amendment, we should \nhave spent these 3 days guaranteeing all American children health care, \naddressing record-breaking gas prices, stimulating the economy after a \nmonth of sluggish job growth, or working out a real plan for dealing \nwith the mess in Iraq. We should have been doing the work of the \nAmerican people, but instead we debated a constitutional amendment that \nnever had any hope of passing.\n  Mr. President, I hope that in the future the Senate can get its \npriorities straight, and I am confident that if it doesn't Americans \nwill find their own way of holding the system accountable.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am very troubled by the Senate \nleadership's decision, with limited days remaining in the session, to \nspend valuable time trying to amend the Constitution to define \nmarriage. This issue should not be at the top of our priority list.\n  Unfortunately, it is a recurring theme here in the Senate during \nelection years, to concentrate on issues that fuel partisan politics, \nrather than addressing our country's important needs. For the reasons I \nwill lay out, I will once again oppose a Federal marriage amendment.\n  The Federal marriage amendment comes up at a time when many other \ncritical issues face our Nation. We have soldiers in Iraq and \nAfghanistan fighting wars with no end in sight. Veterans are still not \ngranted adequate medical support, and now have also been exposed to the \nthreat of identity theft. Millions of Americans still have no health \ninsurance, and gas prices are too high.\n  There are many pieces of pending legislation the Senate should be \ntaking up other than the Federal marriage amendment, such as those \naddressing increased support for education, Head Start reauthorization, \nglobal warming, and a rapidly increasing deficit.\n  Some of my colleagues insist that the institution of marriage is \nunder attack by the courts, and, therefore, passage of this \nconstitutional amendment is critical. This argument is questionable at \nbest.\n  In 1996, the Defense of Marriage Act was passed by the Congress and \nsigned into law. This law gives each State the power to determine its \nown marriage laws and not be forced to accept another State's \ndefinition of marriage. I voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act \nbecause I believe in the importance of allowing States, including \nVermont, the right to define marriage in a manner they deem \nappropriate.\n  As of this date, no court has overruled the Defense of Marriage Act. \nIn fact, the court that many of my colleagues consider to be the most \nliberal, the Ninth Circuit, has upheld the Defense of Marriage Act. The \nproponents of a Federal marriage amendment also point to a case in \nNebraska, Equal Protection Inc. v. Brunning, to prove their point. But \nthat case only addressed the right of people to petition the \ngovernment, it did not rule on the definition of marriage. Because the \nDefense of Marriage Act remains the law of the land, each State retains \nthe right to define marriage as it sees fit, rather than have a \ndefinition forced upon it.\n  I am proud that in my State of Vermont, the legislature, in a \nbipartisan manner, was able to pass a law that affords same-sex couples \nthe same legal rights as other married couples. Vermont's civil union \nlegislation proved to the Nation that the rights of marriage do not \nhave to be an exclusive privilege.\n  The Congress should be focusing on unity, not on exclusion and \ndiscrimination. I am proud that during my 32 years in Congress I have \nbeen a supporter of inclusive, unifying pieces of legislation. I have \nbeen a leading advocate of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, the \nPermanent Partners Act, and of expanding the definition of hate crimes \nto include crimes motivated by gender and sexuality.\n  Here in the Senate, the leadership continues to insist on \nprioritizing a Federal marriage amendment. They insist on spending \nfloor time on this amendment when other, more pressing issues remain in \nthe shadows.\n  What message is the Senate sending to the American people? That real \nand pertinent issues can be swept aside so we can discuss a way to \nfurther exclude our fellow Americans? That we would rather spend time \non a partisan fight than expanding our health care programs or \nincreasing funding for education?\n  This is not a message I can support. We must change our focus from \nsymbolic theoretical debates to concrete policy improvements that yield \npositive results for all Americans. I will vote against a Federal \nmarriage amendment, and hope this issue will be laid to rest so the \nSenate can begin addressing the needs of the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me say this has not \nreally been my issue. We have been involved in some other things, but \nit is one about which I cannot remain silent.\n  I have to say I am probably the wrong person to talk about the \nmarriage amendment for a couple of reasons. One reason is I am not a \nlawyer--one of the few in this body who is not a lawyer. However, I \nhave to say sometimes that gives you a better insight into these things \nthan if you are.\n  I enjoyed listening to some of the liberal Democrats on the Sunday \nshows saying they are for a marriage between a man and woman, yet \nimmediately starting to back down, backpedal, and think of every reason \nin the world. It reminds me a little bit of my English as the national \nlanguage amendment that we had a couple of weeks ago. Everyone was \nsaying they were for it, and then they turned around and thought of \nreasons to vote against it. That is what is happening now. What does \nthat tell you? It tells you the vast majority of people in America want \nthis amendment.\n  When they talk about the polling being only 50 percent of the people \nin America supporting a constitutional amendment for marriage between a \nman and a woman, they normally are talking to people who are very much \nfor that but think we can do it some other way. They think there is \nanother way of doing it, that we can do it State by State or we can do \nit statutorily. But it doesn't work out that way.\n  I think, even not being a lawyer, I can see that a State-by-State \napproach to gay marriage will be a logical and legal mess that will \nforce the Federal courts to intervene and require all States to \nrecognize same-sex marriages.\n  Apparently, most people do agree that is the problem. I find all of \nthose who are concerned about the very strong lobby, the homosexual \nmarriage lobby, as well as the polygamous lobby, that they share the \nsame goal of essentially breaking down all State-regulated marriage \nrequirements to just one, and that one is consent. In doing so, they \nare paving the way for legal protection of such practices as homosexual \nmarriage and unrestricted sexual conduct between adults and children, \ngroup marriage, incest, and, you know: If it feels good, do it.\n  When you look at the history of this country, you can see way back in \nthe founding days that the marriage institution was one of the very \nbasic values on which this country was based. Way back in 1878, \nReynolds v. United States, which upheld the constitutionality of \nCongress's antipolygamy laws, also recognized that the one-man/one-\nwoman family structure is a crucial foundational element of the \nAmerican democratic society. Thus, there is a compelling governmental \ninterest in its preservation.\n  That was 1878. That wasn't just the other day. Yet 3 years ago this \nmonth,\n\n[[Page S5523]]\n\nthe U.S. Supreme Court signaled its likely support for same-sex \nmarriage and possibly polygamy and Federal jurisdiction over the issue \nwhen it struck down the sodomy ban in Lawrence v. Texas. That happened \nonly 3 years ago this month. The majority opinion extended the reach of \ndue process in the 14th amendment of the Constitution to protect that.\n  Then they declared--this is significant--they declared:\n\n       [P]ersons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy \n     for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do.\n\n  In his dissenting opinion, Justice Scalia stated:\n\n       The reasoning leaves on pretty shaky grounds state laws \n     limiting marriage to opposite sex couples. . . .\n\n  That is really much of a concern, when a member of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt agrees with my interpretation as to what that particular \ninterpretation meant.\n  Now we face a serious problem. Looking at the various States, right \nnow we have 45 States that have passed laws, statutes, or have passed \nconstitutional amendments to their State constitutions that would do \naway with gay marriage. Look at the percentages.\n  For those people who say less than 50 percent of the people want a \nconstitutional amendment to protect marriage between a man and a wife, \nlook at the percentages. In my State of Oklahoma, it is 76 percent of \nthe people. That is three-fourths of the people. Down in Louisiana, 86 \npercent of the people said marriage should be between a man and a \nwoman. This is 45 States out of 50 States. Only 5 States have not had \nthat type of either statutory change or a constitutional amendment.\n  When you look at the percentages, it is very true that a very large \npercentage of people believe marriage should be between a man and a \nwoman.\n  Let me mention something that has not been mentioned quite enough in \nthis debate. A lot of people are not as emotional about this issue as I \nam. For those who are not, if you look at just the numbers, look at \nwhat is going to happen in this country if we follow some of these \ncountries such as the Scandinavian countries. In those societies, they \nhave redefined marriage. In Denmark, as well as Norway, where they have \nnow had same-sex marriages legalized for over a decade, things that are \nhappening there in terms of the society--it has nothing to do with \nemotions.\n  According to Stanley Kurtz's 2004 article in the Weekly Standard, a \nmajority of children in Sweden and Norway are born out of wedlock.\n  Kurtz says:\n\n       Sixty percent of first-born children in Denmark have \n     unmarried parents.\n\n  That is in Denmark.\n  Not coincidentally, these countries have had something close to full \ngay marriage for a decade or more.\n  Stop and think. What is going to be the result? The result is going \nto be very expensive. Many of these kids are going to end up on \nwelfare, so it goes far beyond just the current emotions. I think my \ncolleague, Senator Sessions, I believe it was yesterday, said:\n\n       If there are not families to raise children, who will raise \n     them? Who will take the responsibility? It will fall on the \n     State. Clearly it will become a State responsibility.\n\n  I am not sure. I have listened to many of my colleagues, for whom I \nhave a great deal of respect, talk about some of the ways the language \nshould be legally changed in one way or another to perhaps accomplish \nsomething or avoid another problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask if I could have a minute and a half more?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Maybe this isn't worded exactly right. But this is the \nonly show in town. It is the only opportunity that we will have to do \nanything. Again, I said maybe I am the wrong person to talk about this. \nI was talking to my brother, Buddy Inhofe, down in Texas. He is a Texas \ncitizen, I say to my friend from Texas over here. He and his wife \nMargaret--he is 1 year older than I am--they have been married for 53 \nyears. Every time they have a wedding anniversary, it is just like \ngetting married again.\n  As you see--maybe this is the most important prop we will have during \nthe entire debate--my wife and I have been married 47 years. We have 20 \nkids and grandkids. I am really proud to say in the recorded history of \nour family, we have never had a divorce or any kind of a homosexual \nrelationship. I think maybe I am the wrong one to be doing this, as I \ncome with such a strong prejudice for strong families.\n  When we got married 47 years ago, there were a couple of things that \nwere said. In Genesis 2:24 it is said:\n\n       Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be \n     joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.\n\n  Matthew 19 says:\n\n       Have you not read that He who made them at the beginning \n     made them male and female, and for this reason a man shall \n     leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and \n     the two shall become one flesh? So then, they are no longer \n     two but one flesh. . . .\n\n  I can assure you that these 20 kids and grandkids are very proud and \nvery thankful that today, 47 years later, Kay and I believed in Matthew \n19:4, that a marriage should be between a man and a woman.\n  Thank you for the additional time.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am generally hesitant to amend the \nConstitution; there are few things as permanent as a constitutional \namendment, and it is something that clearly should not be done lightly. \nHowever, when activist judges repeatedly take steps to overrule the \nclear voice of a majority of the people, we are left with very few \noptions. As we have seen over the past several years, Federal and State \njudges have time and time again struck down traditional marriage \nprotections laws--laws overwhelmingly approved by voter ballot \ninitiatives. This is simply unacceptable, and therefore I will vote in \nfavor of the Marriage Protection Amendment in order to ensure that \ntraditional marriage laws approved by the voters in a majority of the \nStates are protected.\n  In my State of Montana, the people have overwhelmingly spoken on this \nissue on more than one occasion. In 1997, the Montana Legislature \npassed a State law defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Then \nin 2004, the people of Montana approved a ballot initiative by 67 \npercent which amended the Montana Constitution to state: ``Only a \nmarriage between one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as \na marriage in this State.'' Nationally, 19 States have adopted similar \nState constitutional amendments, and 26 more have statutes designed to \nprotect traditional marriage.\n  Unfortunately, the overwhelming consensus of the people is not good \nenough for some. As we have seen over the past several years, a handful \nof activist judges have taken it upon themselves to decide what should \nconstitute marriage. By now, we are all well aware of the actions taken \nby the judges of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. In that \nState, the court essentially mandated same-sex marriage. More recently, \na Federal district court invalidated a Nebraska constitutional \namendment protecting traditional marriage that had earlier been adopted \nwith over 70 percent approval by Nebraska voters. As we debate this \namendment, legal challenges are currently being brought against \ndemocratically approved traditional marriage laws in nine States. I \nfear it is only a matter of time before similar challenges are brought \nagainst the marriage protections approved by the voters of Montana.\n  Personally, I have always believed that marriage is between one man \nand one woman. However, the ultimate decision in an issue as important \nas what constitutes marriage must fully reflect the desire of the \npeople, not just those of us in Washington and certainly not that of a \nhandful of judges. Therefore, the solution is clear: we must send the \nStates a constitutional amendment that protects traditional marriage \nlaws, protects the will of the people, and prevents judicial activism. \nNo other process is guaranteed to prevent the redefinition of marriage.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today, we take up the valuable time of the \nSenate with a proposed amendment to our Constitution that has \nabsolutely no chance of passing.\n  We do this, allegedly, in an attempt to uphold the institution of \nmarriage in this country. We do this despite the fact that for over 200 \nyears, Americans\n\n[[Page S5524]]\n\nhave been defining and defending marriage on the State and local level \nwithout any help from the U.S. Constitution at all.\n  And yet, we are here anyway because it is an election year--because \nthe party in power has decided that the best way to get voters to the \npolls is not by talking about Iraq or health care or energy or \neducation but about a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage that they \nhave no chance of passing.\n  Now, I realize that for some Americans, this is an important issue. \nAnd I should say that, personally, I do believe that marriage is \nbetween a man and a woman.\n  But let's be honest. That is not what this debate is about. Not at \nthis time.\n  This debate is an attempt to break a consensus that is quietly being \nforged in this country. It is a consensus between Democrats and \nRepublicans, liberals and conservatives, red States and blue States, \nthat it is time for new leadership in this country--leadership that \nwill stop dividing us, stop disappointing us, and start addressing the \nproblems facing most Americans.\n  It is a consensus between a majority of Americans who say: You know \nwhat, maybe some of us are comfortable with gay marriage right now and \nsome of us are not. But most of us do believe that gay couples should \nbe able to visit each other in the hospital and share health care \nbenefits; most of us do believe that they should be treated with \ndignity and have their privacy respected by the federal government.\n  We all know that if this amendment were to pass, it would close the \ndoor on much of this--because we know that when similar amendments \npassed in places such as Ohio and Michigan and Utah, domestic \npartnership benefits were taken away from gay couples.\n  This is not what the majority of the American people want. And this \nis not about trying to build consensus in this country; it is not about \ntrying to bring people together.\n  This is about winning an election. That is why the issue was last \nraised in July of 2004, and that is why we haven't heard about it again \nuntil now. And while this is supposedly a measure that the other party \nraised to appeal to some of its core supporters, I don't know how happy \nI would be if my party only talked about an issue I cared about right \naround election time--especially if they knew it had no chance of \npassing.\n  I agree with most Americans, with Democrats and Republicans, with \nVice President Cheney, with over 2,000 religious leaders of all \ndifferent beliefs, that decisions about marriage, as they always have, \nshould be left to the States.\n  Today, we should take this amendment only for what it is--a political \nploy designed to rally a few supporters and draw the country's \nattention away from this leadership's past failures and America's \nfuture challenges.\n  There is plenty of work to be done in this country. There are \nmillions without health care and skyrocketing gas prices and children \nin crumbling schools and thousands of young Americans risking their \nlives in Iraq.\n  So don't tell me that this is the best use of our time. Don't tell me \nthat this is what people want to see talked about on TV and in the \nnewspapers all day. We wonder why the American people have such a low \nopinion of Washington these days. This is why.\n  We are better than this, and we certainly owe the American people \nmore than this. I know that this amendment will fail, and when it does, \nI hope we can start discussing issues and offering proposals that will \nactually improve the lives of most Americans.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak on S.J. Res. 1, the \nMarriage Protection Amendment to the Constitution. Let me begin my \nremarks by stating my position on the issues raised by this amendment.\n  First, it is my strong personal belief that marriage is between a man \nand a woman. Second, principles of federalism dictate that the \nresponsibility to define marriage belongs to the States. Third, the \nproper role of the Federal Government is to ensure that each State can \nexercise that right and responsibility by preventing, as the Defense of \nMarriage Act does, one State from imposing its view on others.\n  The constitutional amendment under consideration would potentially \naffect two types of relationships that are fundamental to our society. \nThe first is the union between a man and a woman. The second is the \ncompact between the States and the Federal Government. In our zeal to \nprotect the former, we must not do unnecessary harm to the latter, as \nit is the bedrock principle of our country's highly successful Federal \nsystem.\n  When the Senate considered this amendment in July 2004, the \nMassachusetts Supreme Court had only recently issued its 4-to-3 \ndecision in the Goodridge case. I urged that we should not overreact to \nthe single decision of a State court and rush to amend the Constitution \nin such a way as to strip away from our States a power they have \nexercised, wisely for the most part, for more than 200 years. I also \nopposed efforts to amend the Constitution without evidence suggesting \nthat States could not be trusted to make decisions in this area for \nthemselves.\n  During the period since our last debate, many States have taken steps \nto define marriage within their borders. Currently, 45 States have \nenacted laws or constitutional amendments protecting marriage. Nineteen \nStates have State constitutional amendments limiting marriage to a man \nand a woman, with 15 States passing State constitutional amendments \nsince our last debate. Twenty-six other States, including Maine, have \nstatutes limiting marriage in some manner. Maine law explicitly states \nthat ``[p]ersons of the same sex may not contract marriage,'' and \nfurther provides that Maine will not recognize marriages performed in \nother jurisdictions that would violate the legal requirements in Maine. \nThus, even if lawfully performed in another State, a same-sex marriage \nwill not be valid in Maine.\n  Voters in at least seven States will consider State constitutional \namendments in 2006 and another four State legislatures are considering \nsending constitutional amendments to voters in 2006 or 2008. And it is \nstill the case, as it was 2 years ago, that no State law has been \nenacted to allow same-sex couples to marry. Nor has a popular \nreferendum to that effect passed in any State.\n  I respect the right of the people of Maine and the citizens of other \nStates to define marriage within their boundaries. Were I a member of \nthe Maine Legislature, I would vote in favor of a law limiting marriage \nto the union of a man and a woman.\n  This does not mean that Congress can play no role in this area. To \nthe contrary, Congress has two very important roles. The first is to \nprotect the right of each State to define marriage within its own \nborders, and the second is to define marriage for Federal purposes.\n  To its credit, Congress did both of these when it enacted the Defense \nof Marriage Act, or DOMA, in 1996. Signed into law by President \nClinton, DOMA enjoyed broad, bipartisan support in both Chambers of \nCongress, passing by a margin of 85 to 14 in the Senate and 342 to 67 \nin the House. The statute grants individual States autonomy in deciding \nhow to recognize marriages and other unions within their borders, and \nensures that no State can compel another to recognize marriages of \nsame-sex couples. Of equal importance, DOMA defines marriage for \nFederal purposes as ``the legal union between one man and one woman as \nhusband and wife.'' I strongly endorse both of the principles codified \nby DOMA.\n  Even though DOMA has not been successfully challenged during the \nnearly 10 years since its enactment, many supporters of the marriage \namendment point to the Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas as \npresaging DOMA's ultimate demise on constitutional grounds. They argue \nthat DOMA's vulnerability necessitates approving the amendment under \nconsideration.\n  I reject that argument. The conclusion that DOMA is inevitably \ndestined to die a constitutional death is inconsistent with language in \nthe Lawrence decision. In striking down a Texas statute criminalizing \ncertain private sexual acts between consenting adult homosexuals, the \nmajority opinion written by Justice Kennedy was careful to note that \nthe case before the Court ``does not involve whether the government \nmust give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual \npersons seek to enter.''\n\n[[Page S5525]]\n\n  In her concurring opinion, Justice O'Connor was even more explicit \nwhen she observed that the invalidation of the Texas statute ``does not \nmean that other laws distinguishing between heterosexuals and \nhomosexuals would similarly fail. . . . Unlike the moral disapproval of \nsame-sex relations--the asserted State interest in this case--other \nreasons exist to promote the institution of marriage beyond mere moral \ndisapproval of an excluded group.'' These statements persuade me that \nthe Supreme Court is, in fact, unlikely to strike down DOMA. In fact, \nin August 2004, a Federal bankruptcy court in Washington State ruled to \nuphold the constitutionality of DOMA, finding that there was no \nfundamental constitutional right to marry someone of the same sex.\n  Let me end where I began. This amendment is not just about \nrelationships between men and women but also about the relationship \nbetween the States and the Federal Government. I would not let a one-\nvote majority opinion of a single State court lead us to ascribe to \nWashington a power that rightfully belongs to the States. To the \ncontrary, our role should be to safeguard the ability of each State to \nexercise that power within its own borders.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I will vote against cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to the Marriage Protection Amendment. This amendment \nis unneeded and unnecessary. It is divisive and it is a distraction \nfrom what the Senate should be doing, which is making families stronger \nand safer. First, I will vote against this amendment because it is \nunnecessary. Congress has already spoken on the issue. There is a \nFederal law and a State law in Maryland that defines marriage as \nbetween a man and a woman. I supported the Federal law because it \nallows each State to determine for itself what is considered marriage \nunder its own State law. And no law--not a Federal law, not a State \nlaw--can force a church, temple, mosque, or any religious institution \nto marry a same-sex couple.\n  I am also opposing this amendment because I take amending the \nConstitution very seriously. In the entire history of the United States \nwe have only amended the Constitution 17 times. Seventeen times in over \n200 years--that's it. We have amended the Constitution to extend \nrights, not to restrict them. We have amended the Constitution to end \nslavery, to give women the right to vote, and to guarantee equal \nprotection of the laws to all citizens. We have never used the \nConstitution as a weapon against a minority of the population, to \ncondone discrimination, and we should not embark on that path today. It \nis wrong and it undermines the integrity of our Constitution.\n  This amendment is about politics; it is not about strengthening \nfamilies. It is about helping Republicans get reelected. If Republicans \nwere serious about helping families they would focus on jobs, health \ncare, the raising cost of energy, and the cost of college tuition. This \nproposed amendment does not create one new job, pay for one bottle of \nprescription drugs, lower prices at the gas pump, or send one child to \ncollege. This amendment does not help a family pay for the health care \nof a sick child. It does not make sure that the parent of that child \nhas a job with health care coverage. What it does is divide. Americans \ndon't want to see this divisive debate as part of this year's \nelections. It is a dangerous distraction; it is an election year ploy.\n  What do the American people want? They want to see how the Congress \nis fighting to make families stronger and safer. They want to see how \nwe are standing up for all families. Families are stronger when we \ncreate jobs, control the costs of health care, and when we make sure \nthat kids and schools have the resources they need to learn and \neducate. Families are stronger when we make sure our children have the \nbest education we can offer and when we put these values in the Federal \nlawbooks and the Federal checkbook. And families are safer and stronger \nwhen they have help raising healthy children, when we build communities \nwhere they can thrive and when we create a family friendly Tax Code. \nThose are the actions that help to strengthen families and family \nvalues, not this amendment.\n  Finally, I believe that we need to recognize the rights of gays and \nlesbians and their families. We should be focusing on helping to \nstrengthen their families and all families. That is where we need to be \nputting our energy and devoting our attention, instead of on this \ndivisive constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr President, today I voted to invoke cloture on the motion \nto proceed to debate the constitutional amendment to ban same-sex \nmarriage. Let me be clear: I have always strongly opposed same-sex \nmarriage. I believe that there is much confusion about the role of the \nFederal Government and the institution of marriage, and that the public \nshould have the benefit of a debate on the matter. It is my belief that \nthe State of ``marriage'' can exist only between a man and a woman. The \nBible tells us that marriage must be defined this way, and that the \nmarriage vow between a husband and wife, meaning between a man and a \nwoman, is sacred. I believe it. I have lived it. My darling wife Erma \nand I were married for nearly 69 years.\n  I also believe that any substantive debate on this issue must examine \nnot only the marriage relationship between a man and a woman but also \nthe constitutional relationship between States and the Federal \nGovernment. It is the role of the Federal Government to preserve each \nState's prerogative to make laws concerning marriage and the family, \nsince this is an area of the law traditionally left to the States. This \nis the essence of federalism. The job of the Congress is to preserve \nand protect the legislative authority of each State, so that, for \nexample, unions legal in another State cannot be foisted onto the God-\nfearing people of West Virginia.\n  Largely because I believe so strongly in protecting West Virginia's \nability to legislate in this area, I have been, and continue to be, an \nardent advocate of the Defense of Marriage Act, DOMA. This law, which \nwas passed by a bipartisan majority of the U.S. Congress and became law \nin September 1996, makes it clear that no State, including West \nVirginia, is required to give legal effect to any same-sex marriage \napproved by another State. DOMA also defines marriage for Federal \npurposes as being ``a legal union between one man and one woman as \nhusband and wife,'' and a spouse as being only ``a person of the \nopposite sex who is a husband or a wife.''\n  I strongly endorse the principles codified by DOMA. Not surprisingly, \nin 2000, West Virginia enacted its own law against same-sex marriage, \nsimilar to DOMA. Thus, title 48 of the West Virginia Code now precludes \nthe State of West Virginia from giving legal effect to unions of same-\nsex couples from other jurisdictions.\n  As a consequence, both State and Federal law now prevent same-sex \nmarriage in West Virginia. With these laws on the books, I do not \nbelieve it is necessary to amend the U.S. Constitution to address this \nissue. States such as West Virginia already have the power to ban gay \nmarriages. State marriage laws should not be undermined by the Federal \nGovernment. Thus, our goal should not be to lessen the power of the \nseveral States to define marriage, but to preserve that right by \nexpressly validating the role that they have played in this arena for \nmore than 200 years.\n  Mr. President, throughout the annals of human experience, the \nrelationship of a man and woman joined in holy matrimony has been a \nkeystone to the stability, strength, and health of human society. I \nbelieve in that sacred union to the core of my being.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S.J. Res. 1, the \nMarriage Protection Amendment. This important legislation, which was \nintroduced by my distinguished colleague from Colorado, is simple and \nstraightforward. It amends the U.S. Constitution to clearly define \nmarriage as the union between one man and one woman.\n  It is important to have this debate because the institution of \nmarriage is under attack by some rogue local officials and activist \njudges who wish to push their agenda onto the majority of Americans. We \nneed to have this debate to give the American people the opportunity to \ndefine marriage as they see fit. We need to remove the definition of \nmarriage from the courts and return the decision making power to the \nAmerican people.\n  Marriage has traditionally been considered the union between a man \nand a\n\n[[Page S5526]]\n\nwoman. State common law practices have always assumed this to be the \ncase. In addition to that, 45 States have some form of protection for \nthe traditional marriage of a man and a woman. These States have done \nso with strong support from their citizens. Nineteen States have gone \nso far as to enact State constitutional amendments to define marriage \nas the union between one man and one woman. Those amendments have \npassed with support averaging more than 71 percent.\n  What do these statistics make clear? The vast majority of Americans \nwant the institution of marriage to be protected. They want to keep it \nas it has been: a union between one man and one woman.\n  How can we be certain that the American people support defining \nmarriage as the union between one man and one woman? By using the \nultimate democratic tool: the constitutional amendment.\n  Amending the Constitution is a rigorous task, and when our Founding \nFathers drafted the Constitution, they worked to ensure that any \ndecision to alter it was a decision that would be made by the American \npeople. In order to amend the Constitution, we must get a two-thirds \nvote in each body of Congress, which as my colleagues know, is no \nsimple task. After that vote has taken place, the proposed amendment is \nsent to the States, where three-fourth's of State legislatures must \nvote to ratify the proposal. That means that 38 of the 50 States must \nsupport this amendment.\n  This is how the Framers of the Constitution intended our government \nto operate. A constitutional amendment places the final decision with \nthe people, where it should be. Courts will no longer have the power to \nlegislate the definition of marriage. Local officials will no longer \nhave the ability to arbitrarily change the rules. The people will make \nthe final call. Considering this amendment and sending it to the States \nfor ratification is, in my opinion, the closest we can get to a truly \ndemocratic self-government.\n  Why is such an amendment necessary? Opponents of S.J. Res. 1 argue \nthat this is a State issue and that our Nation is governed by the \nDefense of Marriage Act. According to the Defense of Marriage Act, no \nState can be forced to recognize the marriage laws of another State. \nAlthough this is true, the Defense of Marriage Act is not exempt from \nthe Constitution, and therefore, is not exempt from the political \nrulings of activist judges.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act will not prevent an activist judge in \nState court from ignoring the will of that State's citizens if that \njudge forces them to redefine marriage. It does not prevent an activist \njudge in Federal court from ignoring the will of the people and forcing \nthem to recognize a definition of marriage that is not their own.\n  The only way to ensure that the American people define marriage is to \npass a constitutional amendment. If the definition of marriage is \nclearly laid out in the Constitution, neither an activist judge nor a \nrogue local official can ignore that definition and impose his or her \nwill on the American people.\n  It is important to note that the Marriage Protection Amendment deals \nonly with the institution of marriage. It does not alter a State's \nright to recognize civil unions or domestic partnerships. It does not \ndeal with a State's ability to confer benefits upon same-sex couples, \nand so State governments can continue to grant those benefits if they \nso choose.\n  Congress must enact the Marriage Protection Amendment to stave off \nthe fragmentation that is sure to happen if different definitions of \nmarriage exist. Passage of the Marriage Protection Amendment is \nnecessary to the end judicial activism that has surrounded the marriage \ndebate. It is necessary so that the American people can define marriage \nfor themselves. And so, in closing, I strongly urge my colleagues to \nvote in favor of the Marriage Protection Amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to support S.J. Res. 1, the \nMarriage Protection Act, because any change to an institution as \nfundamental to our society as marriage should be made by the people, \nnot unelected judges. The constitutional amendment process, being the \nclosest process we have to a national referendum, is the best way for \nthe people to speak on this important issue.\n  By supporting this amendment, I in no way intend to question or \nslight the value and dignity of any American. Nor, in my judgment, do \nmy colleagues who join me in supporting this amendment. Anyone who \nclaims otherwise is wrong. The question that faces this Senate is a \nquestion of means--when something as profound as changing the \ninstitution of marriage arises, how should it be addressed?\n  I submit that a handful of judges in a few States are not empowered \nand should not be permitted to make this decision for the entire \ncountry. But if we do not pass the Marriage Protection Act, that is \nprecisely what may happen.\n  Today, nine States face lawsuits challenging their traditional \nmarriage laws. State supreme courts in New Jersey, Washington, and New \nYork could decide same-sex marriage cases as early as this year. In \nCalifornia, Maryland, New York and Washington, State trial courts have \nalready struck down marriage laws and found a right to same-sex \nmarriage in their States' constitutions. Those decisions are awaiting \nappeal.\n  Same-sex marriage advocates also have made Federal constitutional \nclaims. In Nebraska, a Federal district court struck down that State's \npopularly enacted State constitutional amendment protecting traditional \nmarriage, and the case is on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Eighth Circuit. Challenges to the Defense of Marriage Act--DOMA--\nare also pending in federal district courts in Oklahoma and Washington, \nand before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  These attempts to redefine marriage through the courts have not gone \naway since this body last voted on a constitutional amendment to \nprotect marriage in 2004. Since then, state courts in Washington, New \nYork, California, Maryland, and Oregon have found traditional marriage \nlaws unconstitutional.\n  Every time they have been given the opportunity, the American people \nhave strongly supported a traditional definition of marriage--the union \nof a man and a woman. Forty-five States currently have statutory \nprotection for that very definition of marriage--all but Massachusetts, \nNew Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Rhode Island. Only four States \nhad such statutory protection 12 years ago. The American people have \nmade their wishes known to their State legislators: they are clearly \nand overwhelmingly for protecting marriage as we have always known it.\n  I believe that traditional marriage, the union between a man and a \nwoman, is the cornerstone of our society and the best possible \nfoundation for a family. I believe that traditional marriage, the union \nbetween a man and a woman, should be the only form of marriage \nrecognized by law. And I believe most Americans agree with me. But if \nnothing else, they deserve a chance to be heard.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose S.J. Res. 1, the \nMarriage Protection Amendment, which would bar same-sex marriages and \nprohibit the Federal Government and all States from conferring ``the \nlegal incidents'' of marriage on unmarried couples. I oppose this \namendment on several grounds. First, if passed, this amendment would \nrestrict the rights of an entire class of people. Second, the amendment \nwould turn back the clock on the Supreme Court's decisions guaranteeing \nthe right to privacy. Third, this amendment would abridge the \ntraditional jurisdiction of State governments. Finally, the amendment \nwould compromise the welfare of children currently being raised by \nsame-sex parents.\n  The proposed Marriage Protection Amendment directly contradicts one \nof the Constitution's fundamental principles--the guarantee of equal \nprotection for all. Since the adoption of the Bill of Rights in 1791, \nthe Constitution has been amended only 17 times and, with the exception \nof prohibition, each time it has been to expand the rights of the \nAmerican people. Adoption of the Marriage Protection Amendment would \ntarnish that rich tradition by targeting a specific group for social, \neconomic and civic discrimination. I\n\n[[Page S5527]]\n\nbelieve that, as government leaders, it is our responsibility to \nprotect individual liberties, not to take them away or restrict them.\n  The Marriage Protection Act also undermines the numerous Supreme \nCourt decisions which ensure individuals' right to freedom from \ngovernment interference with regard to their personal lives. The \nSupreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed that the Constitution protects \nan individuals fundamental freedom to make decisions regarding private \nmatters such as marriage and family. The Marriage Protection Act would \ngo a long way toward eroding these constitutional guarantees to the \nright to privacy.\n  Customarily, marriage law has been left to the jurisdiction of the \nStates. Passage of the Marriage Protection Amendment would define \nmarriage at the Federal level and would prohibit States from exercising \ntheir authority over family law issues. As such, it would clearly \nviolate the traditions of federalism and local control that have been a \nproud part of our national heritage. Allowing the Federal Government to \nco-opt what historically has been a prerogative of the States sets a \ndangerous precedent with regard to the erosion of States rights. My \nvote against the Marriage Protection Amendment is a vote for the \npreservation of State sovereignty.\n  Given the Marriage Protection Amendment's broad and ambiguous \nlanguage, it would have a potentially devastating effect on existing \nsame-sex families. In particular, I am concerned how this amendment \nwould impact the children currently being raised by same-sex parents. \nNot only would it curtail States from granting equal marriage rights to \nsame-sex couples, it could also, through their parents, deprive \nchildren of access to health insurance, life insurance benefits and \ninheritance rights. According to the 2000 Census, more than one-half of \nthe same-sex households in the United States have children under the \nage of 18. Passage of the Marriage Protection Amendment could place the \ncurrent well-being and future security of these children at risk. This \nis a chance I am unwilling to take.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to reject this divisive bill. With \nso many problems currently facing our Nation such as the ongoing threat \nof terrorism, soaring gas prices and the high cost of medical care, \nnow, more than ever, we need to work together as an ohana--a family. \nThis amendment will only serve to segregate a portion of our population \nand prevent them from participating as full citizens. Instead I urge us \nall to work together to ensure that the freedoms enumerated by the \nConstitution can be equally enjoyed by all.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Catholic Charities case in Boston, \njust 2 years after the introduction of same-sex marriage in America, \nhighlights the growing concerns and indicates that the impact of this \ndevelopment on religious freedom has ceased to be a hypothetical \ndiscussion.\n  As Maggie Gallagher wrote in her Weekly Standard piece ``Banned in \nBoston,'' ``[w]hen religious-right leaders prophesy negative \nconsequences from gay marriage, they are often seen as overwrought . . \n. [and that the] First Amendment . . . will protect religious groups \nfrom persecution for their views about marriage.''\n  So who is right? Is the fate of Catholic Charities of Boston an \naberration or a sign of things to come? Some say we are overreacting, \nbut the truth is that while the ramifications in the battle for social \npolicy, procreation, and even protecting children may be clear, the \nreal--but hidden--battlelines are for the religious liberty of all \nfaiths. Recently the Becket Fund convened a group of scholars to \ndiscuss the implications of same-sex marriage on religious liberty. \nThis group was from all parts of the political spectrum and had varying \nviewpoints, but all agreed on one thing--the legalization of same-sex \nmarriage posed a real threat to the free exercise of religion.\n  As I mentioned before, one of the participants, Maggie Gallagher, \nwent on to write a prescient account of the participants' views on this \nissue, and I admit it was disturbing to read.\n  In times past, it would have been unthinkable for a Christian or \nJewish organization that was opposed to same-sex marriage to be treated \nas racists or bigots. But today the unthinkable may have become the \ninevitable. As Anthony Picarello summarizes, ``All the scholars we got \ntogether see a problem; they all see a conflict coming. They differ on \nhow it should be resolved and who should win, but they all see a \nconflict coming.'' Why? Because of cases like that of Catholic \nCharities in Boston.\n  As I discussed a little bit on the floor yesterday before I ran out \nof time, Catholic Charities in Boston has been the adoption provider in \nMassachusetts for many of the hardest to place children, including \nchildren with special needs. Following the legalization of same-sex \nmarriage in Massachusetts, the Boston Globe reported that Catholic \nCharities of Boston had placed a small number of children with same-sex \ncouples. Cardinal O'Malley of Boston responded that Catholic Charities \nwould adhere to the Vatican statement prohibiting such placements in \nthe future. That produced a hubbub with the Catholic Charities Board \nthat was later quelled, but if Catholic Charities thought that was the \nend of the issue it was wrong.\n  Like many States, Massachusetts requires that an entity be \n``licensed'' by the State in order to do adoptions. And to get the \nState license, the entity must agree to obey State laws barring \ndiscrimination--including in Massachusetts the prohibition on \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation. When the Massachusetts \nSupreme Court legalized same-sex marriage, discrimination against same-\nsex couples was also prohibited. These requirements juxtaposed with \nCatholic doctrine put the Catholic Church-affiliated Catholic Charities \ninto a bind--one that legislatures, including this one, have often \nsolved by allowing faith-based and religious organizations to maintain \ntheir integrity.\n  Knowing that, Cardinal O'Malley and Governor Romney tried to get a \nreligious exemption for Catholic Charities from the Massachusetts \nlegislature. The silence from the politicians in that State was \ndeafening. Without that protection, the bottom line is that the \nlegislators in Massachusetts chose to put Catholic Charities out of the \nadoption business.\n\n  Some say that the rightwing is pushing to pass this amendment, but I \ntake you back to the scholars from the Becket Fund conference. Marc \nStern, the general counsel for the center-left American Jewish Congress \ncan hardly be called a rightwinger, but when asked what he would say to \npeople who dismiss the threat to free exercise of religion as \nevangelical hysteria his quote was--``It's not hysteria, this is very \nreal . . . Boston Catholic Charities shows that.'' He went on to say \nthat ``in Massachusetts I'd be very worried.'' Stern noted that while \nthe churches themselves might have a first amendment defense if a State \ngovernment or State courts tried to withdraw their exemption, ``the \nparachurch institutions [affiliated organizations such as Catholic \nCharities and United Jewish Communities] are very much at risk and may \nbe put out of business because of the licensing issues, or for these \nother reasons--it's very unclear. None of us nonprofits can function \nwithout [state] tax exemption. As a practical matter, any large charity \nneeds that real estate tax exemption.''\n  Anthony Picarello of the Becket Fund sounded a more ominous note, \nthat this change could fundamentally alter our view of religious \nliberty. ``The impact will be severe and pervasive,'' Picarello says \nflatly. ``This is going to affect every aspect of church-state \nrelations.'' Recent years, he predicts, will be looked back on as a \ntime of relative peace between church and state, one where people had \nthe luxury of litigating cases about things like the Ten Commandments \nin courthouses.''\n  Picarello points out something I discussed yesterday--that the church \nis surrounded on all sides by the government, and often the boundaries \nare hidden because of the ease with which they are navigated. However, \nas he notes, ``because marriage affects just about every area of the \nlaw, gay marriage is going to create a point of conflict at every point \naround the perimeter.''\n  But not all of these scholars agree on the intensity or imminence of \nthese consequences. Doug Kmiec of Pepperdine law school argued that the \npublic could tell the difference between\n\n[[Page S5528]]\n\nracial discrimination and the differentiation of traditional and same-\nsex marriage, saying that racial discrimination is ``irrational, and \nmorally repugnant'' and the issue of same-sex marriage is ``at least \nmorally debatable.'' Doug Laycock, a religious liberty expert at the \nUniversity of Texas law school, noted that the legal situation is a \nlong way away from equating sexual orientation with race in the law. \nHowever, Stern and Feldblurn were much more clear on the coming legal \nissues that religious organizations will face in the wake of same-sex \nmarriage.\n  And it is that distinction that is important--if sexual orientation \nis like race, then anyone, religious or otherwise, who opposes same-sex \nmarriage will be viewed as and likely treated in the same way as the \nbigots who opposed interracial marriage. It is the political pressure--\nand in some cases the legal pressure--that will ``punish'' those of \ndiffering opinions.\n  For Chai Feldblum, a Georgetown law professor who refers to herself \nas a leader in the movement to advance LGBT--lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntranssexual--rights, the emerging conflicts between free exercise of \nreligion and sexual liberty are real. ``''When we pass a law that says \nyou may not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, we are \nburdening those who have an alternative moral assessment of gay men and \nlesbians.'' Raised an Orthodox Jew, Feldblum argues that ``the need to \nprotect the dignity of gay people will justify burdening religious \nbelief, [b]ut that does not make it right to pretend these burdens do \nnot exist in the first place, or that the religious people the law is \nburdening don't matter.''\n\n  What effects could this ``sea change'' have on religious liberty? \nLet's consider a few examples.\n  A religious educational institution could have its admissions \npolicies, employment practices, housing rules, and regulation of clubs \nchallenged. For example, Marc Stern is concerned about a California \ncase where a private Christian high school expelled two girls who \naccording to the school announced they were in a lesbian relationship. \nWill the schools be forced to tolerate both conduct and proclamations \nby students they believe to be acting in a sinful manner?\n  Public accommodation laws can be used to force commercial enterprises \nto serve all comers, which begs the question of whether religious \ncamps, retreats, or homeless shelters are considered places of public \naccommodation. Could a religious summer camp operated in strict \nconformity with religious principles refuse to accept children coming \nfrom same-sex marriages? What of a church-affiliated community center, \nwith a gym and a Little League, that offers family programs? Must a \nreligious-affiliated family services provider offer marriage counseling \nto same-sex couples designed to facilitate or preserve their \nrelationships?\n  Licensing issues will continue to be a bone of contention in not only \nadoption but psychological clinics, social workers, and marital \ncounselors. We had to face this issue already in the Access to Recovery \nProgram where program administrators were interpreting language in a \nway that sought to penalize faith-based providers such as Teen \nChallenge.\n  And there are probably a plethora of other areas of friction that \nwill emerge.\n  Will speech against same-sex marriage be allowed to continue \nunfettered?\n  Will anyone be able to again say that marriage should be between a \nman and a woman without being branded a bigot?\n  Will a minister be able to preach from I Corinthians 6:9 that the \nunjust and immoral such as adulterers, prostitutes and sodomites will \nnot inherit the earth?\n  Will our local Catholic Charities lose their tax-exempt status if \nthey do not bend their religious faith to the new norm?\n  Will a rabbi or priest be forced to preside over same-sex marriages \nin order to continue to be able to consecrate traditional marriages?\n  The scope of the ramifications of this debate are unclear, but there \nis no doubt that very serious issues arise. As Maggie Gallagher noted \nin her article, ``Marc Stern is looking more and more like a reluctant \nprophet: `It's going to be a train wreck,' he said `A very dangerous \ntrain wreck.' ''\n  I urge my colleagues to think carefully about the implications of \ndoing nothing to protect the sanctity of marriage. If we do not act, \nthen not only are we leaving this important issue in the hands of \nunelected judges, we are leaving the fate of all of these faith-based \norganizations in their hands as well. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment. Let's move forward in the democratic process and let \nthe people decide.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. One minute 43 seconds.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute 15 seconds to the Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the people of the United States do care \nabout marriage. Marriage is important. Our culture and the quality of \nlife of our people in this Nation are important.\n  Just yesterday, the people of my State, by an 81-percent majority, \napproved a constitutional amendment to the Alabama Constitution which \nsaid that no marriage license shall be issued in Alabama to parties of \nthe same sex and the State shall not recognize a marriage of parties of \nthe same sex that occurred as a result of the law of any other \njurisdiction. But that amendment is in jeopardy by the court rulings in \nthe United States, and a ruling that the U.S. Constitution requires \nthat same-sex marriage be recognized just like other marriages will \ntrump Alabama's constitution and that of the 19 other States which \npassed such resolutions by a vote of 71 percent.\n  The only reason to oppose this amendment would be to deny the States \nthe right to make this decision without having it overruled by the \nSupreme Court.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, you just heard the latest report from \nAlabama, a state constitutional amendment protecting marriage just \npassed with 81 percent of the vote. That is what my amendment is all \nabout--to protect that vote conducted in Alabama from being subverted \nby a minority of activists going to court to try to overturn a vote \nlike we just saw in Alabama.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for S.J. Res. 1.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy, is on his way to the Chamber. I know the time \nis running. I will speak until he arrives. I wanted to make a point or \ntwo based on arguments used in this debate.\n  Mr. President, 45 of 50 States passed either a constitutional \namendment or a law defining marriage as between a man and a woman--45 \nof 50 States. There is only one State in America where same-sex \nmarriage is legal, and that is Massachusetts. No other State, county, \ncity, or anyplace in America permits same-sex marriage.\n  Incidentally, it is ironic that the State with the lowest divorce \nrate in America happens to also be Massachusetts. There is simply no \ncrisis or controversy before us today that requires amending the \nConstitution.\n  Another reason I oppose this amendment, as I indicated earlier, is \nthat the language is vague and overbroad. The reference to ``legal \nincidents'' of marriage is troubling. The Senate Judiciary Committee \nheld hearings on the meaning of the term ``legal incidents'' of \nmarriage. I attended those hearings and questioned witnesses. There was\n\n[[Page S5529]]\n\nsimply no consensus on how the courts might interpret that.\n  Some of the witnesses predicted courts would read it to ban civil \nunions. Some even think this amendment would be read by the courts to \nprohibit other efforts to equalize benefits, such as domestic partner \nbenefits, adoption rights, and even hospital visitation rights.\n  Is that what we want to do in the Senate, ban those who have a loving \nrelationship from visiting their partners who are sick in a hospital? \nPassage of the Federal marriage amendment may well have that effect. We \ndon't know.\n  It is also a bad idea because it exemplifies the excessive \noverreaching by Congress into the personal lives and privacy of \nAmerican citizens. How many times will the Republican majority march us \ninto this question as to whether we can protect and defend the privacy \nof our rights as individuals and families?\n  As I mentioned earlier, it is a sad reminder of the debate over the \ntragedy of Terri Schiavo, a woman who was sustained with medical care \nfor some 15 years, and when the decision was made not to provide \nadditional care for her through the courts, there was an effort made by \nthe Republican leadership in Congress to bring the Federal courts into \nthe picture to overturn the family's personal decision and the decision \nof the Florida courts. Congress tried to impose its own morality and \nits own will over the most personal, private, and painful decision any \nfamily can face. This amendment would impose the morality of some on \nthe lives of all.\n  A few months ago, this Nation lost one of its most famous and \nforemost civil rights leaders, Coretta Scott King. Upon Mrs. King's \ndeath, Majority Leader Frist submitted a Senate resolution to honor her \nlife and commitment to social justice, and it was adopted unanimously.\n  I wonder if the majority leader is aware of what Mrs. King had to say \nabout the constitutional amendment that Senator Frist has brought to \nthe floor this week. Here is what she said in 2004:\n\n       A constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages is a \n     form of gay-bashing and it will do nothing at all to protect \n     traditional marriages.\n\n  I hope the Republican leadership, I hope every Senator, takes to \nheart the words of the civil rights hero they were so quick to honor a \nfew months ago.\n  It has been my experience in life that some members of my family, \nmany of my acquaintances and friends are people of different sexual \norientation. Most of them want to be left alone. They want the privacy \nof their own lives. They want to make their own decisions. And here we \nhave an effort to impose in our Constitution a standard which reaches \ninto the legal incidents of marriage, a standard which could deny to \nthem some of the most basic things which we treasure, such as access to \nhealth insurance, access to visitation in hospitals, and the common \ndecency of the social relationship which is all they are asking.\n  Under those circumstances, I think it is important for us to reflect \non the fact that when it comes to amending this Constitution, we should \nbe ever so careful because a change in a few words in the Constitution \ncan have a dramatic long-term negative impact on this great Nation.\n  I see that my colleague, Senator Leahy, has arrived. I yield the \nfloor to him.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 minute 15 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nIllinois.\n  This morning we will be voting on whether to proceed to a proposed \namendment to the Constitution. I strongly oppose this divisive \nexercise.\n  At a time when the Senate should be addressing Americans' top \npriorities, including ways to make America safer, the war in Iraq, \nrising gas prices, health care and health insurance costs, stem cell \nresearch, the erosion of Americans' privacy and the reauthorization of \nthe Voting Rights Act, the President's political strategists and the \nRepublican Senate leadership, instead, try to divide and distract from \nfixing real problems by pressing forward with this controversial \nproposed constitutional amendment.\n  Rather than seek to divide and diminish, the Senate could be working \nagainst discrimination. I was honored to sponsor the Mychal Judge \nPolice and Fire Chaplains Public Safety Officers' Benefit Act of 2002 \nto ensure that the survivors of 9/11 were treated fairly regardless of \nsexual orientation. If we really want to do something that the Senate \ncan do, we should join together in a bipartisan way to pass the hate \ncrimes bill that would help stamp out and punish violent crimes against \nthose attacked because of the color of their skin or their nationality \nor sexual orientation. If we really want to do something worthy of the \nSenate we should debate and pass legislation to end discrimination in \nemployment based on sexual orientation. If we want to recognize the \ndignity and worth of others we should consider S. 1278, the Uniting \nAmerican Families Act, a bill I introduced to bring fairness to our \nimmigration laws.\n  The Constitution is too important to be used for partisan political \npurposes. It is not a billboard on which to hang political posters or \nslogans seeking to stir public passions for political ends.\n  I want all Americans to appreciate that if this proposed amendment \nbecame part of our Constitution, it would represent a dramatic \ndeparture from this Nation's history of expanding freedom and \nindividual rights. We have only amended the Constitution seventeen \ntimes since the Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791. None of these \namendments has served to limit the rights of an entire class of \nAmericans. Furthermore, none of these amendments has dictated to the \nStates how they should interpret their own constitutions. This proposal \nnot only enshrines discrimination in the Constitution, it usurps what \nhas always been the function of the States with regard to defining \nmarriage. When each of us became Senators we swore an oath ``to support \nand defend the Constitution of the United States.'' I will honor that \noath by opposing this effort to inject discrimination into the \nConstitution.\n  This attempt will once again fail to garner the necessary votes to \nproceed. But that should not excuse the Republican leadership's turning \naway from the legislative agenda of the Senate for this election year \nadventure. I hope that the American people will object to this misuse \nof the Senate's time and authority the way they did when the Senate \ninjected itself into the Schiavo matter not so long ago. The American \npeople want their leaders to unite this country and to solve real \nproblems that they face every day. This constitutional amendment is a \ndivisive political effort to shore up sagging poll numbers. I believe \nthe American people will not be fooled and will see through this \nexercise.\n  I look forward to moving on to the Nation's real priorities. The \nSenate should return to a place where we consider solutions to the \nproblems that plague hardworking Americans, from soaring gas prices and \nhigh health care costs to corporate and Government corruption, from \nnational security to effective fiscal and trade policies. We might \nconsider taking action to preserve and improve rather than pollute the \nenvironment. Someday this Chamber might even debate the ongoing \npandemic of AIDS or protect against the impending pandemic from bird \nflu. We might join in effective action seeking to halt the genocide in \nDarfur or oversight of the allegations of Government violations of the \nrights of Americans. I look forward to that time.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned Monday at the start of this debate that \nover the last several years I have repeatedly written to the President \nabout this issue and have yet to receive a response. I have already \nincluded in the Record a copy of my most recent letter to him on this \nconstitutional amendment in which I asked what precise language it is \nthat he supports and what it means.\n  I noted that President Bush said in 2004 that ``States ought to be \nable to have the right to pass laws that enable people to be able to \nhave rights like others,'' but no such thing is guaranteed by the \nproposed amendment that we are considering.\n  The appearance of the President this week, where he reread what \nappeared to be a longer draft of his Saturday radio address to a \nhandpicked audience of those seeking to amend the Constitution to write \ndiscrimination into it and create a constitutional intrusion\n\n[[Page S5530]]\n\ninto family law issues that have always been left to the States, was \ntroubling in so many ways. At least that event was moved out of the \nWhite House Rose Garden, for which I am grateful. Sadly, the audience, \nwhich the White House described as a diverse cross section of community \nleaders, scholars, family organizations and religious leaders, was \nselected apparently to exclude gays and lesbians. That is hardly the \nway to engender fair and open debate or to show tolerance or to honor \nthe dignity of all Americans.\n  As this debate opened, I quoted the President's thoughtful words from \nthe immigration debate. He said: ``We cannot build a unified country by \ninciting people to anger, or playing on anyone's fears, or exploiting \nthe issue of immigration for political gain. We must always remember \nthat real lives will be affected by our debates and decisions, and that \nevery human being has dignity and value. . . .'' I wish that yesterday \nthe President had honored that thought and merely substituted the issue \nof ``marriage'' for ``immigration''. The President is seeking to show \nleadership in the immigration debate and I have commended him for it. I \ncannot commend him for what he did yesterday.\n  Just before the last election, President Bush said that ``States \nought to be able to have the right to pass laws that enable people to \nbe able to have rights like others.'' He cannot square that position \nwith his and his administration's recently announced support for a \nproposed constitutional amendment that prohibits States from conferring \nthe ``legal incidents'' of marriage on same-sex couples. In January \n2005, after he was reelected, President Bush himself recognized that \nthis proposed constitutional amendment was not going to be adopted and \nthat no good purpose was served by forcing more Senate debate on it. \nYesterday, the President did not well serve this Nation or its diverse \npopulation. Our Nation would be better served if we refrained from \ndivisiveness to score political and emotional points before an \nelection.\n  Moreover, yesterday the President's activities demonstrated how the \nRepublican leadership's misplaced priorities and politics have diverted \nthe Senate from matters that concern and affect the American people. By \nway of contrast, the Democratic leader went to the Senate floor to urge \nthat we proceed to conference on the recently passed immigration bill. \nSenate Republicans objected to a usual practice of taking of a House-\npassed bill and inserting the language passed by the Senate so that we \ncan proceed to a House-Senate conference. Instead of spending time \npandering to a segment of Republican's political base, the President \ncould have worked with us to make progress on our bipartisan \nimmigration initiative. Republicans and Democrats have said that we \nwill need the President's help to make comprehensive immigration reform \na reality. Yesterday the President was AWOL on the issue. He was not \nexpending his efforts urging comprehensive immigration reform on the \nrecalcitrant Republican House leadership or helping us in the Senate \novercome threats of procedural objections to proceeding to conference.\n  Another consequence of the Republican leadership's misplaced \npriorities is that the Judiciary Committee has yet to complete hearings \non reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. This is bipartisan, \nbicameral legislation on which I had hoped hearings would be complete. \nThe final hearing on the reauthorization of important minority language \nprovisions was scheduled for tomorrow. It has been postponed, and the \nexcuse is that the Senate debate on this proposed constitutional \namendment takes precedence. So our efforts to enact meaningful, \ncomprehensive immigration reform with strong border security and a path \nto earned citizenship and our efforts to reauthorize the protections of \nthe Voting Rights Act have both been adversely affected as a \nconsequence of the Republican leadership insisting on proceeding to \nthis extended debate.\n  The demagoguery in the President's rally this week and the Statement \nof Administration Policy are sad to see. It is not the institution of \nmarriage that is under attack but the Constitution and our system of \nfederalism. They seek to justify their attack by demonizing judges. The \ncomment the President added to his radio address was to ratchet up the \nrhetoric against judges by proclaiming that judges ``insist on imposing \ntheir arbitrary will on the people.'' This President just appointed \nChief Justice Roberts to lead the U.S. Supreme Court and the judicial \nbranch of the Federal Government. He has appointed approximately 250 \nFederal judges, including 2 Supreme Court Justices and 45 judges on the \ncourts of appeals. The majority of Federal judges have been appointed \nby Republican Presidents. Any judicial decision that was a dramatic \ndeparture from the status quo on this issue would certainly be appealed \nto the U.S. Supreme Court where seven out of nine justices have been \nappointed by Republican Presidents. Does anyone really believe that \nChief Justice Roberts is going to preside over a U.S. Supreme Court \nthat imposes same-sex marriage as an act of ``arbitrary will''?\n  I agree with the Senior Senator from Virginia who recently voiced his \n``grave concerns'' about the proposed amendment because it fails to \n``speak with the clarity to which the American People are entitled.'' I \ntoo have significant concerns about the vague prohibition of ``the \nlegal incidents'' of marriage for same-sex couples. That ambiguity \nraises serious questions whether State laws allowing civil unions and \ncivil partnerships would be overridden and rendered \n``unconstitutional.'' Numerous witnesses at our committee hearings \ntestified that the proposed language would or could invalidate civil \nunions or prevent States from enacting laws that closely mirrored the \nrights of marriage couples.\n  Although the President and some Senate supporters contend that this \nproposed amendment binds only judges and not State legislatures and \nthat it prohibits only marriage but not civil unions or partnerships, \nthat is not clear in the language of the proposed constitutional \namendment. Ironically, it will be judges who have the last word in \ndetermining the meaning of words used in a constitutional amendment. So \nthe very ``boogeymen'' that the proponents of this proposed \nconstitutional amendment seek to create by demonizing judges will be \nthose who will be forced to decide the effect of its intentionally \nambiguous wording.\n  I trust the American people will see through these escapades. I trust \nthey will abhor the attack on the Constitution as I do. I believe they \nhave bigger hearts and compassion of the families of committed same-sex \ncouples. I hope they will hold accountable those who are expending the \nSenate's time on this futile exercise by denying them partisan gain.\n  I have previously noted that the news accounts and editorials \ncharacterizing this effort as crassly political are too numerous to \ninclude in the Congressional Record. On this occasion, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record a sampling from a variety of \nnewspapers and outlets from around the country including editorials \nfrom the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette from May 24, 2006, the Atlanta \nJournal-Constitution from May 28, 2006, the Berkshire Eagle from May \n23, 2006, the Chicago Sun-Times from June 6, 2006, the Pittsburgh Post-\nGazette from May 22, 2006, the Salt Lake Tribune from April 29, 2006, \nand a commentary by CNN's Jack Cafferty from June 2, 2006.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    [From the (Little Rock) Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, May 24, 2006]\n\n                  Democrats Must Confront GOP Strategy\n\n                            (By Gene Lyons)\n\n       So here's the big Republican agenda for the 2006 elections: \n     Other people's sex lives (a.k.a. gay marriage), flag-burning, \n     illegal Mexican immigrants, tax cuts and Chicken Little.\n       There's no surprise about the first few. A GOP campaign \n     resembles a traveling tent show. White House sideshow barker \n     Karl Rove expects that the rubes who line up every two years \n     to see the two-headed calf and the bearded lady will fall for \n     flag-burning again. Never mind that Republicans have done \n     nothing about it since President Bush's father visited a flag \n     factory during his 1988 campaign. Flag burning as a protest \n     all but disappeared after 9/11. Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., \n     also has joined this crusade, the surest sign that she's \n     contemplating running for president in 2008.\n       Amending the Constitution to forbid gay marriage is another \n     election-year shell game. Finessing it shouldn't be too hard \n     for\n\n[[Page S5531]]\n\n     Democrats. If your church refuses to solemnize same-sex \n     marriages, that's its undeniable First Amendment right. \n     Forbidding people to enter into domestic partnership \n     contracts due to sexual orientation, however, would be un-\n     American.\n       No, that won't persuade obsessive homophobes, but they're \n     fewer all the time. Illegal immigration's something else \n     Republicans have ignored for six years. Ironically, Bush's \n     stance reflects the ``compassionate conservatism'' he \n     campaigned on in 2000 but abandoned, maybe because Mexican \n     immigration is a very old story in Texas that he actually \n     knows something about.\n       Ironically, that's got the GOP's Knothead faction all riled \n     up, helping GOP congressmen in safe districts distance \n     themselves from an increasingly unpopular White House, but \n     also hurting Republicans among Hispanic voters in swing \n     districts.\n       Ditto tax cuts. Even the most credulous are getting uneasy \n     with the GOP's ongoing war on arithmetic and worried about \n     spiraling debt caused by Bush's profligate spending.\n       Influential conservative author-activist Richard A. \n     Viguerie recently wrote a Washington Post op-ed predicting \n     that ``without a drastic change in direction, millions of \n     conservatives will . . . stay home this November. And maybe \n     they should. Conservatives are beginning to realize that \n     nothing will change until there's a change in the GOP \n     leadership. If congressional Republicans win this fall, they \n     will see themselves as vindicated, and nothing will get \n     better.'' Which brings us to the Chicken Little theme on \n     which Republican hopes appear to hinge. Sen. Elizabeth Dole, \n     R-N.C,, first raised it in a recent fund-raising letter on \n     behalf of the party's Senatorial Campaign Committee. If \n     Democrats regain Congress, see, they'll act the way \n     Republicans acted toward Bill Clinton, calling for ``endless \n     investigations, congressional censure and maybe even \n     impeachment of President Bush.'' And then the terrorists \n     would win!\n       Many pundits who helped publicize the 1,000-odd subpoenas \n     that congressional Republicans dispatched to the Clinton \n     White House find the prospect of Democrats issuing subpoenas \n     terribly alarming. Slate's John Dickerson worries that a \n     Democratic-led House might ``get bogged down with \n     investigations and embrace the worst Bush-hating tendencies \n     of its members.'' Time columnist Joe Klein, a.k.a. \n     ``Anonymous,'' author of the novel'' Primary Colors,'' who's \n     grown adept at advancing Gap themes while affecting to \n     deplore them, laments that the likely succession of Rep. John \n     Conyers, D-Mich., to chair the House Judiciary Committee if \n     Democrats win in November gives Republicans a chance to play \n     the race card.\n       Because Conyers is African American and has sometimes used \n     the words ``Bush'' and ``impeachable offense'' in the same \n     sentence, Klein fears that Rove will have a field day \n     depicting the veteran Detroit congressman as Kenneth Starr in \n     blackface.\n       The idea that irrational hatred of Bush motivates most \n     Democrats is a favorite topic on the talkradio right. \n     Psychologists call it ``projection,'' attributing to others \n     motives that mirror your own.\n       The best way for Democrats to deal with this Chicken Little \n     theme is straight on, as Conyers has attempted to do. In a \n     recent Washington Post column, he correctly identified the \n     ``straw-man'' logical fallacy that underlies it: attacking \n     arguments your adversary has never actually made.\n       Years of one-party government, Conyers said, have left \n     Americans with many unanswered questions, such as ``whether \n     intelligence was mistaken or manipulated in the run-up to the \n     Iraq war . . . the extent to which high-ranking officials \n     approved of the use of torture . . . whether the leaking of \n     the name of a covert CIA operative was deliberate or \n     accidental'' and who did it.\n       Any alert citizen can add particulars: the legality of \n     National Security Agency's warrantless wiretaps and the \n     constitutionality of Bush's 740 ``signing statements,'' as \n     reported by The Boston Globe, in which the president claims \n     the power to ignore laws with which he disagrees.\n       Conyers wisely stresses that the GOP-led House impeachment \n     of Clinton proved ``that partisan vendettas ultimately \n     provoke a public backlash and are never viewed as \n     legitimate.'' Nobody wants a government that does nothing but \n     investigate itself. But the Republican Congress has \n     completely abdicated its constitutional responsibilities. Our \n     democracy cannot long survive a president who claims the \n     prerogatives of a king.\n       That's an argument the Democrats must win.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, May 28, 2006]\n\n            On Gay Unions, Pandering Rises Above Principles\n\n                          (By Cynthia Tucker)\n\n       In 1964, just one congressman from the Deep South, \n     Atlanta's Charles Weltner, voted for the Civil Rights Act. \n     For all practical purposes, his righteous leadership on civil \n     rights--he also supported the Voting Rights Act--cost him his \n     congressional career.\n       In 1966, he resigned his seat rather than sign an act of \n     loyalty to the segregationist Lester Maddox, as Georgia \n     Democrats insisted. But some analysts believe he would have \n     lost the race for re-election.\n       Doing the right thing is difficult because it often means \n     losing. And the typical politician is willing to lose \n     anything--honor, integrity, dignity--but an election.\n       That helps explain why, during this election season, so few \n     politicians have stepped forward to denounce initiatives \n     against gay marriage as the cynical and opportunistic tactics \n     that they are. They know that playing on prejudice and fear \n     can rally a certain constituency and provide the winning \n     margin in tight races.\n       It certainly worked two years ago. Republican tacticians \n     maneuvered to add amendments against gay marriage to the \n     ballots in 11 States, including Georgia. The result was to \n     lure religious conservatives to the polls in large numbers, \n     probably giving President Bush the boost he needed in the \n     battleground state of Ohio.\n       This year, conservative Republicans--struggling against \n     voter discontent over Iraq, health care and high gas prices, \n     among other things--are desperate to bring those religious \n     conservatives back to the polls. So they've resurrected the \n     same tired tactic. Next month, the Senate is expected to vote \n     on an amendment to the U.S. Constitution banning same-sex \n     unions.\n       Senate leaders haven't made much of an effort to disguise \n     the initiative as anything other than the base political ploy \n     that it is. After a frenzy of gay-bashing during the 2004 \n     campaign season--they thundered against gay marriage as a \n     threat to just about every family tradition, from man-woman \n     marriages to peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches--Republican \n     leaders hadn't even mentioned the issue again. The threat \n     disappeared for two years. Until now, when they're facing the \n     prospect of losing control of Congress.\n       Given the stakes, prominent Republicans won't get in the \n     way of a good wedge issue. Oh, first lady Laura Bush has \n     pointed out the unfairness of a constitutional amendment. So \n     has Mary Cheney, the vice president's gay daughter, who lives \n     openly with her partner of 14 years, Heather Poe, and has \n     recently published her memoirs. This month, Cheney told CNN \n     that ``writing discrimination into the Constitution of the \n     United States is fundamentally wrong.''\n       But it's unlikely you'll hear the vice president arguing \n     against the amendment so pointedly on the campaign trial. \n     While he has said in the past that he opposes it, he'd rather \n     remind his right-wing supporters of his staunch support for \n     the invasion of Iraq. President Bush, for his part, has spent \n     his last pennies of political capital trying to pass a humane \n     policy on immigration. He may not fight for an amendment \n     banning gay marriage, but he's unlikely to get in the way of \n     it, either.\n       In Georgia, meanwhile, even progressive politicians have \n     been cowed by the state's overwhelming consensus against gay \n     marriage. Though 76 percent of Georgia voters approved the \n     ban two years ago, a Superior Court judge recently struck \n     down the amendment on technical grounds. After the ruling, \n     Gov. Sonny Perdue, a Republican, quickly announced plans for \n     a special session of the legislature to rewrite the ban and \n     place it before voters again in November. His two Democratic \n     opponents, Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor and Secretary of State Cathy \n     Cox, rushed to support the move.\n       Cox's awkward leap onto the bandwagon was especially \n     disappointing. While Taylor had supported the ban, Cox had \n     pointed out two years ago that the amendment is \n     ``unnecessary.'' Georgia law, like federal law, already bans \n     same-sex unions. But many analysts have noted that Cox is \n     desperate to draw black voters away from Taylor in the \n     Democratic primary for governor; black Georgians, like their \n     white neighbors, gave their unabashed support to enshrining \n     bigotry in the stare Constitution.\n       Cox, like most other politicians, would rather pander to \n     the prejudices of voters than stand by her principles. It's a \n     perfectly human inclination--doing the safe thing, rather \n     than the right thing.\n       There are never more than a handful like Wettner, who \n     preferred losing a campaign to sacrificing his conscience. In \n     his resignation speech, he declared, ``I love the Congress, \n     but I will give up my office before I give up my principles . \n     . .

Gays are not a \n     threat to America, but congressmen who would tinker with the \n     Constitution to protect their seats assuredly are.\n       By a 10-8 vote that fell strictly along party lines, the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee last week approved a \n     constitutional amendment that would ban gay marriage. The \n     constitution has been amended 27 times, but always to protect \n     civil liberties or to provide them to groups that didn't have \n     them. This would be the first time that the Constitution was \n     amended specifically to deprive a group of civil liberties, \n     adding to the general assault by Washington on the rights of \n     Americans.\n       The full Senate is expected to vote on the amendment when \n     it returns from its Memorial Day recess, and while it will be \n     difficult for the measure to win the necessary two-\n\n[[Page S5532]]\n\n     thirds majority required to begin the amendment process, \n     passage is not the primary goal of the GOP. By simply \n     proposing the amendment, it hopes to gain support of a \n     religious right that puts social issues above all else. A \n     party with nothing but domestic and foreign policy failures \n     on its resume can't afford to lose its rabid rightwingers if \n     it hopes to maintain power in Congress this November. It's a \n     strategy that for all its cynicism worked two years ago when \n     gay marriage was on several state ballots.\n       First Lady Laura Bush, often the voice of reason in the \n     White House, went on Fox News earlier this month to urge \n     Congress to abandon these efforts on the grounds that the gay \n     marriage issue is too complex to be handled legislatively and \n     civil rights should not be deprived by a governmental body. \n     Ms. Bush's stance is a traditional conservative one, but the \n     ``conservatives'' who hold sway in the modern Republican \n     Party are in fact radicals whose affection for big government \n     and disregard for the civil rights of Americans should be \n     abhorrent to true conservatives. A question to be answered \n     Election Day is whether true Republicans will reclaim their \n     party and principles.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Chicago Sun Times, June 6, 2006]\n\n                   Senate Should Focus on Real Issues\n\n       Even by Congress' smoke-blowing standards, the insistence \n     of Republicans on debating a constitutional amendment to ban \n     gay marriage reeks of politics--election-year politics, \n     whatever White House press secretary Tony Snow's doubts about \n     this not being ``a big driver among voters.'' You would think \n     more pressing issues would command attention in the Senate. \n     Such a ban has failed before there, with all but one Democrat \n     opposing it. You would think its scant chance of passing--it \n     would require a two-thirds majority in both chambers and then \n     approval by three-quarters of the states--would take the hot \n     wind out of the anti-gay-marriage faction's sails.\n       But with public approval of the president low, Republicans \n     are convinced restirring the emotions of this issue will \n     rally support for him and those GOP hopefuls looking to \n     November. President Bush is right about not wanting judges, \n     ``activist'' or not, to decide this issue. It should, as he \n     said, be left ``where it belongs: in the hands of the \n     American people.'' But the last time we looked, most \n     Americans were more concerned about national security, \n     immigration and the avian flu than they were the supposed \n     threat of wedded gays. The federal government should honor \n     states' rights and let them make this call.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 22, 2006]\n\n        Family Feud; Sparks Fly in the Senate Over Gay Marriage\n\n       Something petty--a shouting match in the U.S. Senate \n     Judiciary Committee last week--nevertheless echoes strongly \n     with a warning for any thoughtful American concerned about \n     the temper of the times. The spat occurred as the committee \n     considered a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex \n     marriage.\n       In part, the clash between Pennsylvania Republican Sen. \n     Arlen Specter, the committee chairman, and Sen. Russ \n     Feingold, a Democrat from Wisconsin, was about a change in \n     venue for the committee meeting. But the overarching context \n     was the Democratic belief--well-founded, as it happens--that \n     this amendment is all about currying political favor with the \n     Republicans' right-wing base and in the process painting \n     Democrats as the defenders of gay marriage.\n       This worked a treat for those supporting President Bush in \n     the 2004 presidential election, when 11 states had \n     initiatives on gay marriage or civil unions to inflame the \n     voters' prejudices at the polls.\n       The scene in the Judiciary Committee was childish and \n     undignified, perhaps as befitting the nonsense before it. \n     After Sen. Feingold declared his opposition to the amendment \n     and his intention to walk out, Sen. Specter said: ``I don't \n     need to be lectured by you. You are no more a protector of \n     the Constitution than am I.'' He bid the Democrat ``good \n     riddance.''\n       Actually, Sen. Feingold has a better claim to be a \n     protector of the Constitution; he doesn't want to see it \n     larded up with a piece of bigotry in which a majority \n     motivated by religious belief seeks to deprive a small \n     minority of the benefits of matrimony. Ironically, Sen. \n     Specter is ``totally opposed'' to the bill but thinks it \n     should go to a vote. And it will--probably in the week of \n     June 5--as the result of the committee's 10-8 party-line \n     vote.\n       As a practical matter, the amendment is not needed. A \n     majority of conservative justices on the U.S. Supreme Court \n     can be expected to support the existing federal Defense of \n     Marriage Act of 1996--so states such as Pennsylvania do not \n     have to recognize any same-sex marriages granted elsewhere. \n     Indeed, if protecting the sanctity of marriage was the real \n     goal, the amendment would ban divorce, or at least ban \n     divorced people from marrying again. Of course, we don't \n     propose that ourselves, but the backers of the gay marriage \n     amendment would do so if they were consistent.\n       But consistency and logic are not the point. The political \n     power of the amendment, like the proposed effort to do \n     something similar in Pennsylvania, resides in its bullying \n     and hypocrisy. This is about selecting convenient scapegoats \n     and feeling righteous as the administration pursues a sort of \n     anti-Gospel in which social programs are cut and policies are \n     pushed to favor the rich over the poor.\n       Sadly, any shouting matches--as in the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee--are to be expected because promoting rancor and \n     division are the real point. We can only hope that wiser \n     heads will prevail in Congress as this amendment proceeds.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Salt Lake Tribune, April 29, 2006]\n\n         Bill of Wrongs: No Need for Federal Marriage Amendment\n\n       It's hard to claim you are campaigning for states' rights \n     when the measure you are promoting would rewrite all 50 state \n     constitutions in one stroke.\n       And it's hard to claim you are campaigning for individual \n     rights, or for religious rights, when the proposal you back \n     would impose a federalized definition for the very personal \n     and, usually, religious institution of marriage.\n       The proposed ``Marriage Protection Amendment'' has drawn \n     support from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \n     and a spectrum of other faiths, known collectively as the \n     Religious Coalition for Marriage. That group argues, as \n     unconvincingly as everyone else who makes the point, that the \n     growing acceptance of same-sex unions threatens the \n     institution of marriage.\n       This unwise move to amend the basic law of the United \n     States follows successful campaigns to change a few state \n     charters, including Utah's, to ban same-sex marriage. But, \n     beyond being merely redundant to those state efforts, the \n     proposed federal amendment also picks up a serious flaw that \n     was part of 2004's Utah Amendment 3.\n       Utah's constitution does not merely bar same-sex couples \n     from the legal institution of marriage. It prevents them from \n     crafting any ``other domestic union, however denominated,'' \n     That, despite the misleading reassurances of the measure's \n     supporters before the vote, has since been shown to be a \n     useful tool for knocking the pins out from under simple and \n     reasonable domestic partnership agreements that should be the \n     right of any adult to enter, and within the purview of any \n     religious order to sanctify, or not, as it chooses.\n       Likewise, the federal proposal would reasonably preserve \n     the term ``marriage'' for the traditional arrangement of ``a \n     man and a woman.'' But, again, it would unreasonably go on to \n     dictate that every state read its own constitution to deny \n     any constitutional protection to the notion that marriage \n     ``or the legal incidents thereof' should be extended to same-\n     sex relationships.\n       Such an overbroad, if not downright nasty, attack on \n     domestic partnerships is not necessary to reserve the title \n     of ``marriage'' to its traditional understanding. It doesn't \n     belong in any state's constitution. And we certainly don't \n     want it cluttering up the Constitution of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Situation Room, June 2, 2006]\n\n       Jack Cafferty, CNN anchor: Hi, Wolf.\n       Guess what Monday is? Monday is the day President Bush will \n     speak about an issue near and dear to his heart and the \n     hearts of many conservatives. It's also the day before the \n     Senate votes on the very same thing. Is it the war? Deficits? \n     Health insurance? Immigration? Iran? North Korea?\n       Not even close. No, the president is going to talk about \n     amending the Constitution in order to ban gay marriage. This \n     is something that absolutely, positively has no chance of \n     happening, nada, zippo, none. But that doesn't matter. Mr. \n     Bush will take time to make a speech. The Senate will take \n     time to talk and vote on it, because it's something that \n     matters to the Republican base.\n       This is pure politics. If has nothing to do with whether or \n     not you believe in gay marriage. It's blatant posturing by \n     Republicans, who are increasingly desperate as the midterm \n     elections approach. There's not a lot else to get people \n     interested in voting on them, based on their record of the \n     last five years.\n       But if you can appeal to the hatred, bigotry, or \n     discrimination in some people, you might move them to the \n     polls to vote against that big, bad gay married couple that \n     one day might move in down the street.\n       Here's the question: Is now the time for President Bush to \n     be backing a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage?\n\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, we should be addressing America's top \npriorities, including ways to make America safer, the disastrous war in \nIraq, rising gas prices, health care and health insurance costs, stem \ncell research, erosion of America's privacy, the reauthorization of the \nVoting Rights Act, but now we are going to talk about something that is \nhere simply for politics. Rather than seeking to divide and diminish, \nthe Senate could be working against discrimination.\n  Why are we amending the Constitution to do something the States can \ndo? Every State can pass and has passed laws about what will be the \nmarriage laws in their State. No State is able to pass a law that is \ngoing to force another State to accept something they do not want. We \npassed the Defense of Marriage Act in the Congress for that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S5533]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think we are doing what we did in the \nSchiavo matter: We are playing politics with the basic rights of \npeople, and it is wrong.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The time until 10 o'clock is \nreserved for the majority leader or his designee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, obviously, I am not going to take the \nmajority leader's time. Certainly, if anybody on the Republican side \nseeks recognition, I will immediately yield the floor to them. I was \nhoping they would be here.\n  I note the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and I are in an \nasbestos hearing. I was asked by somebody the other day if I felt that \nmarriage would be threatened if we didn't pass this. I have been \nblessed to be married to the same woman for 44 years. I don't feel \nthreatened by it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise once again to express my strong \nopposition to the motion to proceed to this constitutional amendment. \nThere are so many other issues we should be debating instead of this \ndivisive and deeply flawed proposal.\n  We should be debating the raging war in Iraq. We should be debating \nour staggering national debt. We should be debating global warming. We \nshould be debating stem cell research.\n  But we should not be debating a vague and unnecessary proposal to \namend the U.S. Constitution. This week's debate is a textbook \nillustration of misplaced priorities.\n  As Chairman Specter has said, the Federal Marriage Amendment is a \nsolution in search of a problem. The 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, \nwhich I supported, remains the law of the land. It defines marriage for \npurposes of Federal benefits as the union of a man woman, and provides \nthat no State shall be required to recognize same-sex marriages \nperformed in any other.\n  DOMA has been challenged three times, including in the Ninth circuit, \nand each time it has been upheld.\n  DOMA is consistent with principles of federalism and the longstanding \ntradition in our system that matters of family law should be left to \nthe States and not dictated by the Federal Government.\n  In my home State of Nevada, we passed a State constitutional \namendment in 2002 making clear that only a marriage been a man and a \nwoman can be recognized and given effect in Nevada. I supported that \nmeasure.\n  Supporters of the Federal Marriage Amendment say that State laws like \nNevada's are under ``assault'' by ``activist judges.'' The Nevada law \nis not under ``assault'' by anyone. There are no court cases regarding \nmarriage for same-sex couples in Nevada.\n  The decision about how to define marriage was made by the people of \nNevada for themselves, and it wasn't dictated to them by politicians in \nWashington. That's how it should be.\n  In contrast, this Federal amendment would dictate to each State how \nto interpret its own State laws. This is an unwarranted intrusion into \nthe autonomy of State legal systems.\n  In any event, this is not an appropriate subject for a constitutional \namendment. For over 200 years, the Constitution has had no provision on \nmarriage, and we have left this and other family law issues to the \nstates and to this Nation's religious institutions.\n  Our Constitution has only been amended 17 times after the Bill of \nRights was adopted in 1791. Only 17 times in 215 years.\n  Several years ago the nonpartisan Constitution Project convened a \ncommittee of constitutional scholars, civic leaders, and other \nprominent Americans to develop criteria for when a constitutional \namendment is justified. They wrote that our Constitution should be \n``amended only with the utmost care, and in a manner consistent with \nthe spirit and meaning of the entire document.''\n  This amendment fails that test. It does not make our system more \npolitically responsive. It does not protect individual rights. As James \nMadison wrote in Federalist No. 49, the Constitution should only be \namended on ``Great and Extraordinary Occasions.'' This is not such an \noccasion.\n  Earlier this year, former Republican senator John Danforth of \nMissouri spoke about this amendment and this is what he had to say:\n\n       Maybe at some point in time there was one that was sillier \n     than this one, but I don't know of one. . . . Once before the \n     Constitution was amended to try to deal with matters of human \n     behavior, that was prohibition, that was such a flop that \n     that was repealed 13 years later.\n\n  I agree with my distinguished former colleague that this is not an \nappropriate subject for a constitutional amendment.\n  I hope the American people will see this amendment for what it is. \nThis amendment is not about whether any of the Members in this body \nsupport or oppose same-sex marriage.\n  This amendment is about raw election year politics. It has zero \nchance of passing, and everybody knows that.\n  Those who would use the Constitution as a political bulletin board \nshould be ashamed of themselves. Our Constitution deserves better. And \nthe American people deserve better.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the past couple of days, we have had a \ngood, rigorous debate on the future of marriage in America. I thank \nSenator Allard and Senator Brownback for managing the debate and my \ncolleagues who have come to the floor to very thoughtfully and \nthoroughly lay out the legal and cultural issues that are at stake.\n  Throughout human history and culture, the union between a man and a \nwoman has been recognized as the cornerstone of society. Marriage \nserves a public act, a civil institution that binds men and women in \nthe task of producing and nurturing children--husband and wife, father \nand mother--building a family in a community over a lifetime.\n  At its root, marriage is and always has been a public institution \nthat formalizes that family bond. Some on the other side have said that \nthe strength and stability of marriage is a distraction of little \nconcern to the broader public. And I couldn't disagree more.\n  As it so happens, they used the very same argument 2 years ago. They \nsaid the States had little interest in preserving traditional marriage; \nvoters didn't care; other issues were more important. That argument \nwasn't true then, and it is even less true now.\n  Marriage, as we know it, is under assault. Activist courts are \nattempting to redefine marriage against the expressed wishes of the \nAmerican people. And if marriage is redefined for some, it will be \nredefined for all.\n  Last year, voters in 13 States passed by enormous margins State \nconstitutional amendments to protect marriage. Mr. President, 19 States \nnow have State constitutional amendments. Another 26 have statutes \ndoing the same. Alabama voters, yesterday, endorsed an amendment to \nprotect marriage. In total, 45 States have either State constitutional \namendments or State laws to protect marriage.\n  Tennessee, which will give voters the opportunity to voice their \nopinion this November, is one of six States with similar amendments to \nits constitution that are pending. No State--no State--has ever \nrejected an effort to protect traditional marriage when it has been on \nthe ballot.\n  Voters across the country, from red States to blue, have voted \noverwhelmingly to protect traditional marriage. But that has not \nstopped the same-sex marriage activists from taking their campaigns not \nto the American people but to the courts. Indeed, their losses at the \nballot box have only fueled their judicial activism.\n  Currently, nine States have lawsuits pending. In five States, courts \ncould redefine marriage by the end of the year. In California, \nMaryland, New York, and Washington, State trial courts have already \nfollowed Massachusetts and declared their State constitution's \ndefinition of marriage unconstitutional. All of these cases are on \nappeal.\n  A Federal judge in Nebraska overturned a democratically enacted State \nconstitutional amendment protecting marriage. That ruling is now under \nappeal in the Eighth Circuit.\n  Another Federal court case in Washington challenges the \nconstitutionality of the Federal Defense of Marriage Act. That case is \nstayed pending resolution of litigation in the Washington State Supreme \nCourt. Court watchers are expecting a ruling soon.\n\n[[Page S5534]]\n\n  With all of this litigation pending, there is little doubt that the \nConstitution will be amended. The only question is whether it will be \namended by Congress working the will of the people or by judicial fiat. \nWill activist judges override the clear intention of the American \npeople or will the people amend the Constitution to preserve marriage \nas it has always been understood?\n  In Massachusetts, the people have never had a say. The State's \nsupreme judicial court demanded the State sanction same-sex marriage. A \nmajority of the court substituted their personal policy preferences for \nthat of the people, and the consequences of that activism spread far \nbeyond same-sex marriage itself.\n  I wish to read from a letter from Governor Romney sent to me as we \nopened the debate on this issue. In it he warns us that Massachusetts \nis only just beginning to experience the full implication of their \ncourt's decision. He writes:\n\n       Although the full impact of same-sex marriage may not be \n     measured for decades or generations, we are beginning to see \n     the effects of the new legal logic in Massachusetts just 2 \n     years before our State's social experiment.\n\n  In the letter, Governor Romney relates the following account:\n\n       In our schools, children are being taught that there is no \n     difference between the same-sex marriage and traditional \n     marriage.\n       Recently, parents of a second grader in one public school \n     complained when they were not notified that their son's \n     teacher would read a fairy tale about same-sex marriage to \n     the class.\n       The parents asked for the opportunity to opt their child \n     out of hearing such stories. In response, the school \n     superintendent insisted on ``teaching children about the \n     world they live in, and in Massachusetts same-sex marriage is \n     legal.''\n\n  Now second graders are being indoctrinated to accept a radical \nredefinition of marriage against their parents' wishes. That is the \nreality today in Massachusetts.\n  It doesn't stop there. Already religious organizations in \nMassachusetts are feeling the pressure to conform their views as well. \nIn March, the Catholic Charities of Boston discontinued their work \nplacing foster children in adoptive homes. Why? Because they concluded \nthe new same-sex marriage law would require them to place children--\nrequire them--to place children in same-sex homes. Clearly, this is an \nirreconcilable conflict.\n  So while we have advocates denying that same-sex marriage poses any \nconflict with religious expression or with traditional views, we are \nalready seeing in Massachusetts that simply is not the case. We don't \nknow yet the range and the extent of the religious liberty conflicts \nthat would arise from the imposition of same-sex marriage laws, but we \ndo know the implications are serious, that religious expression will be \nchallenged, and that it is a matter of deep public concern. That is why \nwe seek action in the Senate on this important issue.\n  As I have said before, it is only a matter of time before the \nConstitution will be amended. The only question is by whom. Is it going \nto be a small group of activist judges or by the people through a \ndemocratic process? I believe the people should make that decision.\n  We talked about the specific wording of the marriage protection \namendment. Nothing in the amendment intrudes on individual privacy. \nNothing stops States from passing civil union laws or curtails benefits \nthat legislatures establish for same-sex couples.\n  It simply protects the States from having civil unions imposed on \nthem from activist courts. It protects the legislative process by \nletting people speak and vote. It ensures that their voices are heard \nand their votes are respected.\n  My own views on marriage are clear. I believe that marriage is the \nunion between a man and a woman for the purpose of creating and \nnurturing a family. We know that children do best in a home with a mom \nand a dad. Common sense and overwhelming research tell us so. Marriage \nbetween one man and one woman does a better job protecting our \nchildren--better than any other arrangement humankind has devised. I \nbelieve it is our duty to support this fundamental institution.\n  Now we will vote on proceeding on the marriage protection amendment. \nWe will vote on whether we believe traditional marriage is worthy of \nprotection, and we will vote on whether the courts or the people will \ndecide its fate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, today and tomorrow could be historic days \nin the Senate--indeed, in the history of our country--because we have \nan opportunity to eliminate what some have called the most unfair tax \nof all. I speak of what has been called the estate tax, or the \ninheritance tax, or more recently has become known as the death tax.\n  Just a word of the history of this tax would be interesting to my \ncolleagues before I discuss the process by which this consideration \nwill occur and some of the reasons why we need to proceed with it.\n  It is very interesting that the history of the estate tax actually \ncan be traced back to ancient times and the Roman Empire, but the more \nrelevant history for purposes of the United States, because we borrowed \nthis concept from England, came from the Middle Ages when the sovereign \nor the state, of course, owned all of the assets--the land and even the \npersonal property--within the country.\n  What would happen is, when the king owned all of the feudal property \nin England, he would grant the use of that property to the people \nwithin the kingdom. Certain individuals during their lifetimes--let's \nsay a farmer--would have the land to till and the farm animals to take \ncare of. When that farmer died, in effect, his family would have to buy \nback that property from the king in order to continue to farm that \nland, to raise those farm animals and so forth. When the king died, the \nking would let the estate retain the property on which the payment of \nan estate tax, called a relief, existed. That would then enable the \nfamily to continue to run the family farm or the family business, to \nput it in modern-day terms.\n  It seems very strange indeed in the 21st century we would retain this \nodd and clearly out-of-place custom of having to buy back our property \nfrom the king. We do not have a king anymore. There has never been a \nking in the United States of America. Our right to property is \nguaranteed in the Constitution. So it seems strange, indeed, that we \nshould be following a custom which required us to buy back from the \nking our property when our father or our mother dies, for our children \nto have to buy it back when we die. Yet that is the etiology of the \nestate tax, that you pay the state to continue to enjoy the right to \nthe property that you always thought was yours.\n  It is a very expensive price, indeed. In recent years, it has been 55 \npercent for the largest estates. Clearly, a lot of people could not \nafford this, people who put their life savings into their farm or their \nbusiness.\n  I had a friend from Phoenix who owned a printing company. He started \nit himself, and after 40 years built it up to a prosperous printing \ncompany. He took a modest sum out for he and his family but basically \nplowed everything back into the company because to stay ahead in the \nprinting business you had to buy the most modern printing equipment and \ntechnology.\n  On paper, his family had a lot of wealth. He had a lot of wealth when \nhe died. But it was literally tied up in the company. His family looked \nat the estate tax. They had spent a lot of money buying insurance and \nso on. They found they were going to basically have to pay over half of \nthe value of this company to the Government. They did not have that \nmoney. They did not have that liquid cash. So they had to sell this \nprinting company in order to collect the money to pay the Government \nabout half of it in the form of an estate tax.\n\n  What happened? This particular man was one of the most generous \npeople in the city of Phoenix. He contributed millions of dollars. In \nfact, there is a Boys and Girls Club named after him. Every year his \nwife and his daughter would be involved in charitable activities. I \nknow because my wife is one of the best friends of his daughter. They \nheaded up charity events and raised millions of dollars for our \ncommunity. When his family had to sell the business to pay the estate \ntax to the Government, they were no longer in a position to do the \nthings for the community they had always done. They have remained very \nactive and very giving but not to the same extent when they had a \nbusiness to rely upon.\n  So this community lost in many ways. It lost a great, locally owned, \nfamily-owned business. It lost the patriarch of that business, a very \ngenerous person, who supported the community, and the family, of \ncourse, has not been able to employ those people. Over 200 people were \nemployed in the business.\n  One of the modern-day rationales for the estate tax is that it \nprevents the concentration of wealth in just a few families. If there \nis any Nation that you don't have to worry about that, it is the United \nStates of America. We are a Nation in which anyone can make wealth--and \nyou can lose it quickly. Everyone aspires to get higher on the economic \nladder. The notion that somehow there are just a few rich families in \nthis country controlling everything is, of course, a wild myth. So it \nis not necessary to break it up.\n  But what happened when people like my friend Jerry, when he passed \naway and his family had to sell his printing company, what happened to \nthe concentration of wealth? It sure took it away from his family, all \nright, though no one would contend they were really among the elite of \nthis country. He was a poor Jewish kid from New York who came out west, \nmade good, employed a lot of people and did a lot for his community. \nNo, they sold to a big corporation, a public company. So the \nconcentration of wealth, of course, was enhanced, not lessened, as a \nresult of the application of the estate tax.\n  It is very hard for small businesses these days, or even small farms, \nto compete with publicly-owned businesses. When the CEO of a publicly-\nowned business passes on, nothing happens. The corporation simply goes \nchugging right along. But when the patriarch of a family-owned business \npasses away and half of the money in the business has to be paid to \nUncle Sam, it can crush that small business. It is one of the reasons \nwe need to eliminate this tax. The small family-owned business or \nfamily-owned farm cannot compete with the giant corporation which does \nnot suffer the same kind of tax.\n  We should not have to buy back the estate from the king any longer. \nWe need to end this most unfair tax of all, the death tax.\n  It is interesting that even though most Americans will not have to \npay the death tax because their estates would fall within the amount \nthat is exempted, by very large numbers, they recognize it is a very \nunfair tax. So when public opinion surveys ask people their opinion of \nthe tax, the majority of people in this country say they would like to \nend the tax, that it is unfair and it should be eliminated. As a matter \nof fact, this applies to liberal and conservative voters.\n  According to a Gallup poll from April of this year, 58 percent of the \nrespondents said that the inheritance tax is unfair. It is interesting, \nthis poll was taken when Americans were filing their taxes. The death \ntax was called unfair by more people than the despised alternative \nminimum tax. Only 42 percent of the AMT said it was fair. Yet, of \ncourse, we know that also to be a very unfair tax. It was never \nintended to apply to average Americans. It was put in there to make \nsure that even the wealthiest Americans with all of their deductions, \nexemptions, credits and places to park their money that even they would \nhave to pay some tax--even if they did not owe any income tax, they \nwould owe an alternative minimum tax.\n  Now, that alternative minimum tax, much like the death tax, is \nreaching down to take money from more and more and more Americans. So \nwe are recognizing that whatever its good intentions originally, it is \nan unfair tax.\n  It is interesting that even though more Americans will be hit with \nthe AMT, a greater number of Americans believe the death tax is more \nunfair\n\n[[Page S5536]]\n\nthan even the alternative minimum tax. Of course, they are both unfair. \nThey both need to be eliminated. It shows the sense of fairness that \nAmericans have.\n  There was a poll taken not long after the Presidential election last \nyear. It was interesting to me that while 89 percent of people who \nidentified themselves as Bush voters believed the death tax is somewhat \nor very unfair, 71 percent of the Kerry voters also found the death tax \nat least somewhat or very unfair: 25 percent, somewhat; 46 percent, \nvery unfair. So this reaches across the economic spectrum; it reaches \nacross the political spectrum. Americans know an unfair tax when they \nsee it, and they think it ought to be eliminated.\n\n  Of course, the economic theory backs them up. They say it is unfair \nbecause, among other things, it is a tax on hard work. It is a tax on \nthrift over consumption. It is a tax on assets that have already been \ntaxed at least once when they were earned and sometimes multiple times \nas that money has been invested and then returned a profit.\n  Americans understand we should have a tax policy that encourages \nsavings and encourages working more. When people know that the next \ndollar they earn is going to be taken by the Federal Government or that \nhalf of everything that is left in this estate could be taken by the \nFederal Government, what is the incentive for them to continue to work?\n  Dr. Edward Prescott, a Nobel Prize winner in economics from Arizona \nState University, got that prize by proving the phenomenon that there \nis a direct relationship in how much more people will work and how much \nthey have to pay in taxes. When they know most of what they earn, they \ncan put back into their business, save, invest or give to their kids, \nthey will continue to work. When they know it will go to Uncle Sam, \nguess what. They don't work anymore. That is lost productivity. It is \nlost productivity that damages our entire country, our economy. It \nobviously hurts in job creation. It hurts in our ability to continue to \nenjoy the kind of growth we have.\n  The studies verify this. The studies verify, according to the Joint \nEconomic Committee, for example, which has done one of these recent \nreports, that the estate tax has reduced the stock of capital in the \neconomy by about $847 billion over the last several decades, the last \n60 years. That is almost $1 trillion in lost capital that could have \nbeen put to work creating jobs and creating products.\n  In comparison, the estate tax raised $761 billion in inflation-\nadjusted dollars over this same period of time. The bottom line is, \nthis is a destructive tax. It is not a tax that helps taxpayers very \nmuch. It is about 1 percent of the revenues we collect, and, according \nto estimates, Americans actually pay about the same amount in money \nevery year to avoid paying the death tax as it brings into the Federal \nTreasury.\n  Alicia Munnell, an economist, has made that point. She was a member \nof President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. She estimated that \nthe costs of complying with the estate tax laws are about the same as \nthe revenue raised. It is expected to raise about $28 billion in this \nfiscal year.\n  The bottom line is, therefore, it is a very inefficient tax. It \ncosts, actually, twice as much as we think it does. It does not bring \nin that much revenue. And certainly it is very detrimental to economic \ngrowth and to capital formation.\n  There is a way we treat this phenomenon in the Tax Code. It really \ntells us how we should treat the estate tax. Think about the unintended \nevents that occur in your life. Obviously, death is the chief among \nthem. You cannot choose when you die. Everyone knows they are going to \ndie, but it is not an event that is a voluntary event or that we decide \nwhen we are going to do it, certainly not for tax-planning purposes.\n  It is much like a couple of other things that are recognized in the \nTax Code as involuntary events. One of them is what happens when there \nis a theft. Someone breaks into your home and steals a lot of your \nproperty. You might get the insurance company to give you that money \nback. Should that money be taxed as income when you get it back from \nthe insurance company? Of course not. It is merely a replacement for \nwhat was stolen from you. The Tax Code recognizes this in what is \ncalled an ``involuntary conversion,'' and they do not force you to pay \nthe ordinary income tax on the money you get back when you suffer that \nloss.\n  It is the same thing for death. Death is not a planned event. Death \nis not something like a sale of property for which you would expect to \npay a capital gains tax but, rather, something that occurs to you \ninvoluntarily; certainly you should not suffer a price when the estate \nis passed to you from your loved one, let's say. It comes, of course, \nat the worst possible time in people's lives to begin with, when they \nare grieving the loss of a loved one and now are going to have to pay \nthe king to get that loved one's estate. This is not something which \nAmericans believe is fair or right or just.\n\n  There is a way we treat this in the Tax Code--involuntary conversion. \nYou don't get taxed on it. The same philosophy ought to apply to the \nestate tax. There are a lot of reasons. There are the purely economic \nreasons. There is American public opinion. There is the philosophy of \nthe Tax Code. All of these things mitigate against having this unfair \ndeath tax today.\n  What we have done is to, therefore, set up a process by which we can \ntake up the House bill which voted overwhelmingly to eliminate the \ndeath tax. That is H.R. 8. What we are debating now is the taking up of \nH.R. 8 so that we, too, can vote to repeal this fundamentally unfair \ntax. We will have a cloture vote. It will occur presumably sometime \ntomorrow. I urge colleagues to vote yes on cloture so that we can take \nup the House bill.\n  Some of my colleagues do not want to support the House bill for full \nrepeal. I understand that. They are well aware of the fact that since \nthere may not be support for that to get 60 votes, a lot of work has \nbeen done to develop an alternative which would end the most pernicious \nimpact of the tax but still allow some revenue to be collected from the \nmost wealthy estates each year. I will discuss that in a moment.\n  The bottom line is that in order for us to vote on full repeal or to \nvote on an alternative to full repeal, we will have to support the \nfirst cloture motion to proceed so that we can take up the House bill. \nPresumably, then, the majority leader would have a cloture vote on that \nunderlying bill and people can vote yes or no on that as they please. I \nwill vote to repeal the estate tax. Should that fail, we will then have \nthe opportunity to vote on an alternative. That alternative has been \nrelatively widely discussed, and we will have an opportunity to discuss \nit more later.\n  In general terms, what it would do is provide that most people won't \nhave to spend the $30 billion a year that is spent on insurance \npolicies, lawyers, accountants, estate planners, and the like to try to \navoid paying most of the estate tax. For most people, under this \nalternative compromise, the exempted amount will be large enough that \nthey won't have to worry about it, or if even after the exempted \namount, their estate will be covered--and with the increase in real \nestate prices today and with the value of businesses and farms going \nup, frequently, simply because of the value of the land or the personal \nproperty, a lot of estates could get caught even with a generous \nexempted amount. We have a plan that only the capital gains tax rate \nwould apply. If that is the case, then, whether you choose to sell the \nproperty before death or you are willing to pay whatever you have to \nafter the exempted amount after death, it is the same. It would be 15 \npercent today; after 2010, it would be 20 percent, if that is not \nchanged. Everybody knows, therefore, that the penalty, in effect, to \nthe Government is the same. You pay on the gain if you sell the \nproperty before death. If your heirs inherit the property, they would \npay that same 15 or 20 percent. There may be an addition to ensure that \nthe very wealthiest estates pay at a higher rate. That is something we \nare discussing with colleagues.\n  The bottom line is, what we will do is make clear that for most \npeople, they won't have to worry about the death tax anymore. For the \nvery few who do, it would be only the very largest estates which would \nclearly have the financial means of doing something about it.\n  We are not going to be able to get to either a vote on full repeal or \nthe alternative unless we vote for cloture to\n\n[[Page S5537]]\n\ntake up the House bill. That is the critical vote which will occur \ntomorrow.\n  We have a series of speakers. I believe the Senator from Texas, Mr. \nCornyn, is next. Then we have Senators Talent, Shelby, Bunning, Allen, \nThune, and Grassley on the Republican side. I urge them to be here to \nensure their place in line so that they have an opportunity to speak \nfor the allotted time on this important issue, laying the foundation \nfor what is going to be a historic vote tomorrow to finally get on the \nprocess for getting rid of this most unfair tax.\n  I urge colleagues' support and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I congratulate Senator Kyl, who has been \na true champion of this effort and a leader on a bipartisan basis, for \nhis good work. I know we were delayed a little bit because we thought \nwe were going to come to the floor with this important legislation \nabout the time that Mother Nature sent us Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. \nBut we are back here through no small effort on the part of Senator \nKyl. I thank him for his leadership.\n  This is an issue which affects my constituents in Texas a lot and \nconcerns Americans, as we know, across a broad political spectrum, as a \nresult of public opinion polls. It goes back to 2001, when Congress \npassed the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act which \nincluded a phaseout of the death tax. Eliminating the death tax was an \nimportant part of that overall tax relief package which has played no \nsmall part in the incredible economic expansion we have seen in America \nsince that time: 2 million new payroll jobs in the past year; more than \n5 million new payroll jobs since May of 2003; unemployment is at 4.6 \npercent, the lowest in almost 5 years; home ownership has reached \nalltime highs, including among those categories of minority owners who \ntraditionally have lagged behind in terms of their pursuit of the \nAmerican dream. The economic growth and expansion we are seeing today \nwould not have been possible but for the important tax relief this \nCongress passed with President Bush's leadership in 2001 and 2003.\n  Unfortunately, because of our budget rules, because of our inability \nto get 60 votes for permanent repeal, Congress has been unable to \ncompletely eliminate the death tax. The death tax will amazingly \ndisappear in 2010 but then rear its ugly head in 2011 and revert to its \npre-2001 level. In other words, unless we act, the American taxpayer \nwill see a huge tax increase.\n  This debate is about whether Members of the Senate truly believe that \ndeath should remain a taxable event for American taxpayers, especially \nthose who are hit in a disproportionately disadvantageous way--\nranchers, farmers, and small business owners. I favor eliminating the \ndeath tax because, fundamentally, it is an unfair tax. Once you earn \nincome and pay taxes on your income, then Uncle Sam comes along, when \nyour loved one is lying on their deathbed, and says: We want another \nbite out of your savings and assets that have accumulated due to your \nhard work and industry.\n  There are those who say this is just to benefit the rich and wealthy. \nThat ignores the reality on the ground. The death tax brings the hammer \ndown on Texas farmers and ranchers whose most valuable asset is their \nland. To pay this double tax, farmers and ranchers are threatened with \nthe prospect of selling just to pay their tax. This is true of small \nbusiness owners who have chosen perhaps not to incorporate or form a \nbusiness organization such that they can take advantage of other tax \nexclusions and exemptions but, rather, this affects small business \nowners in a disproportionately negative way as well.\n  The death tax discourages savings. By taxing bequests, the death tax \ndiscourages small business owners and family farms from saving and \nreinvesting in their business. Many economists bemoan the fact that \nAmericans don't save enough compared to other countries. Eliminating \nthe death tax would lower the barrier to savings that so many Americans \nface.\n  Not only does the death tax discourage small businesses and farmers \nand ranchers from saving, it also hinders their ability to operate from \ngeneration to generation. The current death tax burden especially makes \nit progressively more difficult for each succeeding generation to keep \nan agricultural operation going. The death tax reduces the inheritance \navailable to heirs, again discouraging people from working, saving, and \ninvesting. We are all familiar with the stories of sons and daughters \nhaving to sell the family farm their parents gave them so they could \nmerely pay the tax bill upon the demise of their loved one.\n  The death tax also discourages entrepreneurial activity, which is the \nkey to keeping America competitive in the global economy. As ironic as \nit may seem, the former Soviet Union, our opponent in the Cold War, \nunderstands the positive economic benefits of eliminating the death \ntax. Last year, Russia eliminated its own death tax. In fact, 414 \nMembers of the Duma, the Russian Parliament's lower house, voted in \nfavor of the proposal, a record at the time.\n  Dying should not be a further burdensome, expensive, and complicated \nevent because of the death tax. Right now, it is. IRS data indicates \nthat more than half of the estates of those who die in America are \nrequired to file a death tax return even though they never owe any \ndeath tax to begin with. In addition, complying with one or more of the \ncomplicated parts of the Internal Revenue Code can be crushing when you \nconsider that taxpayers need to hire attorneys and accountants, \nappraisers, and other experts to make sure that all their t's are \ncrossed and their i's are dotted. Many taxpayers are not lucky enough \nto afford the armies of accountants and tax lawyers needed to avoid the \ndeath tax through the use of legal and reasonable trusts or \nfoundations. The IRS interacts with American taxpayers every day in one \nway or another. It should not be there on the day those taxpayers leave \nthis Earth.\n  I know there are concerns expressed by some colleagues with regard to \nthe budget deficit. There is no doubt that Congress needs to do all it \ncan to responsibly control the rate at which we spend on mandatory \nprograms which are the primary cause of our deficit, growing as they \nare at the rate of 8 percent or more a year--Medicare, Social Security, \nand Medicaid. Earlier this year, I offered an amendment to the budget \nresolution that would have built on the successes of the Deficit \nReduction Act and further reduced the growth in mandatory spending. \nUnfortunately, it was not accepted.\n  Some advocate keeping the death tax in the IRS Code as the key to \nopening the door of fiscal discipline. I disagree. Following this path \nwill lead to nowhere and lead there fast. What it will do, instead, is \nslam the door on ranchers and farmers and family-owned businesses. That \nis not something I am prepared to do. To ensure the economy's continued \nmomentum, we need to make sure the permanent elimination of the death \ntax is included in this legislation. We have to end the death tax once \nand for all as a matter of fundamental fairness.\n  The fact is, by cutting taxes, we spur economic activity, which, in \npart, accounts for why the budget deficit is actually lower than had \nbeen projected earlier, because the revenue to the American Treasury \nhas increased with the burst and expansion of economic activity. With \nmore people working, more people paying taxes, there is more revenue \ninto the Treasury. We have been through a recession, national \nemergencies, corporate scandals, and a war. Yet because of the \nPresident's leadership and the leadership of this Congress in passing \nimportant tax relief, we were able to put money back in the pockets of \nordinary Americans so that they could then invest and help grow the \neconomy that has benefited us all. Let us not get in the way of that \nimportant progress by failing to take the necessary action to end the \ndeath tax once and for all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the Book of Proverbs says:\n\n       A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's \n     children.\n\n  Tomorrow, the Senate will vote on whether the Government should have \na part in that transaction. Tomorrow, the Senate will vote on whether \nto move to the consideration of a repeal of the estate tax.\n\n[[Page S5538]]\n\n  During a particularly tumultuous time in American history, President \nFord said:\n\n       Truth is the glue that holds government together. \n     Compromise is the oil that makes government go.\n\n  We are not confronted with the same level of rancor today as when \nPresident Ford said that. But both of these institutional virtues--\ntruth and compromise--are as essential today as they were then. To \nachieve true estate tax relief for our constituents, we will need a \nheavy dose of each.\n  The estate tax is a difficult issue. Members on both sides of the \ndebate have strong feelings. Back home, many of us meet with ranchers, \nfarmers, family businesses, and others who feel passionately about the \nestate tax. Some believe that it is an unfair tax. Others believe that \nit is an important source of revenue for government programs.\n  Personally, I believe that the estate tax has caused significant \nhardship for families in my home state of Montana. I often hear from \nranchers and farmers who own land that has become very valuable. Often, \nthey have little cash in their pockets to pay the estate tax when \npassing their land on to their children. In Montana, like many other \nplaces in the West, people are committed to their land. They are \ncommitted to their way of life.\n  Many of my constituents want to pass their ranch or farm on to their \nchildren. They do not want it divided up. They do not want it spoiled \nby developers. Their children want to stay on the land. They want to \nkeep the lifestyle that is so important to them. They love the land. \nThey are stewards of the proud western heritage of ranching and \nfarming. They take their attachment to the land very seriously. And \nthey do not take kindly to the government interfering with their link \nto the land. This is why I support repeal of the estate tax. From my \nview, from Montana's view, a tax that forces ranchers to break up their \nland is a bad tax.\n  This is my strongly held belief. But I realize that some of my \ncolleagues believe just as strongly that inheritances over a certain \nvalue should be subject to tax. I understand that anything is possible. \nBut it appears unlikely that we are going to change many Senators' \nminds on this issue. Each side is pretty well dug in.\n  As a consequence, we are short of the votes required to repeal the \nestate tax outright.\n  That is why I have been working together with Republicans and \nDemocrats to achieve a compromise on the estate tax. Senator Kyl, in \nparticular has made an important effort to reach a compromise. I \ncommend him.\n  My goal is to pass a repeal of the estate tax. But if we are not able \nto reach that goal, at the very least we should reach a resolution that \nwill protect as many Montanans as possible from the estate tax.\n  I think that we can accomplish that. But we will need time. It will \ntake real effort. It will take concessions. I am committed to that \nwork.\n  I have met with many Senators from both parties on this issue. Our \nstaffs have been meeting for months. We have been working to address \nthe details, if we reach an agreement. After meeting with Republicans \nand Democrats on the estate tax, we have considered several proposals \nthat will both increase the exemption for estates subject to the tax, \nand lower the rates of taxation.\n  These proposals will not eliminate the estate tax altogether. But \nthey will--at the very least--eliminate the tax for 99.7 percent of \nMontanans and Americans alike. Only 3 tenths of 1 percent of Americans \nwould have to worry about the tax again. That is a very small number. \nOnly 31 out of nearly 9,000 estates in Montana would be subject to an \nestate tax in 2006 under the proposals we are discussing.\n  We are discussing proposals that amount to roughly half of the cost \nof full repeal. That is the ultimate consensus position. That is the \nmiddle.\n  I think that Senator Kyl and I have made good progress. But I am \nwilling to listen to other ideas that Members have. We should keep this \nprocess going. We should continue the work of negotiation. We have not \nfinished our work on a compromise. But even so, the majority leader has \ndecided to hold a vote on the estate tax.\n  Let's be honest. Tomorrow's vote is thus not a constructive step to \nactual reform. It is a political exercise. It is a reward to the noisy \nWashington interest groups that pray on resentment and discord. Both \nDemocrats and Republicans are guilty, on occasion, of forcing votes \njust to score political points. But that is not a productive way to run \nthe Senate. So what will we be left with tomorrow at the end of this \nvote? Perhaps more distrust of one side from the other. But we will not \nhave accomplished the goal that many of us in this body seek: true \nestate tax relief for our constituents.\n  As our former Majority leader George Mitchell used to say said: ``Do \nyou want to make a statement, or do you want to make law?'' I am \ncommitted to making law. I will work together with Republicans and \nDemocrats alike. I will work with anyone in this body to reach a \nconsensus on the estate tax that gives real estate tax relief to \nMontana families, and importantly, has the votes to pass.\n  But such a compromise will take time. My hope is that we can return \nto negotiations after this vote. I hope that then we can bring to those \nnegotiations a renewed sense of purpose and drive to accomplish a true \ncompromise--consistent with the best traditions of this body. We owe \nthis spirit of cooperation to the Senate as an institution. More \nimportantly, we owe it to the ranchers and farmers and families in \nMontana and across America who expect us to work together for a \ncompromise on the estate tax that will provide real relief--not \npolitical statements.\n  Madam President, let us not just make statements. Let us negotiate. \nAnd let us make the law that will end this tax once and for all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, today, we are witnessing another display \nof Republican anguish for America's oppressed minority, the rich and \nthe super-rich. They suffer from a terrible injustice: They have to pay \ntaxes on their millions and multimillions and even billions of dollars \nin accumulated wealth.\n  Thanks to my Republican colleagues, the rich and super-rich pay far \nless in taxes than they did 5 years ago. But their sympathy knows no \nbounds. So today we are debating eliminating taxes--not just lowering \nthem but eliminating them--on only the wealthiest one-half of 1 percent \nof all Americans, taxes they don't even pay themselves but their \nestates pay after they die.\n  This debate is not about saving family farms or small businesses, \nalthough I personally favor exempting them from all estate taxes.\n  This proposal is about eliminating a tax that falls only on the rich \nand the super-rich. When it comes to tax cuts for them, the Republicans \njust cannot do enough. They have done so much already. They lowered the \ntop personal income tax rates by more than any other categories. They \nreduced the tax rate for capital gains to 15 percent. President Bush \nwanted to eliminate taxes on dividends, but Congress settled on a 15 \npercent rate for that income as well.\n  Republicans and a few Democrats--but mainly Republicans--have created \na Federal Tax Code where a working person with taxable income above \n$28,400, or a head of household with taxable income above $38,400, pays \nmuch higher tax rates than rich people pay on millions of dollars of \nincome from dividends and capital gains.\n  Let me say that again. A working American pays a tax rate of 25 \npercent or higher on every dollar of earned taxable income above \n$28,400, or $38,400 for a head of a household. A multi-millionaire or a \nbillionaire pays a tax rate of only 15 percent on any amount of \nunearned taxable income. Now, there is a tax injustice to the middle \nclass working Americans that we should be doing something about.\n  But, no, what do my Republican colleagues propose today? More tax \ncuts for only the wealthiest people in America. They don't seem to care \nthat they are sacrificing the financial strength and stability of our \nFederal Government to continue these tax giveaways. They are addicted \nto what the nonpartisan Concord Coalition has called the ``most \nreckless fiscal policy in our Nation's history.''\n  When George Bush became President, the Federal Government's operating\n\n[[Page S5539]]\n\nbudget had just been balanced for the first time in nearly 40 years. \nNow, it is running deficits of $500 billion a year. The entire Social \nSecurity trust fund surpluses are being spent to cover part of those \noperating deficits. The rest of it is being borrowed. President Bush's \nown budget projects that in fiscal year 2011, the year this proposed \nrepeal would become permanent, the on-budget deficit will be $415 \nbillion.\n  Total Federal debt will have grown to $11.5 trillion. Over $3 \ntrillion of that debt will be owed to the Social Security trust fund. \nThat is the amount of the trust fund surpluses the Republican tax \ngiveaways will squander to pay for them.\n  The Federal financial situation only gets worse during the following \nyears. According to the Social Security trust fund's trustees, that \nfund will start to run annual deficits in 2016--that is 10 years from \nnow--as more and more baby boomers retire. Those annual Social Security \ntrust fund surpluses will be gone. Those previous surpluses that \nPresident Bush and most Members of Congress once promised would be \nsaved in a lockbox until needed to pay Social Security benefits will be \ngone, too--gone to pay for part of the tax cuts for the rich and super-\nrich. So then the Federal Government's operating budget will be running \nhuge deficits.\n  The Social Security trust funds will start running big deficits. The \noperating fund will owe the trust fund over $3 trillion, and yet this \nSenate is talking about eliminating a tax on the richest one-half of 1 \npercent of Americans.\n  This is beyond fiscal irresponsibility. This is fiscal insanity. \nThese projections are right from the President's own budget office and \nthe Social Security trust fund trustees. The revenue shortfalls are \ncatastrophic. We are standing on the look-out tower of the Titanic and \nall we have to do is open our eyes and look at the financial iceberg \nthat is dead ahead. My Republican colleagues want to keep going full \nspeed ahead. They also want to pour more coal on the fire. The people \nin the first-class cabin will get to enjoy their extra champagne and \ncaviar for a short while longer.\n  Nobody likes to pay taxes. This country was founded by anti-tax \nrebels. But once it became our country and our Government of we, the \npeople, most Americans willingly paid their fair share of the taxes \nnecessary for the public services that we collectively want, like \nnational defense, education, highways, and the rest.\n  There used to be an ethic in this country that if you made more money \nas an individual or a corporation, you paid more taxes. That was your \nfair share. That was a reasonable price to pay for living in the \ngreatest country in the world and for being successful in it. Now that \nethic has been lost. Now too many people and companies want to make \nmore and more money and pay less taxes or pay no taxes or get rebates.\n  Politicians pander to those desires by offering more and more tax \ncuts because they are popular and they help them get re-elected--while \nstill increasing Government spending, because that is popular, too. But \nthe result of that lost ethic and the insatiable desire for more and \nmore tax cuts in the last year--setting aside Social Security--total \nFederal tax revenues amounted to only three-fourths of expenditures. \nUnder existing tax policies, it won't get much better. Under this \nestate tax proposal, it will get worse.\n\n  So the question before us is: Who cares about the future of this \ncountry? Who will say no to the demands for more money by its most \nprivileged people who apparently don't understand or don't care what \nthey are doing to the financial future of everyone else? But we do \nknow, we, the 100 elected representatives of all the people of this \ngreat and still strong Nation, we, the stewards of its financial \ntreasures and the trustees of the public trust, we do know. It is our \nresponsibility to know what eliminating the estate tax would do to our \nNation's future financial solvency, and there is no possible way to \nresponsibly adopt this proposal. There is no way to justify placing the \nfinancial interests of a few Americans ahead of the financial interests \nof all the rest of America.\n  If we eliminate this tax, we might as well eliminate all Federal \ntaxes starting in the year 2011 and start over again because the \nFederal tax system will have been irretrievably broken, and it will be \njust a matter of time before everyone finds out and discovers that this \ncountry's financial future has been squandered by a few in here to \nbenefit a few out there. Then there will be hell to pay.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, we are debating the question of whether \nthe estate tax ought to be eliminated. It has been fashionable to call \nthis tax the death tax. That is a name conjured up by some PR people \nfor a handful of wealthy families whom the New York Times revealed this \nmorning have spent $200 million over the last several years trying to \nconvince people there is a death tax.\n  There is no death tax. None. We do have a tax on the wealthiest \nestates in the country. Currently, the exemption levels of $2 million \nper person or $4 million a couple mean that only one-half of 1 percent \nof estates are taxed.\n  To eliminate the estate tax would cost the Treasury $776 billion from \n2012 to 2021. That is the time it would be first fully in effect. That \ndoesn't count the interest lost. The interest lost would be another \n$213 billion. So the total cost to the Treasury would be nearly $1 \ntrillion in the time 2012 to 2021.\n  Let's look at our current budget condition because that should inform \nwhat we do here. Do we have this money? And the answer is clearly no, \nwe don't have the money. We already can't pay our bills. This is what \nhas happened in the last 5 years. These are the deficits that have been \nrun up. They are the biggest deficits in the history of our country. \nThis year they are anticipating a deficit of $325 billion. That doesn't \naccurately describe our fiscal condition because what is going to get \nadded to the debt this year is not $325 billion. What is going to get \nadded to the debt this year is over $600 billion.\n  In the midst of this sea of red ink, what our colleagues are talking \nabout doing is eliminating another trillion dollars. Let's just stack \nit on the debt. They are not proposing cutting spending to offset this \namount. They are not proposing other taxes to offset this amount. They \nare proposing borrowing the money. This is our pattern of borrowing \nsince this President took over.\n  In the last part of his first year, the debt of the country stood at \n$5.8 trillion. We don't hold him responsible for the first year because \nthat was a budget determined in the previous administration. But here \nis what is happening to the debt under this President in 10 years--the \nfirst 5 years we have already seen and the 5-year budget that is before \nus now.\n  If the 5-year budget that has been passed in the House and the Senate \ngoes forward pursuant to the President's proposal, this will be the \ndebt at the end of that period--almost $12 trillion. This President \nwill be responsible for doubling the debt of the country.\n  Already he has more than doubled the amount of American debt held by \nforeign entities. It took all these Presidents--42 Presidents--224 \nyears to run up $1 trillion of external debt. This President has more \nthan doubled that amount in just 5 years. This is an utterly \nunsustainable course, debt on top of debt.\n  The result is, we now owe Japan over $600 billion. We owe China over \n$300 billion. We owe the United Kingdom almost $200 billion. We owe the \noil exporters almost $100 billion. And now Mexico has gotten on to our \nlist of top 10. We owe Mexico $40 billion.\n  Most of the added borrowing we have done to float this boat, most of \nthe money has not come from our own country. We have borrowed more from \nabroad in the last 5 years than we borrowed from America to finance \nthese deficits.\n  Our colleagues are saying: Let's go out and borrow another trillion \ndollars, primarily from Japan and China, in order to give a tax \nreduction to one-half of 1 percent of the estates. This makes no \nearthly sense.\n  Under current law--here we are in 2006--a couple can shield $4 \nmillion. In fact, with any kind of estate planning, they can shield far \nmore than that. In 2009, that will go up to $7 million. That is under \ncurrent law.\n  Under current law, in 2009, 99.8 percent of estates will pay zero. \nThere is no death tax. There is no death tax.\n\n[[Page S5540]]\n\nThere is a tax on wealthy estates, and if we don't get some help from \nthe very wealthiest among us, guess what. We are either going to have \nto ask middle-class people to pay more, or we are just going to keep \nrunning up the debt.\n  The proposal of our friends on the other side is just stack it on the \ndebt, stack it on top of the debt that has already doubled under this \nadministration's watch.\n\n  Already under current law, the number of taxable estates has \ndramatically fallen. In 2000, we had 50,000 estates that were taxable. \nThat was down to 13,000 this year. By 2009, it will be further cut to \njust 7,000.\n  What is this really about? This is really about a handful of wealthy \nfamilies who, according to the New York Times in this morning's paper, \nhave spent more than $200 million over the last several years to \nconvince people there is a death tax. I just had a colleague tell me a \nbaggage handler stopped him and urged him to end this death tax because \nhe was deathly afraid he was going to get taxed. That baggage handler \ndoesn't have to worry. One has to have $4 million in their family \nbefore they pay a penny of tax. With any kind of estate planning, you \ncan shield far more than that.\n  I recently spoke with a North Dakota estate lawyer. He does more \nestates than any lawyer in my state. I said: Is this estate tax with a \n$4 million exemption per family a problem?\n  He said: Kent, it is a nonissue. Not only do you have $4 million, but \nin addition, you have a whole series of things you can do to further \nreduce your tax liability, and on top of that, if you do have any \nliability, you have 14 years to pay if you have a closely held business \nor a farm.\n  You have 14 years to pay. People say there is a liquidity problem. \nThere is no liquidity problem. The only people who have an issue are \nvery wealthy people.\n  I would love to be able to say to them that we can dramatically \nreduce your tax burden, but the problem is we can't pay our bills now. \nPeople say it is the people's money. Absolutely it is. It is also the \npeople's debt, and this debt that is going to be added to is in all of \nour names. This is in all of our names. Are we really going to take on \n$1 trillion of additional debt in order to help a handful of very \nwealthy people who really don't need the help?\n  We have already heard many of them say: Please, don't do this. Warren \nBuffett, the second wealthiest man in the world, said this makes no \nsense at all. Mr. Gates, the father of the richest man in the world, \nhas come before us and said: We don't need this kind of help. We have \nbeen blessed by being in America. We have had the opportunities of \nbeing here. We expect to make an additional contribution.\n  There is something else that should be mentioned, and that is, we \nhave other tax relief we need to consider, and this should be the \npriority over estate tax repeal. Repeal costs $369 billion from 2007 to \n2016. During that same period it would cost $286 billion to extend the \n10-percent bracket. That really does affect people, middle-class \npeople. It would cost $183 billion to extend the child tax credit. That \nreally does affect middle-class people. And it would cost $46 billion \nto extend the marriage penalty relief.\n  I submit these are priorities. These are the issues--extending the \n10-percent bracket, extending child tax credit, extending marriage \npenalty relief--to which we ought to pay attention.\n  Finally, this is a quote from the chairman of the Finance Committee \nlast year:\n\n       It's a little unseemly to be talking about eliminating the \n     estate tax at a time when people are suffering.\n\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee had it right last year. It is \nunseemly. It is unseemly to be eliminating the estate tax when our \ncountry is in deep debt, when our country is at war, when our country \nis running up record deficits, and when there are so many other needs \nthat are the real priority for the people of this country.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Madam President, is it in order for our side to speak \nnow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Missouri \nmay proceed.\n  Mr. TALENT. Madam President, I wish to speak a few minutes today \nabout the repeal of the death tax and why we ought to do it and, the \nvery least, why we ought to vote on it. I do this with a background of \nsomebody who chaired the Small Business Committee in the House for two \nterms and had occasion to have hearings on this proposal and on the \ndeath tax. And more than that, I have spoken over the years with scores \nand scores of small business people and farmers who are penalized by \nthis tax in a particularly demoralizing way. I think it is time to get \nrid of it or at least to vote on getting rid of it. We owe that to \nthem.\n  These are the people who drive America's economy. These are the \npeople who create the jobs, who create the technical innovations on \nwhich we depend. They are particularly hard hit by our death tax, which \nis the most onerous estate tax or death tax in the world.\n  Keep in mind that death taxes work on estates that have already been \ntaxed. There isn't anything in an estate that hasn't already been taxed \nas a lot of it has already been taxed several times, and our death tax \nallows the Government to come in on the demise of a person and collect \nup to 55 percent of what they have worked for, what they have earned, \nand what they saved in the hope they could benefit their children.\n  The death tax is punitive. It costs the economy. It is directed \nprecisely at the kind of activity that we need for economic growth and \nat precisely the kind of people who drive economic growth. Repeal of \nthe death tax would increase nonresidential investment capital by $25 \nbillion, an average of 100,000 to 200,000 jobs a year, greater \ndisposable income for American workers, and stronger economic growth. \nThat is what the economists say when they study it.\n\n  I believe the impact of the death tax is far greater than just what \nthe economists have been able to estimate and monetize because it is a \nparticularly demoralizing tax. It says to the small businesspeople and \nthe farmers, indeed, to everybody who saves and invests, that you can \ndo everything you can to build up your business, you can do everything \nyou can to build up your farm, you can do all that with a view toward \nbenefiting your community, your employees, and making the kind of \nsuccess we want you to make out of your life, you can be successful at \nthe American dream, and then the Government comes in and takes more \nthan half of it and often takes more than half of it under \ncircumstances which have the impact of destroying the whole enterprise. \nThis is not speculation; this is what small businesspeople are saying \nand what they have said year after year after year. I know because I \nhave had them before my committee.\n  Many in Missouri are affected by this tax. Renee Kerchoff is the \nsecond-generation owner of Rudroff Heating and Air-Conditioning, \nstarted in Belton, MO. Because her family worked hard, because they \nwere willing to take risks, because they reinvested what the business \nearned instead of keeping it for themselves, the business has done \nwell. Her father is no longer living. Renee's mother is living. She is \ngoing through the dilemma thousands and thousands of family \nbusinesspeople go through in this country every day: she is trying to \nfigure out how to save the business when her mother passes away because \nshe will owe a huge financial liability to the Federal Government.\n  When I was chairing a committee in the House, I had one woman--not \nMs. Kerchoff but a different woman--break down in front of the \ncommittee trying to explain how she and her brother were unable to save \nthe family business. ``Mr. Chairman,'' she said, ``if we have to sell \nthe business, what is going to happen to the employees?'' What happens \nto employees when you have to liquidate a business? What happens to \nemployees when you have to sell out to a big company? They get laid \noff.\n  Farmers, in the view of this tax, are often considered to be wealthy \nbecause they have farmland maybe near a suburban area that has gone up \nin value. There are farms in Missouri where the land is valued at $1 \nmillion or more. Those farmers would be surprised to hear that the \nFederal Government believes they are wealthy. A lot of that land is \nnear St. Louis or Kansas City. It has gone up in value, but they don't\n\n[[Page S5541]]\n\nhave the cash to pay the tax. They are going to have to sell the farm \nto pay the tax instead of passing it on to their heirs.\n  This is a common story all over the United States. What are these \nfamily businesspeople and farmers trying to do? They are reacting to \nthis. They don't want to sell the business. They don't want to sell the \nfarm. They are spending enormous amounts of time and effort and money \non lawyers and accountants trying to figure out how to preserve what \nthey have built up for their whole lives. Do we want them meeting with \ntheir brothers and sisters and other family members and spending hours \nand hours on an estate plan, or do we want these innovative and hard-\nworking people spending hours and hours figuring out how to grow their \nbusiness and create jobs and grow the economy so that the rest of us \nwill benefit?\n  To me, the answer is clear. We can unleash this layer of people \naround this country by telling them: Look, when you earn money, yes, \nyou are going to pay a substantial amount to the Federal and State \ngovernment--and many of them pay 50 percent or more of their income in \nFederal and State taxes--but once you have paid that, what is left is \nyours. It is yours and your family's. You can reinvest it in the \nbusiness, you can build up the farm, and you don't have to have this \nhanging over your head year after year. We are not going to penalize \nyou for succeeding at the American dream.\n  Heaven knows, enough small businesspeople and farmers fail. They try \ntheir best, but they don't succeed. And here we have a tax which dates \nback decades and decades, an out-of-date tax which punishes people for \ndoing what we want them to do. That is what is wrong with this tax. It \nis economically wrong. It has bad impacts. The think tanks can study it \nand monetize all that and figure out all the bad, negative impacts of \nthis tax, but it is just wrong. It is wrong, when a person has spent \ntheir whole life trying to build something up so they can leave \nsomething to their kids and their grandkids, for the Government to come \nin and take it all, and that is what it amounts to, especially when \nthey have paid taxes on it already.\n  We have a weird tax system. We have a tax system that says to people: \nIf you spend everything you earn, if you are a small businessperson and \nyou take the money out of the business and you consume, if you go out \nand you draw the biggest salary you can draw, you don't expand the \nbusiness, you don't build it up, you don't try to help your employees \nby creating more opportunity for them, you don't try to do anything for \nyour community by expanding the economic base of the community, if you \nspend it all, the Tax Code favors that, we think that is OK. But if you \ntry to do what my parents and the people of my parents' generation \nroutinely did, which is live up to your responsibilities of the next \ngeneration, you try to save it and invest it and grow it because you \nbelieve in America, you believe in the future of the country, and you \nwant to help your kids or your grandkids or somebody else's kids or \ngrandkids, the Government doesn't like that. The Government is going to \ncome in and take all of that. Why? Because we are afraid we are going \nto lose revenue.\n\n  I am a believer that if you trust in the American people, in the hard \nwork, the decency, the foresight of the American people, we are going \nto do OK with revenue. If we grow this economy, the Government will \nhave plenty of revenue.\n  At the very least, we ought to vote on this. I believe it is time for \nus to ask, as a body, are we going to filibuster everything? I mean, is \nthere no bill we can just allow to come to a vote? If you don't like \nthis, vote against it. Now we are filibustering the motion to go to the \nbill. I hope everybody in the country understands that this is a \nfilibuster of an attempt just to debate the bill. We are not even going \nto allow that. Despite the expressed wishes of small business \norganizations and farm organizations, despite the trend in the rest of \nthe world, we are not even going to debate it. We don't trust the \nAmerican people with their money. We don't trust the small businesses \nand the farmers to expand the economy and to create jobs, and we don't \neven trust ourselves to vote on something. No wonder people are \nfrustrated.\n  There is still time to do the right thing here. Let's vote on the \nmotion to proceed, pass the motion to proceed, debate the bill, and \nthen I hope pass the bill--if not a permanent repeal, at least a \nsubstantial permanent reform that lowers this tax substantially, \ncreates simplification, and says to our entrepreneurs, our small \nbusinesspeople, our investors, our farmers: We trust you, and we \nbelieve in you. Go out and do what you want to do because we think that \nis good for America.\n  We still have the chance to do that. I hope we will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong and \nunwavering support for a full repeal of the estate tax, or the death \ntax, as we often refer to it.\n  Until World War I, the Government only imposed an estate tax or \ninheritance tax to raise revenue to fund expenses directly related to \nthe necessities of war. Even then, the rate was measured. However, that \npractice changed after World War I, and unlike four previous occasions, \nthe tax was not repealed once a peace agreement was reached. In fact, \nthe tax continued to increase until it reached 70 percent during \nFranklin Roosevelt's administration.\n  What was once a means to finance war eventually became a significant \nrevenue stream that funded all aspects of a growing Federal \nbureaucracy. Today, the estate tax continues to provide a significant \nrevenue stream to the Federal coffers and functions as a redistribution \nof personal wealth and punishment, basically, to those successful \nbusiness owners seeking a better way of life.\n  The death tax places an undue burden on our Nation's family-owned \nfarms and small businesses. These individuals work tirelessly day in \nand day out to make their own way, to contribute to society and the \neconomy, only to be told their loved ones will be punished when they \ndie. Too often I hear sons and daughters forced to sell a piece--if not \nall--of the legacy their parents worked to create and sustain simply to \npay the estate tax. That scenario is wrong. We should not punish hard \nwork and entrepreneurship; we should reward it. We should reward those \nwho choose to continue their family businesses rather than shut them \ndown. These people work hard to promote prosperity and growth in their \nlocal communities, only to be told by the Federal Government that in \naddition to the taxes they have paid each and every year, they must now \npay an additional tax, the death tax, because someone died.\n  Taxing death has a negative impact on the desire of Americans to \ninvest and to save. A basic economics class will teach you that savings \nand investment are positive for individuals, families, and our economy. \nPunitive taxes such as the estate tax, capital gains tax, dividend tax, \nand the gift tax all have a negative impact on our overall economic \ngrowth.\n  In 2001, as my colleagues well know, Congress acted to eliminate the \nestate tax by January 1, 2010. Unfortunately, this provision sunsets in \n2011, just 1 year after it is fully repealed. As it currently stands, \nin 2011 the Tax Code is set to completely reverse all progress we have \nmade to reduce the tax burden on our Nation's entrepreneurs. So those \nwho are not fortunate enough to die, can you imagine, in 2010 will be \nfaced with the prospect of their loved ones being responsible for as \nmuch as 55 percent of the estate's assets.\n  Whether it is a construction company, a cattle farm, a medical \npractice, or any of 100 other businesses, they all require significant \ncapital investment in land, equipment, and materials that quickly \novercome the threshold we will return to in 2011. These investments are \nnot part of the business; in most cases, they are the business.\n  I am also concerned that, like other taxes I mentioned earlier, the \nestate tax serves as a second bite at the apple. Our current tax system \ntoo often taxes income and then asks for more. The estate tax or death \ntax is one of the more egregious examples of this situation.\n  I believe the Federal Government should work to minimize the burden \non the American taxpayer and to simplify our tax system. The estate tax \nis contrary to both of these purposes. It not\n\n[[Page S5542]]\n\nonly taxes assets a second time, it also is one of the more complicated \ntaxes to comply with in our bloated Tax Code.\n  I believe repeal of the estate tax is one of the many steps we as \nelected representatives of our respective States and people should take \nto spur economic growth, remove the burden on small business, and \nsimplify our tax system, and I urge my colleagues to support immediate \nand full repeal of this tax.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today in strong favor of \nabolishing one of the most unjustified taxes we have in America today: \nthe death tax. Americans should not have to talk to their undertaker \nand their tax man on the same day. Small businesses and family farms \nshould not be forced to close down in order to pay the Government money \nbecause a loved one has passed away. Unfortunately, I see this \nhappening when I travel back to Kentucky every week. We are not looking \nout for our economy or our very own people when we charge them for \ninheriting the American dream.\n  The mom and pop diner on the corner of our town squares and third-\ngeneration farms in our rural areas are being unduly burdened by a \nrepressive Tax Code. In fact, many are forced to close their doors or \nsell out, just so they can afford what the Government says they owe.\n  America's prosperity was created by our entrepreneurial spirit, but \ntoday it is estimated that 70 percent of all businesses never make it \npast the first generation, while 87 percent do not make it to the third \ngeneration, and only 1 percent make it to the fourth generation. Why? \nOne of the big reasons is the burden of the death tax.\n  We call this tax the death tax not only because of the time that it \nstrikes often unsuspecting families but also because it kills American \nbusinesses and jobs. The ridiculous complexities of the death tax \nactually favor individuals whose tax lawyers and accountants plan for \nyears to shield money from estate taxation. The real people who are \naffected by the estate tax are often small businesses and farms, when \ndeath catches them unprepared.\n  The estate tax is equal to an unfair double tax on savings and \ninvestment. In short, it is a tax on the American dream, the dream that \nif you work hard and save money you can leave your children with the \nopportunity to live a happier and more prosperous life than you \nyourself did.\n  Estate taxes give taxpayers an incentive to save less and spend more. \nWe all know that is not what we need in today's economy. The Commerce \nDepartment reported recently that Americans' personal savings fell into \nnegative territory at minus \\1/2\\ percent last year. We ought to be \ndoing all we can to encourage savings, not to penalize people for it. \nWe should give grandparents and parents an incentive to leave their \nchildren with the fruits of their lifelong labors. It is time for the \nSenate to wake up and realize the death tax, which raises only a very \nsmall portion of our revenue, is ready for its own death.\n  Poll after poll has shown us that this is what the American people \nwant us to do. Please, let us join the House of Representatives in \nrepealing this unneeded, burdensome tax.\n  Distinguished colleagues, I urge you to join me in supporting the \nrepeal of the death tax today. The time for talk is over. Today is the \ntime to take an action that can really make a difference. This is the \nonly way we can ensure that our fellow citizens experience the American \ndream, not the American nightmare. I urge my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to make a couple of comments with \nrespect to the bill before us now. I just came from meeting with \nWyoming youngsters who were here with the National Guard, helping young \npeople finishing up with their GEDs, and so on. It was very impressive, \nvery impressive to have young people moving forward and being able, \nhopefully, to be successful. That has a little to do with what we are \ntalking about here today.\n  The fact is, the question of how we treat people who have been \nsuccessful, in terms of their business, in terms of their operations, \nis something we are talking about here. We have had, of course, a \nnumber of discussions on the matter of estate taxes. It seems like we \nhave been back and forth on it for a very long time. The problem is \nstill there. I think this is a great opportunity for us to do something \nsignificant about that.\n  I have to tell you, in a State such as Wyoming where a lot of people \nare in small businesses and ranches and farms, this is a particularly \nimportant one. A family works all their lives--several families. They \nput together an operation--not wealthy families, but the value of the \nproperty is such that when the time comes that the older members of the \nfamily pass away, they have to sell the property in order to pay the \ntax. It takes it away from the continuation in that family and the \nbusiness.\n  I know that is not a brand new idea. I think it is the important \naspect here, that people have paid taxes all through their processes--\nwhenever there is a profit, there is a tax; whenever there is a sale, \nthere would be a tax. But to force the family to have to sell to \naccommodate the tax as an estate tax seems to me effectively a death \ntax, and that is not the way it ought to be.\n  Here is an opportunity for us to do something. I hope we can \neliminate the tax. If we can't, we need to at least make a reasonable \nagreement as to how it might be done in a way that allows people to \ncontinue to pass their businesses and their farms and their ranches on \nto their families, and to be able to do it without being forced to \ndispose of the property before their family can continue to do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to offer my strong support for \npermanent repeal of the death tax.\n  It is said that ``a penny saved is a penny earned.'' Unfortunately, \nthat is not the case for many Americans--especially those who have \nfamily businesses and farms. Instead of being rewarded for their \ninitiative and determination, entrepreneurs are penalized for taking \nadvantage of all this country has to offer.\n  For much of the 21st century, the death tax has burdened this \ncountry's hardest working citizens. It is finally time for Congress to \npermanently repeal this unfair tax. That is why I am pleased to support \nthe Death Tax Repeal Permanency Act. Death should not be a taxable \nevent.\n  Fortunately, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n2001 increased the amount that taxpayers can exempt from estate and \ngift taxes and slowly reduced the rate over the period 2002 through \n2009. This act will fully repeal the death tax for 1 year in 2010.\n  However, if Congress does not act to make this repeal permanent, then \nthe death tax will return to its pre-2001 levels. Failure to \npermanently repeal this tax results in estate-planning uncertainty for \nfamily-owned businesses and farms that are not sure whether or not to \nanticipate the return of the tax in 2011. Furthermore, failure to \npermanently repeal this tax would reinstate an unfair regime that taxes \npeople twice--once on their income and again at their death.\n  One of the tenets of a fair tax system is that income is taxed only \nonce. Income should be taxed when it is first earned or realized, it \nshould not be repeatedly re-taxed by Government. The death tax violates \nthis tenet. At the time of a person's death, much of their savings, \nbusiness assets, or farm assets have already been subjected to Federal, \nState, and local tax. These same assets are then unfairly taxed again \nunder the death tax.\n  One of the most disturbing aspects of the tax is that it can destroy \na family business, or force the sale of a family ranch or farm. Despite \nwhat the opponents may claim, this can and does happen. To prove this \npoint, I would like to share the story of some of my constituents. The \nLaurence family was forced to sell their 1,810 acres of ranch\n\n[[Page S5543]]\n\nland just north of Carbondale, CO. The daughter of the late Rufus \nMerrill Laurence explained that the death tax forced the sale of the \nfamily's ranch, land Mr. Merrill had hoped to keep in the family for \ngenerations to come.\n  No American family should lose its business or ranch because of the \ndeath tax. The problem is that the death tax fails to distinguish \nbetween cash and non-liquid assets, and since family businesses are \noften asset-rich and cash poor, they can be forced to sell assets in \norder to pay the tax. This practice can destroy the business outright, \nor leave it so strapped for capital that long-term survival is \njeopardized.\n  Similarly, more and more large ranches and farms are facing the \nprospect of break-up and sale to developers in order to pay the estate \ntax.\n  The death tax also discourages savings and investment. Former Federal \nReserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan repeatedly warned about the \ndangers of a low national savings rate, and current Fed Chairman Ben \nBernanke has continued to raise the same concerns. Yet the death tax \nsends the message that it is better to consume today than invest and \nmake more money in the future.\n  The death tax also undermines job creation. The Heritage Foundation \nestimates that the death tax alone is responsible for the loss of \nbetween 170,000 and 250,000 potential jobs each year. These jobs are \nnever added to the U.S. economy because the investments that would have \nresulted in higher employment are simply not made.\n  The death tax also holds back overall economic growth. The Joint \nEconomic Committee found that the tax reduces the stock of capital in \nthe economy by $497 billion, or 3.2 percent. Permanent repeal of the \ndeath tax would allow individuals to save more money, spur job \ncreation, and allow business resources to be put toward productive \neconomic activities.\n  America is a nation of tremendous economic opportunity--opportunity \nfor ownership that is available to all who go in search of it. Success \nis determined principally through hard work and individual initiative. \nOur tax policy should focus on encouraging greater initiative rather \nthan on attempts to limit inherited wealth. The death tax is a relic, \nand should be treated as such. It constitutes double taxation, damages \nfamily businesses, and harms the overall economy. It is time for the \ndeath tax to go--and this time, for good.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern \nabout efforts by the President and some in Congress to repeal or all \nbut eliminate the estate tax.\n  The estate tax is an important component of our progressive Federal \ntax system, it is the Federal Government's only tax on wealth, and by \n2009 less than one-half of 1 percent of all estates will be subject to \nthe tax. Far from being a ``death tax,'' the tax falls on heirs who \nseldom had any real role in earning the wealth built up by the estate \nholder.\n  The estate tax is simple: when a very wealthy person dies, the \ndecedent's estate pays a portion of the total assets to the Federal \nGovernment and the remainder is then passed on to heirs. Capital gains \nthat have built up in the estate tax free are passed on to the heirs on \na ``stepped up'' basis, and the heirs are not liable for any income tax \non these gains. No tax is levied if the estate passes to a spouse or is \ndonated to charity. The overwhelming majority of estates pay no Federal \nestate tax.\n  This tax raises significant revenue, it is highly progressive, and it \nprovides an important backstop to the income tax.\n  Today, only estates worth more than $2 million are subject to the \nestate tax and an individual will be able to pass along up to $3.5 \nmillion tax-free by 2009. A couple can pass along twice that amount. \nAnd let's not forget that estate planning often shields even greater \nsums of wealth from taxation.\n  The House Committee on Government Reform estimates that the heirs of \nLee Raymond, former ExxonMobile CEO, and the current CEOs of the five \nlargest U.S. oil companies would receive a windfall of up to $211 \nmillion if the estate tax were permanently repealed. The committee has \nalso calculated that estate tax repeal could save the heirs of \nPresident Bush, Vice President Cheney and 11 Cabinet members as much as \n$344 million.\n  It would be hard to call this a middle class tax cut without \npretending a great deal.\n  Indeed, the Congressional Research Service reports that in 2004 when \nthe exemption was $1.5 million, 99 percent of estates paid no estate \ntaxes whatsoever. It bears repeating that less than one-half of 1 \npercent of estates will pay any tax at all as the estate tax exemption \nclimbs to $3.5 million by 2009.\n  Despite the concerns expressed by some farm and small business \ngroups, the vast majority of taxable estates are those of \nmultimillionaires and billionaires who made their fortunes through \ntheir business and investments in securities and real estate or were \nborn into extremely wealthy families.\n  After the President's tax cuts passed in 2001, he took a victory lap \nthrough Iowa where the New York Times quoted the President as saying:\n\n       I heard somebody say, ``Well, you know, the death tax \n     doesn't cause people to sell their farms.''\n\n  He added:\n\n       I don't know who they're talking to in Iowa.\n\n  Perhaps it was Neil Harl, an Iowa State, University economist whose \ntax advice has made him a household name among farmers throughout the \nMidwest. He has searched far and wide but has never found a case in \nwhich a farm was sold to pay estate taxes. ``It's a myth,'' says \nProfessor Harl, who has only found heirs who wanted to sell the family \nfarm.\n  Even the American Farm Bureau Federation, one of the leading \nadvocates of estate tax repeal, can not provide a single example of a \nfarm lost due to estate taxes.\n  The reality is that only a small fraction of taxable estates consists \nprimarily of family-owned farm or small business assets. The Tax Policy \nCenter estimates that in 2004, only 440 taxable estates--2 percent of \nall taxable estate--were primarily made up of farm or business assets. \nAnd the Congressional Budget Office found that the vast majority of \nfamily farms and small business estates would have sufficient liquid \nassets--such as bank accounts, stocks, bonds, and insurance--to pay the \ntax without having to sell any farm or business assets. CBO also found \nthat with a $3.5 million exemption--$7 million per couple--only 13 or \nfewer farms would encounter any liquidity constraints.\n  Moreover, there are already special provisions in place to ease tax \nburdens for family-owned small businesses and farms, such as allowing \nadditional sums to be bequeathed tax free and permitting estate taxes \nto be paid in installments over 14 years at favorable interest rates.\n  So if saving family farms and small businesses is not the real root \nof the repeal effort, you would think that there would be some sound \neconomic rationale. However, claims by proponents that eliminating the \nestate tax would encourage saving and investment, reward \nentrepreneurship, and contribute to economic growth turn out to be \nmyths as well.\n  Repeal advocates argue that capital assets have already been taxed \nduring the taxpayer's lifetime, so a tax at death is gratuitous. But \nthe reality is that a large share of capital assets has never been \ntaxed. Under current law, we have a provision called the ``step-up'' in \nbasis that allows capital gains from the appreciation of assets--such \nas a house or stocks--during the decedent's lifetime to escape taxation \nthrough 2009. In 2010, the lone year in which full repeal is currently \nslated to be in effect, we switch to a ``carry-over basis'' in which \nheirs of large estates would inherit the potential capital gains \nliability that is realized only when the asset is sold.\n  In effect, today under the pretax law, the heirs receive the estate \nbut on a stepped-up basis--the current value of the home. So for the \nhome the father purchased for $30,000 and is now worth $1 million, they \nreceive the estate based on the value of a million dollars. No taxes \nwere ever paid on that appreciation other than the estate tax.\n  The Small Business Council of America opposes the full repeal of the \nestate tax because they estimate that a great number of small business \nowners will be worse off due to the loss of step-up\n\n[[Page S5544]]\n\nin basis and only an extraordinary few will be better off. Four years \nfrom now, the Halls of Congress will be filled with heirs who won't \nwant to pay taxes that they have inherited with repeal of the estate \ntax.\n  But any economic rationale for repeal falls apart when you learn that \nit will reduce national saving and hurt economic growth. According to \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation, making estate tax repeal permanent \nwould cost an additional $369 billion over 10 years. This estimate, \nhowever, dramatically understates the true cost of repeal. The full \ncost of repeal would not be felt until the second decade, beyond the \ntime period of the budget estimates. In that decade, the cost of repeal \ncould reach nearly $800 billion, plus debt service costs that would \nbring the total to nearly $1 trillion.\n  A compromise plan currently circulating in the Senate would \npermanently raise the exemption to $5 million and cut the top estate \ntax rate to 15 percent, which would cost nearly as much as full repeal, \nand it is not much of a bargain.\n  Rising federal budget deficits make the cost of repeal or ``repeal-\nlite'' even more unpalatable. The drain on the budget would occur at \nthe very time that the baby boom generation enters retirement and \nrising Social Security and Medicare costs would strain our budget.\n  The President's tax cuts were passed at a time of huge projected \nsurpluses in the Federal budget. The surpluses have been squandered by \nthis administration and with deficits as far as the eye can see, it is \nsimply irresponsible for the President and Republicans in Congress to \npress for full repeal of this tax.\n  By financing repeal with debt, we would be replacing the so-called \n``death tax'' for a few very wealthy heirs with a ``birth tax'' for \nall, an action that seems neither wise nor fair. The cost of estate tax \nrepeal will be paid for with borrowed money. Future generations of \ntaxpayers--who will make significantly less than the deceased \nmultimillionaires and billionaires whose estates would no longer owe \ntaxes--will have to repay those funds. Estate tax repeal would raise \nthe per-person debt burden by about $3,000 in just the first 10 years \nafter the tax disappears.\n  In 2005, the CEO of ExxonMobile earned $9.1 million. Contrast that \nwith the fact that the typical firefighter, police officer, or soldier \ntoday makes less than $50,000 a year and the inequity of this repeal is \ninescapable.\n  Clearly, estate tax repeal will predominately benefit the heirs of a \nhandful of very wealthy estates. According to the Forbes 2005 ``World's \nRichest'' list, three members of the Mars family have $10.4 billion \neach and four members of the Walton family have nearly $20 billion \neach. These heirs still rank among the world's wealthiest people even \nafter taxes.\n  Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson and Johnson fortune, put it this \nway, ``I was always told that the American Dream is about getting a \nbigger and better life than your parents have. But that dream was \naccomplished by my great-grandfather. ``\n  In their book about the history and politics of the estate tax, Death \nby a Thousand Cuts, Yale professors Michael J. Graetz and Ian Shapiro \nprovide an eye-opening account of how a few very wealthy individuals \nand families have been working long and hard behind the scenes on \nrepeal efforts. In the meantime, some of the wealthiest Americans--\nincluding Warren Buffett, William Gates, Sr., George Soros, and Ted \nTurner--have warned about the corrosive effect of eliminating the \nestate tax.\n  When Teddy Roosevelt endorsed the idea of an inheritance tax, he said \nthat its ``primary objectives should be to put a constantly increasing \nburden on the inheritance of those swollen fortunes, which it is \ncertainly of no benefit to this country to perpetuate.'' Indeed, our \nFounding Fathers abandoned an economic aristocracy--where large \nfortunes were handed down generation after generation, concentrating \nwealth and power--to create a meritocracy based on the ideal of equal \nopportunity for all. Underlying the estate tax is the notion that \nbecause our government provides a stable environment for wealth to be \ncreated and flourish--our financial markets, legal system, regulatory \nsystem, and strong national defense--society is owed a modest return on \nthose investments.\n  Television ads last year depicted a World War II veteran supporting \nthe repeal of the estate tax, the underlying message being that the tax \nis somehow unpatriotic. Ironically, the estate tax was first adopted in \nthe nineteenth century to pay for government shortfalls due to wartime \nspending.\n  Today, we are at war and yet there is no sense of the shared \nsacrifice that has united this country in past conflicts. Our military \nfamilies are making tremendous sacrifices, and too many of them have \nmade the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country. With $320 \nbillion appropriated or pending for Iraq operations to date and nearly \n2,500 service men and women killed, the human and financial tolls are \nboth more staggering than imagined.\n  With mounting war costs, the impending retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration and deficits as far as the eye can see, it is unconscionable \nto think that we are going to vote on repealing one of the most \nprogressive taxes on the books.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about the death tax. It is not the \ndeath tax. It is the estate tax. But there is a death tax that is paid \nby Americans to sustain and support this country--and it is terribly \nunfair because it falls on a few. In Iraq, it has fallen upon 2,480 of \nour soldiers. In Afghanistan, it has fallen upon 299. It also falls \nupon the police and fire officers who each day risk their lives and \nsome who give their lives. They truly pay the death tax. They will \nnever be touched by this estate tax.\n  The average base pay of a specialist in the U.S. Army is $24,000. He \nwon't be worried nor will his family be worried about the estate tax. \nFirefighters make about $40,000; police officers, $47,000 on average in \nthis country. Yet, sadly, too many of them each year for their country \npay the ultimate death tax. It is more debilitating than any check one \nsends to the IRS.\n  What do they need? What do their families need? They certainly need a \nstrong, robust economy that will support their families in the future.\n  For those young Americans who are wounded in action--and right now in \nIraq, 17,869--they need a strong Veterans Administration to support \nthem years from now just when this repeal of the estate tax burden \nwould take its toll and take more and more money away from the Federal \nrevenue.\n  They are the ones who really pay the cost. If we pass this measure, \nwe won't be able to help them when they need the help. We won't be able \nto support the Veterans' Administration system. We won't be able to \nprovide the kind of support for education, for opportunities for higher \neducation that will be so necessary for their children.\n  This repeal vote misses the point. The death tax was a slogan thought \nup by Republican operatives to sell an idea that does not have a \ncompelling economic rationale. But there is a real death tax, and \nsadly, Americans in uniform must pay it for this country every day. \nThey will receive no benefit from this repeal. Indeed, our ability to \nhelp them and their families will be limited in the years ahead.\n  I don't think this is just bad policy, it is unconscionable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I come to the Senate today to discuss \nthe issue of estate tax with a little bit of a different perspective \nfrom some of my Democratic colleagues who have spoken so very \npassionately on this issue already today.\n  I respect many of their approaches and concerns, but I come to this \nissue from a little bit of a different perspective. That perspective is \nbecause I believe the estate tax in its current form is unfair.\n  Outright repeal of the estate tax for family-owned businesses and \nfarms has been a goal of mine since I entered Congress 14 years ago. I \nhave grown up on a seventh generation Arkansas\n\n[[Page S5545]]\n\nfarm. I have watched as small communities and family-owned businesses \nhave dwindled from their inability to maintain their competitiveness in \nthe ever-growing global community, but also with the unbelievable \nchallenges they face of the cost of health care, the cost of doing \nbusiness, real estate costs, and others.\n  I have seen too many small business owners and farmers in my home \nState restrict the growth of their enterprises in order to avoid facing \nthe impossible choice of leaving their families with an up to 55 \npercent Federal tax burden or the other option of selling off portions \nof their assets when they die in order to pay that tax.\n\n  However, because of our current budgetary constraints, I do recognize \noutright repeal is not feasible. Not at this time. With that said, it \nis more important than ever that we do what we can now to provide some \ncertainty and relief for those who are so drastically impacted by this \ntax.\n  Last week, I received a phone call from a constituent who owns a \nfamily trucking and farming equipment business. The business was \nstarted by the family in 1927. Over the years and through much hard \nwork they have grown from a small dealership into a thriving family \nbusiness that now employs more than 450 Arkansans.\n  I hope many of us will continue to focus on the issue that small \nbusinesses are the No. 1 employer in this country and are the least \nlikely to send their jobs overseas. They are the foundation, in many \ninstances, of our communities. Whether it is the sponsor of our Little \nLeague teams or the group that is sponsoring the Cub Scout campout, we \nknow they are the heart of our communities in rural America.\n  Seeing this business grow, we all are thrilled to hear these stories. \nI am particularly thrilled to hear stories of families, families who \nhave invested their capital, their hard work, ideas, and their lives in \ntheir trade, and are ultimately successful in realizing that American \ndream we all talk about.\n  This same story is repeated all over our great State of Arkansas, \nwhether it be the jewelry store owner in Fayetteville, the meatpacker \nin Morrilton, the car dealer in Springdale, or the timber farmer in \nMonroe County.\n  Indeed, these stories can be heard across our entire Nation. Family \nbusinesses are the engines of our small communities. It is the family-\nowned businesses that provide the jobs, the wages, and the health care, \nin most instances, for our constituents. It is the family-owned \nbusiness that sponsors our Little League teams or pays our local State \nand Federal taxes. They are an intricate part of the community. They \nlive in our rural communities. They care about what happens to them.\n  Yet because of the estate tax, we are forcing them to spend valuable \nassets on estate planning and life insurance rather than creating more \njobs by investing and expanding their businesses. We are putting them \nat a disadvantage with their publicly traded competitors.\n  What kind of risk do major publicly traded corporations have to \nmitigate against with the death of a CEO? None. But a family-owned \nbusiness has to spend tremendous amounts of resources in mitigating \nagainst that risk.\n  I, for one, intend to fight for these family businesses, fight for \nthese communities, and fight for these jobs in rural America. \nUnfortunately, as this businessman from my State was quick to point out \nto me, we in Washington have left far too many of these family \nbusinesses in a quagmire as a result of the erratic estate tax policy \nwe set in 2001. Under the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation \nAct of 2001, the estate tax will be phased out in 2010 only to come \nback in full force in 2011 at a 55-percent rate.\n  For the family-owned business and farms which comprise more than 80 \npercent of all business enterprises in America, and which spend tens of \nthousands of dollars each year in planning for this tax, the status quo \nis unacceptable. It is not acceptable because many of our mom-and-pop \nshops are having to lock a significant portion of their capital \nresources into estate planning that may or may not be needed down the \nroad. For small businesses with very limited liquidity, the uncertainty \nis paralyzing at a time when we should be giving them every opportunity \nto expand.\n  At the expense of our family businesses, this issue has been used by \nsome as a political football for far too long. It should end now. It \ncan end now. Since current policy was set in 2001, we have revisited \nthis issue in the Senate on multiple occasions. However, each time we \nhave had the opportunity to act, we have failed to reach a reasonable \nsolution, a compromise, which is what most people in this country want \nCongress to do, to come together to bring results for the problems they \nexperience, not an end-all-be-all solution but a compromise that gets \nthem some results.\n  In this Congress, interested parties on both sides of the aisle have \nbeen at the negotiating table since early last summer. We have the \ninformation we need to form a compromise solution. We have that \nopportunity now. It is my understanding from leaders on the other side \nof the aisle that should a true compromise be forged on this issue \nprior to tomorrow's vote, a vote on that compromise would be allowed.\n  Let me emphasize again, the time for a solution is now. Our economy \nis yearning for the investment of these small businesses, these family-\nowned businesses, that can help regenerate what we need in our economy, \nthe jobs in our community that we need them to expand on. The time for \nthe solution is now, not later.\n  We have told these family businesses now is not the time far too many \ntimes already. I am so very hopeful this time we will do better. We \nknow we do not have the perfect solution. But we also know if we do not \nseize the opportunity to provide them the certainty they need to \ncontinue their businesses, to take the money they are now spending on \nestate planning and reinvest those dollars into the job creation and \nthe expansion of their businesses, we will have missed a great \nopportunity.\n  We have the opportunity to come together, to provide some certainty \nfor these family businesses through the estate tax reform by raising \nthe estate tax exemption, reducing that tax rate to a reasonable level. \nLet's not let that opportunity slip away.\n  I encourage my colleagues, come to the table. Look at what we have to \nwork with. We have enthusiastic American family jobs and businesses \nthat want desperately to be a part of making this country strong. We \nhave an opportunity to offer them some solutions, some certainty, in \norder to be able to do just that, to give back to this great country \nthat has given them the opportunity to create and build a family and a \nfamily business they are enormously proud of.\n  Let us not let this opportunity slip away. I encourage my colleagues \nto please take seriously this issue--not politically, but seriously, \nthe issue of the relief that we can provide by coming together on a \ncompromise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today we have another clear chance to \nsee the priorities of the other side of the aisle. While my Republican \ncolleagues claim to have a plan to address gas prices, college tuition, \nand middle-class tax breaks, today the American people can see what the \ntrue agenda is: another gift to the wealthiest Americans who need it \nthe least.\n  Tomorrow, we will vote on whether we should consider permanently \nrepealing a tax that only affects those who inherit estates larger than \n$4 million. We will be voting on whether repealing this tax should be a \ntop priority for the United States Senate. And we will be voting on \nwhether repealing a tax for those with multi-million dollar estates is \na good way to spend the American people's tax dollars--$1 trillion of \nthose tax dollars, to be exact.\n  In my State of more than 8 million, only 1,100 New Jerseyans paid any \nestate tax in 2004. Of those New Jerseyans who inherited an estate, a \nsmall 1.5 percent paid any estate tax when the exemption was $2 \nmillion. Today, that exemption has doubled, and in three years, it will \nhave more than tripled, so even fewer New Jerseyans will be affected. I \nstrongly support giving estate tax relief to family farmers, small \nbusiness owners and others who need it, but that's not what this bill \ndoes. This bill showers a trillion dollars in benefits on the top half \npercent of Americans at a time of record debt and deficits.\n  By contrast, however, more than 120,000 New Jerseyans have benefited\n\n[[Page S5546]]\n\nfrom a tax deduction for college tuition that Republicans have let \nexpire. We had the chance to extend this deduction in the most recent \ntax bill, but somehow, the tuition deduction just didn't make the list \nof priorities in a $70 billion bill of tax cuts.\n  We cannot honestly pretend that repealing this tax is a priority for \nthe American people; 99.5 percent of Americans aren't affected by this \ntax. And 3 years from now, under current law, even fewer will be \nsubject to it. Congress has already acted on the estate tax, increasing \nthe exemption level from $1.3 million to $4 million, so that only a \nquarter of the estates taxed in 2000 pay a tax today. Under current \nlaw, those who inherit a $7 million estate in 2009 will pay no tax.\n  And yet, the American people are being told that this is about saving \nthem from more taxation. Small businesses are being told that the \nestate tax could be the death of their business. The average American \nis now in fear that they, too, might have to pay a burdensome tax when \na parent dies. But the American people should see these for what they \nare: scare tactics.\n  Instead, the American people should be up in arms that this is the \nissue their Senators think is a high priority. They should be furious \nthat instead of dealing with any of the issues they are concerned \nabout, instead of addressing energy prices, instead of providing a \ntuition deduction to help families with the cost of college, we are \ntalking about repealing taxes for the super wealthy.\n  So let's not be swayed by a few stories or scare tactics.\n  Instead, let's look at the facts. The fact is that under the current \nexemption, only 135 small businesses Nation-wide have to pay any estate \ntax. The fact is that while full repeal would help those with \nmultimillion dollar estates--such as Vice President Cheney, who would \nsave up to $60 million from repeal or former Exxon Mobil Chairman Lee \nRaymond, who would save $164 million--full repeal would actually hurt \nmost small businesses, according to the Small Business Council of \nAmerica.\n  And the fact is, while this may save a few millions for a handful of \nmultimillionaires, the American people will be paying off the cost of \nrepealing this tax for years to come.\n  Let's see this for what it is. This is a tax that does not affect \n99.5 percent of Americans. This is not a tax crisis, and it is not a \nfamily business crisis. Repealing it is irresponsible. Greater debt \nupon the next generation of Americans for the benefit of a wealthy few \nis morally wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to strongly endorse H.R. 8, the \nDeath Tax Repeal Permanency Act of 2005 and urge my colleagues to vote \nfor it. This has been brought up year after year for decades. I hope my \ncolleagues will vote in favor of giving the death penalty to the death \ntax. It is an unfair tax.\n  I like listening to all the different commentaries. The preceding \nspeaker from New Jersey was acting as if it is the Government's money, \nthat this is the taxpayers' money somehow going to those who have \nestates. It is individuals, human beings. Americans are the ones who \nare the owners of their property, not the Government. My view, as a \nmatter of principle, is that death should not be a taxable event. The \nsale of an asset ought to be the taxable event.\n  This is an important tax policy that affects family businesses, small \nfarms, people all over this country who would like to pass on their \nAmerican Dream, what they worked on and worked for and accrued through \ntheir lives, to their children.\n  I was listening to the Senator from Arkansas who said she wanted a \nsolution, fairness, and certainty. There is going to be a chance to \nhave that fairness, that certainty and solution. Tomorrow we will vote \non this measure, and we can repeal the death tax. That will bring a \nsolution. It will bring fairness, and it will bring certainty.\n  In 2001, I proudly supported efforts to reduce taxes on families, \nindividuals, and small businesses, and also to phase out over a period \nof time the death tax. We reduced the death tax in the strange way that \nthey do things in Washington. The death tax was at 55 percent. It gets \nreduced over a period of years, until the year 2010, to zero. In 2006, \nit is one amount; in 2008, it is another. By 2010, it is down to zero. \nBut then in the year 2011, it goes back up to 55 percent and a \n$600,000-something exemption. One would think in looking at this tax \npolicy that the folks in Washington are incentivizing the American \npeople to die in the year 2010. If they die that year, there is no \ndeath tax. If they survive, then they will be subjected to a 55-percent \ntax. This is a strange and odd policy. It hurts hard-working taxpayers \nwho wish to leave their life's work to their loved ones.\n  It has harmed entrepreneurs and innovators who want to rely on a \npredictable, consistent tax system so that they can invest and create \njobs and expand opportunity and spur economic growth. This absurd, \ncomplicated tax policy does not allow people to plan with a simple, \nstable, and certain tax law.\n  We have an opportunity to give the death penalty to the death tax \nonce and for all. This is the right thing to do for a number of \nreasons. First and foremost is the issue of fairness. Talking about \nwhose money is this, if an American man or woman earns money, they get \nhit with an income tax. If they invest it, they get hit with taxes on \nany interest. If they sell an asset that they have invested in, that \nends up getting hit with a capital gains tax. Dividends are taxed. \nInterest is taxed. If they buy something with that earned money that \nhas already been taxed once or twice before, they pay a sales tax. And \nas a practical matter, the Government taxes people to death. Then, \nafter they do die, what happens? You have, in effect, the IRS, like a \nbunch of buzzards, hovering around at the funeral trying to get another \nchunk out of what is left from that person who is deceased.\n  I like to paraphrase Virginia's first Governor, Patrick Henry: There \nshould be no taxation without respiration in the United States of \nAmerica. We do need to get rid of this death tax.\n  Part of the American dream is to be able to pass on what you have \nworked for or the business you have started. You may have inherited it \nfrom someone else or bought it, but you built it up and would like to \npass it on. A majority of Americans agree. About 70 percent of \nAmericans, according to surveys, support it, even if they would not be \nsubjected to this tax, because they recognize how unfair it is to be \ntaxing death. This is a matter of fairness that the American people \nunderstand.\n  The second reason to eliminate the death tax is that it has a harmful \neffect on our economy. In many cases, the assets that are subjected to \nthe death tax have already been taxed once or twice or three or four \ntimes before. That means the death tax is the fourth or fifth tax. It \ndrains our economy. It provides little incentive to keep a farm and \nprovides little incentive for a business to expand or to improve \nbecause its value would go up.\n  We have done a lot of things in the last few years that are \nbeneficial for small business: For example, the $100,000 expensing for \ncapital equipment as opposed to $25,000. That new equipment will make \nthat company or that enterprise more productive, more efficient, and \nundoubtedly more profitable. But if you keep doing that year after year \nand improving it, you will improve the value of your business, making \nit subject to the death tax which is obviously counterproductive.\n  Another way this unfair tax hits people in the Commonwealth of \nVirginia is to look at the outer suburbs, Prince William County, Loudon \nCounty, the Piedmont of Virginia, the Shenandoah Valley. Someone may \nhave farmland or forestry property in the hills and mountains. That \nproperty, when someone dies, is not taxed at what the value would be \nfor running cattle on it or growing trees. It is taxed by the Federal \nGovernment at its highest and best use. The highest and best use of \nmost of this property is not running cattle or growing soybeans or \ntimber. It is going to be taxed at what the value would be if it were \nsubdivided into a development or if it were along a highway \ncommercially. So what happens so often is urban sprawl or suburban \nsprawl in the Piedmont, the Shenandoah Valley, the Richmond area, and \nelsewhere in Virginia and in the country because that forestry property \nwill give you just the return when you harvest the timber. But to pay \nthose\n\n[[Page S5547]]\n\ntaxes, you will have to get a loan. You are not going to get enough \nincome off of that property to be able to pay those taxes. So what \nhappens is that that forestry property or that family farm gets \nsubdivided to pay the Federal Government death taxes. And whatever \nremains of that farm, if any, after it is subdivided, is a less \nefficient farming or agricultural or forestry operation.\n  This does harm people in a variety of ways, not just fairness, not \njust impeding and countering incentives for improving a business. It \nalso means for Virginia ending up with more suburban sprawl. Talk to \ndevelopers when they develop a subdivision. It is usually and so often \nfrom an estate sale where that family cannot keep the family farm \ngoing, and it changes the nature of many communities.\n  I have listened to all the arguments: Gosh, why can't we do this, and \nwhy can't we do that. We can do a lot tomorrow. We can act. It is \nsomething that has been promised year after year. Some people may not \nthink it is entirely how they would like it, but why not do something \npositive, constructive and useful and follow the will of the majority \nof the Senators. Those of us advocating this are not in the minority. \nWe are in the majority. There is a supermajority needed to keep \nproceeding, but stop the obstruction. Let's follow the will of the \nmajority of the American people, the will of a majority of the Senate, \nand for tax fairness, for tax simplification, for certainty and \nstability of tax policy, let's kill the death tax once and for all and \nprovide new life to the American economy and the American Dream.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I echo what my colleague from Virginia has \nsaid and rise in support of repealing the unfair death tax.\n  It is fair to say that death should not be a taxable event. There is \ndecisive majority support in the Senate for repealing the death tax. \nAnd if you look at what happened in the House of Representatives, 272 \nvotes in favor of repealing the death tax, a bipartisan vote in the \nHouse, and a big, bipartisan support vote in the Senate. What is \nhappening is it gets filibustered. It takes 60 votes to end the \nfilibuster. I hope my colleagues will join with the rest of us, those \nwho have chosen to try to block this from consideration, and vote with \nus to at least allow us to proceed to consideration, to proceed to a \nvote, to allow the will of the Senate and what I believe is the will of \nthe majority of the people in the country to be worked.\n  It is an unfair tax because the Donald Trumps and Paris Hiltons of \nthe world, which are the examples most often used by our colleagues on \nthe other side, are not going to pay it. They have a team of lawyers \nand accountants who are going to make sure that they pay little or no \ndeath tax. It is family-owned farms and small businesses that will end \nup paying the tax.\n  There are a lot of numbers being put up by both sides in this debate. \nAfter spending a little time in Washington, it becomes clear that just \nabout everyone can find a statistic to support their particular point \nof view. I brought with me some real South Dakota stories that can help \nus understand who the death tax can hit and how it can hurt or even \nshut down a family farm or business.\n  Perhaps the most well-known example of a family-owned and operated \nbusiness in my State of South Dakota is Wall Drug. I had hoped to have \na poster to show it because people across this country, anybody who has \ntraveled down interstate 90 in South Dakota has seen signs for Wall \nDrug. Although it currently draws thousands of people every day, Ted \nand Dorothy Hustead never imagined the success of their family-owned \nand operated business. Wall Drug wasn't always the tourist attraction \nit is today.\n  In fact in 1931, Ted and Dorothy Hustead and their son Bill moved to \nthe prairie town of Wall, SD. Ted was a pharmacist and started his own \ndrugstore with $3,000 left behind for him by his father. After a 5-year \ntrial, the Husteads were ready to give up their family-owned business \nuntil Dorothy's extraordinary advertising idea.\n  The Husteads began advertising free ice water on the billboards to \ndraw people in who were traveling across the hot, vast prairie of South \nDakota.\n  The story is told that before they could get back to the store, after \nputting the signs up on what used to be highway 16 in South Dakota, \nthere were already customers streaming into the store to get some of \nthis free ice water. The first sign sprung up on highway 16 and it \nturned out to be the key to their success. Today, Wall Drug's \nadvertisements are still along the highways of South Dakota, still \nadvertising free ice water, along with other more modern draws. Their \nsigns can also be seen all over the world, often with the mileage \ndutifully added. My office is 1,565 miles from Wall Drug.\n  This didn't happen overnight. In 1951, Ted and Dorothy's son, Bill \nHustead, joined the business, working to create the family attraction \nthat Wall Drug is today. The second-generation Husteads expanded the \nbusiness and increased advertising spending.\n  In 1981, Bill's oldest son Rick became the first member of the third \ngeneration to join the business. Later joined by brother Ted, the \nthird-generation owners continue to run the family business based upon \nthe same western hospitality once embodied by their grandparents. \nHolding its reputation high, Wall Drug represents America's strong \nentrepreneurial spirit, built on innovation and perseverance and passed \ndown through three generations of the Hustead family.\n  Why do I use this illustration to tell the Wall Drug story? Because \nit would be a shame to see family operations such as Wall Drug be sold \noff because of an untimely death in the family. That is what might \nhappen to this business and these two other South Dakota stories that I \nwill share with you. The effect of the death tax is very real on these \nfamily-owned operations, family-owned businesses.\n  In central South Dakota sits a 3,000-acre family farm. I will \ndescribe it as a medium-sized farming operation in South Dakota--not \ntoo big, not too small. Unfortunately, a death occurred in the family. \nAs a result, $750,000 will likely be paid in taxes. This is a huge \namount of money for a farm operation in my State, where land values can \nmake an operation look a lot more valuable on paper than they are in \nreality. In other words, farmers like this can often be described as \n``land rich'' and ``cash poor.'' All their value is in their land. When \na massive death tax bill comes due, the only option is often to sell \nthe land to pay this unjust tax. Thus, a family legacy comes to an end.\n  There is another operation in my State of South Dakota, with 10,000 \nacres in the north central part of the State. Like so many farms and \nranches in South Dakota, the parents who have run the place for decades \nare now advancing in years. In this particular family, the mother \npassed away and the father is getting on in age. Their kids would like \nto continue in the business, but the tax on the farm would likely be \n$1.5 million. That might make it impossible for the kids to stay on and \nkeep that family farm alive. I find it very disturbing that our Federal \nTax Code could influence a family's ability to keep their farm from \nbeing broken up and sold off.\n  These are examples of real family farms that are facing the effects \nof the death tax. This is just not an exercise in the theoretical. Real \nfarms, ranches, and real small businesses are watching how the Senate \nis going to act on this important issue. Our action, or inaction, this \nweek will affect real businesses in each of our States.\n  Mr. President, in my State and other rural States, we are seeing the \nnext generation leave for school and, too often, not coming back. We \nneed to put in place incentives for our young people to keep rural \nAmerica alive and strong. The death tax is an incentive for exactly the \nopposite effect. It can help push young people away from carrying on \nthe family business in rural places. I hope the Senate will do the \nright thing and bring a permanent end to the unfair death tax.\n  I will offer one final thought on an argument we are hearing from the \nother side of the aisle. I have heard it said that repealing the death \ntax will add up to $1 trillion to the deficit. We heard a similar \nargument made when it came to reducing the tax rate on capital gains. \nThe other side was wrong then, and they will be wrong again this time.\n  The analysts who have churned out figures in the trillion-dollar \nrange are\n\n[[Page S5548]]\n\nnot taking into consideration the nature of the death tax and its \nlarger impact on the economy. With the death tax permanently killed, \nfamily business owners would then reroute tens of thousands of dollars \nfrom lawyers and accountants hired to avoid being hit by the death tax \nback into their business. There this capital would be used to hire \nanother employee or add value to their operation.\n  In fact, repealing the death tax would remove the asterisk on the \nAmerican promise of passing your hard-earned business or nest egg to \nyour children or grandchildren. The death tax in its current form has a \nchilling effect on the creation of new family businesses that would be \ncreated if assets could be passed down to the next generation. How many \nnext generation beneficiaries would have invested in a new business if \nonly they had sufficient capital to do so? How often has the death tax \nprevented this? How many potential jobs were not created as a result?\n\n  The changes in economic behavior if the death tax was no longer a \nfactor to consider is hard to determine. But the dividend and capital \ngains rate reductions serve as a good indicator. Those rate reductions \nhave paid for themselves many times over in increased Government \nrevenue.\n  Last month's budget report from the Treasury Department has tax \nreceipts up by $137 billion, up 11.2 percent for the first 7 months of \nfiscal year 2006. The year before, if you look at 2004 to 2005, there \nwas a $274 billion increase in Federal revenues, or 14.6 percent more \nFederal revenues for fiscal year 2005. Reducing those taxes spurred \neconomic growth and increased Government revenue. That is exactly what \nI expect would happen if we were to eliminate once and for all the \ndeath tax.\n  So I ask my colleagues to take a look at the death tax and getting \nrid of it simply as a matter of bringing fairness to our Tax Code. That \nis how the American people view it; that is how South Dakotans view it. \nEven though many Americans might not have a substantial nest egg to \npass on to their children, they understand the death tax to be unfair. \nFor that reason, they oppose it. They also know that it is those very \nsame small businesses, small farms, and ranch operations that are \ncreating jobs and making it possible for young people to continue to \nstay in the rural areas of this country.\n  One recent poll suggests that 68 percent of Americans support \nrepealing the death tax. It is simply unfair for death to be a taxable \nevent. I urge my colleagues to allow us to vote, allow us to proceed to \nthe debate, and to get an up-or-down vote on the floor of the Senate, \nand to join the House of Representatives, which passed it by a very big \nbipartisan vote--legislation that would repeal and end the death tax \nonce and for all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I speak in favor of doing away with the \ndeath tax. To follow a principle of taxation and not just for the sole \npurpose of doing away with the tax, but following on what the Senator \nfrom South Dakota said, an obvious one is that death should not be an \nincident of taxation--not because it is death, but because when you \ncollect taxes in an instance like that, it is like a fire sale. When \nyou force a sale at a particular time to pay taxes, the value is going \nto be less than if the marketplace works. So by letting the asset pass \nfrom one generation to the other and letting the succeeding generation \nsell it according to the willing buyer/willing seller, more money is \ngoing to come in. That is a principle that has been laid out by the \nSenator from South Dakota.\n  Another principle that hasn't been spoken about yet is when to tax \nfor Government services--tax income the earliest it is made, and tax it \nonce. Beyond that, you ought to let the marketplace decide the value of \nsomething and tax it accordingly. Under both circumstances, more money \nis going to come into the Federal Treasury.\n  So I believe that death should not be a taxable event. Since I have \nbeen in the U.S. Senate, I have been working on reform of the estate \ntax. Taxing people's assets upon their death is just plain wrong--not \nwrong to the heirs as much as it is wrong to think that you are going \nto get more money into the Federal Treasury that way than if you let \nthe marketplace work and determine the true value of something with a \nwilling buyer and a willing seller.\n  Heirs should not be forced to sell a single asset in order to meet an \narbitrary tax due date--the due date caused by death. Assets should not \nhave to be sold to pay taxes. The market should determine when things \nare bought and sold. That is the best measurement--when a willing buyer \nmeets a willing seller and they agree on a price and a time when that \nasset should be sold.\n  Unfortunately, under existing law, we have it all wrong. Under \ncurrent law, in 2011 when we will once again have an estate tax due and \nowing within 9 months of death of 55 percent, and even in some cases up \nto 60 percent, that is just not right. It is not right for the family \ninvolved and it is not the best thing for the Federal Treasury, because \nthat is not going to bring in the massive amount of revenue that would \ncome in if the marketplace were working. It is not right because we \nhave forced many unwilling sellers to have to deal with a very willing \nshark of a buyer who is waiting in the murky waters of tax uncertainty.\n  Some people wonder why I care so much about this issue. I have \nreporters from big city newspapers calling me, because I am a U.S. \nSenator, to remind me that Iowa is somewhat economically poor compared \nto very so-called wealthy places, like New York City, and that land and \ncompanies in the Midwest are not worth much. They take great joy in \ncalling up my constituents--probably very randomly--and maybe stopping \nby once or twice for a so-called investigation about the haves and the \nhave-nots of our State. They do it trying to find out the grassroots \nfeeling about this great tax debate.\n  I may not get to write on the front page of a fancy urban newspaper, \nbut I do get to talk to a lot of my constituents because I visit every \ncounty every year to find out what is important to my constituents \nthrough my town meetings. I will give you, from those meetings, a \ncouple of examples, as my colleague from South Dakota did for his \nState, of why I think this debate is so important and this bill is so \nimportant and this cloture vote should pass.\n  Unfortunately, we have it all wrong. Under current law, in 2011 we \nwill once again have an estate tax due and owing within 9 months of \ndeath of 55 percent and even in some cases up to 60 percent. That just \nis not right. We have forced many unwilling sellers to have to deal \nwith a very willing ``shark'' of a buyer waiting in the murky waters of \ntax uncertainty. These are real people who live in Iowa. They have \ndevoted their entire lives, for multiple generations, to building \nbusinesses and creating good jobs for people of rural Iowa.\n\n  Over 40 years ago, Eugene and Mary Sukup started a grain handling and \nstorage manufacturing company in Sheffield, IA. On my family farm, my \nson and I used Sukup equipment to store our corn and soybeans and to \nuse drying equipment for drying corn for storage. So I know that the \nSukups, as a family manufacturing business, have a quality product and \nthey serve their customers well, and they serve all Iowa well in the \nsense of jobs. Today, the Sukup family and the next generation of two \nsons and their families are involved; they are still headquartered in \nthis little community of Sheffield, IA, with a population of 968 \npeople. But they employ over 300 people from 5 different counties, in \ngood-paying jobs, with good retirement plans. In fact, the original \nemployee team that started with them 40 years ago is still there today, \nand, in many cases, the next generation of that family has also joined \nthe team.\n  In addition, the Sukups' facilities in other States, also \ncontributing to the economy of those other States, like Defiance, OH; \nJonesboro, AR; Arcola, IL; Aurora, NE; and Watertown, SD-- places where \ngood jobs and hard work that isn't flashy and doesn't make the scandal \npage of big city papers are valued as important ingredients of down-\nhome, good living. These are the places where people invest in the \nlocal economy and contribute to the community as good taxpaying \ncitizens.\n\n  Let me tell you about another little Iowa town, Shenandoah. That is \nwhere Lloyd Inc. is located. It, too, is not a flashy company. They \nstarted making\n\n[[Page S5549]]\n\nanimal dietary mixes in 1958 and now is a significant provider of \nveterinary drugs. Eugene Lloyd is a doctor of veterinary medicine and \nthe CEO of the company. He tells me that the company has never laid off \nemployees due to poor business cycles and employs over 80 well-educated \npeople in Shenandoah, a town of less than 6,000 people.\n  The company has also provided generous health care and retirement \nplans to their employees and, like I said, in rural America, those \nbenefits are very important.\n  Unfortunately, even after vigilant estate planning, these two family-\nowned companies will be facing a combined estate tax bill of well over \n$40 million. That is $40 million that will leave the State of Iowa. The \ncompanies will probably face a fire sale and so often, it is sold to \nsomeone with no interest or desire to maintain the current location or \ncontributions to the community. So there are two companies, two towns, \n6 counties, 4 families and hundreds of employees, all of which will be \nhurt if we don't do something about the death tax. Businesses will be \nsold, locations will be shut down, and real people will lose good jobs \nand the State of Iowa will lose $40 million of hard capital invested \nfor almost 90 years between the two companies. Not to even mention how \nmuch salary, retirement plans and charitable contributions they have \nmade to those little Iowa communities.\n  So when the multinational or foreign companies come calling, we have \nno one else to blame but ourselves for letting these family owned \ncompanies committed to the community go away.\n  All of us from rural America are trying to battle what is called out-\nmigration. If we leave the death tax in place in its punitive form in \n2011, it will suck jobs, businesses, and people out of rural America.\n  That is why I care about this death tax debate--real people, in real \nIowa counties that have entire communities that would care. It is \nstrange, in New York City, how many multimillionaires live on any one \nblock in Manhattan?\n  Those so-called multimillionaires seem a little different when you \ncheck out the Iowa corn crop, or you sit together at church or the \ngrandson's baseball game. They are, as the popular book says ``the \nmillionaire next door,'' they are the pillars that help hold up all \nthose 99 counties that I visit every year. I know these are not the \nkind of stories that make the front page of the big city papers, but \nwhen family businesses get sold and shut down or moved out of State or \neven out of the United States, it certainly makes the front page of the \nnewspapers about which I really care.\n  So when you hear about the number of estates affected, keep in mind, \nto some extent, that statistic is only a snapshot. The estate tax \nreturn is filed by the representative of the dead person. Those \nstatistics, so often dwelled on by many of the proponents of the death \ntax, don't capture the full picture. The statistic is only a look at \nthe dead person who owned the business or farm. It doesn't take into \naccount the dead person's family, employees, or neighbors. All of those \nfolks are affected if the death tax burdens that family business or \nfarm.\n  I plan to vote for cloture, and I hope 60 other Senators also vote \nfor cloture on Thursday. It is time we had a real debate on a \nreasonable solution to this problem. Kicking the can of tax uncertainty \nis draining dollars out of these family owned businesses, just as well \nas the estate tax, only the expense of planning for these uncertainties \ntakes money every month and not just all of it within 9 months of \ndeath. Vote yes on cloture. We owe these folks an answer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I have asked my staff to see if they can \nfind some charts--maybe the kind of charts prepared by our friend, \nSenator Conrad.\n  Let's look at this first chart. One of the charts I asked to see if \nthey can find is a chart that deals with what has happened in this \ndecade under current law with respect to the amount of an estate that \nis excluded from the estate tax so we can see what it looks like over \ntime and what the rates look like over time.\n  As I recall, the amount that could be excluded from the estate tax in \n2001 was about $1.35 million. It went up to $2 million, $3 million, and \nthis year it is about $4 million combined, two people in a family, \nhusband and wife, and then I believe in 2009 there is $3.5 million \nexcluded for each spouse, for a total of $7 million for a family in \nwhich there are two people. The amount of the tax, going back to 2001, \nI believe was about 55 percent. Over time it has been decreasing, so \nthat in 2009 the amount of the estate that will be excluded from the \ntax is $7 million, and I believe the rate is 45 percent. The next year, \nin 2010, there is no estate tax, and then in 2011 we go back to where \nit was in 2001, which is again about a little less than $1.5 million, \nand the rate would be 55 percent.\n  People like to have some certainty in their lives so they can do \nplanning for a whole lot of activities. Certainly businesses like to \nhave certainty so they can do planning. That is especially true when \nfolks are trying to develop business plans or estate plans. When we \nlook at a tax that goes from an exclusion of $7 million at a rate of 45 \npercent to the next year having no tax, and the year after that we will \nbe back where we were in 2001, that certainly doesn't provide the kind \nof certainty under which businesses or families like to operate.\n  My hope is that during the course of this debate or this year, we can \ncome up with some certainty. There are folks who would like to see the \nestate tax go away altogether. When I was Governor of Delaware, we \nactually eliminated the inheritance tax. We cut taxes 7 out of 8 years. \nCan you believe that, Mr. President? We reduced taxes 7 out of 8 years. \nWe also balanced the budget 8 years in a row.\n  The concern in getting rid of the estate tax altogether is we didn't \nbalance the budget last year or the year before that, and we are not \ngoing to balance the budget this year or for as far as the eye can see. \nIn fact, the way to come closest to reducing the deficit, as the \nadministration would have us believe, to cut it in half, is to assume \nwe are not going to spend any more money in Iraq the next year and the \nyear after and we are not going to spend any more money in Afghanistan \nor do anything to fix the alternative minimum tax, which is likely to \ncost us some money--in fact, a whole lot of money. If we ignore all \nthose items, we can pretend the deficit will be cut in half, but I \ndon't think we can in good faith ignore them.\n  Let me see what else we have in charts that might be worth looking \nat. This chart gives us some idea of the percentage of the estates that \nare going to be taxed in 2009. Again, this is if we consider a $7 \nmillion exclusion with a rate of about 45 percent. It says that in \n2009, only 0.2 percent of estates will be subject to that tax. If we \nexclude everything up to $7 million, that doesn't leave very many \nestates. That is 2 estates out of 1,000 which would have to pay \nanything at all. And even in 2009, the rate would be down from 55 to 45 \npercent. This chart shows a pie. That is a pretty small sliver out of \nthat pie. Actually, it would probably be a lot slimmer than that if we \nreally wanted to show it in proportion.\n  Let's take a look at one more. This chart shows how many estates were \nbeing taxed in 2000--roughly 50,000. When we go up to the $7 million \nexclusion for a husband and wife, the number of taxable estates is down \nto about 7,000.\n  I wish we had another chart that actually showed what the value of \nthe estate tax is in revenues to the Treasury. I don't know if we have \na chart showing that information. If we can take a look, that would be \ngood.\n  Some folks like to call the estate tax the death tax. That is \nactually pretty clever. But I always think of it as the estate tax.\n  I think of something I call the birth tax. It is a tax that every \nchild born in the country this year inherits upon their birth because \nit is the amount of our debt that accrues to them and, frankly, to the \nrest of us. The amount of money we owe as individuals as a personal \nobligation--again, take the total amount of our debt divided by the \ntotal number of people, and we are talking about tens of thousands of \ndollars. In fact, if we look not just at the money that is accumulated \ndebt but if we look at that more on an accrual\n\n[[Page S5550]]\n\nbasis, we are looking at a birth tax that is not $20,000 or $30,000 per \nperson but maybe 10 times that amount of money.\n  This is the cost of the estate tax repeal. We generally only look \nahead 5 years. We have been raising the amount of estates that are \nexcluded and lowering the tax rate for the last couple of years--\nactually, the last 5 years--and the amount of money lost to the \nTreasury is actually pretty small.\n\n  Starting right about 2010, it jumps rather considerably, and it looks \nlike it is $60 billion a year starting in 2012, and it just climbs to \n2021 and almost $100 billion a year. This wouldn't concern me if we had \na balanced budget. This wouldn't concern me if we had a reasonable \nprospect for a balanced budget. This concerns me because we don't have \na balanced budget and we don't have any prospect for a balanced budget \ngoing forward. For us to go willy-nilly into eliminating the estate tax \naltogether is just imprudent--woefully imprudent.\n  Should we do nothing? Should we just let the clock continue to tick, \nso we get to 2009 with a rate of 45 percent and $7 million excluded \nfrom the estate tax, and then in 2010 it all goes away, no estate tax, \nand then in 2011 it comes back to where it was 10 years earlier? Does \nthat make sense? I don't think that makes much sense, either. Rather \nthan simply criticize those who make the estate go away, we ought to \nfind a middle ground, a third way, and the third way says: What can we \ndo that is fair and reasonable to farm businesses, families, and so \nforth, and at the same time will not make the budget deficit look like \nthis or this much worse going forward?\n  The approach I like is we go back to where we will be in 2009 if we \ndon't change the law. There are several of us who are going to \nintroduce legislation to do this. I am not sure who will be in the \nlead. I will be one of the cosponsors. It says: Let's think about \nproviding continuity and certainty. Let's acknowledge the fact that \nmoneys should be excluded from the estate tax. And what is a reasonable \nlevel? Right now, we are at $4 million for a family, and in 2009 it \nwill be at $7 million. We are going to suggest we exclude not just in \n2009 but in 2010 and 2011 at least $7 million.\n  I believe we should index that amount going forward, just stay at $7 \nmillion for the next 10, 20, 30 years, but it will go up every year in \nconjunction with some deflator, the CPI or something such as that, and \nsay the rate that is going to be effective in 2009 on the money in \nexcess of the $7 million that can be excluded is 45 percent and lock it \nin at 45 percent for a while. So not only in 2009 will the amount \nexcluded be $7 million, but in 2010 we will exclude $7 million, maybe \nwith a CPI adjustment, and in 2011, $7 million, again adjusting \naccording to inflation, but the rate would stay the same at 45 percent.\n  I wish I had a chart that actually shows how that would affect this \naccumulation of debt, our deficit. It would reduce by about 70 percent \nthe amount of red ink. It wouldn't eliminate it entirely, but we \nwouldn't be looking at numbers of close to $100 billion a year in 2021. \nWe might be looking at $30 billion. We wouldn't be looking at $50 \nbillion a year in lost revenues to the Treasury; we would be looking at \nsomething more like $15 billion.\n  If people don't think we should have the estate tax where it was in \n2001, that is not going to make them too happy because it is still a \nfair amount of loss to the Treasury, but it is not this huge loss to \nthe Treasury. As long as we are running these huge deficits with little \nprospects of things getting better anytime soon, we need to find a \nmiddle ground, something more fiscally responsible and something \nresponsive to what has been expressed to me by our farm families and \nsmall businesspeople.\n  We are going to have a chance to vote on a cloture motion on the \nmotion to proceed tomorrow. I understand those who want to eliminate \nthe estate tax entirely would like to prevail tomorrow and they would \nlike to go forward. I don't know if the cloture motion on the motion to \nproceed tomorrow is going to pass. If it doesn't pass, rather than \nthrowing up our arms and saying that is it for another year or two, I \nhope we will actually take a closer look at what some of us are going \nto be introducing either today or tomorrow which says that $7 million \nis a reasonable amount of money to exclude from the estate tax, which \nis lower than the current rate on estates, 45 percent for everything \nabove $7 million is not an unreasonable level, and see if we can't work \ntoward that goal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am sure it is not going to be a \nsurprise to anyone here that I am opposed to the repeal of the \ninheritance tax. Now, I don't believe people ought to be taxed beyond \nwhat is normal by increasing taxes here or there, but I do have a \nproblem with figuring out ways to reduce taxes, inheritance taxes, on \nthe wealthiest among us. We are talking about wealth that staggers the \nimagination, that is so vast that the average American can't even \ncomprehend it. We are talking now about making it easier for the \nwealthiest among us to pass along the fortunes that some of them worked \nhard for, a lot of them inherited, and for the next generation who is \nwaiting for dad or mom to pass away so they can make sure they can keep \nup with the yachts and the airplanes and the things of that nature. I \ndon't say that everybody who is wealthy is spoiled or has bad values, \nbut I think we have to look very carefully at what we are doing in the \ncircumstances in which this country is living.\n  To give an example, this is like saying, if you are in debt, deeply \nin debt, the best way to solve your problems is to go out and borrow \nmore money to pay off the old debt. It sounds foolish, doesn't it? But \nthat is what we are about to do if we chip away at the taxes that are \nnow--the revenue that is now collected through inheritance taxes.\n  At first glance, it sounds like a good idea to get rid of the \ninheritance tax. When you look below the surface, you learn that \nrepealing it is a bad deal for the vast majority of Americans.\n  There is a lot of misinformation being passed around about who pays \nthis tax. We have even given it a name that makes it so repulsive that \nas soon as you hear it, you say: Wow, what is this, a death tax? Do you \nmean you have to pay a tax for dying?\n  No. You have to pay a tax for making so much money that life can \nforever be comfortable. Not a bad thought, but at what cost? That is \nthe thing that we are concerned about.\n  Here is the truth: One-half of 1 percent of the estates this year \nwill be subject to tax. I don't know how many people who make $45,000 a \nyear can understand what happens with one-half of 1 percent of the \nestates in this country of ours. What it says is that 99.5 percent of \nthe estates left are not subject to any tax. To be even considered for \nthis tax, an estate must be worth at least $2 million.\n  For any of you who hear my voice or look at the figures you see in \nthe paper, remember, when someone says to you: You don't want that \ndeath tax out there, do you? It doesn't affect you unless you are worth \nat least $2 million. Then, on top of that, there are all kinds of tax \nshelters and exemptions. So very few people pay the tax. As a matter of \nfact, the average rate that estates pay is somewhere in the high teens, \nand rarely ever approaches the 55 percent marginal rate, which is the \nhighest of them all. So I think some of my colleagues have to \nunderstand the history of the inheritance tax.\n  I was very lucky in my lifetime. My father died very young and left \nmy mother a widow when she was 37 years old, and I was already in the \nArmy. I had enlisted in the Army just over--well, over 62 years ago. My \nmother was this young, struggling widow, deep in debt because my \nfather, who was a very healthy man, got sick on the job, and it took a \nyear to rob him of his strength and his energy, so that there was \nnothing left except grief and debts my mother had to pay.\n  I was the beneficiary, as a result of my military service, to get \nsomething called the GI Bill. The GI Bill said to those who serve: We \nare going to help you make up for some of the years that we took for \nyou to protect our country and protect our ideals, and we are going to \nprovide funds for you to improve your lot, to get an education, to make \nup for the time lost, for building a career. The GI Bill sent me to \ncollege. I never would have been able to\n\n[[Page S5551]]\n\ngo. It would never have been available to me.\n  When I graduated high school, I had a job loading trucks. That is \nwhat my life was like. But good fortune struck me, and the \nopportunities that America gives were mine in abundance.\n  I went to Columbia University. I went to the business school there. I \nsit on that school's board now. I look back in amazement at what good \nfortune that I had. I created a company with two other fellows named \nADP, Automatic Data Processing. Automatic Data Processing is a company \nthat today employs 44,000 people in 26 countries in which we serve. \nThree guys from factory-working fathers, two of them are brothers, and \nmy father, all worked in the same kinds of factories in Patterson, NJ. \nSo life was good.\n  We presented a new idea in America, those years when we started. It \nwas called outsourcing. It was the opportunity for companies to render \nspecialized services so that the companies who hired us could devote \nthemselves to making their product better and selling it cheaper and \nbeing more efficient totally. So as a consequence of that--why is this \nstory relevant? It is because as a consequence of creating a company--\nmy old company before I came to the Senate over 20 years ago--that \ncompany had the longest growth record of any company in America at over \n10 percent, each and every year, growth and income. Every year for 42 \nyears in a row we had the longest growth record in America, and I take \nmodest pride in knowing I was part of that development.\n  As a consequence, of course, I made some money, a lot of money by \nmost standards, and I brought my four kids up to understand that they \nwere also lucky, and not just because their father was successful, and \neach one of them has worked very hard to make their own lives.\n  I tell that story because what I want to be understood is that I \nwould be a beneficiary, or my kids would be beneficiaries, of a no-tax \nestate if it was left to them. But what would that do for my children \nas a result? It wouldn't do anything for them, in my view, in the long \nrun. Give them more money? No. I would rather give them a safe country. \nI would rather give them a chance to fight against childhood diseases. \nMy oldest grandchild has asthma, and my daughter, when she takes them \nout to play sports anyplace, the first place she looks for is an \nemergency clinic to make sure if he has an attack, they can get there \nin a hurry.\n  That is the most important thing in my life, to make sure that my \nchildren are safe and that we know that if, heaven forbid, they are the \none-third of the children in America who are going to get diabetes in \ntheir juvenile years, that we will be able to fight against it. I meet \nwith those families. I talk to them. I talk to the children, and I ask \nthem about the terrible inconvenience that it is to deal with sticking \ntheir fingers day and night and making sure they feel good throughout \ntheir schoolday.\n\n  So when I think of what legacy I might give my children, it is not \nmore money in the bank. It is a safer country, it is air that they can \nbreathe, it is water that they can drink, it is assistance, if they \nneed it, to get through school, the same thing that every grandparent \nwants for their grandchildren.\n  Now, to say, OK, Frank, you have been lucky. You did well. You \nprovided a lot of people with very good jobs. But now what we are going \nto do is reward you on top of the rewards you have already gotten by \ngiving you more money, by making sure that your kids can live \ncomfortably.\n  I have a list of people who are lobbying against the estate tax. When \nyou see the size of some of these estates, it blows your mind, to use a \ncommon expression. I want to take a look at the chart that shows what \nhappens if we cut estate taxes for the wealthiest.\n  This is interesting. There is a company called Halliburton, a company \nthat used to be run by the Vice President of the United States, and who \nstill gets an income from them, almost as large as his income from the \nU.S. Government. This is the Vice President of the United States who \ngets an income from a private company that does all kinds of defense \nbusiness that has been charged with overcharging us for work they did \nin Iraq, that got a no-bid contract that ran over $2 billion. The \nCheney family--and listen, we respect success, but Vice President \nCheney still has options, tens of thousands of options that are not yet \nexercised in Halliburton, whose value depends on their ability to do \nbetter.\n  That is the price of the stock. So if we want to reward Vice \nPresident Cheney and Halliburton for their questionable work and their \nquestionable morality when they still do business with Iraq through \nsham corporations, Iran who gives money to terrorists, who go to Iraq \nto kill our kids--Halliburton, that is the company. Vice President \nCheney was the CEO of the company. I am not suggesting there is a \nconnection anymore, but I will tell you this: If you want to go to ADP \nand sell them something, you tell them you know Frank Lautenberg--I was \nthe chairman and CEO of the company--it does make it a notch easier to \nget some business. We are going to give them a $12 million tax cut--\n$12.6 million. That is what happens if we repeal the estate tax, as is \nsuggested.\n  A famous name here, it is not the Hilton Hotel, but it is Paris \nHilton, and she will get $14 million in tax cuts if we go ahead and \neliminate the estate tax as suggested. The chairman of Exxon made a lot \nof money. He made $145,000 a day--$145,000 each and every day--and the \naverage wage in this country is $45,000 a year, the average wage. The \nnumber of people who make $145,000 a year is very small. Senators in \nthe United States Senate make a little more than $145,000. In fact, \nthey make $165,000. But here, Mr. Raymond made $145,000 a day. So we \nare going to be nice to him because he made so little: $145,000 a day. \nWe want to give him a $164 million tax cut, give his heirs $164 \nmillion. It is obscene, Mr. President. That is what it is.\n  It is really funny. When you ask for the origins--when did the \ninheritance tax come into play--people forget that it was originally \npushed by President Roosevelt. President Roosevelt, people say? Yes, \nbut not Franklin Roosevelt. It was developed by a Republican, Teddy \nRoosevelt. He believed that an inheritance tax should not be aimed at \nthe average citizen or even citizens of above average wealth. President \nTheodore Roosevelt said the inheritance tax should ``be aimed merely at \nthe inheritance or transmission in their entirety of those fortunes \nswollen beyond all healthy limits.'' This is what the current estate \ntax does. It affects only the hereditary elite, those who inherit \nestates of more than $2 million. I repeat: 99.5 percent of American \nfamilies will not be affected by the estate tax. They won't have to pay \na penny out of their legacy.\n  So when I look at where we stand now, deep in debt because in America \nwe increased the debt limit so we could splurge some more and spend and \nborrow up to $9 trillion--not earn, borrow to get us up to $9 trillion, \nand it is rumored that soon we will be looking at the possibility of \nraising the debt limit again.\n  And repealing the inheritance tax will only further balloon our \nNation's debt. So in order to increase the inheritance of the richest \npeople in the country, we are going to pass more debt to everyone \nelse's children and grandchildren.\n  I would like someone to explain why that is a good idea.\n  In 2009, the estate tax exemption will be $3.5 million--but that is \nnot good enough for most Senate Republicans.\n  Here's what that means in real life:\n  You could have a $1.9 million mansion, a 44-foot motor yacht, a \nbeautiful summer beach house, his and hers Porsches, and a $600,000 \ninvestment portfolio--and still--still--you would not pay a penny of \nestate tax.\n  The people who need a break are not the wealthiest one-half of 1 \npercent. It's everyday people who deserve a break. They deserve a break \nfrom high gas prices, rising college tuition and health care costs.\n  But instead of trying to help everyday people, the Republicans in the \nSenate are clamoring to help the richest families in America.\n  Forget gas prices--Congress needs to make sure Paris Hilton gets a \nfew more million dollars in inheritance. We have to make sure that the \nheirs to the former CEO of ExxonMobil don't miss out.\n  Some of the wealthiest Americans in the country have actually spoken \nout against this madness.\n\n[[Page S5552]]\n\n  Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said that the estate tax has \nplayed a ``critical role'' in promoting American economic growth by \ncreating a society in which success is based on merit rather than \ninheritance.\n  Buffett said that repealing the estate tax ``would be a terrible \nmistake'' and would be the equivalent of ``choosing the 2020 Olympic \nteam by picking the eldest sons of the gold-medal winners in the 2000 \nOlympics.''\n  Mr. President, if we repeal this inheritance tax, what would be the \neffect on everyday people and the Federal budget?\n  For starters, it would cost our Nation $73 billion every year by the \nmiddle of the next decade.\n  What could we do with that much money?\n  We could provide health insurance for every uninsured child in \nAmerica, and have enough left over to give them full college \nscholarships.\n  We could give every family in America a $500 tax cut.\n  We could eliminate 75 percent of the Social Security shortfall.\n  We could provide clean food and water to the 800 million people in \nthe world who lack it.\n  We could provide the funds necessary to pay for the war in Iraq for \nthe next 10 years.\n  So that is our choice. We can help everyday people, or we can give a \nbig gift to the richest people in America.\n  I have heard my colleagues on the other side say they hear stories \nevery week about farmers or small business people having to sell their \nbusinesses to pay the estate tax. But they have not been able to cite a \nsingle example of this actually happening.\n  In fact, in 2001, the American Farm Bureau could not find even one \nfamily farm that had to be sold to pay the estate tax.\n  The estate tax mostly does not hit small business people and family \nfarms. The vast majority of assets affected by the estate tax, more \nthan 70 percent, were in liquid assets like stocks, bonds, and cash.\n  In an attempt to do away with this ``small business'' and ``family \nfarm'' fiction once and for all, in 2002, Democrats proposed to \ncompletely and permanently exempt all family farms and all family-owned \nbusinesses from the estate tax. But those on the other side of the \naisle voted against it. It was an illustration that they are interested \nin protecting the wealthy, pure and simple.\n  Mr. President, this week has really showcased how backwards the \npriorities of this Senate are. Instead of tackling gas prices or \ndealing with the war in Iraq, we tried to pass a constitutional \namendment on gay marriage.\n  Now, instead of helping families afford college or get better access \nto health care, we are looking to help the richest families in the \ncountry get richer.\n  This is indeed the twilight zone Senate. In my view, it is time to \ncancel this show.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the audacity of the Bush administration \nand their congressional allies truly knows no limit. In spite of all of \nthe urgent problems facing our Nation--from the ongoing war in Iraq, to \nthe devastating hurricane damage along the gulf coast that has not yet \nbeen repaired, to the outrageously high gasoline prices that are \nsqueezing American families--the top Republican priority is eliminating \nthe estate tax for the richest families in the country. President \nBush's policies have already added nearly $3 trillion to the national \ndebt in the last 5 years. Now, they are proposing more of the same, \nmore tax breaks benefiting only the wealthiest among us.\n  The first 10 years of estate tax repeal would cost $800 billion in \nlost revenue, nearly a trillion dollars when the cost of interest on \nthe higher national debt that would result is included. It is \nunaffordable. It is the ultimate example of misplaced priorities. \nRepealing the estate tax would cost as much each year as the Federal \nGovernment spends on homeland security, and it would cost more than we \nspend on education. And, it would be grossly unfair.\n  Today, under current law, only 5 estates in 1,000 are subject to the \nestate tax. By 2009, only 3 estates in 1,000 will be subject to the \nestate tax. Only estates over $3.5 million will be taxed. Thus, \nrepealing the estate tax would only benefit a few thousand heirs of the \nrichest men and women in the country. One columnist recently called it \nthe ``Paris Hilton Tax Break'' and that description accurately \nidentifies who would benefit from such an enormous tax giveaway.\n  The notion of an estate tax is nothing new or radical. We have had an \nestate tax for over 100 years. During much of that period, it covered a \nfar greater percentage of estates than we are taxing today. One of the \nstrongest advocates of the estate tax was Teddy Roosevelt, who believed \nit was essential to a fair and democratic society. Those who have \nbenefited most from the opportunities America offers have a special \nobligation to contribute something back to their country.\n  Advocates of repeal always claim that the estate tax forces the sale \nof large numbers of farms and small businesses each year. That claim is \ngreatly exaggerated. CBO analyzed this issue. It concluded that if the \n2009 exemption level of $3.5 billion had been in place in 2000, only 94 \nsmall businesses and 65 farms in the entire country would have owed any \nestate tax. Of those, most had sufficient liquid assets to cover the \nestate tax owed without touching the business or farm. The few that did \nnot, have the option of paying the tax in installments over 14 years.\n  These small businesses and farms are being used as a sympathetic \nTrojan horse to conceal those who would really benefit from estate tax \nrepeal. The real beneficiaries of repeal would be the heirs of the \nrichest men and women in America.\n  If we eliminate the estate tax on the largest concentrations of \nwealth in our society, we will be permitting the very few who inherit \nhuge amounts of money to receive their millions tax free while working \nAmericans have to pay substantial taxes on their wages. It would be \nterribly unfair to tax work while giving inherited wealth a free ride.\n  The estate tax is the most progressive of all Federal taxes. At a \ntime when the income gap between the wealth few and the middle class \nhas grown disturbingly wide--wider than it has been in decades, why \nwould we want to transfer more of the tax burden from the rich onto the \nshoulders of middle class families. Make no mistake, the trillion \ndollars that would be lost should the estate tax be repealed will have \nto be made up by increasing other federal taxes, taxes paid mostly by \nthe middle class. That is the injustice of repealing the estate tax.\n  What we should do is make permanent the estate tax that will be in \nplace in 2009--covering estates over $3.5 million--$7 million per \ncouple--with a top tax rate of 45 percent. Only three-tenths of 1 \npercent of estates would owe any tax under that proposal. While the \nmaximum rate of 45 percent may sound high, that figure is very \nmisleading. Analyses show that the effective tax rate on these \nestates--the rate after the $3.5 million exemption and other available \ndeductions are taken into consideration--would be, on average, only 17 \npercent.\n  I believe all the revenue from preserving the estate tax at the \n2009--level should be statutorily dedicated to the Social Security \ntrust fund. Saving Social Security for the many who depend on it is far \nmore important than repealing the estate tax for the wealthiest few.\n  No Government program reflects the values of the American people \nbetter than Social Security. We are a community that takes care of our \nmost vulnerable members: the elderly, the disabled, and children whose \nparents have died prematurely. Two out of every three retirees receive \nover one-half of their income from Social Security. Without it, many of \nthem would be living in poverty. Social Security does much more than \nprovide retirement income for seniors. It also provides lifetime \ndisability insurance protecting those who become seriously injured or \nill. When a worker becomes disabled before reaching retirement age, \nSocial Security is there to help him and his family. And when a worker \ndies leaving minor children, Social Security provides financial support \nfor those children until they reach adulthood.\n  The revenue from the estate tax would reduce the Social Security \nshortfall by more than 25 percent, according to the Social Security \nAdministration's chief actuary. It would add years of solvency to the \nprogram. That\n\n[[Page S5553]]\n\nwould set the right priority for America.\n  The priorities of this Republican Congress have been wrong for our \ncountry. If we are serious about reducing the deficit and strengthening \nthe economy, we must stop lavishing tax breaks on the rich, and start \ninvesting in the health and well-being of all families. These families \nare being squeezed unmercifully between stagnant wages and ever-\nincreasing costs for the basic necessities of life. The cost of health \ninsurance is up 56 percent in the last 5 years. Gasoline is up 75 \npercent. College tuition is up 46 percent. Housing is up 57 percent. \nThe list goes on and on, up and up--and paychecks are buying less each \nyear.\n  The dollars that Republicans now want to spend on the ultimate tax \nbreak for the rich--allowing the heirs of multimillionaires to inherit \ntheir enormous wealth tax free--are dollars that should be used to help \nall Americans. The American people deserve better; and in November they \nwill insist on a new Congress that truly shares their values and cares \nabout their needs.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nNative Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2006. Unfortunately, \nthis bill has been mischaracterized and therefore misunderstood by \nmany.\n  Sponsored by Senator Daniel K. Akaka and Senator Daniel K. Inouye, \nthe bill brings into focus the unique political and legal relationship \nthat the indigenous peoples of Hawaii, Native Hawaiians, have with the \nUnited States. The United States has treated Native Hawaiians in a \nmanner similar to that of American Indians and Alaska Natives since \nHawaii became a territory in 1898. All that this legislation does--with \nthe substitute amendment that addresses some concerns raised by the \nDepartments of Justice and Interior--is extend the Federal policy of \nself-governance and self-determination to Native Hawaiians, thereby \nproviding parity in Federal policies toward American Indians, Alaska \nNatives, and Native Hawaiians.\n  More than 160 statutes have been passed by Congress recognizing the \npolitical and legal relationship that Native Hawaiians have with the \nUnited States. These statutes demonstrate how Congress has repeatedly \nacknowledged the legal and political relationship between Native \nHawaiians and the United States. Just as it has done with the other \nindigenous people of this country, the Native Americans and Alaskan \nNatives, Congress has established Federal programs to address the \nhealth, education, and housing needs of Native Hawaiians. As an \nindigenous people that exercised sovereignty over lands now comprising \nthe State of Hawaii, Native Hawaiians are seeking parity with other \nfederally recognized indigenous peoples. S. 147 is the vehicle for \nwhich this can be achieved.\n  Beginning with the debates of the Continental Congress and continuing \nin the records of discussion and correspondence amongst the framers of \nthe Constitution, it was recognized that the aboriginal, indigenous \npeople who occupied the lands now comprising the United States had a \nstatus as sovereigns that existed prior to the formation of the United \nStates. Based upon the recognition of that preexisting sovereignty, the \nU.S. Constitution--article I, section 8, clause 3--vests the Congress \nwith authority to regulate commerce with the three classes of sovereign \ngovernments identified there--foreign nations, the several States, and \nIndian tribes.\n  In numerous rulings over the ensuing 215 years, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt has repeatedly held that legislation enacted to address the \nconditions of the native people of the United States is constitutional \nand does not constitute discrimination on the basis of race or \nethnicity because the sovereign status of the Indian tribes is the \nbasis for the government-to-government relationship the tribes have \nwith the United States.\n  The Court has thus consistently drawn a distinction between \nlegislation that addresses the conditions of the native people of the \nUnited States on the grounds that the United States has a political and \nlegal relationship with the Indian tribes--a relationship that is not \npredicated on race or ethnicity but rather on sovereignty--and \nlegislation that addresses the conditions of specific groups whose \nmembers are defined only by reference to their race or ethnicity--\nAfrican Americans, Hispanic Americans, etc.\n  The status that the Constitution recognizes in Indian tribes was \nlater extended to Alaska Natives in their capacity as aboriginal, \nindigenous people of the United States, and it is on the same basis \nthat the Congress has enacted legislation for the aboriginal, \nindigenous people of Hawaii.\n  Many opponents of the bill are attacking and classifying \nreconciliation efforts between the United States and the Native \nHawaiians as race-based. However, anyone who has a clear understanding \nof Hawaii's history cannot deny that Native Hawaiians are Hawaii's \nindigenous peoples, nor can they deny that Native Hawaiians have a \nlegal and political relationship with the United States based on their \nstatus as Hawaii's indigenous peoples. It is offensive that laws \nintended to seek justice and equality for African Americans are now \nbeing used to oppress native peoples.\n  We must be fair and thorough while deliberating the merits of this \nlegislation. It is unfair to pick and choose what aspects of the \nConstitution and related statutes do and do not apply. This is an \nopportunity that each Member of this Chamber has to demonstrate their \ncommitment to recognizing and respecting the aboriginal, indigenous \npeople that had a status as sovereigns that existed prior to the \nformation of the United States. The time to recognize Native Hawaiians \nand their contributions to our country is now. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport efforts of the Senators from Hawaii to secure Federal \nrecognition for Native Hawaiians.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nthe legislation before us today, H.R. 8, which would make the repeal of \nthe estate tax permanent starting in 2010. Without so much as a \nhearing, debate, or markup in the Finance Committee, the majority is \nbringing the largest tax bill that will be before us this Congress with \nthe clear intent of not allowing the minority any reasonable \nopportunity to amend it. The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated \nthat repeal of the estate tax will require roughly $370 billion in debt \nfinancing through 2016, although a more accurate cost of 10 years of \nenactment is closer to $1 trillion when interest on the debt is \ncalculated into the equation. At a time when interest rates are being \nraised steadily to address inflationary fears, it is hardly the time \nfor our Government to be adding to our national debt in this magnitude \nfor tax relief that only benefits the wealthiest in our country.\n  In 2001, in my State of New Mexico, there were only 200 people dying \nwith any estate tax liability. This left roughly 98 percent of New \nMexican estates entirely untaxed. If the exemption had been $2.5 \nmillion, as will occur in 2009 under current law, 99.7 percent of \npeople dying in New Mexico would have owed no estate taxes. At a time \nwhen gas is over $3 a gallon and many businesses are telling me that \nthey can no longer afford to offer health insurance to their workers, I \ncannot in good conscience support repealing the estate tax--an act that \nprovides a benefit to only about .3 percent of New Mexicans.\n  The effort to permanently repeal the estate tax is a continuation by \nthe majority of giving tax breaks to a small minority of Americans--\nthose who need it least. Just a couple of weeks ago, the President \nsigned the reconciliation tax bill into law which added 2 additional \nyears of tax relief for those receiving dividends and capital gains. \nSlowly but surely, the majority is creating a society where those who \nwork for a living will be paying taxes while those who are fortunate \nenough to have investments or inherited wealth will either avoid \ntaxation or be paying at a significantly lower rate. The result will be \na United States that has slid back to economic disparity not seen since \nthe Gilded Age where extreme wealth accumulated in the pockets of our \nNation's wealthiest while the average working family was left behind. \nAt a time when gas prices are climbing, the cost of electricity is \ngrowing, and health care costs are exploding, it is simply unacceptable \nthat this Congress is devoting time and our children's resources to \nproviding another tax break to the wealthiest among us. Instead this \nCongress should be looking at ways to reduce the tax\n\n[[Page S5554]]\n\nburden on folks who only have earned income--and generally not enough \nof it.\n  I would remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that the \nimpact of deficit spending is immense and one that will be borne not \nonly by us in the coming years but by future generations who have no \nsay in our current financial irresponsibility. Since this \nadministration took over and Congress has been controlled solely by one \nparty, we have seen our Nation's economic security drop precipitously. \nIn order to pay for unaffordable tax cuts, we have become a beggar \nnation, forced to go to foreign countries with our hat in hand asking \nthem to buy our debt. Many of these countries, such as China and Japan, \nare the very same countries that are becoming more and more competitive \nwith our Nation for high-tech and higher salaried jobs--a fact that is \nnot unrelated. As interest rates continue to rise to combat \ninflationary pressures, it is costing this Government more and more to \nsell our debt to our foreign competitors. At the same time, we are \nfacing demand pressures to offer a higher rate of return to attract \nthese wary investors, as they gradually accumulate more of our debt \nthan most economic models would indicate is prudent. The only prudent \ncourse of action would be to tighten our belts and balance our budget \nthereby returning control of our economic prosperity to us instead of \nleaving it in the hands of our foreign competitors. But instead of \ncoming up with rational tax policy that rewards the majority of \nAmericans who work for a living, we are foisting on these families the \ndelusion that estate tax relief benefits them and handing out further \ntax cuts to those who have seen their wealth grow at historic rates in \nthe past several years.\n  Mr. President, we owe it to our children and grandchildren to provide \nthem with the opportunities we inherited from our parents. The real \n``death tax'' is the one we are leaving for our children to pay when we \nare gone. With the passage of the Deficit Reduction Act in 1993, we \nwere able to correct years of irresponsible tax policy and head our \nNation back in the right direction. By maintaining fiscal discipline, \nwe were able to have our first surplus in decades. It is shameful that \nwe are considering legislation today that, in many senses, is the final \nnail in the coffin of fiscal responsibility by providing additional tax \ncuts to the richest in our Nation to the detriment of hard-working \nAmerican families. This is not the act of a Government that is supposed \nto represent all of the people in our Nation--a nation that was founded \non the belief that the opportunity for prosperity is to be shared by \neveryone. This legislation is another step toward creating an America \nthat I was not elected to represent by my fellow New Mexicans--the vast \nmajority of whom earn their living by going to work every day. I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in opposing this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/07/senate-section/article/S5554-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5554-S5591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT OF 2005--MOTION TO \n                                PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 3 p.m. \nhaving arrived, the Senate will proceed to consideration of the motion \nto proceed to S. 147, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to S. 147, a bill to express the policy \n     of the United States regarding the United States relationship \n     with Native Hawaiians and to provide a process for the \n     recognition by the United States of the Native Hawaiian \n     governing entity.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time from 3 p.m. \nuntil 6 p.m. shall be divided for debate as follows: 3 to 3:30, \nmajority control; 3:30 to 4, minority control, alternating between the \ntwo sides every 30 minutes until 6 p.m.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, one of the parliamentary mysteries of \nthe Senate is that we are now about to move, as was reported, to the \nNative Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act. Some might wonder why. I \nwas presiding, as the Senator from Minnesota is now, earlier in the \nweek. I heard an eloquent speech by a Senator from the other side of \nthe aisle, the Senator from Vermont, who said we ought to ``focus on \nsolutions to the high [gasoline] prices, something that hurts people in \nyour state and mine, the rising cost of health care . . . the ongoing \nsituation in Iraq. . . . We're not going to talk about any of those \nthings,'' said the Senator from Vermont, from the other side of the \naisle.\n  Yet as a result of efforts there, on that side of the aisle, we are \nnow moving ahead to the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, \nS. 147.\n  The legislation may seem insignificant, but I am here today to say \nthat, in this seemingly insignificant piece of legislation, is an \nassault on one of the most important values in our country. It is a \nvalue so important that it is carved in stone above the Chair of the \nPresiding Officer. It is our original national motto: E Pluribus Unum, \none from many. This bill is an assault on that principle because it \nwould, for the first time in our country's history, so far as my \nresearch shows, create a new, separate, sovereign government within our \ncountry, based on race, putting us on the path of becoming more of a \nUnited Nations than a United States of America. It will set a precedent \nfor the breakup of our country along racial lines, and it ought to be \nsoundly defeated.\n  No one has to take my word for this. The U.S. Commission on Civil \nRights, a body established to protect the rights of minorities and the \nunderprivileged, has publicly opposed this legislation. Here is what \nthe Commission on Civil Rights said:\n\n       The Commission recommends against passage of the Native \n     Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005 as reported \n     out of committee on May 16, 2005, or any other legislation \n     that would discriminate on the basis of race or national \n     origin and further subdivide the American people into \n     discrete subgroups, accorded varying degrees of privilege.\n\n  So this bill undermines our unity. It would undermine our history of \nbeing a Nation based not upon race but upon common values of liberty, \nequal opportunity, and democracy.\n  We have had many great accomplishments in our country. Our diversity \nis a magnificent accomplishment. But the greater accomplishment, \ngreater even than our diversity, is our ability to unite all of that \ndiversity into one Nation. We should be going in that direction and not \nin the opposite direction.\n  Our Constitution guarantees equal opportunity without regard to race. \nThis legislation does the opposite.\n  Those who favor this bill like to describe a bill that is not the \nbill I have read. Those who favor the bill say it is not about \nsovereignty, it is not about land and money, it is not about race, it \nis what we did once in Alaska and that the Native Hawaiians would be \njust another Indian tribe. It is a nice bill, they say. It is sponsored \nby the two Senators from the State of Hawaii, whom we all greatly \nrespect and admire, so, they say, let's just pass it.\n  Let me address each of those claims one by one--sovereignty, to begin \nwith. Those who favor the bill say this is not about sovereignty. After \nall, they argue, the new government that would be set up would be \nsubject to the approval of those who are ``Native Hawaiians,'' and it \nwould have to be approved by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior. But \nthe bill expressly states in section 4(b) that its purpose is to \nestablish a ``political and legal relationship between the United \nStates and the Native Hawaiian governing entity for the purposes of \ncontinuing a government-to-government relationship.''\n  A government-to-government relationship--such as a government \nrelationship between the United States and France or England or Germany \nor any other country. That sounds like a sovereign government to me.\n  That's not the end of it. In an interview on National Public Radio on \nAugust 16 last year, the Senator from Hawaii, who is the sponsor of \nthis bill, was asked if this could lead to secession of the State of \nHawaii from the United States. The NPR reporter stated, ``But [Senator \nAkaka] says this sovereignty could even go further, perhaps even \nleading to independence.'' And the Senator from Hawaii responded, \n``That could be. As far as what is going to happen at the other end, \nI'm leaving it up to my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren.''\n\n[[Page S5555]]\n\n  The office of Hawaiian Affairs, an office of the Government of the \nState of Hawaii at one time said on its Web site that under this bill:\n\n       The Native Hawaiian people may exercise their right to \n     self-determination by selecting another form of government, \n     including free association or total independence.\n\n  Total independence, Mr. President. This bill clearly allows for the \nestablishment of a new, sovereign government within the United States \nof America. I have not found another example of that in our history.\n  No. 2, those who favor the bill say this is not about race. But the \nbill itself says something else. It says that anyone ``who is a direct \nlineal descendant of the aboriginal, indigenous native people'' of \nHawaii is eligible to participate in creating this new sovereign \ngovernment. By this definition, anyone who may have had a seventh-\ngeneration Native ancestor, making him 1/256 Native Hawaiian, can \nqualify. They do not need to have been part of a Native Hawaiian \ncommunity at any point during their lifetime. They don't even need to \nhave lived in Hawaii. In fact, of the 400,000 Americans of Native \nHawaiian descent in the United States, approximately 160,000 don't even \nlive in Hawaii. They live all over the United States of America. But \nthey all would be eligible to be part of this new sovereign government \nunder the bill.\n\n  So eligibility to participate in this new government is not based on \nwhere you live. It is not based on being part of a specific community. \nIt is based on your ancestry. That is why the U.S. Commission on Civil \nRights has specifically said the bill ``would discriminate on the basis \nof race or national origin.''\n  No. 3, land and money. Those who favor the bill say it is not about \nland and money, but the bill says something else. My staff counted 35 \nreferences to ``land'' or ``lands'' in the text of the bill, and in \nsection 8 of the bill it specifically delegates to this new race-based \ngovernment the authority to negotiate for:\n\n       (A) the transfer of lands, natural resources, and other \n     assets, and the protection of existing rights related to such \n     lands or resources;\n       (B) the exercise of governmental authority over any \n     transferred lands, natural resources, and any other assets, \n     including land use.\n\n  So the bill says this is about land and ``other assets.'' It is not \nsurprising. According to an Associated Press article from April 14 of \nlast year on this bill, ``there is a general belief the Department of \nHawaiian Home Lands would be folded into this new native government. \nAccording to that department's Web site, ``Approximately 200,000 acres \nof homestead lands are provided for the Hawaiian Home Lands program.'' \nThat is from the Associated Press.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, the state's Office of Hawaiian \nAffairs controls a trust fund worth $3 billion for the benefit of \nNative Hawaiians. One has to ask whether some or all of that $3 billion \nwould be given to this so-called tribe. The bill expressly allows the \ntransfer of land and assets, so this is a serious question.\n  Then the last two arguments the proponents make. They say that this \nis similar to what we did for the Alaska Natives. But there are some \nprofound differences between Alaska and Hawaii. First, the history is \ndifferent. When the United States acquired Alaska from Russia, the \ntreaty stipulated we needed to deal with the Alaska Natives. And when \nAlaska became a State, we included in the law that Alaska Natives would \nhave a special status. That is not true for Native Hawaiians. They have \nalways been part of the State and lived under its jurisdiction.\n  Second, the provisions in S. 147 for the recognition of a native \ngovernment are different from those for Alaska Natives. Alaska Natives \nwere recognized to form corporations and other local forms of \ngovernment, based largely on the village communities in which they \nlived. Most Native Hawaiians don't live in separate villages or \ncommunities in Hawaii and elsewhere in the United States. They are \neveryone's next-door neighbor. Of the 240,000 Native Hawaiians living \nin Hawaii, the U.S. Census reports that less than 20,000 live on \n``Hawaiian homelands.'' The rest are mixed with the States' population.\n  Finally, there is another argument that those who support this bill \nmake. They say: We are just recognizing another Indian tribe. This puts \nNative Hawaiians on an equal footing with other Native American groups.\n  That is their argument. But U.S. law has specific requirements for \nrecognition of an Indian tribe. A tribe must have operated as a \nsovereign for the last 100 years, must be a separate and distinct \ncommunity, and must have had a preexisting political organization. That \nis what the law says. Native Hawaiians do not meet those requirements.\n  In fact, in 1998 the State of Hawaii acknowledged this in a Supreme \nCourt brief in the case of Rice v. Cayetano, saying, ``the tribal \nconcept simply has no place in the context of Hawaiian history.'' It \nwould be difficult to argue that Hawaii was not well represented in \nthat debate because the current Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, Justice Roberts, was the lawyer for the State of Hawaii in this \nargument before the Supreme Court and they said, ``the tribal concept \nsimply has no place in the context of Hawaiian history.''\n  If the bill establishing a Native Hawaiian government would pass, it \nwould have the dubious honor to be the first to create a separate \nnation within the United States. While Congress has recognized \npreexisting American Indian tribes before, it has never created one. \nThat is the difference. Of course, we have recognized preexisting \nAmerican Indian tribes who meet a very specific definition of what an \nIndian tribe is in our law. But so far as I can tell, we have never \ncreated an Indian tribe, and the State of Hawaii itself recognized \nbefore the Supreme Court that its native peoples are not a tribe.\n  To pass this legislation would be a dangerous precedent. It wouldn't \nbe much different than if American citizens who were descended from \nHispanics who lived in Texas before it became a Republic in 1836 \ncreated their own tribes based on claims these lands were improperly \nseized from Mexico or it could open the door to religious groups such \nas the Amish or Hasidic Jews who might seek tribal status to avoid the \nconstraints of the establishment clause of the Constitution. If we \nstart down this path, the end may be the disintegration of the United \nStates into ethnic enclaves.\n  Hawaiians are Americans. They became U.S. citizens in 1900. They have \nsaluted the American flag, paid American taxes, fought in American \nwars. The distinguished Senator from Hawaii has won the Congressional \nMedal of Honor fighting in American wars.\n  In 1959, 94 percent of Hawaiians reaffirmed that commitment to become \nAmericans by voting to become a State. Similar to citizens of every \nother State, they vote in national elections.\n  Becoming an American has always meant giving up allegiance to your \nprevious country and pledging allegiance to your new country, the \nUnited States of America.\n  This goes all the way back to Valley Forge when George Washington \nhimself signed such an oath, and his officers did as well.\n  Today, in this year, more than 500,000 new citizens will take that \noath where they renounce their allegiance to where they came from, not \nbecause they are not proud of it but because they are prouder to be an \nAmerican. And they know if we are going to be one Nation in this land \nof immigrants, they must become Americans.\n  All around the world, countries are struggling with how to integrate \nand assimilate into their societies people from other countries: \nMuslims in Europe, specifically in those countries, Turks in Germany, \nGreat Britain, France, and Italy--all are struggling with this. They \nare envious of our two centuries of history of helping people from all \ncountries come here, learn a common language, understand a few \nprinciples, and become Americans. They are proud of where we came from, \nprouder of who we are.\n  This goes in exactly the opposite direction. This may seem like an \ninsignificant piece of legislation, but within it is embedded an \nassault on one of the most important fundamental values in our country: \nthe value that is expressed and carved right there, ``E Pluribus \nUnum,'' one from many.\n  This legislation would undermine our national unity by treating \nAmericans differently based on race. It would begin to destroy what is \nmost unique\n\n[[Page S5556]]\n\nabout our country. It would begin to make us more of a ``united \nnations'' instead of the United States of America.\n  I hope the Senate heeds the advice of the U.S. Commission on Civil \nRights and defeats this legislation, legislation which the commission \nsaid ``would discriminate on the basis of race or national origin and \nfurther subdivide the American people into discrete subgroups accorded \nvarying degrees of privilege'' and create a new, separate, race-based \ngovernment for those of Native Hawaiian descent.\n  I have tried in my remarks to show that this bill is about \nsovereignty, that it is about land and money, that it is about race, \nthat it is not like what we did for Alaskans, that the Native Hawaiians \nwould not just be another Indian tribe. We don't create new tribes in \nour country. We recognize preexisting ones, and we have very specific \nprovisions in the law about how we do that.\n  The question before us is about what it means to become an American. \nAnd this bill is the reverse of what it means to be an American. \nInstead of making us one Nation, indivisible, it divides us. Instead of \nguaranteeing rights without regard to race, it makes them depend solely \nupon race. Instead of becoming one from many, we would become many from \none.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the \nAkaka bill. If cloture is invoked on that bill, there is a process by \nwhich we will debate and amend the bill.\n  I would like to discuss with my colleagues today some of the \ninfirmities with the bill that we would hope to address through the \namendment process. There is no way to sugarcoat this bill.\n  This bill proposes that the Federal Government establish a racial \ntest for Americans who want to participate in the creation of a new \ngovernment--a government that will gain, according to section 8 of this \nlegislation, lands and natural resources, civil and criminal \njurisdiction, and governmental authority and powers. It is \nunconstitutional, it offends basic notions of American values, and it \nshould be rejected.\n  I would like to spend a few minutes talking about an amendment that \nwe would be voting on should this bill be brought forward.\n  First, keep in mind that we are going to have to decide once and for \nall if we believe in racial tests and race-based government. Government \nanticipated by this bill is created through a racial test. Read section \n3, subparagraph 10: Native Hawaiians, those eligible to participate in \nthe creation of this government, are defined ``as an individual who is \none of the indigenous, native peoples of Hawaii and who is a direct \nlineal descendent of the aboriginal, indigenous, native people in the \nHawaiian islands on or before January 1, 1893, and exercised \nsovereignty there, or a person who descends from one who was one-half \nNative Hawaiian in 1921.''\n  What is that test? It is a racial test. As the Supreme Court \nemphasized, ancestry is a proxy for race.\n  Some advocates insist that it is not a race-based government, no \nmatter what the actual language of the bill says.\n  So we will offer an amendment to put this question to the Senate.\n  The amendment will say that this new government will not have any \ngovernmental powers if membership in the entity is in any way \ndetermined by race or ancestry. The Senate will have a straightforward \nup-or-down vote on whether it supports or rejects the principle of \nrace-based government. If I am wrong and the bill's text is wrong, and \nthis isn't about race, then that amendment will surely pass \noverwhelmingly.\n  When I discussed this amendment with the bill's sponsors in the past, \nthey have said they would strongly oppose it. So we will let the Senate \nvote directly and resolve the issue. All Senators should look forward \nto a vote on whether they support race-based government.\n  Second, we will have to decide whether the Constitution and basic \ncivil rights are to be left to a negotiation process after the bill's \npassage.\n  As I have explained previously, this bill would allow the creation of \na government not subject to the Constitution and Bill of Rights. It \ncould also be immune from the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and all \nother State and Federal civil rights laws. It would authorize creation \nof an enclave where Native Hawaiians would be subject to a different \nset of legal codes, taxes, and regulations.\n  Proponents deny this. They say it is preposterous to say that civil \nrights won't be protected. They say the bill won't result in unequal \ntax and legal systems in Hawaii. They say basic fairness would be \npreserved. But then they say just how this happens is entirely up to \nsubsequent negotiations between the Native Hawaiian entity and \nState and Federal bureaucrats.\n\n  Obviously, basic civil rights should not be up for negotiation. So we \nwill offer an amendment to clear this up. My civil rights amendment \nwill apply the entire Bill of Rights to the new government. It will \napply all Federal antidiscrimination laws. It will ensure that the new \ngovernment doesn't have any special immunities from lawsuits under \nthose laws.\n  It will prevent the creation of any racially defined liabilities, so \nthat no person is subject to any law, regulation, tax, or other \nliability if any person is exempted on the basis of race or ancestry. \nAnd it will guarantee fairness and equal treatment. It will not leave \nthese matters up to future ``negotiations.''\n  This civil rights amendment deserves a vote, and it will get one.\n  The New York Times editorialized today that the bill does not \n``supersede the Constitution.'' I disagree, but we can resolve this.\n  So let's vote and not leave it up to chance. Let's adopt my amendment \nand guarantee civil rights and equal treatment.\n  Again, I have shared the drafts of this amendment with the sponsors \nof the bill who said they oppose it. Perhaps they will reconsider, but \nthe Senate will have an opportunity to vote on this amendment.\n  Third, there is a dispute over whether the people of Hawaii, who are \nmost personally affected by this legislation, actually want this bill. \nThe sponsors say yes, and point to opinion polls that speak vaguely of \n``recognizing'' Native Hawaiians. I can point to alternative polls \nwhich show strong majorities opposed when the citizens understand that \nwith recognition comes the potential for unequal treatment. Do the \nHawaiian people want this? We know much of the political establishment \ndoes. But what about the citizens? I am concerned that this bill will \ndivide Hawaii and encourage racial division there and elsewhere.\n  Indeed, as the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights noted in its report, \nif you listen to the citizens of Hawaii rather than just their \npolitical leaders, it is clear that this legislation has already \ndivided that State. Why would the Senate want to impose a divisive \nresult upon the State of Hawaii without giving Senators a voice?\n  So one of my colleagues will offer an amendment that will give us the \nanswer to the question. It will simply require that all citizens of \nHawaii have a voice by requiring a statewide referendum once the \nnegotiations are complete.\n  The Senate should not be passing on the question of what is good for \nHawaii when we have evidence of such division.\n  Again, I have floated this idea by the bill's sponsors, and they have \nopposed a referendum requirement. But why would they not want to ensure \nthat the people of Hawaii have a direct voice in approving or rejecting \nthe final product of the negotiations called for in the bill?\n  So we will have an amendment. The Senate can decide if the people of \nHawaii should be denied their opportunity to speak.\n  As I have said in the past, I will support a cloture vote and will \nsupport the Senate having an opportunity to debate and vote on \namendments to this bill. But should cloture be accepted and the Senate \nget on this bill, I have also\n\n[[Page S5557]]\n\nnoted I strongly oppose it and will offer amendments to try to ensure \nthe result of the bill is most fair to the people of Hawaii. That I \nwill most surely do.\n\n  I look forward to that debate. I look forward to the debate and \namendments that will be offered as a result.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time, the hour of 3:30 having arrived, \nthe next 30 minutes is under the control of the minority.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I expected my colleague from Arizona would \nspeak on the estate tax. He, in fact, spoke about the subject which we \nwill now spend the next 30 minutes on, on this side, the Native \nHawaiian Government Reorganization Act. He raises some questions, and \nmy expectation is that debate and discussion about this proposal will \npromote some rather aggressive discussion in the Senate. That is fine. \nIt is nice at this point that after all these many years we are \ndebating this issue.\n  I will give a little bit of the history as vice chairman of the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs. That committee is the committee that \nbrought this legislation to the Senate. The action was bipartisan. We \nhave decided this is a worthy piece of legislation. I support it. The \ncommittee supports it. That is the basis on which it is in the Senate \nnow.\n  I don't know the history nearly as well as my colleagues, Senator \nAkaka and Senator Inouye, but let me describe a little of the history, \nif I might. I know a bit of this because I represent a State in which \nwe have numerous Indian tribes. Those are the first Americans. Those \nare the folks who were there before my ancestors showed up. They owned \nthe land. They farmed along the Missouri River. I understand something \nabout Indian tribes, tribal governments and self-determination. I \nunderstand that because I work in that area a lot with the Indian \ntribes from my State.\n  Let me describe the issue of aboriginal and indigenous peoples in the \nUnited States, and especially in Hawaii, from the small amount of \nhistory that I know. Again, the rich history here will be better \nrecited by my colleagues, Senator Inouye and Senator Akaka.\n  January 16, 1893--that is a long, long time ago--the United States \nMinister John Stevens, who served, then, as Ambassador to the court of \nQueen Liliuokalani, directed a marine company onboard the USS Boston to \narrest and detain the queen. This is the queen that served the \nindigenous people in Hawaii. She was arrested. She was placed under \narrest for 9 months at the palace.\n  That event was engineered and orchestrated by the Committee of Public \nSafety which I understand consisted of Hawaii's non-native Hawaii \nbusinessmen, with the approval of Minister Stevens.\n  So we have a people in Hawaii who were the first Hawaiians, the \nindigenous people to Hawaii, who had a government, who had a structure. \nThe head of that government was summarily arrested and a new government \nwas created in Hawaii. That new government apparently was a government \nthat would meet at the pleasure of those who engineered the arrest of \nthe queen.\n  Today, after many decades raising questions, should there not be an \nopportunity for Native Hawaiians, very much as there has been an \nopportunity in our country in what is called the lower 48 for Indian \ntribes to seek reorganization, to seek reorganization--there should be \nsome opportunity along the way for there to be a Native Hawaiian \nGovernment Reorganization Act. The reason this is a ``reorganization'' \nis because that government existed. This is not the creation of a new \ngovernment. This is a government that previously existed, but many \ndecades ago was essentially dissolved or destroyed as a governing unit \nby the actions I previously described.\n  My colleagues have come to the Congress from the State of Hawaii and \nhave asked that a bill authorizing the reorganization of a Native \nHawaiian governing entity that could negotiate agreements with the \nUnited States and the State of Hawaii to address a good number of \nissues relating to self-determination and self-governance of the Native \nHawaiians be brought to the Senate and be considered and debated. That \nis the basis on which it is here today.\n  Upon introduction last year by my colleagues from Hawaii, this bill \nwas referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs. We held a hearing on \nthe bill, received testimony that demonstrated broad bipartisan \nsupport, strong support for this bill in Hawaii and also in Indian \ncountry around America.\n  We heard from Governor Lingle from the State of Hawaii about the \nimportance of this bill to the people and to the economy of Hawaii. We \nheard from Native Hawaiians about the significance of this bill on all \naspects of Native Hawaiian life. We heard from the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians about its long-standing support for Native Hawaiians \nto be formally afforded the right to self-determination. This bill does \nnot by itself do that. It establishes the process for a reorganization \nin order to create that structure.\n  There has been back and forth between interested parties on this \nbill. There are some who have concerns and questions about it. \nSignificant efforts, I know, have been spent by my two colleagues, \nSenator Akaka and Senator Inouye, to address concerns relating to \njurisdiction, claims and gaming issues. I believe these concerns in \nalmost all cases have been adequately resolved.\n  Even more importantly, I believe the Members of the Senate, finally, \ndeserve the opportunity, and my two colleagues from Hawaii deserve the \nopportunity, to have this legislation before the Senate open for \ndiscussion and open for debate.\n  Senator Akaka requested floor time for this bill 1 year ago. His \nrequest was not granted because we were compelled to address other \nimminent concerns relating to hurricane relief and other matters at \nthat time that were urgent.\n  Bills on this issue have been introduced since the 106th Congress. \nNone have received time for floor debate. Fairness, I believe, now \nrequires this Congress to offer this bill in the Senate for full \ndebate.\n  Let me finally say this. I know of no two Members of the Senate who \nhave worked harder, with greater determination to advance the cause in \ntheir State that has broad bipartisan support in their State on behalf \nof Native Hawaiians, a right that is already afforded to many other \naboriginal and indigenous peoples around the United States that has not \nbeen afforded to those Native Hawaiians. I know of no one in this \nSenate who has worked harder for an important issue of passion in their \nhearts than Senator Akaka and Senator Inouye. I am very pleased that \nthe Senate Committee on Indian Affairs was able to pass this \nlegislation and bring it to the Senate today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I discuss legislation that is \ncritically important to the people of Hawaii, all the people of Hawaii, \nthe Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005. While I am \npleased to see this bill finally come to the Senate floor after 6 long \nyears, I remain perplexed by the constant barrage of misinformation \nthat has been provided by opponents to this legislation.\n\n  Tomorrow we will be voting on a motion to invoke cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 147, the Native Hawaiian Government \nReorganization Act of 2005. I ask all of my colleagues, to let this \nbill come to the floor for a debate--whether you are for or against it. \nAt the minimum, we should be allowed to discuss what this bill is \nreally about.\n  I also want to alert my colleagues to the fact that a new substitute \namendment has been drafted which incorporates legislative language \nnegotiated between Senator Inouye and myself and officials from the \nExecutive Branch to address policy concerns regarding the liability of \nthe United States in land claims, the impact of the bill on military \nreadiness, gaming, and civil and criminal jurisdiction in Hawaii. While \nI realize that we will not consider the substitute amendment until we \nget to the actual consideration of the bill, I share this with my \ncolleagues so that they know that our negotiations with the \nadministration have been successful in addressing their concerns and \nadhering to the intent and purpose of this bill.\n  This bill is about process and fairness. Hawaii's indigenous peoples, \nNative Hawaiians, have been recognized\n\n[[Page S5558]]\n\nas indigenous peoples by Congress through the one hundred sixty-plus \nstatutes we have enacted for Native Hawaiians. Congress has \nhistorically treated Native Hawaiians, for more than a hundred years, \nin a manner similar to American Indians and Alaska Natives. What our \nbill does is to authorize a process so that the federal policy of self-\ngovernance and self-determination, a policy formally extended to \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives, can be extended to Native \nHawaiians, thereby creating parity in the way the United States treats \nits indigenous peoples.\n  We have bipartisan support for the enactment of this bill. I extend \nmy deep appreciation to the cosponsors of this legislation, Senators \nCantwell, Coleman, Dodd, Dorgan, Graham, Inouye, Murkowski, Smith, and \nStevens, for their unwavering support of our efforts.\n  I especially want to recognize Hawaii's Governor, Linda Lingle, who \nserves as the first Republican governor in Hawaii in 40 years. Despite \nour political differences, Governor Lingle and her cabinet, primarily \nAttorney General Mark Bennett and Hawaiian Homes Commission Chairman \nMicah Kane, have worked tirelessly with us for the past 4 years in an \neffort to enact this bill for the people of Hawaii.\n  In Hawaii, support for the preservation and culture of Hawaii's \nindigenous peoples is a nonpartisan issue. In Hawaii, diversity is \nprecious. The more we understand our culture, traditions, and heritage, \nthe more we can contribute to the fabric of society that has become the \nlocal culture in Hawaii. While my opponents see diversity as a threat, \nthe people of Hawaii embrace diversity and celebrate it as a means of \nunderstanding the foundations upon which our local culture, the culture \nthat brings us all together, is based.\n  Let me be the first to say that the people of Hawaii, including \nHawaii's indigenous peoples, are proud to be Americans. The many Native \nHawaiians in the National Guard who were away from their families for \neighteen months, serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom, are proud to be \nAmerican. In fact, it is a well-documented fact that native peoples \nhave the highest per capita rate of serving in our military to defend \nour country. It is absolutely offensive to read opponents' \nmischaracterization of this bill as an effort to secede from the United \nStates or to question the right of Hawaii's indigenous peoples to have \na mechanism of self-governance and self-determination within the \nframework of Federal law.\n  This bill is of significant importance to the people of Hawaii. It is \nsignificant because it provides a process, a structured process, for \nthe people of Hawaii to finally address longstanding issues resulting \nfrom a dark period in Hawaii's history, the overthrow of the Kingdom of \nHawaii. The people of Hawaii are multicultural and we celebrate our \ndiversity. At the same time, we all share a common respect and desire \nto preserve the culture and tradition of Hawaii's indigenous peoples, \nNative Hawaiians.\n  Despite this perceived harmony, there are issues stemming from the \noverthrow that we have not addressed due to apprehension over the \nemotions that arise when these matters are discussed. I have mentioned \nthis to my colleagues previously, but it bears repeating that there has \nbeen no structured process. Instead, there has been fear as to what the \ndiscussion would entail, causing people to avoid the issues. Such \nbehavior has led to high levels of anger and frustration as well as \nmisunderstandings between Native Hawaiians and non-Native Hawaiians.\n  As a young child, I was discouraged from speaking Hawaiian because I \nwas told that it would not allow me to succeed in the Western world. My \nparents lived through the overthrow and endured the aftermath as a time \nwhen all things Hawaiian, including language, which they both spoke \nfluently, hula, custom, and tradition, were viewed as negative. I, \ntherefore, was discouraged from speaking the language and practicing \nHawaiian customs and traditions. I was the youngest of eight children. \nI remember as a young child sneaking to listen to my parents so that I \ncould maintain my ability to understand the Hawaiian language. My \nexperience mirrors that of my generation of Hawaiians.\n  While my generation learned to accept what was ingrained into us by \nour parents, my children have had the advantage of growing up during \nthe Hawaiian renaissance, a period of revival for Hawaiian language, \ncustom, and tradition. Benefiting from this revival is the generation \nof my grandchildren who can speak Hawaiian and know so much more about \nour history.\n  It is this generation, however, that is growing impatient with the \nlack of progress in efforts to resolve longstanding issues. It is this \ngeneration that does not understand why we have not resolved these \nmatters. It is for this generation that I have written this bill to \nensure that we have a way to address these emotional issues.\n\n  There are those who have tried to say that my bill will divide the \npeople of Hawaii. My bill goes a long way to unite the people of Hawaii \nby providing a structured process to deal with issues that have plagued \nus since 1893.\n  This bill is also important to the people of Hawaii because it \naffirms the dealings of Congress with Native Hawaiians since Hawaii's \nannexation in 1898. Congress has always treated Native Hawaiians as \nHawaii's indigenous peoples, and therefore, as indigenous peoples of \nthe United States. Federal policies towards Native Hawaiians have \nlargely mirrored those pertaining to American Indian and Alaska \nNatives.\n  Again, let me reiterate, Congress has enacted over 160 statutes to \naddress the conditions of Native Hawaiians including the Native \nHawaiian Health Care Improvement Act, the Native Hawaiian Education \nAct, and the Native Hawaiian Home Ownership Act. The programs that have \nbeen established are administered by federal agencies such as the \nDepartments of Health and Human Services, Education, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and Labor. As you can imagine, these programs go a long \nway to benefit Native Hawaiians, but they also serve as an important \nsource of employment and income for many, many people in Hawaii, \nincluding many non-Native Hawaiians. There are many Hawaii residents \nwhose livelihoods depend on the continuation of these programs and \nservices.\n  While I took the time a few weeks ago to talk about Hawaii's history, \nI want to spend the next few moments discussing that history once \nagain. This is very important to understand the context of what we are \ntrying to accomplish with this bill.\n  The year 1778 marks the year of first contact between the Western \nworld and the people of Hawaii. That year, Captain James Cook landed in \nHawaii. Prior to Western contact, Native Hawaiians lived in an advanced \nsociety that was steeped in science. Native Hawaiians honored their \nland (aina) and environment, and therefore developed methods of \nirrigation, agriculture, aquaculture, navigation, medicine, fishing and \nother forms of subsistence whereby the land and sea were efficiently \nused without waste or damage. Respect for the environment and for \nothers formed the basis of their culture and tradition.\n  Society was structured. Chief, alii, ruled each of the islands. Land \nwas divided into ahupuaa, triangular-shaped land divisions which \nstretched from the mountain to the ocean. Each ahupuaa controlled by a \nlower-chief. The lands were worked on by the commoners, referred to as \nmakaainana. There was an incentive for the chiefs to treat the \nmakaainana well as they could always move to another ahupuaa and work \nfor another chief.\n  The immediate and brutal decline of the Native Hawaiian population \nwas the most obvious result of contact with the West. Between Cook's \narrival and 1820, disease, famine, and war killed more than half of the \nNative Hawaiian population. By 1866, only 57,000 Native Hawaiians \nremained from the basically stable pre-1778 population of at least \n300,000. The result was a rending of the social fabric.\n  This devastating population loss was accompanied by cultural, \neconomic, and psychological destruction. Western sailors, merchants, \nand traders did not respect Hawaiian kapu, taboos, or religion and were \nbeyond the reach of the priests. The chiefs began to imitate the \nforeigners whose ships and arms were so superior to their own.\n  By the middle of the 19th Century, the islands' small non-native \npopulation had come to wield an influence\n\n[[Page S5559]]\n\nfar in excess of its size. These influential Westerners sought to limit \nthe absolute power of the Hawaiian king over their legal rights and to \nimplement property law so that they could accumulate and control land. \nAs a result of foreign pressure, these goals were achieved.\n  The mutual interests of Americans living in Hawaii and the United \nStates became increasingly clear as the 19th Century progressed. \nAmerican merchants and planters in Hawaii wanted access to mainland \nmarkets and protection from European and Asian domination. The United \nStates developed a military and economic interest in placing Hawaii \nwithin its sphere of influence. In 1826, the United States and Hawaii \nentered into the first of the four treaties the two nations signed \nduring the 19th Century.\n  King Kamehameha I began the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1810 upon unifying \nthe islands. The Kingdom continued until 1893 when it was overthrown \nwith the help of agents of the United States. The overthrow of the \nKingdom is easily the most poignant part of Hawaii's history. Opponents \nof the bill have characterized the overthrow as the fault of Hawaii's \nlast reigning monarch, Queen Lili'uokalani. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth.\n  America's already ascendant political influence in Hawaii was \nheightened by the prolonged sugar boom. Sugar planters were eager to \neliminate the United States' tariff on their exports to California and \nOregon. The 1875 Convention on Commercial Reciprocity eliminated the \nAmerican tariff on sugar from Hawaii and virtually all tariffs that \nHawaii had placed on American products. It prohibited Hawaii from \ngiving political, economic, or territorial preferences to any other \nforeign power. It also provided the United States with the right to \nestablish a military base at Pearl Harbor.\n  While non-Hawaiians were determined to ensure that the Hawaiian \ngovernment did nothing to damage Hawaii's growing political and \neconomic relationship with America, Hawaii's King and people were \nbitter about the loss of their lands to foreigners. Matters came to a \nhead in 1887, when King Kalakaua appointed a prime minister who had the \nstrong support of the Hawaiian people and who opposed granting a base \nat Pearl Harbor as a condition for extension of the Reciprocity Treaty.\n  The business community, backed by the non-native military group, the \nHonolulu Rifles, forced the prime minister's resignation and the \nenactment of a new constitution. The new constitution--often referred \nto as the Bayonet Constitution--reduced the King to a figure of minor \nimportance. It extended the right to vote to Western males whether or \nnot they were citizens of the Hawaiian Kingdom, and disenfranchised \nalmost all native voters by giving only residents with a specified \nincome level or amount of property the right to vote for members of the \nHouse of Nobles. The representatives of propertied Westerners took \ncontrol of the legislature. This is the constitution that the opponents \nto the bill have characterized as bringing democracy to Hawaii.\n  A suspected native revolt in favor of the King's younger sister, \nPrincess Liliuokalani, and a new constitution were quelled when the \nAmerican minister summoned United States Marines from an American \nwarship off Honolulu. Westerners remained firmly in control of the \ngovernment until the death of the King in 1891, when Queen Liliuokalani \ncame to power.\n  On January 14, 1893, the Queen was prepared to promulgate a new \nconstitution, restoring the sovereign's control over the House of \nNobles and limiting the franchise to Hawaiian subjects. She was, \nhowever, forced to withdraw her proposed constitution. Despite the \nQueen's apparent acquiescence, the majority of Westerners recognized \nthat the Hawaiian monarchy posed a continuing threat to the unimpeded \npursuit of their interests. They formed a Committee of Public Safety to \noverthrow the Kingdom.\n  On January 16, 1893, at the order of U.S. Minister John Stevens, \nAmerican Marines marched through Honolulu, to a building known as Arion \nHall, located near both the government building and the Hawaiian \npalace. The next day, local revolutionaries seized the government \nbuilding and demanded that Queen Liliuokalani abdicate. Stevens \nimmediately recognized the rebels' provisional government and placed it \nunder the United States' protection.\n  I was deeply saddened by allegations made by opponents of this \nlegislation that the overthrow was done to maintain democratic \nprinciples over a despotic monarch. As you can tell by the history I \njust shared, our Queen was trying to restore the Kingdom to its native \npeoples after Western influence had so greatly diminished their rights. \nColleagues, I want you to understand Hawaii's history and the bravery \nand courage of our Queen, who abdicated her throne in an effort to save \nher people after seeing United States Marines marching through the \nstreets of Honolulu.\n  The Republic of Hawaii was formed in 1893, and in 1898, Hawaii was \nannexed as a territory of the United States. At the time of the \noverthrow, the Republic of Hawaii took control of approximately 1.8 \nmillion acres of land which were held in a trust for the people of the \nKingdom of Hawaii. The driving force of the overthrow, the formation of \nthe Republic, and the drive towards annexation was land ownership and \ncontrol over land.\n  Native Hawaiians, like other indigenous cultures, could not grasp the \nconcept of fee simple ownership of land. The concept of owning land was \nas foreign to them as the concept of owning air would be to us today. \nFor ancient Hawaiians, and for many Hawaiians today, it is understood \nthat all fortune comes from the aina, or land. Therefore, it was \nimportant to cultivate and protect the aina and its resources, but the \nconcept of owning it was inconceivable. Ancient Hawaiian society was \nbased on sharing--everyone cultivated, everyone protected, everyone \nreaped the benefits.\n  From the time of annexation until present day, as I noted previously \nin my statement, Congress has treated Native Hawaiians in a manner \nsimilar to that of American Indians and Alaska Natives. Federal \npolicies towards Native Hawaiians have always paralleled policies \ntowards American Indians and Alaska Natives. As early as 1910, Congress \nincluded Native Hawaiians in appropriating funds to study the cultures \nof American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n  In 1921, Congress enacted the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920, \nwhich set aside approximately 203,500 acres of land for homesteading \nand agricultural use by Native Hawaiians. The act was intended to \n``rehabilitate'' the Native Hawaiian race which was estimated to have \ndropped from between 400,000 and 1 million, to 38,000. At the time, \nprevailing Federal Indian policy was premised upon the objective of \nbreaking up Indian reservations and allotting lands to individual \nIndians. Indians were not to be declared citizens of the United States \nuntil 1924, and it was typical that a 20-year restraint on the \nalienation of allotted lands was imposed. This restraint prevented the \nlands from being subject to taxation by the states, but the restraint \non alienation could be lifted if an individual Indian was deemed to \nhave become ``civilized.'' The primary objective of the allotment lands \nto individual Indians was to ``civilize'' the native people. The fact \nthat the United States thought to impose a similar scheme on the native \npeople of Hawaii in an effort to ``rehabilitate a dying race'' \nillustrates the similarity in federal policies toward Native Hawaiians \nand American Indians.\n  Opponents of my bill have unfortunately conjured a theory that there \nwas no intent to recognize Native Hawaiians as indigenous peoples at \nthe time of Statehood. I've gone back and reviewed the constitutional \nconvention of 1950 which resulted in the constitution that was adopted \nin 1959 when Hawaii was admitted to the Union. The delegates to this \nconvention reflected the multi-ethnic diversity in the islands. Only 19 \npercent of the delegates were Native Hawaiians. The 1950 convention \ndeliberately incorporated provisions of the Hawaiian Homes Commission \nAct of 1920.\n  It was not without controversy. At least one delegate opposed its \ninclusion. Yet, the majority of convention delegates voted to include \nthe provisions and the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act remains a part of \nthe Hawaii State Constitution today.\n\n[[Page S5560]]\n\n  In addition, the Hawaii Admission Act also required the State to take \ntitle over the majority of the public lands which had been ceded to the \nUnited States at the time of annexation. The Act required that the \nlands be held by the state as a public trust, with income and proceeds \nbeing used for five public purposes, one of which was to address the \nconditions of Native Hawaiians. It is clear to me after reviewing these \ndocuments that while this issue has not been unanimous, there has \nalways been overwhelming support for efforts to recognize Native \nHawaiians as Hawaii's indigenous peoples, and to accord them such \ntreatment.\n  From 1959 to 1978, little was done at the state level to benefit \nNative Hawaiians. In 1978, the state held a constitutional convention. \nOne of the results of the constitutional convention was the \nestablishment of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a quasi-State agency \nwhich was set up to address Native Hawaiian issues. The agency would be \ndirected by a Board of Trustees, all Native Hawaiians, who were to be \nelected by Native Hawaiians. The State of Hawaii ratified the \nconstitutional convention's proposal and from 1978 to 1999, the Board \nof Trustees for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs was elected by Native \nHawaiians.\n  In 1999, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the case of Rice v. \nCayetano that because OHA receives state funds, the vote for the Board \nof Trustees could not be restricted to Native Hawaiians. The vote for \nthe Board of Trustees has since been open to the entire State of Hawaii \nand all state citizens are eligible to run for a position on the Board \nof Trustees. The people of Hawaii have elected Native Hawaiians to each \nof the nine positions.\n  Some of my opponents have claimed that this bill would circumvent the \nRice case. There is no intent to circumvent the Rice case. Nothing in \nthis bill would address the election of the Board of Trustees for the \nOffice of Hawaiian Affairs.\n  In 1993, P.L. 103-150, the Apology Resolution, was signed into law. \nThe bill apologized to Native Hawaiians for participation of U.S. \nagents in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and committed the \nUnited States to a process of reconciliation with Native Hawaiians. In \n1999, officials from the Departments of the Interior and Justice \ntraveled to Hawaii for public consultations with Native Hawaiians. In \n2000, the Departments issued a report, From Mauka to Makai: The River \nof Justice Must Flow Freely. One of the primary recommendations in the \nreport is that legislation should be enacted which would provide Native \nHawaiians with greater self-determination within the federal framework \nover their assets and resources. S. 147 would make this recommendation \na reality.\n  The reconciliation process I referred to is still an ongoing process. \nI see this measure as an important step in the reconciliation process--\na necessary step that provides the structure for us to continue to \nprogress in reconciliation between Native Hawaiians and United States.\n  I also want to share a unique fact about Hawaii's history. We have \nhad six forms of government. Pre-1810 the islands were ruled by \nchiefdoms. The Kingdom of Hawaii was established, following the \nunification of the Islands by King Kamehameha I in 1810, and continued \nuntil the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1893. From 1893-1898, \nthe Republic of Hawaii ruled. The territorial government followed from \n1898-1941. During World War II, martial law was declared, resulting in \nthe civilian government being dissolved and a Military Government \nruling the territory of Hawaii from 1941-1944. We returned to our \nterritorial government in 1944 and in 1959 we were granted admission \ninto the Union.\n  I can assure my colleagues that the political status of Native \nHawaiians has been a hot topic in Hawaii since 1959. In 1999, Hawaii's \nCongressional delegation formed the Task Force on Native Hawaiian \nissues. I was selected to head our delegation's efforts. I immediately \nestablished five working groups to assist us in addressing the \nclarification of the political and legal relationship between Native \nHawaiians and the United States. The groups included the Native \nHawaiian community, state officials, including agency heads and state \nlegislators, Federal officials, Native American and constitutional \nscholars, and Congressional members and caucuses. We held several \npublic meetings in Hawaii with the members of the Native Hawaiian \ncommunity working group and the state working group. Individuals who \nwere not members of the working group, and many who opposed our \nefforts, were allowed to attend and participate in the meetings. \nOverall, we had more than one hundred individuals provide initial input \nto the drafting of the legislation.\n  The bill was first considered by the 106th Congress. Five days of \nhearings were held in Hawaii in August 2000. While the bill passed the \nHouse, the Senate failed to take action. The bill was subsequently \nconsidered by the 107th and 108th Congresses. For each Congress, the \nbill has been favorably reported by the Senate Committee on Indian \nAffairs and the House Committee on Resources. Unfortunately, until now, \nwe have not had an opportunity for the Senate to consider this \nlegislation.\n\n  S. 147 the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005, \ndoes three things: (1) it establishes a process for Native Hawaiians to \nreorganize their governing entity for the purposes of a federally \nrecognized government-to-government relationship with the United \nStates; (2) creates an office in the Department of the Interior to \nfocus on Native Hawaiian issues and (3) establishes an interagency \ncoordinating group comprised of federal officials from agencies who \nimplement federal programs impacting Native Hawaiians.\n  The process for the reorganization of the Native Hawaiian governing \nentity has received the most publicity and most attention. I am very \nproud of the careful balance between structure and flexibility provided \nin the reorganization process. Native Hawaiians will truly be able to \nmake critical decisions in shaping their reorganized governing entity.\n  Some have asked, why do you need to reorganize the entity? My answer \nis simple--our history requires it. Unlike some of our native brethren, \nwhen the Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown, our native peoples were not \nallowed to retain their governing entity. Article 101 of the \nConstitution of the Republic of Hawaii required prospective voters to \nswear an oath in support of the Republic and declaring that they would \nnot, either directly or indirectly, encourage or assist in the \nrestoration or establishment of a monarchical form of government in the \nHawaiian Islands. The overwhelming majority of the Native Hawaiian \npopulation, loyal to their Queen, refused to swear to such an oath and \nwere thus effectively disenfranchised.\n  Similarly at the time of annexation, an overwhelming number of \nHawaiians signed a document in protest of annexation, referred to as \nthe Ku`e Petition. It is this document that I have here. A substantial \nnumber of Native Hawaiians signed this document in further protest of \nwhat had happened to their government.\n  My bill provides for the reorganization of the governing entity, \nbecause upon the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Native Hawaiians \nlost their governing entity. Despite the lack of a government, Native \nHawaiians have maintained distinct communities and perpetuated their \nculture, traditions, customs, and language. While the United States has \nalways treated us in a manner similar to that of American Indians and \nAlaska Natives, the Federal policy of self-governance and self-\ndetermination has not been extended to us because we lack a \ngovernmental structure.\n  Opponents of my bill say that I am creating a government. I believe \nit is clear that, rather than creating a government, I seek to provide \nan opportunity for the restoration of a government which requires the \nreorganization of an entity.\n  Similarly, because of our history, the governmental authority in \nHawaii is held by the State, local, and Federal governments. For that \nreason, the bill requires that following the reorganization of the \nentity and the recognition of the entity by the United States, the \nNative Hawaiian governing entity will negotiate with the State and \nFederal governments regarding matters such as the transfer of lands, \nassets, and natural resources, and the exercise of governmental \nauthority. Everything remains status quo until addressed and resolved \nin the negotiations process.\n\n[[Page S5561]]\n\n  It is anticipated that Hawaii's State Constitution is likely to \nrequire an amendment which will require the vote of all residents in \nHawaii. It is also anticipated that implementing legislation at the \nstate and federal levels will be required to implement negotiated \nmatters. This is what I referred to as the structured process that \nwould allow the people of Hawaii to address the longstanding issues \nresulting from the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. This process is \ninclusive and allows for all interested parties to participate.\n  Opponents of my bill have sought to either mischaracterize potential \noutcomes or to predetermine the process. I have opposed both efforts. \nAs you can see, enactment of this bill alone does not, for example, \nallow for the native government to exert criminal and civil \njurisdiction over people in Hawaii. Rather, for the Native Hawaiian \ngoverning entity to exert any jurisdiction, the state and federal \ngovernment would need to agree to allow the Native Hawaiian governing \nentity to exercise such authority. Implementing legislation at the \nstate level would also need to be enacted to make this a reality.\n  Others have sought to predetermine this matter. Given the inclusive \nprocess that the bill provides, and the fact that the people of Hawaii \nneed to address these matters, I do not believe it is appropriate for \nCongress to predetermine the outcome of this process. Given everything \nthat I have shared with you, I would hope that you agree with me.\n  Finally, before I conclude, I'd like to speak briefly about what this \nbill does not do. The enactment of S. 147 will not lead to gaming in \nHawaii. There is only one federal statute that authorizes gaming in \nIndian Country, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and it does not \nauthorize Native Hawaiians to game. In addition, the State of Hawaii is \none of two states in the union that criminally prohibits all forms of \ngaming. Therefore, gaming by the entity would only be allowed with \nchanges to both federal and state law.\n  The enactment of this bill also does not impact funding for Indian \nprograms and services. As I described earlier, Congress has established \nprograms and services for Native Hawaiians. These programs are \nappropriated from accounts completely separate from those that fund \nIndian programs and services. The bill clearly states that it does not \ncreate eligibility for Native Hawaiians to participate in Indian \nprograms and services.\n  I will conclude where I began. Colleagues, for the people of Hawaii, \nnative issues are not partisan. Many of my constituents merely ask that \nwe do right by Hawaii's indigenous peoples and enact this measure that \nprovides Native Hawaiians with the opportunity to reorganize their \ngoverning entity for the purposes of a Federally recognized government-\nto-government relationship with the United States. Many of my \nconstituents ask that you enact this bill because it provides a \nstructured process for us to finally address longstanding issues \nresulting from a painful history so that we can all move forward as a \nState.\n  Mr. AKAKA. After 6 long years, we will be voting tomorrow on a motion \nto invoke cloture to proceed to S. 147. Whether you are for or against \nit, I ask all Members to let this bill come to the Senate so we can \ndiscuss its merits. It is only through this dialog, through the airing \nof facts and the dismissal of misunderstandings and myths, that we can \nprovide a fair and honest consideration of what this measure really \nmeans to Native Hawaiians as well as to this great Nation of ours. That \nis what this honorable body has always done. This is why we gather in \nthis Senate to discuss matters of law and governing and of fairness and \nof human and civil rights.\n  At the heart of it, this bill is about fairness and about creating a \nprocess to achieve it. Native Hawaiians have been recognized as \nindigenous peoples by Congress. After more than 160 statutes, for more \nthan 100 years, Congress has treated Native Hawaiians in a manner \nsimilar to American Indians and Native Alaskans. But when it comes to \nhaving a process and Federal policy on self-governance and self-\ndetermination, Native Hawaiians have not been treated equally.\n  What this bill does is authorize a process to examine whether a \npolicy of self-governance and self-determination can be extended to \nNative Hawaiians, thereby creating parity in the way the United States \ntreats its indigenous peoples.\n  We have bipartisan support for this bill. I extend my deep \nappreciation to its cosponsors, Senators Cantwell, Coleman, Dodd, \nDorgan, Graham, Inouye, Murkowski, Smith, and Stevens for their \nunwavering support. Again, I especially want to honor Hawaii's first \nRepublican Governor, Governor Lingle, in 40 years. Despite our \ndifferent political affiliations, Governor Lingle, Hawaii's Attorney \nGeneral Mark Bennett, Hawaiian Homes Commission Chairman Micah Kane, \nand the rest of the Lingle administration have worked tirelessly with \nus to support this bill.\n  While that may surprise some in Washington, DC, you have to \nunderstand back home, support for Hawaii's indigenous peoples is a \nnonpartisan issue. We see our diversity as our strength and not as a \nthreat. It is a point of pride and a thing that unites, not divides us. \nWe embrace our diversity and celebrate it as part of our social fabric. \nIt is who we are as a people and as a State. That is why we are not \nthreatened by efforts to preserve and strengthen the culture and \ntraditions of Hawaii's indigenous peoples.\n  Let me also say that the people of Hawaii, including Native \nHawaiians, are proud to be Americans and to share that system of \ngovernment that always has and allows us to be many and also to be one. \nThey include the many Native Hawaiians who are members of the Hawaii \nNational Guard and who are called away from their families to serve in \noperation Iraqi Freedom. Moreover, it is a well-documented fact that \nnative peoples have the highest per capita rate of those serving in our \nmilitary.\n  That is why it is absolutely offensive to read mischaracterizations \nof this bill as an effort to secede from the United States.\n  What this bill really does is provide a structured process to finally \naddress long-standing issues resulting from a dark period in Hawaii \nhistory, the overthrow of the kingdom of Hawaii.\n  A few weeks ago I took time to talk about Hawaii's history. I have \ngiven a review of that history and its ramifications on this measure. I \nbelieve it is absolutely essential for anyone voting on this bill to \nunderstand historical context. I strongly encourage all Members to \nagain review this history because there remain issues stemming from the \noverthrow that have not been addressed because of apprehension based on \nemotions rather than facts.\n  Instead, there has been fear of where these discussions might lead, \ncausing people to avoid the issue altogether. Such behavior has led to \nfrustration and misunderstanding between some Native and non-Native \nHawaiians. But let me bring this complex history and how it has \naffected us down to a more human scale and to a more personal level.\n\n  As young child, I was discouraged from speaking Hawaiian because I \nwas told it would not allow me to succeed in the Western World. My \nparents, God bless them, lived through the overthrow and endured the \naftermath, when all things Hawaiian, including language, hula, custom, \nand tradition, were viewed negatively. I was discouraged from speaking \nthe language and practicing Hawaiian customs and traditions. I was the \nyoungest of eight children. I remember as a young child sneaking to \nlisten to my parents so that I could maintain my ability to understand \nthe Hawaiian language. My experience mirrors that of many other \nHawaiians of my generation.\n  While we dealt with the stigma of being Hawaiian, my children have \nhad the advantage of growing up during a period of revival for Hawaiian \nlanguage, custom, and tradition. My grandchildren, who can speak \nHawaiian and know so much more about our history, also benefited from \nthis revival. It is this generation, knowing the history, that grows \nimpatient with the lack of progress and efforts to resolve longstanding \nissues. It is this generation, steeped in American values of justice, \nequality, and self-determination, who cannot understand why we have not \nyet resolved these matters. It is for this and future generations that \nwe have written this bill to address these important issues.\n\n[[Page S5562]]\n\n  There are those who have tried to say that my bill will divide the \npeople of Hawaii. I believe my bill goes a long way to unite the people \nof Hawaii by providing a structured process to deal with unresolved \nissues and unhealed wounds that have plagued us since 1893.\n  Essentially, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act does \nthree things: One, it establishes a process for Native Hawaiians to \nform a government-to-government relationship with the United States. \nTwo, it creates an office in the Department of the Interior to focus on \nNative Hawaiian issues. And three, it establishes a coordinating group \ncomprised of officials from Federal agencies who implement programs \nimpacting Native Hawaiians. But it is the process for reorganizing a \ngoverning entity that has received the most attention. That is why I am \nvery proud of the careful balance between structure and flexibility \nprovided in this process. Native Hawaiians will truly be able to make \ncritical decisions in shaping their government.\n  Some have asked: Why do you need to reorganize a governing entity? My \nanswer is simple: Our country's history requires it. Our sense of \njustice and fairness requires it. When the kingdom of Hawaii was \noverthrown, our native peoples were not allowed to retain their \ngoverning entity. Article 101 of the Constitution of the Republic of \nHawaii required prospective voters to swear an oath in support of the \nRepublic and declare that they would not, either directly or \nindirectly, encourage or assist in the restoration or establishment of \na monarchy in the Hawaiian Islands. The overwhelming majority of the \nNative Hawaiian population, loyal to the Queen at that time, refused to \nswear to such an oath and was thus effectively disenfranchised.\n  Similarly, at the time of annexation, an overwhelming number of \nHawaiians signed a document of protest referred to as the Ku'e \npetition--it is this document that I have--as a substantial number of \nNative Hawaiians signed this document in further protest of what had \nhappened to their government. Despite the lack of a government, Native \nHawaiians have maintained distinct communities and perpetuated their \nculture, tradition, customs, and language.\n  Opponents of the bill say I am creating a new government. I believe I \nam providing an opportunity for the restoration and reorganization of a \ngovernment that once existed and was unjustly removed.\n  Before I conclude, I wish to speak briefly about what this bill does \nnot do. This bill will not result in the taking of private lands in \nHawaii. No one will lose their home or business because of my bill. The \nenactment of S. 147 will not lead to gaming in Hawaii. There is only \none Federal statute that authorizes gaming in Indian Country--the \nIndian Gaming Regulatory Act. And it does not authorize Native \nHawaiians to game. In addition, the State of Hawaii is one of only two \nStates that criminally prohibits all forms of gaming. Therefore, gaming \nwould only be allowed with changes to both Federal and State law.\n  Enactment of this bill does not impact funding for Indian programs \nand services. Congress has established separate programs and services \nfor Native Hawaiians. These programs are appropriated from accounts \nseparate from those that fund Indian programs. Moreover, the bill \nclearly states that it does not allow Native Hawaiians to participate \nin Indian programs and services.\n  Finally, gaining an understanding of a history of a culture and \npeople we are not familiar with is not an easy task. I commend Members \nof the body for doing their homework. It can be so easy to simply \ndismiss this bill as racially based, as a threat to the sovereignty of \nthe United States or as a ploy for one group to gain an undeserved \nadvantage. The harder task is a studied one. But it is the right one.\n  If I might take you back in history one more time for just a moment: \nIn the 1840s, recognizing the strategic importance of the Hawaiian \nIslands, the great maritime powers of the day--principally England, \nFrance, and the United States--jockeyed for positions of advantage, \neven as they acknowledged the islands as an independent nation. It was \na time of much international intrigue. Urged on by local British \nresidents, the commander of the British squadron in the Pacific sent an \narmed frigate to Honolulu to ``protect British interests.''\n  King Kamehameha III was forced to yield to British guns, and for 5 \nmonths the islands were placed under British rule. International \npressure, as well as personal intervention from Queen Victoria herself, \neventually forced the British Government to declare the action as \nunauthorized. On July 31, 1843, the Hawaiian flag was raised once \nagain.\n  During a service of thanksgiving held at historic Kawaiahao Church in \nHonolulu, Kamehameha III recited a phrase that has since become \nHawaii's State motto: Ua mau . . . ke ea . . . o ka aina . . . I ka \npono--the life of the land . . . is perpetuated . . . in righteousness. \nThat has always been the case, not only in Hawaii but throughout our \nNation's history.\n  The people of Hawaii are asking that we do right by Hawaii's \nindigenous peoples and enact this measure that provides Native \nHawaiians with an opportunity for self-determination and self-\ngovernance. They ask that we enact this bill because it provides a \nstructured process to finally address longstanding issues resulting \nfrom a painful moment in our history, so that we can move forward as a \nState. They ask that we enact this bill because it is just, because it \nis fair, because it is the right thing to do.\n  We are a nation of immigrants, and we celebrate our diversity every \nday at dining room tables around the country. In this grand experiment \nof democracy, we have found we can be many and yet be indivisible. The \nUnited States of America has pledged itself to liberty and justice for \nall people. This bill does that for the Native Hawaiians.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes 7 seconds remaining on the \nminority's time.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I said earlier that I think we will \nhear on the Senate floor many times during this debate about the \nenormous respect we have for our two colleagues from Hawaii and how \nmuch we would prefer not to disagree with them. I think it is fair to \nsay that this bill would not have a chance of being seriously \nconsidered on the floor if it weren't for our respect for them.\n  Despite that respect, I have to say, after hearing the Senator from \nHawaii, this bill is worse than I thought. Many of my colleagues in the \nRepublican caucus have come to me and said this is not about \nsovereignty or about race. The Senator from Hawaii made very clear that \nthis is about sovereignty. He said in his own words that this is a bill \nto create--he says ``restore''--let's just say establish--a new \ngovernment within the United States of America, and admission to that \ngovernment is based upon race. So you cannot pass this bill off and say \nit is not about sovereignty. It is about sovereignty. There is no \ndifference of opinion about that between the Senator from Hawaii and \nme.\n  He said specifically that the first objective of this legislation is \nto establish a process to establish a government which would have a \ngovernment-to-government relationship with the United States. That is a \nsovereign government composed of American citizens who would now become \npart of a new government because they might be a small percentage \nNative Hawaiian, and certain benefits would come to them. So it is \nabout sovereignty and race.\n  Why is that a problem? Let me add that the Senator from Hawaii \nreferred to this new sovereignty as their government. But we have one \ngovernment. That's why there are Americans, just like my family, which \nis Scotch-Irish American, like those of African descent who are \nAmericans, and like those of every descent who are Americans, who share \nin our government.\n  That is what is special about this country. Of course we admire our \ndiversity. What a great strength diversity is. No country is more \ndiverse. We are a land of immigrants. Out of that\n\n[[Page S5563]]\n\ngreat mix comes our strength. But there is one greater strength, and \nthat is taking all of that diversity and making one country of it.\n  How do we do that? We do it in an extraordinary way that goes all the \nway back to Valley Forge, when George Washington administered an oath \nto his officers that said:\n\n       I renounce, refuse, and abjure any allegiance or obedience \n     to the king, and I swear that I will, to the utmost of my \n     power, support, maintain, and defend the United States of \n     America.\n\n  Now, new citizens of this country have ``become Americans'' ever \nsince then by taking that same oath. In the immigration bill we passed \na couple weeks ago, we codified that oath. So every year, a half \nmillion people come here from countries such as Bangladesh, China, \nFrance, and every part of the world. They don't come to salute India or \nspeak the language of China or to adopt the principles of France. They \nrespect where they came from, and they are proud of it, but they become \nAmericans. We don't do it based on race. We don't do it based on \nancestry. We do it based upon a few principles in our founding \ndocuments. One of those is that we don't discriminate based upon race \nor ancestry, and another great principle is E pluribus unum, which this \nbill would turn upside down.\n  So this is not a bill which should be passed just because we greatly \nrespect our colleagues, which we do. But Hawaiians are Americans. \nTennesseans are Americans. Oklahomans are Americans. Hawaiians have \nbeen American citizens since 1900. In 1959, they voted 94 percent to \nbecome a State, to be Americans. When you become American, you renounce \nyour allegiance to some other government and pledge allegiance to the \nUnited States of America. If we don't do that, we take step toward \nbeing a sort of United Nations instead of a United States.\n  I hope my friends, who have looked at this bill and said: We love our \ncolleagues and this doesn't seem like a very important bill, so let's \ndo it for them, will look at the assault upon a tremendously important \nprinciple embedded in this bill. It is about sovereignty. It is about \nland and money. It is about race. It is not the same as what we did in \nAlaska. Native Hawaiians are not just another Indian tribe. We don't \ncreate Indian tribes; we recognize Indian tribes. This is not an Indian \ntribe under the language of our laws.\n  I am afraid that what has happened here is that in 1998, the Supreme \nCourt of the United States made a decision and they said Native \nHawaiians could not have an organization if the voting membership was \nbased upon being Native Hawaiian because the 15th amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution says you cannot vote based on race. So this is an \nattempt--it is a breathtaking attempt--to establish a new nation within \nthe United States of America.\n  I suppose there might be a lot of aggrieved people in the United \nStates who might like to establish a nation. This Nation isn't without \npain. We have stories from our beginning, whether it is Native \nAmericans, whether it is African Americans, whether it is Mormons who \nmay have felt mistreated, murdered in State after State, whether it is \none religion today--maybe it is Hasidic Jews or an Amish group. There \nare a great many people who, in our history, may not have been properly \ntreated. But an understanding of American history is that it is a great \nsaga of setting high goals for ourselves and then always moving toward \nthose goals. We never reach them. We say ``all men are created equal,'' \nbut we have never been. The men who wrote that owned slaves. But what \nhave we done? We have systematically, over our history, chipped away, \nmoving ahead, falling back, fighting a great Civil War, saving the \nNation, waiting another hundred years before African Americans could \nsit at a lunch counter in Nashville, always moving toward that goal. \nMost of the debates in this Senate are about establishing high goals--\npay any price for freedom, equal opportunity, E pluribus unum. Those \nare our goals, and we never reach them, but we always try for them.\n\n  What is our goal here? Our goal is that we should hope that every \nsingle citizen in this wonderful State of Hawaii be equal--if there \never were a multiethnic, diverse State, it is Hawaii. It is a wonderful \nexample of our diversity. According to the 2000 census, 40 percent of \nHawaiians are of Asian descent, 24 percent are White, 9 percent say \nthey are Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islanders, 7 percent claim to be \nHispanic, 2 percent Black. Twenty-one percent report two or more racial \nidentities. There is much diversity of which Hawaiians are proud and of \nwhich we are proud. What unites them? What unites us all is that we \nhave become Americans. We are proud of where we came from, proud of our \nancestry, but prouder to be American.\n  There may be some issues that need to be addressed. We can find ways \nto address them. There may be some wrongs that need to be righted. \nCertainly, Native Hawaiians would want to renew their culture and their \ncustoms and their language. All of us do that. I go to my family \nreunion of Scotch-Irish Presbyterians every summer. I have been to the \nItalian-American dinner here in Washington, DC. I never went to an \nevent where there was more emotion or Italianness. But the greatest \nemotion came when the Italian Americans stood up and pledged allegiance \nto the United States. They didn't have a problem saying: We are proud \nto be Italian, but we are prouder to be American. So how could we be \nseriously discussing on the floor of the Senate establishing for \n400,000 Americans who live there, I think from almost every State of \nthis country, a new government based on race to which they would be \nprivileged and the rest of us could not be a part of? That is not \nAmerican. That might be the United Nations, but it is not the United \nStates. It is not consistent in the most basic ways with the history of \nthis country.\n  So I hope that my colleagues, who have considered this legislation as \nmaybe not too important, as something that should be done primarily out \nof respect for our two distinguished friends from Hawaii, will look at \nthis carefully and not be lulled in by comments that this isn't about \nsovereignty. I think Senator Akaka was very candid and very direct when \nhe said the first objective of this bill was to establish a process to \ncreate an entity which would have a government-to-government \nrelationship with the United States.\n  Mr. President, this is a dangerous precedent. It is the reverse of \nwhat it means to be an American. We have other issues that should come \nto the floor before this. I hope colleagues will think carefully before \nmoving ahead on this piece of legislation.\n  I see the Senator from Alabama has arrived.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. \nAlexander, for his thoughtful comments on this subject and other \nrelated subjects. He taught me a phrase that he uses, which is that we \nneed to make sure everyone who grows up in this country knows what it \nmeans to be an American. To be an American is not a racial thing. An \nAmerican is a person who adopts the American ideal of equal justice \nunder law, without regard to race, religion, national origin, or any \nother matter of that kind.\n  Our Founders of this Nation were very wise in a number of important \nways. One of the most important ways was they had a clear vision of the \nNation they birthed and they saw it far into the future. They always \nconsidered the importance of principle because principle was important \nto the growth and progress of the Nation they loved for the long term. \nThey never failed to think of the impact their actions may have on the \nfuture, even the distant future of the country they birthed, the \ncountry they loved.\n  I do not believe we are as thoughtful today in that matter as we used \nto be. Too often, we make decisions based on perceived immediate needs \nor on political forces at the time or friendship or some deal we \nthought we were forced to make or needed to make at a given time; and \ntoo seldom in this busy, hectic place do we take the time to consider \nthe long-term implications of our actions on the great Republic which \nwe have been given.\n  We simply must think in the long term in a principled way as we \nconsider the Native Hawaiian legislation. It is not too much to say the \nlegislation could create a crack in the American ideal of equal rights \nand colorblind justice. This would be a huge step. It is a\n\n[[Page S5564]]\n\nstep we must not take. This Nation in its maturity and wisdom must not \nsuccumb to any balkanization of America. A great nation must set \ncrystal clear policies on these matters, crystal clear policies on this \nquestion. The Republic must firmly reject, must nip in the bud now and \nwhenever it may appear in the future, any notion of creating sovereign \ngovernments within our borders unless they meet every criteria of the \nIndian Tribe Program.\n\n  National Review said in a recent article:\n\n       You might have thought after watching the immigration \n     debate that the Senate could not be more cavalier about the \n     unity and sovereignty of the Nation. Think again. The Senate \n     is about to vote to pave the way with a bill to create a \n     race-based government which is on the verge of passing.\n\n  This bill has been around a number of years, but we have never had a \nfull debate about it. Unfortunately, many in Congress don't seem to \nfully understand yet the enormous implication of establishing what can \nreally fairly be said to be a race-based government. And further, the \nAmerican people have not been informed of the breadth and significance \nof the legislation. That is why it is good we are having the debate at \nthis time.\n  We must talk about it. We ought to let the American people know that \nthis bill would create a nation out of United States citizens. The \nterritory known as Hawaii is the epitome really of our country's great \nmelting-pot concept and has always been made up of a diverse group of \ncitizens with different racial backgrounds. They are famous for that.\n  If we pass this bill, we will divide them. The bill would result in \nthe State of Hawaii giving up substantial lands to the new nation which \nwould begin a downward spiral from an America that is based on a shared \nideal to one where race, ancestry, our nationality constitute a legally \napproved basis for segregation and really discrimination.\n  What is discrimination? Discrimination is saying you have an \nadvantage or a disadvantage based on race.\n  This legislation seeks to create an extra constitutional race-based \ngovernment of Native Hawaiians by arbitrarily labeling that race of \npeople as an Indian tribe.\n  Essentially, it seeks to create a sovereign entity out of thin air, \nsomething that the Supreme Court said as far back as 1913 cannot be \ndone. Indian tribes existed before our Constitution, before our Nation, \nin many cases, with continuity of leadership, centralized locality, and \ncultural cohesiveness. Therefore, the United States recognizes \nqualified Indian tribes as sovereign entities. Indeed, we signed \ntreaties with many of them and made promises in those treaties to \nprovide them certain degrees of sovereignty.\n  Equating Native Hawaiians with a legitimate Indian tribe is not \npossible because Native Hawaiians share none of the unique \ncharacteristics possessed by recognized tribes. Native Hawaiians never \nlived as a separate, distinct, racially exclusive community, much less \nexercise sovereignty over Hawaiian lands. They never established \norganizational or political power. They never lived under a racially \nexclusive government. All Hawaiians, regardless of race, were subjects \nto the same monarch in 1893. In other words, Native Hawaiians have \nnever exercised inherent sovereignty as a native indigenous people, as \nthe bill asserts and must assert if it were to have any chance of \nwithstanding constitutional muster.\n  Nonetheless, the bill would carve out a special exemption in the \nConstitution for these people based on race solely. A special exception \nbeing sought for Native Hawaiians is extraordinary.\n  Under the bill, there is no guarantee that members of a new \ngovernment would be subject to constitutional rights and protections, \nsuch as the first, fourth, and 15th amendments. The U.S. Constitution \nguarantees to every citizen a republican form of government, and this \nhas been defined to mean all the protections of our Constitution.\n  At a minimum, the Founding Fathers intended that a republican form of \ngovernment ensure popular rule and no monarchy, but under this bill, \nnothing guarantees these basic principles will be honored. This new \ngovernment, this new sovereignty will be free to reinstate a monarchy \nor establish any other method of government they may choose.\n  Essentially, persons who are now citizens of the United States and \nwho are now guaranteed these protections, a republican form of \ngovernment, would now be turned over to a government that is not bound \nto honor that.\n  One should not be deprived of the right to vote or be denied free \nspeech or have property taken without due process. These are deeply \nrooted principles in the United States, but they will not be guaranteed \nas part of a Native Hawaiian government. Under the bill, Congress would \nstrip United States citizens of these and other great protections they \nnow enjoy.\n  Perhaps this is why there is a lot of unease in Hawaii about this \nlegislation. Indeed, so many residents oppose it. In May of 2006, in a \ntelephone pole, 58 percent of Hawaiian residents said they opposed the \nbill. Of the respondents identifying themselves as Native Hawaiian, \nonly 56 percent said they supported it. Of the Native Hawaiians, only a \nlittle more than half said they supported it. Given this split among \neven Hawaiians, is it not surprising that 50 percent of all respondents \nsaid they want a vote on the bill before it becomes law, which is not \nprovided for in this legislation?\n  I will share a few thoughts by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. \nThey oppose the bill. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights voted \nrecently to oppose the legislation because of its concern with the \nbill's discriminatory impact.\n  The Commission is an independent Government agency tasked with the \nduty to examine and resolve issues related to race, color, religion, \nsex, age, disability, or national origin. It is composed of eight \nmembers, though currently only seven. Four are appointed by the \nPresident and four are appointed by Congress. At no time may more than \nfour members of the same party sit on the Commission.\n  Pursuant to its authority to submit reports, findings, and \nrecommendations to the Congress, the Commission released their report \nlast month on this bill recommending ``against the passage of the \nNative Hawaiians Government Reorganization Act or any other legislation \nthat would discriminate on the basis of race or national origin and \nfurther subdivide the American people into discrete subgroups accorded \nvarious degrees of privilege.''\n  That is strong language. I submit that is what the bill does. I \nsubmit that is why we should not pass it.\n  Let me repeat that. They oppose this act and any other legislation \nthat would ``discriminate on the basis of race or national origin and \nfurther subdivide the American people into discrete subgroups accorded \nvarying degrees of privilege.'' And, I would add, based on their \nnational ancestry or race.\n  ThIs report was issued after--the Commission held a hearing on \nJanuary 20, 2006, where experts--both opposing and supporting the \nbill--testified about the legislation. The Commission held the briefing \nrecord open until March 21, 2006, to receive additional comments from \nthe public. Sixteen public comments were received during the period, \nand most of the commentators wrote to express their opposition to the \nbill.\n  Interestingly, the report notes that ``While most commenters oppose \nthe legislation, the governmental and institutional commenters \nprimarily support it. The report also states that ``Many [opponents] \nargued, in very personal terms, that the proposed legislation would be \ninconsistent with basic American principles of equality, traditional \nHawaiian values, and their own personal ethics.\n  Commission Chairman Gerald A. Reynold, himself an African American, \nagreed with opponents, stating that:\n\n       I am concerned that the Akaka Bill would authorize a \n     government entity to treat people differently based on their \n     race and ethnicity . . . This runs counter to the basic \n     American value that the government should not prefer one race \n     over another.''\n\n  In a case called Rice v. Cayetano, the Supreme Court found a similar \nattempt to create a race-based classification unconstitutional. In that \ncase, the Court struck down a race-determinative voting restriction in \nHawaii as a violation of the fifteenth amendment, which bars racial \nrestrictions on voting. By a vote of 7 to 2, the Court held \nunconstitutional a system under which non-Native Hawaiians were barred \nfrom voting for or serving as\n\n[[Page S5565]]\n\ntrustees of the State's Office of Hawaiian Affairs. Finding that the \nfifteenth amendment protects the rights of Whites, Asians, Hispanics, \nand persons of other races in Hawaii just as it protects all other \nindividuals against racial discrimination, the Court stated:\n\n       One of the reasons race is treated as a forbidden \n     classification is that it demeans the dignity and worth of a \n     person to be judged by ancestry instead of by his or her own \n     merit and essential qualities. An inquiry into ancestral \n     lines is not consistent with respect based on the unique \n     personality each of us possesses, a respect the Constitution \n     itself secures in its concern for persons and citizens.\n\n  Proponents of this bill seek to circumvent this Supreme Court \ndecision by completely separating the Native Hawaiian community into \nits own sovereignty, placing it and its members outside of \nConstitutional protections. This is the only way it can be done.\n  Instead of carving Native Hawaiians out from constitutional \nprotections, and separating them from America, we must uphold \nconstitutional principles, as well as American--especially Hawaiian--\nideals, by not discriminating against anyone on account of race.\n  Our Constitution seeks to eliminate racial separatism, not promote \nit. How can we promote equality while separating our people into \ndistinct, legally-recognized racial sovereignties with more or less \nrights and still be ``one nation''?\n  Because they existed prior to the establishment of our Constitution \nand Federal Government, Native American Indian tribes have long been \nrecognized as sovereign entities--most signed treaties to that effect.\n  Tribes have never been, nor can they now be, created out of thin air \nby Congressional legislation. Instead, ``tribes'' seeking recognition \nafter statehood must adhere to a process established by the Federal \nGovernment. To be formally recognized, a tribe must demonstrate that it \nhas operated as a sovereign for the past century, was a separate and \ndistinct community, and had a preexisting political orgranization. The \nNative Hawaiian people cannot meet these criteria and have conceded \nsuch on at least one occasion. In the case that I previously mentioned, \nRice v. Cayetano, the State of Hawaii argued in its brief that:\n\n       [F]or the Indians the formerly independent sovereign entity \n     that governed them was the tribe, but for native Hawaiians, \n     their formerly independent sovereign nation was the Kingdom \n     of Hawaii, not any particular `tribe' or equivalent political \n     entity. . . . The tribal concept simply has no place in the \n     context of Hawaiian history.\n\n  Let me reiterate and further explain why Native Hawaiians cannot meet \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs' standards for tribal recognition. \nThose standards boil down to two basic requirements: one, the group \nmust be a separate and distinct community, and two, a prexisting \npolitical entity must be present.\n\n  The BIA requires a tribe to demonstrate that it represents a separate \nand distinct community. Yet, Native Hawaiians live in almost every \nstate in the Nation and have fully integrated into American society. \nNative Hawaiians do not live as a cohesive, autonomous group of people \nand have not done so at any point in history. Rather, they are fully \nimmersed in all aspects of American life. For example, almost half of \nall marriages in Hawaii are interracial. Hawaiians serve in the U.S. \nmilitary, dedicating their lives to the service of America. They are a \npart of American culture and certainly do not live separate and \ndistinct from the rest of us.\n  The BIA requires a tribe to demonstrate that it had a preexisting \npolitical organization. Yet, no political entity--whether active or \ndormant--exists in Hawaii that claims to exercise any kind of \norganizational or political power. Knowing this, the bill's advocates \nrely on findings in the bill declaring that ``Native Hawaiians'' \nexercised ``sovereignty'' over Hawaii prior to the fall of the monarchy \nin 1893, and that it is therefore appropriate for Native Hawaiians to \nexercise their ``inherent sovereignty'' again. This argument is fatally \nflawed because there was no race-based Tribal Hawaiian government in \n1893, so there is no ``Native Hawaiian'' government to be restored. \nSince the early 19th century, the Hawaiian ``people'' included many \nnative-born and naturalized subjects who were not ``Native Hawaiians'' \nin the sense of this bill--those people included Americans, Chinese, \nJapanese, Koreans, Samoans, Portuguese, Scandinavians, Scots, Germans, \nRussians, Puerto Ricans, and Greeks. All were subjects of the monarch, \nnot just those with aboriginal blood. Further, Hawaiian government, \nincluding the monarchy that existed until 1893, always employed non-\nNatives, even at the highest levels of government. Therefore, it would \nbe impossible to ``restore'' the ``Native Hawaiian'' government of \n1893--as the bill purports to do--because no such racially-\nexclusive government--or nation--ever existed.\n\n  If there ever was a time for Native Hawaiians to establish themselves \nas an Indian tribe, it has long passed. When Hawaii was considering \nstatehood, there was absolutely no push to establish any tribal \nsovereignty. In fact, 94 percent of voters supported statehood in 1959, \nand at the moment it was attained, all people living in the territory \nbecame full-fledged citizens of the United States of America. They \ndeserve every protection that our Constitution ensures.\n  There are many practical consequences of this legislation that must \nbe considered. If this bill passes, it would allow for the creation of \nHawaiian ``tribes'' in every State. This would have extreme social \nconsequences--sporadic pockets of people in almost every State would be \ngoverned differently than their neighbors and would be immune from \nState and Federal laws and taxes. The result would be a chaotic \nintermixing of different rules and regulations throughout the entire \ncountry. Native Hawaiian business owners, exempt from state and local \ntaxes, could displace non-Native Hawaiian business-owning neighbors, \ngiving them an enormous competitive advantage. Further, the bill could \nconceivably lead to complete secession from the United States. In fact, \na group of supporters, including the State of Hawaii's own Office of \nHawaiian Affairs, views this bill as a potential step towards ``total \nindependence.'' On a website operated by that agency, the following \npassage appears under a section called, ``How Will Federal Recognition \nAffect Me?''\n\n       [The bill] creates the process for the establishment of the \n     Native Hawaiian governing entity and a process for federal \n     recognition. The Native Hawaiian people may exercise their \n     right to self-determination by selecting another form of \n     government including free association or total independence.\n\n  How breathtaking is that? We simply cannot return to a government \nwhere different races of Americans are governed by different laws.\n\n  The bill itself does not require any percentage of Native Hawaiian \nblood for inclusion in the new race-based government, which could \ntherefore include someone with only ``one drop'' of native blood. \nHawaiians with significant traceable blood heritage oppose the bill, in \npart, for this very reason. Those Hawaiians with at least 50 percent \nblood quantum were given Federal assistance and lands by the Hawaiian \nHomes Commission Act of 1921, a requirement which still exists today, \nwith the only exception being for children of homesteaders with 25 \npercent blood quantum.\n  Doesn't this entire process of dividing money, property, and benefits \nbased on a person's race--the percentage of ``blood'' they have--sound \nan alarm? Yet this bill positively seeks to divide people based upon \nrace and blood--all in the name of apology and restitution.\n  What about the French who held the Louisiana territory? Should they \nbe given special benefits because we forced them into a sale?\n  We cannot go down this path. Not only would all Americans suffer if \nwe sever Native Hawaiians from our American community, but those \nindividuals who would become citizens of a Native Hawaiian sovereignty \nwould lose rights that we as Americans cherish.\n  One of the many lessons learned from the Civil War is the importance \nof national unity. Abraham Lincoln referred to the principle of \nsecession as ``one of disintegration, and [one] upon which no \ngovernment can possibly endure.''\n  We fought a war over the issue, and the question was settled for all \ntime. We are one Nation and will not be separated--whether by secession \nof a State or a racial group. Certainly we cannot promote this state-\nsanctioned racial separatism. If passed, this bill would create a \nslippery slope that could lead\n\n[[Page S5566]]\n\nto a host of pernicious possibilities for our future as a unified \nNation. In an editorial written last fall, Georgie Anne Geyer quoted \nthe eminent historian Henry Steele Commager praising the Founding \nFathers for thinking hard about the future--even the distant future. \nThey ``couldn't give a speech or write a letter without talking about \nposterity.''\n  We cannot set a precedent that would allow every racial group in \nAmerica to become its own independent sovereignty. Native Hawaiians, \njust like any other racial group in this country, are free to practice \nand promote their culture. They are free to pass down their traditions \nfrom generation to generation. America celebrates her diversity, but \nshe cannot allow her diversity to divide her citizens.\n  E Pluribus Unum--out of many, one--is fundamental to our national \ncharacter. This bill seeks to turn that fundamental principle upside \ndown and would make us many out of one.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Idaho is in the Chamber. I \nwill conclude with these thoughts. We are as Members of this Senate \nparticularly charged with thinking about the long-term future of our \nRepublic. That is how we are today in a relatively healthy condition \nbecause our forefathers thought about those matters. They thought about \nthe principles on which this Nation was founded.\n  The concept is that once an American, based on adoption of the \nAmerican ideal, you become an American regardless of your race, your \nancestry, your religion, or your national origin. That is who we are as \na people. And I submit, it is a matter of the greatest danger that we \nmove away from the classical acceptance of Indian tribes to now start \ncreating sovereign entities.\n  Sovereign means independent, to a certain degree uncontrollable by \nthe U.S. Government. Sovereign entities within our Nation based on \nrace, with people spread all over the Nation actually, being a member \nof a new government, a new government that according to the supporters \nand even the Hawaiian Web site indicates could lead to separation and \nindependence, that is not a step we ought to take. We need to nip this \nin the bud. We need to end this now. We need not go down this road.\n  I so respect my colleagues from Hawaii. They are committed to their \npeople. They understand the concerns of their citizens. They want to \nhelp them. They have a particular desire to be compassionate to the \nHawaiian people, the Native Hawaiians who have grown up on the islands \nfor many years. But I say with all due respect, in terms of the overall \nNational Government of which we are a part and the principles to which \nwe must adhere, that we should not go down the road creating an \nindependent sovereign entity based on race, as this bill would do. \nTherefore, with reluctance and great respect for my colleagues who \nsupport this legislation, I urge our Members to vote no.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I quote:\n\n       Hawaii illustrates the Nation's revolutionary message of \n     equality of opportunity for all, regardless of background, \n     color, or religion. This is the promise of Hawaii, a promise \n     for the entire Nation and, indeed, the world, that peoples of \n     different races and creeds can live together, enriching each \n     other, in harmony and democracy.\n\n  That is Lawrence H. Fuchs, Hawaii Pono, 1961, written at the time of \nstatehood.\n  Today, with that quote in mind, I rise in opposition to the Native \nHawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2006. As my colleague just \nmentioned, I respect both of my Hawaiian colleagues and the work they \nhave done to promote the culture and heritage of their native people. \nAt the same time, I must disagree with the underlying notion of this \nbill.\n  The major argument in favor of this bill is the notion that Congress \nshould create a Native Hawaiian tribe in order to treat them the same \nas American Indians and Native Alaskans. But Congress cannot simply \ncreate an Indian tribe. Only those groups of people who have long \noperated as an Indian tribe, lived as a separate and distinct \ncommunity--geographically and culturally--and have a preexisting \npolitical structure can be organized as a tribe.\n  Hawaiians could never qualify as an American Indian tribe. First, \nthey do not have the preexisting political structure. Prior to \nsecession from the Republic of Hawaii, Hawaii operated under a monarchy \nand not a tribe. Even if they were once organized in tribal \ngovernments, they have had no type of Native Hawaiian government for \nover 100 years.\n  Furthermore, in 1959, 94 percent of Hawaiians voted favorably to \napprove the Hawaii Statehood Act and become American citizens.\n  At this time, there was an understanding that Hawaii's native people \nwould not be treated as a separate racial group and that they would not \nbe transformed into an Indian tribe.\n  Second, Native Hawaiians do not have an independent and separate \ncommunity. In fact, Hawaii is one of the most integrated and blended \nsocieties in America. Hawaii is, in essence, America's great melting \npot. The creation of a Native Hawaiian race-based government entity \nwould drive a wedge into the now harmonious melting pot of the Hawaiian \nculture. This bill is asking us to pretend that a tribe existed based \non the sharing of one drop of blood. We cannot simply reorganize a \ntribe that never existed or create a new race-based government entity.\n\n  Furthermore, using Congress to create a tribe offends the very idea \nof equal protection under the law. Creating a Native Hawaiian tribe, \nespecially one with no borders, undermines our constitutional rights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The control by the majority has \nexpired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 3 \nmore minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleagues for allowing that to happen.\n  This would establish a set of laws for Native Hawaiians and another \nset of laws for non-natives, some of whom have lived on the island for \ngenerations. This division would create a wedge, in my opinion, in the \nHawaiian community. It would create two sets of laws for a group of \npeople who live in the same neighborhoods, attend the same schools, and \ngo to church together. A Native Hawaiian could be subject to one set of \nlaws while his neighbor is subject to a different set of laws. I think \nnot.\n  The legislation offends a founding principle of this Nation: that all \nmen and women are created equal--we have fought wars and struggled \nmightily down through the decades to make that happen--not men and \nwomen with Hawaiian blood are equal, and those without Hawaiian blood \nare equal. That is a confusing thought. As the Supreme Court stated, \n``In the eyes of the government, we are just one race--it is \nAmerican.''\n  It is astonishing that Congress is considering creating a race-based \ngovernment in Hawaii given the tremendous progress that this Nation has \nmade, as I have mentioned, in eliminating race as a distinguishing \ncharacteristic among its citizens. Presumptive color blindness and race \nneutrality is now at the core of our legal system and cultural \nenvironment and represents one of the most important American \nachievements of the 21st century.\n  To create a race-based government would be offensive to our Nation's \ncommitment to equal justice and the elimination of racial distinctions \nin the law. The inevitable constitutional challenge to this bill almost \ncertainly would reach the U.S. Supreme Court. We cannot simply \ncircumvent the Supreme Court's holding and strict scrutiny of race-\nbased tests.\n  The U.S. Civil Rights Commission issued a report earlier this year \nthat recommended that Congress reject this bill or any other \nlegislation that would discriminate on the basis of race or national \norigin and further subdivide the American people into subgroups \naccorded varying degrees of privilege. This bill would authorize a \ngovernment entity to treat people differently based on their race and \nethnicity. Again, this notion runs counter to the basic American value \nthat the government should not give preference to one race.\n  Our most violent internal conflicts, whether in the 1860s or the \n1960s, have revolved around efforts to eliminate the laws of racial \ndistinctions and to\n\n[[Page S5567]]\n\nencourage a culture where all citizens become comfortable as a part of \nthe American race.\n  Creating a race-based government in Hawaii would create a dangerous \nprecedent that could lead to ethnic balkanization. This is a huge step \nbackwards in our American struggle to advance civil rights and to \nensure equal protection for all Americans under the law.\n  This journey is by no means complete, but this bill halts progress in \nthat very important journey and sends an entirely contrary message--a \nmessage of racial division and racial distinction and ethnic separatism \nand of rejection of the American melting pot ideal.\n  As many of our colleagues have said, and I repeat: We so respect our \nHawaiian colleagues, our Hawaiian friends; at the same time, we must \nreject this idea that there is a separation spoken to in this law \nunique to a race or a culture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise at this moment to join Senator \nAkaka speaking in support of the measure before us this day.\n  This bill, which is long overdue, finally will have a chance for fair \nconsideration by this body. I hope this bill will finally begin the \nprocess of extending a Federal policy of self-governance to Native \nHawaiians and will repair the injustices of the past.\n  As I sat here listening to the speeches, I must candidly say that I \nwas a bit disappointed that some of my friends who oppose this measure \nhave mischaracterized the history of my State.\n  Hawaii's history, as recounted by Senator Akaka, is well-documented. \nAfter Captain James Cook arrived in Hawaii, other foreigners came to \nthe islands, often as laborers. Over the ensuing years, like other \nNative people who carried no immunities to the diseases that \naccompanied the waves of immigrants to their shores, the Native \nHawaiian population was reduced from estimates as high as several \nhundred thousand people at the time of first recorded western contact \nto a little over forty thousand. An 1854 smallpox epidemic, for \ninstance, took the lives of 6,000 people--almost 10 percent of the \npopulation at that time.\n  Along with the decimating diseases, the social and economic \nconditions of the Native Hawaiians deteriorated as well. The influence \nof non-Native Hawaiians continued to grow. On January 17, 1893, the \nHawaiian Kingdom was illegally overthrown with the assistance of the \nUnited States. The United States' involvement in the overthrow is \nthoroughly documented in a report commissioned by President Grover \nCleveland.\n  My parents and grandparents lived through Hawaii's trying times. In \nmy generation, I was raised with an understanding that the Native \nHawaiian people had been wronged. It is for this reason that I, and the \nother citizens of Hawaii, ask you to do the right thing for the Native \nHawaiian people.\n  Some of our colleagues have also questioned Congress' authority to \ndeal with Native Hawaiians. But after serving for 28 years on the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs, with approximately seventeen years as \neither the Chairman or the Vice Chairman, I am very informed of the law \nthat governs the Federal relations with the aboriginal, native people \nof the United States. As such, I want to assure everyone that Congress \npossesses the authority to pass this measure.\n  Congress' authority over Indian matters has been repeatedly affirmed \nby the United States Supreme Court. Its power is explicit in the \nConstitution. It derives from the Indian Commerce Clause, Article I, \nSection 8, clause 3, which vests Congress with the power to regulate \ncommerce with the Indian tribes. It also stems from the Treaty Clause, \nwhich authorizes the Federal Government to enter into treaties with \nother nations, as was done with various Indian tribes and the Native \nHawaiian government. Although the Constitution does not authorize the \nCongress to make treaties, this provision does authorize Congress to \naddress matters with which the treaties made pursuant to that power \npertain.\n  In addition, the Court has found that Congress' power over Indian \naffairs derives from the Property Clause, Article IV, Section 3, Clause \n2, which vests the Congress with the authority to ``dispose of and make \nall needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other \nProperty belonging to the United States.'' This provision was used by \nCongress to set aside public lands for the use of Alaska Natives and a \ncolony, established for scattered, unrelated Indians. In Hawaii, \napproximately 203,500 acres of land were similarly set aside for Native \nHawaiians.\n  And Congress' authority over Indian affairs also derives from the \nDebt Clause and, like any other national government, its inherent \nauthority that is a necessary concomitant of nationality.\n  Congress' authority is broad and plenary. The Federal policy towards \nthe aboriginal, indigenous people has not been constant nor consistent. \nBut changing Federal policy is fully within the scope of Congress' \nauthority. Congress has exercised this authority to recognize the \ninherent sovereignty of an Indian tribe, to terminate the government-\nto-government relationship between the United States and an Indian \ntribe, to establish a process for the reorganization of a tribal \ngovernment, as Congress did with the enactment of the Indian \nReorganization Act of 1934, and to restore tribes to their original \nfederally-recognized status.\n\n  In fact, after terminating the government-to-government relationship \nwith Indian tribes, Congress enacted legislation to restore the \nsovereign status of some of those tribes. Even though the Indian tribe \ndid not exercise federally-recognized sovereign authority during the \ntime its relationship with the United States was terminated, this was \nnot a barrier to an exercise of Congress' power to restore the federal \nrecognition of the native government.\n  When Congress exercises its authority in this manner, it is not \n``creating'' sovereignty nor is it ``creating'' a native government. \nNative sovereignty preexisted the formation of the United States. For \nthe purpose of carrying on government-to-government relations, the form \nof native government is irrelevant.\n  Congress established the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 to provide \na process for the reorganization of other native governments. This Act \ndoes not require that Native governments be organized as tribes. Senate \nbill 147 proposes to provide a similar process for Native Hawaiians.\n  Although Native Hawaiians are not Indians nor are they organized as \nIndian tribes, Congress is not precluded from dealing with them in the \nmanner proposed by the bill. The Constitution is a living document. The \nauthors of the Constitution intended that Congress' authority to deal \nwith Indian tribes include all aboriginal, indigenous people of the \nUnited States, including American Indians, Alaska Natives and Native \nHawaiians, wherever they were located and however they were organized.\n  The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress' authority over other \naboriginal, indigenous people of the United States, regardless of \nwhether they are ``Indians'' or organized as a ``tribe,'' as those \nterms are defined today. It is irrelevant whether the native peoples \nare located within the original territory of the United States or in \nterritory subsequently acquired, whether within or without the limits \nof a state. In pre-colonial times, the term ``Indian'' was defined to \nmean ``native'' or ``the aboriginal, indigenous people'' and the term \n``tribe'' was defined to mean ``a distinct body of people.''\n  Correspondence between James Monroe and James Madison concerning the \nconstruction of what was to become the Commerce Clause make no \nreference to Indian tribes, but they do discuss Indians. Clearly, our \nfounding fathers did not intend the term ``Indian tribes'' as used in \nthe Constitution to only extend to those pre-existing Indian tribes \nthat were dependent nations at the time of the framing of the \nConstitution. Under this interpretation, Congress would have no \nauthority.\n  As Senator Akaka relayed, the first recorded western contact with the \naboriginal indigenous people of Hawaii was the arrival of Captain James \nCook in 1778. While recording his encounters with Native Hawaiians, \nCaptain Cook referred to Native Hawaiians as ``Indians.'' His accounts \nreported that the Native Hawaiians ``lived in a highly organized, self-\nsufficient, subsistent social system based on a communal land\n\n[[Page S5568]]\n\ntenure with a sophisticated language, culture, and religion.'' In other \nwords, Native Hawaiians were a distinct body of people.\n  The Court has upheld Congress' exercise of its broad, plenary \nauthority to recognize Indian tribes who were and are not Indians nor \nwere they organized as tribes at the time that Federal recognition was \nextended to them. For instance, the Court affirmed Congress' \nrecognition of an Indian tribe that consisted of scattered, unrelated \nindividual Indians, who were forced onto a reservation or colony. Even \nafter the Supreme Court questioned whether the Pueblos of New Mexico \nwere Indians and found that they were not organized as tribes, the \nSupreme Court upheld Congress' exercise of authority to recognize and \ntreat Pueblos as Indian tribes. Despite numerous opportunities to do \nso, the Supreme Court has not questioned Congress' authority to treat \nAlaska Natives as Indian tribes.\n  Whether the reference was to ``Indians'' or ``Indian tribes,'' the \nFramers of the Constitution did not intend those terms to limit \nCongress' authority, but rather intended those terms as descriptions of \nthe native people who occupied and possessed the lands that were later \nto become the United States. When the Constitution was drafted, they \nauthorized the Federal government to enter into treaties with the \nIndian tribes because they were considered independent sovereigns, not \ndependent nations.\n  Any other interpretation would mean that Congress has been acting \nillegally since the formation of the Union and that the Supreme Court \nhas wrongly decided the scope of Congress' authority.\n  The legal basis for the distinct status of the indigenous, native \npeople is their sovereignty, which preexisted the formation of our \ncountry, over lands that became the United States.\n\n  This sovereignty is not created by Congress. This sovereignty did not \nneed to be retained through treaties with the Federal government. \nTreaties are a mechanism for recognizing the inherent sovereignty of \nanother government.\n  Like the other Federally recognized Indian tribes, Native Hawaiians \nare a distinct body of aboriginal, indigenous people who exercised \nsovereignty over land that is now the United States. Like other Native \ngroups, the Federal government has a unique responsibility for Native \nHawaiians. On November 23, 1993, the United States apologized for its \nrole in the overthrow, acknowledged the historical significance of the \noverthrow and the suppression of the inherent sovereignty of the Native \nHawaiian people, and committed to provide a foundation for \nreconciliation between the United States and the Native Hawaiian \npeople. As such, Congress has assumed a special relationship with them.\n  Giving effect to the special relationship between the federal \ngovernment and the native peoples is not racially discriminatory. The \nSupreme Court has sustained Congress' action towards Indian tribes as \nconstitutionally valid as long as our actions are reasonable and \nrationally designed to further self-government and to fulfill our \nunique obligation towards them.\n  Between 1826 and 1887, the United States entered into treaties with \nthe Native Hawaiian government. In 1893, we assisted in the illegal \noverthrow of their government and extinguished the government-to-\ngovernment relationship between the United States and the Native \nHawaiian government. Now, we propose to establish a process that may \nlead to the restoration of a Federal relationship with a Native \nHawaiian governing entity. This bill will authorize Native Hawaiians' \nwith more autonomy to undertake activities that they believe will \nbetter their conditions and meet their other needs in the manner that \nthey deem best. It fulfills the Federal government's unique obligation \ntowards Native Hawaiians. As such, it is not racially discriminatory.\n  Some have suggested that the Supreme Court, in Rice v. Cayetano, has \nruled that the Congress does not have the authority to enact this bill.\n  This is incorrect.\n  In 1978, the citizens of Hawaii convened a constitutional convention \nand proposed amendments to the State's constitution to afford Native \nHawaiians a means by which to express their right to self-governance \nand self-determination. They did so by creating the Office of Hawaiian \nAffairs, which is governed by a Board of Trustees. Because this was \nintended to be the State counterpart to the Federal policy of extending \nself-governance and self-determination to the aboriginal, indigenous \npeople, the citizens of Hawaii limited eligibility to vote for the \nOffice of Hawaiian Affairs trustees to Native Hawaiians.\n  The Office of Hawaiian Affairs is, however, a State agency. Thus, \nwhen the Court considered this matter, it ruled that the voter \neligibility requirement violated the Fifteenth Amendment as a State may \nnot disenfranchise voters by limiting voter eligibility for a State \nagency to one group of people. The Court expressly refused to address \nwhether Congress had the authority to treat Native Hawaiians as Indian \ntribes. In passing, however, the Court mentioned that if the issue were \nbefore the Court, it would look to whether Congress has treated Native \nHawaiians in the same manner as it has treated Indian tribes.\n  Congress has done that.\n  Hawaii became a territory of the United States in 1900 yet by 1910, \nCongress began treating Native Hawaiians as Indians when it \nappropriated funds for the ethnological research of American Indians \nand Native Hawaiians.\n  In 1921, after receiving testimony from the then Secretary of the \nDepartment of Interior who testified that the Native Hawaiians were our \nwards and ``for whom in a sense we are trustees . . .,'' and who \nexplained that Congress had the right to use the same authority for \ndealing with Indians to set aside lands for Native Hawaiians, Congress \ndid just that. Congress set aside land for Native Hawaiians as part of \nits trust responsibility to them.\n  In 1938, Congress recognized certain Native Hawaiian fishing rights \nin Hawaii National Park, in a manner similar to Congress' recognition \nof retained tribal hunting, fishing, and gathering rights in some \nnational parks.\n  In the 1950s, Congress was terminating its government-to-government \nrelationship with some Indian tribes and delegating some of its \nauthority over Indian affairs to the various States, through such laws \nas Public Law 83-280, which delegated certain Federal authority of \nIndian affairs to some States. At this time, Hawaii was seeking to \nbecome the fiftieth State. Consequently, Hawaii's admission to the \nUnion was conditioned on its administration of the public trust \nestablished pursuant to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act.\n\n  In 1972, a Native Hawaiian employment preference was enacted in the \nsame manner that Congress enacted Indian preference laws. The Indian \npreference law was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court as \nconstitutionally sound and consistent with laws designed to preclude \ndiscrimination in the workplace.\n  Notably, this was the same year that the Equal Employment \nOpportunities Act of 1972, which prohibited discrimination in the \nworkplace, was enacted into law. I mention this for a reason. Congress \nis an intelligent, thoughtful body. It is highly unlikely that Congress \nwould have adopted one law prohibiting discrimination in the workplace \nwhile at the same time enacting a Native Hawaiian employment \npreference, unless Native Hawaiians were exempt from the broader bill \nbecause Congress treats them in the same manner that Congress treats \nIndian tribes.\n  Only two years after the United States Supreme Court held that Indian \npreference laws were not racially discriminatory because of Congress \nunique responsibility towards Indian tribes, a second Native Hawaiian \nemployment preference law was enacted. Clearly, Congress considered \nNative Hawaiians as having the same status as Indian tribes.\n  There are many more laws like these but I will not list all of them. \nIn total, however, over 160 laws concerning Native Hawaiians have been \nenacted into law. Within the last five years, we have enacted \nadditional laws, including laws that have legislatively reaffirmed our \ntrust relationship with Native Hawaiians. Under the theory of those \nopposing the bill, all of these laws are illegal.\n  Although Senator Akaka explained the process established by the bill \nin detail, I want to briefly reiterate some of his comments. This bill \nestablishes a\n\n[[Page S5569]]\n\nprocess for the reorganization of a Native Hawaiian governing entity. \nThe process is similar to processes established for the recognition of \nother aboriginal, indigenous people.\n  Upon enactment of the bill, a Commission will be created to determine \nwhether those who voluntarily choose to participate in the Native \nHawaiian governing entity meet the eligibility criteria. The Commission \nwill prepare a roll, which the Secretary must certify. An Interim \nGoverning Council will be established with no powers except to prepare \norganic governing documents for the approval of those listed on the \ncertified roll. Once this has been approved by the membership, it must \nbe certified by the Secretary of the Department of the Interior.\n  If, and when, the Secretary certifies the organic governing \ndocuments, elections for Native Hawaiian government officials must be \nheld in accordance with the organic governing documents. At this point, \nthe Native Hawaiian governing entity still has no power. Instead, the \nNative Hawaiian governing entity must negotiate with the State of \nHawaii and the Federal government for any powers and authority as well \nas other rights.\n  This will be a long, thorough process that will take years to \ncomplete. And this will not be the last time that the Congress will \nhave an opportunity to address the power and authorities of the Native \nHawaiian governing entity. Bills will need to be introduced in the \nCongress for the enactment of implementing legislation. They will be \nreferred to the relevant committees of jurisdiction of each House. \nThere will be votes in each body to approve implementing legislation \nand the President will have to sign such legislation into law.\n  A similar process will be required for changes to State law. The \ncitizens of Hawaii, through their State representatives, will have an \nopportunity to be involved in any changes in State law. Any changes to \nthe State's constitution must be submitted to the voters of the State.\n  Before closing, I want to address some misconceptions regarding this \nmeasure and clearly inform my colleagues about what this bill does and \ndoes not provide.\n  This bill does not create sovereignty or extend Federal recognition \nto the Native Hawaiian governing entity upon passage of this bill. \nInstead this bill establishes the process that I outlined. As I \ndiscussed earlier, any sovereignty by the Native Hawaiian governing \nentity, if and when it is recognized, is inherent and preexisted \nHawaii's inclusion into the Union.\n  Any governmental powers and authority that the Native Hawaiian \ngoverning entity will exercise must be negotiated with the Federal and \nState governments.\n  This bill does not extend jurisdiction to the Native Hawaiian \ngoverning entity over non-Native Hawaiians. Any jurisdictional \nauthority must be negotiated between the Native Hawaiian governing \nentity, the State of Hawaii, and the Federal government.\n\n  Any jurisdiction that may be granted through the negotiations will be \nwithin the boundaries of the State of Hawaii, not over the United \nStates. Critics of the bill confuse the eligibility roll with the \npotential jurisdiction of the governing entity. Like other native \ngovernments in the United States, anyone meeting the eligibility \ncriteria defined in the bill or the organic governing documents, \nregardless of where they live, are eligible for membership in the \ngoverning entity.\n  The bill prohibits the application of the Indian Gaming Regulatory \nAct, which is the only Federal authority for the exercise of gaming by \nIndian tribes. Additionally, the State of Hawaii is one of only two \nstates that criminally prohibits gaming.\n  The bill expressly provides that Native Hawaiians will not be \neligible for Indian or Alaska Native programs. It is unnecessary to \ninclude Native Hawaiians in other programs as Congress has already \nestablished programs specifically for them.\n  The cost of the bill is minimal. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that the bill will cost $1 million for fiscal years 2006 \nthrough 2008, and less than $500,000 per year thereafter. The Committee \non Indian Affairs has also been informed that the enactment of this \nbill will not affect direct spending or revenues.\n  I want to make it clear to all of my colleagues that this bill does \nnot propose anything that we have not already done for Indian tribes. \nYears ago, Congress recognized that it has a trust obligation to the \nNative Hawaiians. Congress has treated Native Hawaiians in the same \nmanner as it has dealt with Indian tribes. It is time that Congress \nformally extends its policy of self-government and self-determination \nto Native Hawaiians.\n  Mr. President, I want my colleagues to know that this bill will unite \nHawaii. Senate bill 147, already has the broad support of both \nRepublicans and Democrats in Hawaii. It is now time to reach out and \ncorrect the wrong that was committed so many years ago. I hope that my \ncolleagues will also provide their support by voting for this bill.\n  As a member of the territorial senate at the time of statehood, and \nas former majority leader of the house, I was privileged to be involved \nin discussions and decisions reached between the Government of the \nUnited States and the government of the territory of Hawaii. Moreover, \nas our State's first Member of Congress, I was actively involved in the \ndiscussions and agreements between the Government of the United States \nand the government of the State of Hawaii.\n  My parents and my grandparents lived in Hawaii through Hawaii's \ntrying times. My grandparents were immigrants from Japan. In my \ngeneration, I was raised with an understanding that the Native Hawaiian \npeople had been wronged. This is a part of history that very few of my \nconstituents are fully aware of. But my mother, when she was at the age \nof 4, lost her father who was working in the fields of the plantation. \nShe had lost her mother at the time of childbirth, so she found herself \nan orphan at a very early age. But fortunately, a Native Hawaiian \ncouple learned about this, came forward to the plantation village, and \ntook her by the hand and adopted her. And for years she lived as a \nHawaiian with the Hawaiian family, and she never forgot that.\n  For many reasons, including that, I and other citizens of the State \nof Hawaii ask all of my colleagues here to do the right thing for the \nNative Hawaiian people. Some of our colleagues have questioned \nCongress's authority to deal with Native Hawaiians, but after serving \nfor 28 years on the Committee on Indian Affairs and approximately 17 \nyears as either the chair or the vice chair, I believe most humbly that \nI am sufficiently informed of the law that governs the Federal \nrelations with the aboriginal native people of the United States. There \nis no question that Native Hawaiians are aboriginal, and they are \nnative and indigenous. They were there before the first White man came. \nThey were there before the first Americans came.\n  Based on my decades of study and experience, I would like to assure \nmy colleagues that Congress does possess the authority to pass this \nmeasure.\n  We speak of the special relationship between the Federal Government \nand the native peoples, and some have suggested that this was racially \ndiscriminatory.\n  Mr. President, history shows that Native Hawaiians are good and \npatriotic Americans. The people of Hawaii are good and patriotic \nAmericans. If you look at the records of World War II and all the wars \nthereafter, including the present one in Iraq, you will find a \ndisproportionately large number of men and women from Hawaii serving in \nuniform and standing in harm's way for the people of the United States. \nIn fact, for this small, little State, with about the smallest \npopulation, we have more Medals of Honor on a per capita basis than any \nother State. Our government recognizes the patriotism of Native \nHawaiians and the people of Hawaii. In fact, the first Native Hawaiian \nin the Vietnam war to receive the Medal of Honor was--yes--a Native \nHawaiian, and he was one of the first in the Nation to do so. They are \ngood American citizens.\n  This bill, even if it becomes the ultimate law of this land, will not \nchange the situation. Native Hawaiians will be subject to every \nprovision in the Constitution of the United States. That is the fact. \nThey will be subject to the laws of the State of Hawaii and the United \nStates. They will be subject to\n\n[[Page S5570]]\n\nthe laws of the county of Hawaii. If any changes are made--for example, \nif we decide, as we did with many Indian nations, to give them the \npower to arrest--if someone goes speeding through the streets--that \npower has to be negotiated and granted by the supersovereign, the \ncounty to the Indian tribe. It does not come naturally.\n  The Native Hawaiian government, if you want to call it such, will not \nhave the authority to establish its own army. It will not have the \nauthority to coin its own currency. Yes, they can set up businesses, \nestablish schools if they wish to, but they will never, under this \nbill, pass any measure that will be in contravention with the \nConstitution of the United States or the laws of the United States.\n  This bill does not secede the State of Hawaii or any part thereof \nfrom the United States. The lands that we speak of are lands that have \nbeen set aside, not by us, but by the Government of the United States \nin 1920. In 1920, the Members of Congress, without the urging of Native \nHawaiians, without the urging of the people of Hawaii, finally came to \ntheir senses and realized that the takeover had been illegal, and that \nNative Hawaiians were indigenous, aboriginal people of the territory of \nHawaii at that time.\n  So, on their own initiative, this Congress established a law to set \naside lands which they called the homestead lands. And those qualified, \n50 percent Hawaiian blood, were placed on these lands. It is still \nthere, and Native Hawaiians still live in those places. If they ever \nhave this law in the books, these lands will become the land base of \nthis new entity.\n  They are not taking away anything from the people of Hawaii. They are \nnot taking away anything from the Government of the United States. They \nwill continue to pay taxes. They will continue to put on the uniform of \nthe United States. They will continue to stand in harm's way.\n\n  I want Congress to know that, if anything, this bill will unite the \npeople of Hawaii. This bill has the broad support of Republicans and \nDemocrats in the State. Somewhere in this gallery is the Governor of \nHawaii, the Honorable Linda Lingle. And she is a Republican. She \nsupports this measure.\n  The counties of Hawaii, every one them--Oahu, Kauai, Maui and \nHawaii--would support this measure. The State of Hawaii legislature, \nthe House and the Senate, unanimously support this measure.\n  We have heard results of polls. We are politicians. We know all about \npolls. I can set up a poll myself and suggest that 99 percent of the \npeople of Hawaii support the war in Iraq, and we know that is wrong. \nYes, we can set up our own polls.\n  But I can tell you the legislature supports it, the county \ngovernments support it, the Governor does, and all Members of the \ncongressional delegation. I don't know why people would say that the \npeople of Hawaii do not support this measure.\n  I think it is about time that we reach out and correct the wrong that \nwas committed in 1893. Yes, at that time the representative of the \npeople of the United States directed a marine company on an American \nship to land and take over the government. They imprisoned our queen. \nNo crime had been committed. When the new government took over and \nturned itself over to the government of the United States and said, \nPlease take us in, the President of the United States was President \nCleveland at that time. He sent his envoy to Hawaii to look over the \ncase. When he learned that the takeover had been illegal, he said this \nwas an un-American act and we will not take over. The queen is free.\n  I am a proud American. I am glad that we are part of the United \nStates of America. Senator Akaka and I took part in World War II. We \nput on the uniform. He served in the Pacific. I served in Europe. We \nwould do it again. I know our people will do it again.\n  I wish to discuss the report on the Native Hawaiian Government \nReorganization Act which was released by the United States Commission \non Civil Rights on May 4, 2006 and the ill-founded reliance on the \nreport by some of my colleagues. It is important to note that the \nmeasure before us is supported by leading civil rights organizations, \nsuch as the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and the National \nCongress of American Indians. There are many more but in the interest \nof time, I will only note that I am more than willing to provide any \nMember with a more detailed list of leading civil rights organizational \nsupport for this measure.\n  With respect to the Commission's report, I urge my colleagues to \nthoroughly examine the report and the proceedings leading to it. I say \nthis because the majority's report lacks credibility--both procedurally \nand substantively. I am confident that once my colleagues learn of the \nserious procedural and substantive flaws of the report, they will join \nme in rejecting the Commission's report and supporting S. 147, the \nNative Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2006.\n  The first point that my colleagues need to consider is that this \nreport is not even based on the measure that will be before us. During \nthe Commission's January briefing, the Commissioners were provided with \na copy of the Substitute Amendment that was publicly available since \nlast fall and that Senator Akaka recently introduced as a separate \nmeasure. It is this language on which we will vote. Yet, even though \nthe Commission was informed of this, the Commission based its \nrecommendation on the bill ``as reported out of committee on May 16, \n2005,'' which is substantially different from the substitute amendment.\n  Perhaps some think this was an oversight on behalf of the Commission \nbut I assure you--it was not. During the Commission's May 4, 2006 \nmeeting, Commissioner Taylor specifically asked to which version of the \nbill this report referred. After a discussion on the record in which it \nwas readily apparent that the Commissioners had no idea which version \nthe report was referring to, the Commission had to recess for 10 \nminutes so that staff could determine to which version the report was \nreferencing. Then, after calling the meeting back to order, the \nCommission stated that the report pertained to the version as reported \nby the Committee on Indian Affairs, ignoring entirely the substitute \namendment, which they had been informed would be the measure considered \nby the Senate.\n  Perhaps some may be thinking--what difference does it make? Let me \nassure you, the differences between the version reported by the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs and the substitute amendment are \nsubstantively different. In fact, the measure that will be before us \nreflects several weeks of negotiation between the administration and \ncongressional Members to address concerns raised by the administration.\n  Before moving on to the substantive flaws of the Commission's report, \nI want to point out that one Commissioner filed an amicus brief in Rice \nv. Cayetano without ever publicly disclosing that involvement or \nrecusing herself from the Commission's proceedings. Apparently, actions \nlike these are par for the course for this Commission. It is actions \nsimilar to these that led to the recent findings of the Government \nAccountability Office that the Commission lacked procedures to ensure \nobjectivity in its reports.\n  The Commission's majority report also suffers from serious \nsubstantive flaws. Unlike the careful, thoughtful analyses contained in \nthe dissenting opinions, the majority report is devoid of any analysis \nof the underlying bill or arguments. Instead, the so-called ``report'' \nis merely a summary of the briefing held in January, a one sentence \nrecommendation, and copies of the written testimonies provided during \nthe January briefing. It is nothing more than ``he said this and she \nsaid that.'' Nothing in this document explains why one argument was \nrejected and another one accepted. I believe it is because the \ncommissioners know what we know--the law is on our side.\n  Although this is apparently consistent with the way this Commission \ndoes business, it is unacceptable. The Government Accountability Office \nissued a report last week specific to the Commission and recommended \nthat the Commission should strengthen its quality assurance policies \nand make better use of its State Advisory Committees. More \nspecifically, the Government Accountability Office found that the \nCommission lacked policies for ensuring that its reports are objective. \nIt also found that the Commission lacks accountability for some \ndecisions made in its reports because it lacks documentation for its \ndecisions. A review of\n\n[[Page S5571]]\n\nthe Commission's report on Native Hawaiians illustrates that this lack \nof accountability is clearly evident in this instance, for the \nCommission provides no rationale for its finding on S. 147.\n\n  Another flaw with the Commission's recent report is that the \nCommission ignored two previous reports on related issues by the Hawaii \nState Advisory Committee. The Government Accountability Office \nacknowledged that the State Advisory Committees are the eyes and ears \nof the Commission. It also found that while the Commission does not \nhave policies to ensure objectivity for its own documents, the \nCommission does have quality assurance policies in place for State \nAdvisory Committee products, including a policy to incorporate \nbalanced, varied, and opposing perspectives in their hearings and \nreports. The Hawaii State Advisory Committee heard from numerous \nwitnesses and spent substantial time preparing two articulate, balanced \nreports on Native Hawaiian issues relevant to the measure before us. \nYet the Commission ignored these reports. Imagine reports from the \nState Advisory Committee in your respective State--the entity with the \nmost knowledge of local issues, that is the entity most in touch with \nthe local communities, and that has quality assurance policies--not \neven being consulted or informed about a briefing on an issue that only \nimpacts your State.\n  Because the Commission's recommendation was based on a version of the \nbill that is not before us, is void of any analysis and is not \nsupported by Supreme Court case law, it is difficult to address any \narguments that may have influenced the Commission's decisions. Thus, I \nwill take this opportunity to clarify some misconceptions that some of \nthe Commissioners appear to possess.\n  First, this matter is not race-based as the Commission's \nrecommendation implies. Instead, the Commission appears to have a \nfundamental misunderstanding of Federal Indian law. It is undisputed \nthat the Supreme Court has upheld Congress's plenary authority over \nIndian tribes, including those aboriginal, indigenous peoples who \nexercised control over land that comprise the United States even if \nthose peoples were not called Indians, were not organized as tribes, \nand did not have a government at that time.\n  I am confident that if challenged, this measure will be upheld. For \nas then Attorney John Roberts, now Chief Justice Roberts, stated during \noral argument in Rice v. Cayetano, ``The Framers, when they used the \nword Indian, meant any of the Native inhabitants of the new-found \nland'' and that Congress's ``power does, in fact, extend to Indians who \nare not members of a tribe.''\n  Second, it is absurd that there are some who think that because \nCongress delegated some authority to the Secretary of the Department of \nthe Interior to develop regulations to administratively recognize a \ngroup of people as an Indian tribe, Congress's power to exercise its \nown authority is now bound by those regulations. Let me remind \neveryone--the Congress is not subject to an agency's regulations. \nCongress still possesses the power to restore recognition to an Indian \ntribe and we have used this authority repeatedly without first \ndetermining whether a group met the criteria set forth in the \nSecretary's regulation.\n  I thank the Chair for allowing me this opportunity to educate my \ncolleagues about the true impact of the Commission's report on this \nmatter. I encourage my colleagues to examine the transcript of the \nJanuary briefing and the May meeting, the report with the dissenting \nopinions, as well as the recent Government Accountability Office Report \non the Commission. I am confident that after doing so, my colleagues \nwill understand that any reliance on this report is misguided.\n  Mr. President, as Congress has done for many other Indian tribes, \nthis measure merely sets up a process to formally extend the Federal \npolicy of self-governance and self-determination to Native Hawaiians. \nThis bill is about fairness and justice for Native Hawaiians--Native \nHawaiians will finally be afforded the same respect that the Federal \nGovernment affords to other Native Americans. Given that Congress has \nalready enacted over 160 Federal laws for the benefit of Native \nHawaiians, there will be no harm to other Native Americans and equally \nimportant, there will be no negative effects on the other citizens of \nHawaii.\n  There are some who claim that this bill is race-based and will divide \nHawaii because of race-based preferences stemming from this measure. \nThis is not true. This bill is not based on race and those who make \nthis claim do not understand the people or history of Hawaii. As I \nsaid, in 1893, the United States participated in the illegal overthrow \nof the Kingdom of Hawaii, which resulted in longstanding issues in \nHawaii that need to be addressed. This measure will ensure those issues \nare addressed fairly and equitably. It is because this measure starts \nthe process of healing old wounds and bringing all of Hawaii's citizens \ntogether that the vast majority of Hawaii's citizens support passage of \nthis bill.\n  I ask my colleagues to ignore the rhetoric and to look at the facts: \nThe entire Hawaii Congressional delegation supports, and is actively \nworking on, passage of this bill. Our distinguished colleagues in the \nHouse, Congressmen Abercrombie and Case, have introduced a companion \nmeasure, and both testified before the Senate Committee on Indian \nAffairs in support of this bill and its importance to Hawaii. As \nCongressman Case stated, this bill is ``the most vital single piece of \nlegislation for our Hawaii since Statehood.''\n  Hawaii's Republican Governor supports the bill and has stated that \n``this bill will be a unifying force in Hawaii'' and that it is ``vital \nto the continued character of the State of Hawaii.'' Both Hawaii's \nState House and Senate have repeatedly and overwhelmingly approved a \nresolution in support of this bill. We were elected by Hawaii's \ncitizens to represent their interests and we believe that this measure \nis in their best interests. We would not support a bill that would \nracially divide the people who elected us into office. Trust that we \nhave the best interests of all of Hawaii's citizens in mind.\n  Beyond Hawaii's elected officials, Hawaii's two largest newspapers \nhave written editorials in support of passage of this bill or \ncondemning allegations that this bill is racially discriminatory. The \nHonolulu Advertiser recently stated ``this measure forges a middle \npath, the most reasonable course toward resolution--if only Congress \nwould give it a shot.'' The people of Hawaii support it because, as the \nAdvertiser recognized, ``Federal recognition would help chart a course \nfor the difficult but necessary process of resolving festering disputes \nand in healing the breach caused by the overthrow of the Hawaiian \nmonarchy.''\n  Hawaii's business community, including the two largest banks, support \npassage of this bill. The vast majority of Hawaii's citizens support \npassage of this bill. Given this diverse and broad level of support, I \ndo not understand how any of my colleagues can oppose passage of this \nmeasure by claiming that it will divide Hawaii based on race.\n  Instead, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure \nas it is the fair, just thing to do and all of Hawaii's citizens will \nbenefit from this measure when the longstanding issues will be finally \nbe put to rest. Without this measure, without your support, those \nissues will remain unresolved.\n  Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, S. 147 does nothing \nmore than to establish a process to formally extend the same Federal \npolicy of self-governance and self-determination that has been extended \nto other Native Americans to Native Hawaiians. When one looks at the \nimpact that this policy has had on other Native Americans, it is clear \nthat this policy will benefit not only Native Hawaiians but also all of \nHawaii's citizens.\n  Since the 1970s, the Federal Government has had a policy of self-\ndetermination and self-governance for Native peoples. The success of \nthis policy has been demonstrated over and over and it is not stopping. \nEvery day, we see improvements in native communities as a result of \nthis policy. Every day, we see State and local communities benefiting \nfrom Native Americans exercising self-governance. It is time that \nNative Hawaiians, and Hawaii, also benefit from this policy.\n  While Native Hawaiians are not Indians nor is there Indian Country in \nHawaii--nor will there be with passage of this measure--the experience \nof other Native Americans since the Federal\n\n[[Page S5572]]\n\nGovernment adopted a policy of self-governance for Indian tribes is \ninformative. Since implementation of the Federal policy of self-\ndetermination, other Native Americans have seen a revitalization in \ntheir native languages and culture. Because of this policy, other \nNative Americans have experienced higher educational achievement, \nstronger economies, better mental and physical health and less reliance \non social programs. Although other Native Americans still have a long \nway to go, the policy of self-governance and self-determination has \nrepeatedly been called the most successful Federal policy for Native \nAmericans. I am confident that Native Hawaiians will have a similar \nexperience and that all of Hawaii's citizens will receive benefits.\n  Self-governance is critical to maintaining Native Hawaiian culture, \nlanguage and identity. Native Hawaiians were affected by the various \nFederal policies the United States had towards Indian tribes. So like \nother Native Americans, Native Hawaiians were prohibited from speaking \ntheir native language and practicing their culture. Native Hawaiians \nexperience similar social characteristics--often ranking the highest in \nthe least desirable categories and the lowest in the most desirable \ncategories. They suffer from some of the highest rates of obesity, \ndiabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and other health \ndisparities. They experience the highest rates of poverty in the State \nof Hawaii and have some of the lowest educational achievement. Native \nHawaiian youth suffer from high rates of depression and are more likely \nto attempt suicide than other youth in Hawaii. Although it will not \nhappen overnight, Native Hawaiian self-governance will reverse these \ntrends. Testimony before the Indian Affairs Committee indicated a link \nbetween teen suicide and depression and the lack of language and \nculture in other native communities. Testimony also indicated that when \nIndian tribes exercise self-governance and take steps to regain or \nincorporate their language and culture into everyday life, mental \nhealth issues decrease.\n  Preserving and revitalizing native language, culture and identity \nleads to stronger personal identity and cultural awareness. Native \nself-governance will lead to culturally appropriate physical and mental \nhealth programs, as well as more relevant education curriculum, for \nNative individuals. This, in turn, will lead to better health, higher \nacademic achievement, strong native leadership, increased employment, \nless poverty and decreased dependence on Federal and State social \nprograms. Self-governance will ensure that Native Hawaiians retain \ntheir dignity.\n  Consequently, all people of Hawaii will benefit. Decreased reliance \non social programs, fewer children needing remedial education, and more \npreventative, culturally appropriate health programs will result in \nless funding needs over the long term. But this is not all. Hawaii is \nalready full of rich, diverse cultures which are celebrated throughout \nthe year but, with this measure, all of Hawaii will be able to \ncelebrate an ever stronger native culture. Non-natives will learn more \nabout the islands based on the traditional knowledge of Native \nHawaiians gained over centuries of island occupation. Higher achieving \nchildren will no longer have to wait for their counterparts to catch \nup. Instead of remedial education classes, there will be more rigorous, \nchallenging classes for our youth. Visitors already come to Hawaii to \nadmire and appreciate the unique Hawaiian culture; with this measure, I \nam confident even more will come to experience the stronger, richer \nNative Hawaiian culture.\n  I invite all of my colleagues to Hawaii to experience our unique \nculture, diversity and spirit of aloha. This bill will enhance Native \nHawaiian self-governance while benefiting all of Hawaii's citizens. \nThis is why I am proud to cosponsor this legislation. This is why our \ndistinguished House colleagues, Congressmen Abercrombie and Case have \nintroduced a companion measure. I respectfully urge my colleagues to \nhelp Hawaii by supporting S. 147.\n  I just hope my colleagues will not look upon Native Hawaiians as \nthose who are trying to get out of the United States. They are not. We \nare just trying to tell them: Yes, we recognize the wrong we have \ncommitted. Therefore, use the lands that we have provided you. Set up a \ngovernment. But this is what you may do. You may set up your schools, \nyou may set up businesses. What is wrong with that? We are not asking \nto establish a government in there that will put up a fence and keep \neveryone out. That government will not establish an army to attack us.\n  This is the American thing to do; the least we can do. And, \nincidentally, the National Congress of American Indians, representing \nthe Indian nations of this Nation, support this measure. Alaskan \nnatives, Eskimos, support this measure.\n  Granted, there are those who oppose this measure. But I just hope \nthat they will look into their hearts and look into the hearts of \nNative Hawaiians. They are good people. They just want to know that \nsomeday they can tell their grandchildren the wrong that was committed \nin 1830 has been rectified.\n  I am certain my colleagues will do so. I thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank my dear colleague from Hawaii, the \nsenior Senator, who has spoken from the heart about our bill and about \nwhat it means to our people in Hawaii, the unity of support that is \nthere in Hawaii and also the support that is here nationally.\n  He mentioned NCAI, the National Congress of American Indians. He \nmentioned the AFN, the Alaska Federation of Natives. Also, the American \nBar Association has supported our bill. These are national \norganizations that have studied it and have considered this bill to be \nworthwhile.\n  As I mentioned in my statement, this bill has been reviewed by the \nDepartments of Justice and the Interior, the White House and the \nadministration. They have made clarifications that we will include in \nour amendments and in our substitute amendment.\n  This is a bill that does not have anything to do with starting a \ngovernment that would be able to do what it wants. This governing \nentity will be structured so that it can deal with the problems of the \nHawaiian people and will give them a seat at the table. It will give \nthem an opportunity to negotiate whatever they decide.\n  I should tell you, those who have spoken in opposition to this bill \nare good friends that we respect--and we will continue to do that--who \nhave other reasons to oppose our bill. I do respect them very deeply. \nBut our bill is one that will help the Hawaiians to deal with their \nconcerns. When it was stated that I had mentioned that they could \nsecede, the question that was asked me was whether that could happen. I \npointed out that to secede, the Hawaiians would have to take it to this \ngoverning entity and this entity would decide whether they should take \nthis to be negotiated with the State government and then with the \nFederal Government.\n  Let's say they do decide to secede as an entity. I don't think the \nState government, with the State laws, would agree to that. It has to \nbe negotiated.\n  And let's say if--and I know it won't happen--the State of Hawaii \nagrees to that. Then it has to go to the Federal Government. So this is \nall within the law.\n  I have spoken to those in Hawaii who want Hawaii to be independent. I \nhave told them you can use the governing entity to discuss it. This is \nwhat I meant. They can bring these issues to the governing entity and \nthe governing entity will make a decision as to independence or \nreturning to the monarchy. But all of this would be within the law of \nthe United States, as mentioned by my senior Senator. It will be within \nthe Constitution of the United States. But this gives the Hawaiians a \ngoverning entity to deal with their concerns and negotiate them on the \nState level as well as the Federal level.\n  Also, in the substitute amendments that we will be offering, it does \nhave the clarifications from the administration as well.\n  So I rise to urge my colleagues to permit us to bring it to the \nfloor, to\n\n[[Page S5573]]\n\npermit us to do that through cloture and then to let the Senate decide \nabout our bill.\n  As I said, the United States of America is a nation that has \nconsistently tried to keep liberty and justice alive and well. This is \nan opportunity to do that.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider their vote, give us their votes on \ncloture so we can then bring it to the floor and discuss it further.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I just want to mention on the sovereignty \nrebuttal, the Federal policy of self-governance and self-determination \nallows for a government-to-government relationship between indigenous \npeople. This is not new. It exists right now between the United States \nand 556 tribes, 556 native governments. The continued representation of \nthis bill as an unprecedented new action is just plain wrong.\n  With all due respect to my colleagues, as I said earlier, Native \nHawaiians are proud to be Americans. Native Hawaiians, however, are \nindigenous peoples and Congress has the authority to recognize \nindigenous peoples.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this legislation. \nI do, however, respect the goals and the concerns that have been \nexpressed by the Senators from Hawaii and their supporters. I certainly \nagree with the language used by Senator Inouye to describe the people \nof Hawaii. They are indeed good people. They are indeed great patriots. \nI think no one better exemplifies the patriotism, the support for \nAmerican ideals, and the commitment to our country, than the two \nSenators from Hawaii, each in their service to this institution, their \nservice to our country, and their service to our country's military.\n  Senator Inouye discussed the need to right wrongs, and how that was \none of the objectives of this legislation. Even if we concede the \nimportance of righting wrongs, we can argue, as I do argue, that this \nis the wrong way to go about that.\n  This bill does not create a sovereign state or a sovereign entity. \nThat point was made by both Senators in their remarks. However, we \ncannot escape the fact that the legislation as written, on page 51, \ndoes describe very specifically the objective for Native Hawaiians to \nhave an inherent right of self-determination and self-government. That \nclearly suggests a goal, whether it is short-term or long-term, of \nestablishing self-governance; of establishing independence in some \nshape or form.\n\n  If this isn't an objective, then certainly it ought not to be \nincluded in the legislation.\n  This is not a question of tribal recognition. I think it is a mistake \nto make that analogy because there are very specific requirements for \ntribal recognition, and they are not met in this case. Therefore, that \nconcern is misplaced.\n  Most fundamentally, and I think most problematically, this \nlegislation does create a very separate and distinct governing entity, \nand the participation within that governing entity is based upon racial \nand ethnic classification. We have to ask ourselves whether this is a \nprinciple or a policy which the American people would support, whether \nit is one which will further our shared goals as Americans. I believe \nthe answer is no. It is a mistake to create two distinct privileges for \nparticipation in governance at any level that is based solely on one's \nracial or ethnic background.\n  The governing power of this new entity, the Native Hawaiian governing \nentity, is not small nor trivial. Again quoting from the legislation:\n\n       Among the general powers conferred on this governing entity \n     are the power to negotiate or engage in negotiations designed \n     to lead to an agreement addressing such matters as the \n     transfer of land, natural resources and other assets, and the \n     exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction.\n\n  These are not small matters. I believe the suggestion that this is a \nmodest entity, one with only very limited powers, is mistaken.\n  The proponents of the legislation might argue that there are \nintervening steps required on the part of the State government or the \nFederal Government to validate these negotiations. That doesn't change \nthe fact that this governing entity has real power to negotiate that is \nnot given to any other entity, and that the participation in that \ngovernance is based solely on one's ethnic or racial background. I \nbelieve that simply is not justified.\n  To the extent there are constitutional questions brought to bear, \nthey ought to be focused on due process, on whether this restriction \nthat one only participates in this governing entity if one has a \ncertain racial or ethnic background is an unfair limitation on an \nindividual American's right to participate in the electoral process.\n  Even if that were not a factor, balkanizing Americans, dispensing \npolitical power, or dispensing political recognition on the basis of \nethnic or racial background is a mistake. It is bad precedent. It \nemphasizes differences that we might have. I believe it runs the risk \nof disenfranchising certain Americans and takes us in the wrong \ndirection.\n  If there are wrongs that need to be set right, we should have a \ndebate about what those actions were and what specific steps ought to \nbe taken to address them. However, this is not the right vehicle. This \nis not the right approach. This does not send the right message.\n  In dealing with cases that have come before the Supreme Court which \ndealt with this question, the Supreme Court cited the 15th amendment, \nwhich forbids discrimination in voting based on race or ethnic \nbackground.\n  To quote from that decision, the Court said:\n\n       One of the reasons race is treated as a forbidden \n     classification is that it demeans the dignity and worth of a \n     person to be judged by ancestry instead of by his or her own \n     merit and essential qualities. An inquiry into ancestral \n     lines is not consistent with respect based on the unique \n     personality each of us possesses, a respect the Constitution \n     itself secures in its concern for persons and citizens . . . \n     [To do so would be] odious to a free people whose \n     institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\n\n  It is an approach that runs contrary to those fundamental goals and \nobjectives which are contained in the 15th amendment.\n  I think on a more personal level, it is worth understanding the \nimpact this can have on an individual.\n  I wish to close by referring to several comments which were provided \nby residents of Hawaii themselves before the Civil Rights Commission.\n  Quoting from one letter:\n\n       . . . It is appropriate to say that I am of Hawaiian, \n     Caucasian and Chinese descent only because it shall be noted \n     that I am a descendent of the indigenous peoples of Hawaii \n     and do not support the Akaka bill . . . If [the Akaka bill] \n     comes to pass, I will no longer acknowledge my Hawaiian \n     heritage as I will be forced to choose on which side of the \n     fence to stand. I will choose the Anglo-American tradition of \n     the right to life, liberty, property and the pursuit of \n     happiness. This will prevent me from recognizing all that is \n     Hawaiian in me. I consider the Akaka bill to be a proposal to \n     violate my rights . . .\n\n  This is a resident of Hawaii testifying before the Civil Rights \nCommission. He wrote:\n\n       . . . I am writing to ask for the civil rights commission \n     to oppose the Akaka Bill on the grounds that it will divide \n     our state among racial lines . . . I am of native American \n     blood (Nez Pierce Indian) but cannot be considered eligible \n     for benefits such as those desired by native Hawaiians . . . \n     The Akaka Bill will destroy our way of life in Hawaii . . .\n\n  The third letter quoted in that report to the Civil Rights \nCommission:\n\n       . . . I am a descendant of both: Kamehameha the Great, who \n     united the islands and people, natives and non-natives and \n     made Hawaii a model for the world: and the Mayflower pilgrims \n     whose ideals of individual freedom and responsibility and \n     self-reliance shaped the most inclusive and widely shared \n     system of government in history: American democracy . . . The \n     Akaka Bill would dishonor the unity and equality envisioned \n     by Kamehameha the Great and the ideal of one nation, \n     indivisible, composed of indestructible states, envisioned by \n     the U.S. Constitution . . .\n\n  These are individual opinions of residents of Hawaii who have their \nown personal history and perspective. We shouldn't make decisions in \nCongress or anywhere else based on just anecdotal information, but I \nthink they do reflect the difference of opinion, the difference of \nperspective, and the natural concerns possessed by even those who are \nsupposed to benefit from this legislation because of the way the bill\n\n[[Page S5574]]\n\ntreats people--not based on the content of their character, not based \non their individual rights as Americans, but based on their particular \nethnic or racial background.\n  If we can move away from the balkanization, classification, and \nunique treatment of people based on racial-ethnic background and move \ntoward the consideration of every individual based on their character, \ntheir integrity, and their commitment to our shared ideals, I believe \nwe will be a stronger and a better country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on this bill with some \ntrepidation, because, as I heard the Senator from Tennessee say earlier \nas I was watching the debate from my office, everyone in this Chamber \nhas enormous respect and affection for the Senator from Hawaii. We \nunderstand how important this issue is to him and believe he is making \nhis arguments in the best of faith.\n  I must say, though, that it is staggering to me to think of how \nimportant the issues are that underlie this bill. This is not a bill \nwhich just affects the State of the Senators from Hawaii; this is a \nbill which would potentially affect what it means to be an American.\n  One of the defining characteristics of this great country in which we \nlive is that no matter where we come from, no matter what our ethnic or \nracial heritage might be, no matter where we were raised, once we \npledged allegiance to the United States of America, we became an \nAmerican, someone who believes in the ideal of America's values, \nincluding equal justice under the law. So the very concept that people \nwould be treated differently based upon whether they are Native \nHawaiians or whether they came from Ireland or whether they are some \nother ethnic or racial group is anathema to what it means to be an \nAmerican.\n  This bill, it has been observed, would create a race-based and \nracially separate government for Native Hawaiians. It has been observed \nby the U.S. Supreme Court in the year 2000 in the Rice v. Cayetano \nlawsuit that this legislation is actually addressed to limit \nparticipation in a government based on one's consanguinity or \nbloodline, is in effect a proxy for race. What we are talking about is \nparticipating in the benefits of being a Native Hawaiian based upon \nrace and racial differences rather than saying to anyone and everyone \nthat America remains a nation where anyone and everyone, based upon \ntheir hard work, based upon their willingness to try to accomplish the \nmost they can with the freedoms that we are given--it is totally in \ncontradiction to that goal and that aspiration we have for all \nAmericans. It is important to address some of the specific allegations \nthat have been made.\n\n  First of all, this is equivalent to creating an Indian tribe. The \nState of Hawaii has stated in court, in 1985, the tribal concept has no \nplace in the context of Hawaiian history.\n  In the Rice v. Cayetano case, the brief said that for Indians, the \nformerly independent sovereignty that governed them was for the tribe, \nbut for the Native Hawaiians, their formally independent sovereign \nnation was the kingdom of Hawaii, not any particular tribe or \nequivalent political entity. The tribal concept, the brief went on to \nsay, on behalf of the State of Hawaii, the tribal concept simply has no \nplace in the context of Hawaiian history.\n  If we think about that, it is clear Native Hawaiians, if they are \ngoing to be identified based upon having Native Hawaiian blood, do not \nlive on a reservation or any geographically discrete plot of land. \nIndeed, they are dispersed throughout Hawaii and throughout the Nation. \nThe only defining characteristic is whether an individual has any \nNative Hawaiian blood.\n  It is completely different from Indian tribes which were, at the time \nof the founding of this Nation, sovereign entities unto themselves, so \nit was entirely appropriate that the Government negotiated \nrelationships with those existing sovereign entities, the Indian \ntribes, as they exist even today.\n  But to say today, in 2006, we all of a sudden are going to identify \nsome 400,000 Native Hawaiians wherever they may live in Hawaii and \nelsewhere and create a tribe, or a tribe equivalent, out of thin air \nhas simply no counterpart in the way the Indian tribes are created. \nAnd, indeed, as the State of Hawaii has said for itself, the tribal \nconcept simply has no place in the context of Hawaiian history.\n  As to the goals and the aspirations of this particular legislation, \nit is clear this bill lays down some rudimentary, I would say early, \nsteps in the recognition of a political governing body. But as to the \ngoals of this legislation and the supporters of this legislation, the \nOffice of Hawaiian Affairs acknowledges what the goals are under the \nAkaka bill. It says:\n\n       The Native Hawaiian people may exercise their right to \n     self-determination by selecting another form of government, \n     including free association or total independence.\n\n  The concept of any people within the confines of the United States \nclaiming their total independence is not unknown to our Nation's \nhistory. Six hundred thousand people died in a civil war, claiming a \nright to independence from the Union. There has been much bloodshed, \nmany lives lost, to preserve this great Union that we call the United \nStates of America.\n  When I say this seemingly innocuous legislation raises profound \nissues that affect who we are as a Nation and what we will be as a \nNation, I mean that in all sincerity. This legislation would be a \nserious step backward for our Nation and could not be any further from \nthe American ideal.\n  From the beginning, Americans have been a people bound together not \nby blood or ancestry but rather by a set of ideas. These ideas are \nfamiliar to all of us: liberty, democracy, freedom, and most of all, \nequal justice under the law. These are the ideas that unite all \nAmericans. They are ideas that have literally changed the course of \nhuman events.\n  No longer are the greatest civilizations in the world recognized or \nmeasured by how many subjects bow before a king or how many nations are \nconquered by armies. Today, we measure greatness of a nation to the \nextent that the nation's people are recognized as equal under the law. \nThis is enshrined in our most basic documents. Thomas Jefferson's \nDeclaration of Independence, stating ``that all men are created \nequal.''\n  But we know too well that those are words on paper. The long road to \nequality, on which we most certainly continue to travel and which \ncontinues to be a work in progress, has been costly to our Nation. As I \nmentioned a moment ago, it has been paid for with the blood of hundreds \nof thousands of American patriots. Unfortunately, the signposts along \nthe way have been too often marked by violence and bigotry when we have \nseen Americans pitted against other Americans claiming special status \nbecause of the color of their skin or because of their relationships.\n  Today, however, America stands as a shining example of what happens \nwhen people set the ideal in their mind as the goal to work forward. As \nJustice Harlan noted in his classic dissent in the case Plessy v. \nFerguson:\n\n       [O]ur Constitution is color-blind, and knows neither nor \n     tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, \n     all citizens are equal before the law.\n\n  While it certainly took far too long in our own Nation's history to \nembrace the truth of Justice Harlan's position, and we certainly have \nmore to do as a work in progress ourselves, America has made \nsignificant progress toward equality.\n  Unfortunately, this bill--whatever good the intentions may be, and I \ngrant those without any argument--the bill threatens to undermine all \nof the progress we have made by establishing a race-based government \nand requiring the Federal Government enforce its creation.\n  There are the bill sponsors, the Governor of Hawaii, and the Attorney \nGeneral, who argue that the bill does not establish a race-based \ngovernment. Indeed, they say that the bill neither further balkanizes \nthe United States nor sets up a race-based separate government in \nHawaii.\n  With all due respect, a plain reading of the legislation indicates \notherwise. The bill clearly states that only Native Hawaiians can \nparticipate in the newly established community, period. And a Native \nHawaiian is defined in part as ``[o]ne of the indigenous, native people \nof Hawaii and who is a direct lineal descendant of the aboriginal, \nindigenous native people.''\n\n[[Page S5575]]\n\n  But perhaps the most troubling description of the bill comes from our \nfriends, the Senators from Hawaii:\n\n        . . . the first step is to create a list of Native \n     Hawaiians eligible . . . The individuals on the list will be \n     verified by a commission of individuals in Hawaii with \n     demonstrated expertise and knowledge in Hawaiian genealogy. \n     The list will be forwarded to the Secretary of the Department \n     of Interior who is authorized to certify the list only if the \n     Secretary is fully satisfied that the individuals meet the \n     necessary criteria.\n\n  In other words, the legislation requires that the Federal Government \nhire Federal employees to serve on a race-based commission that itself \nwould use a racial test to determine membership in the race-based so-\ncalled tribe.\n  I ask my colleagues to explain to me how this does not ``set up a \nrace-based separate government in Hawaii.'' It seems that if words have \nany meaning, the truth is plain to see that it does, indeed, establish \na race-based system without precedent in American history.\n  What concerns me even more is that the proponents claim the \nlegislation will not balkanize the United States. But this claim \nvirtually ignores the entirety of our Nation's long and historic \nstruggle over issues of race from slavery to Jim Crow laws and beyond, \nlaws and policies that define our people based on race are bound to \nultimately fail.\n  Furthermore, by claiming to create an analogy to an Indian tribe out \nof Native Hawaiians scattered across the planet, Congress will be \ngiving the new government some of the same benefits as other Indian \ntribes. Yet the new government will operate at a very different \nenvironment with no geographic boundaries nor physical communities. The \npeople who may be confirmed as Native Hawaiians are completely \nintegrated with all others throughout Hawaii and throughout the 50 \nStates. Developing this government will create a large number of \nstructural and practical difficulties that one can only imagine.\n  Since time is short today, and it is my sincere hope that our \ncolleagues will vote against cloture on this bill, I will reserve \nadditional comments for a later time.\n  I conclude by saying this is an idea that runs completely counter to \nAmerica as a melting pot, which has been so often used to describe our \nNation as a Nation that is comprised of many races and many \nethnicities, people of wildly divergent beliefs. But the one thing we \ndo agree on is the founding ideals that have made America unique, none \nof which is more important than equal justice under the law. If we are \nto embrace for the first time in American history, as a matter of our \nlegislative actions, race-based distinctions for Americans, it will be \na day we will long rue and will be a black mark in our Nation's long \nmarch toward equal justice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Can Senator Akaka yield me some time to comment on the \nlegislation?\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator desires \nfrom our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized. The \nChair notes the Senator still has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining on the \nmajority time as well.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak using the \ntime of the Senator from Hawaii. They can reserve their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am in support of the legislation, and I will take my \ntime from the other side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am saddened to hear some of the \ncomments I have heard today in the Senate. Most people do not \nunderstand the circumstances that existed in both of our offshore \nStates.\n  I have come to the Senate to support the Native Hawaiian Government \nReorganization Act introduced by my good friends from Hawaii. I support \nthis bill not only because of my friendship and respect for Senator \nInouye and Senator Akaka but also because it is the right thing to do \nfor the Hawaiian people. I have visited with the Hawaiian people very \noften on this subject.\n  Alaska, similar to Hawaii, has a rich history shaped by native \ncultures and traditions. These customs are a vital part of our \nheritage. My commitment to protecting and preserving the culture of \nAlaskan Natives spans now more than four decades. I believe Native \nHawaiians deserve this protection as well.\n  While our Alaskan Native community still faces many challenges, their \nposition has been improved because of legislation which clarified their \nrelationship with our State of Alaska and with the Federal Government.\n  Soon after I came to the Senate--and that was in 1968--I began \nworking to settle the unresolved claims of our Alaskan Natives. Many of \nthe arguments against the Hawaiian bill now made by the opponents of \nthis legislation were made by those who opposed the Alaskan Native \nClaims Settlement Act enacted in 1971. But time has proven them wrong. \nThe Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act did not create States within \nour State. It did not lead to secession. It did not lead to anyone \ntrying to create a nation within our Nation. Those who argue that the \nbill before the Senate will lead to secession ignore the history. More \nthan 562 Indian tribes are recognized by our Federal Government.\n  Not one of those tribes has sought to secede from their State or from \nthe Nation. Federal recognition of these tribes has not prompted any \nState that they call home to try to secede from our Union. The Akaka \nbill reaffirms our longstanding commitment to the rights of our \nindigenous people. It ensures that Native Hawaiians will have the same \ntype of recognition afforded to American Indians and to Alaska natives \nby the act of 1971.\n  The U.S. Government has a responsibility to Native Hawaiians, as it \ndoes to all indigenous people under our Constitution. The Constitution \nvests Congress with the authority to promote the welfare of all Native \nAmerican people and to help foster their success.\n  Like the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, the bill before us, \nwhen it is enacted, will create a framework which ensures Native \nHawaiian groups can address their unique circumstances. ANCSA was a \ncrucial step in responding to the concerns of Alaska natives. It \nempowered them to improve their own position. The Akaka bill offers \nNative Hawaiians the same opportunity.\n  Our Federal policy of self-determination and self-governance has not \nbeen formally extended to Native Hawaiians. This omission unfairly \nsingles them out for disparate treatment from our Federal Government. \nIt deprives them of the processes by which other native groups may \nnegotiate and resolve issues with the Federal and State governments. In \nmy judgment, it is time to right this wrong.\n  This bill will fulfill our Federal obligation to Hawaii's native \npeople. The Akaka bill authorizes the United States, the State of \nHawaii, and the Native Hawaiian Government to conduct negotiations. \nTheir discussions will address the unique issues facing Native \nHawaiians. These steps will help ensure the future prosperity of the \nNative Hawaiian people.\n  The bill offered by the Hawaiian delegation has garnered widespread \nsupport. The legislation reflects the recommendations made by the \nDepartment of Justice and the Department of the Interior in the \nreconciliation report they published in 2000. The Governor of Hawaii, \nthe Hawaii State legislature, and a majority of the Hawaiian people \nsupport this bill. Both the National Congress of American Indians and \nthe Alaska Federation of Natives have passed resolutions in support of \nthis bill.\n  Just as I sought to protect the rights of Alaska natives, Senators \nAkaka and Inouye are fighting for the rights of their native people in \nHawaii. They have my full support. They have the support of the Alaska \npeople. I believe they have the support of those who want to see these \nwrongs righted.\n  The time has come to fulfill our commitment to these indigenous \npeople and to address the needs of the Native Hawaiians. We can no \nlonger deny our Nation's responsibility to promote their welfare as \nmuch as we have promoted the welfare of the Indian people and the \nAlaska native people.\n  The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act is a step towards \nmeeting our Federal commitment to\n\n[[Page S5576]]\n\nNative Hawaiians. It is long overdue. I have come to urge our \ncolleagues to support cloture and vote in favor of this legislation.\n  I am sorry we are no longer really a debating body. I would love to \ndebate this. I would love to try to ask them to understand what \nhappened in Alaska. The rights of Alaskans aren't the same. There were \npeople who said: You can't do that; that will create a State within a \nState. There were people who said: You can't do that; they will rebel \nagainst the United States.\n  These people are good Americans. They serve in our military. They \njust have a different culture, and it has never been recognized by our \ngovernment as it should. It was done in Alaska in 1971. It is long \noverdue here.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time between 6 and 6:30 be \ncontrolled by the majority, and the time between 6:30 and 7 be \ncontrolled by the minority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I yield as much time as he needs to the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Native Hawaiian \nGovernment Reorganization Act of 2005.\n  Although I am a proud Illinoisan, proud to be the junior Senator from \nIllinois, many of you know that I was born and raised in Hawaii. Anyone \nwho has been fortunate enough to visit or call Hawaii home, as I once \ndid, and as my grandmother and sister and adorable niece still do, \nanybody who has spent time in Hawaii cannot help but recognize the \nuniqueness of the place. In addition to its scenic landscapes and rich \nhistory, it is the living legacy of aloha--the spirit of openness and \nfriendliness that is ingrained in the shared, local culture that shapes \nand enhances each island encounter and experience.\n  Throughout Hawaii's history, individuals of all nationalities, races \nand creeds have found solace in Hawaii. In large part this stems from \nthe culture of Native Hawaiians, who have always acknowledged and \ncelebrated diversity. This incorporation of new cultures and practices \nover the years has strengthened and unified the community. And as the \nchild of a black father and a white mother, I know firsthand how \nimportant Native Hawaiian efforts are to foster a culture of acceptance \nand of tolerance.\n  For this reason, I am proud to join Senator Daniel Akaka to extend \nthe Federal policy of self-governance and self-determination to Native \nHawaiians. Native Hawaiians are a vital part of our Nation's cultural \nfabric, and they will continue to shape our country in the years to \ncome.\n  The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act provides both the \nprocess and opportunity for Native Hawaiian communities to engage \nthemselves in and reorganize their governing entity to establish a \nfederally recognized government-to-government relationship with the \nUnited States of America. The process set forth in the bill empowers \nNative Hawaiians to explore and address the longstanding issues \nresulting from the overthrow of the kingdom of Hawaii.\n  There are three main provisions of the Native Hawaiian Government \nReorganization Act.\n  First, the bill establishes the Office of Native Hawaiian Relations \nin the Department of the Interior to serve as a liaison between the \nNative Hawaiians and the United States.\n  Second, the bill establishes the Native Hawaiian Interagency \nCoordinating Group that will be comprised of Federal officials from \nagencies that administer Native Hawaiian programs. These provisions are \nintended to increase coordination between Native Hawaiians and the \nFederal Government.\n  And third, the bill provides a process for reorganizing the Native \nHawaiian government entity. Once the entity is reorganized and \nrecognized, there is a process of negotiations to resolve longstanding \nissues such as the transfer of and jurisdiction over lands, natural \nresources, and assets.\n  Support for this bill comes not only from the people of Hawaii but \nfrom people all across America. This bill also is supported by the \nindigenous peoples of America, including American Indians and Alaska \nnatives. As Americans, we pride ourselves in safeguarding the practice \nand ideas of liberty, justice, and freedom. By supporting this bill, we \ncan continue this great American tradition and fulfill this promise by \naffording Native Hawaiians the opportunity to recognize their governing \nentity and have it recognized by the Federal Government.\n  As someone who grew up in Hawaii and has enormous love for the \nHawaiian culture, I also think it is important, as I know the two \nSenators from Hawaii will acknowledge, that there have been \ndifficulties within the community of Native Hawaiians, oftentimes \ndespite the fact that we are visitors to Hawaii; that many times \nparticularly young Native Hawaiians have had difficulties in terms of \nunemployment, in terms of being able to integrate into the economy of \nthe islands, that some of the historical legacies of what has happened \nin Hawaii continue to burden the Native Hawaiians for many years into \nthe future.\n  This bill gives us an opportunity not to look backward but to help \nall Hawaiians move forward and to make sure that the Native Hawaiians \nin that great State are full members and not left behind as Hawaii \ncontinues to progress.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. I take a minute to commend \nthe senior Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, and most of all Senator \nAkaka, particularly, for his tireless efforts to bring this to the \nfloor. When people all across the country didn't know about this issue, \nSenator Akaka was the one who made sure we did. He has been a champion \nfor the people of Hawaii. He is always working hard and thinking big to \nrealize this ideal for the native population of his State. They are \ntruly fortunate to have Senator Akaka as their Senator.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote for the Native Hawaiian \nGovernment Reorganization Act of 2005. I will be proud to add my vote \nto the roll call.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, before I yield time to the Senator from \nAlaska, I would like to say a word about secession. This bill in no way \nallows the State of Hawaii to secede from the United States. To \nreiterate my prior statement, I support addressing the legal and \npolitical relationship between Native Hawaiians and the United States \nwithin Federal law. I do not support independence. I do not support \nsecession of the State of Hawaii from the United States.\n  This bill extends the Federal policy of self-governance and self-\ndetermination to Hawaii's indigenous peoples, thereby providing parity \nin Federal policies toward American Indians, Alaska natives, and native \nHawaiians. The bill focuses solely on the relationship between the \nUnited States and Native Hawaiians within the context of Federal law.\n  None of the numerous federally recognized tribes have been accused of \nseeking to cause their State to secede from the Union because of their \nlegal and political relationship with the United States. Such claims \nare false and meant to instill fear in those who are unfamiliar with \nthe nature of government-to-government relations between tribal \nentities and the United States.\n  Given Hawaii's history, I have a small group of constituents who \nadvocate for independence. Why? Because there hasn't been a structured \nprocess to deal with the longstanding issues resulting from the \noverthrow. The absence of a process to resolve the issue has led to \nfrustration and desperation. My bill provides a structured process to \nbegin to address these longstanding issues. Contrary to the claim of \ndivisiveness, my bill goes a long way to preserve the unity of the \npeople of Hawaii.\n  I yield time from our side to Senator Murkowski of Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator from Hawaii for his leadership on \nthis issue, for his leadership on behalf of the people of Hawaii. There \nis so much in common that the Alaskans in the north share with our \nneighbors in the Pacific. I would like to take a few\n\n[[Page S5577]]\n\nmoments to speak a little bit about the history and how the history of \nour Alaska Natives ties in with the Native Hawaiians and why I stand \ntoday in support of the legislation offered by Senator Akaka.\n  As Abraham Lincoln is revered by the African American community as \nour first civil rights President, Richard Nixon is held in esteem by \nAmerica's native people for his doctrine of self-determination. \nPresident Nixon knew that in order for the native people to break out \nof the despair and poverty that gripped their lives, they would need to \nbe empowered to take control of their own destiny. One of President \nNixon's legacies to America's first peoples is the Indian Self \nDetermination and Educational Assistance Act. Another one is the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act. These two pieces of legislation \neliminated any doubt as to whether the Native people of Alaska were \nrecognized as among the first people of our United States and were, \ntherefore, eligible for the programs and services accorded to Native \npeople.\n  Yet it took more than a century from the time the United States \nacquired Alaska from Russia for the legitimate claims of Alaska's \nnative people to be resolved. One hundred and three years to be exact. \nPresident Nixon signed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act into law \non December 18, 1971. It has been amended by Congress to clarify one \nambiguity or another on numerous occasions since.\n  The Indian Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, which \nprovides the legal basis for our Nation's special relationship with its \nnative people, speaks of the authority of Congress to regulate commerce \nwith the Indian tribes. It is now well established that this provision \nof the Constitution is the legal basis for our Nation's special \nrelationships with the Native peoples of Alaska.\n  Some of Alaska's native people regard themselves as Indians. But the \nEskimo and Aleut peoples of Alaska, who have also been recognized by \nthis Congress and the courts as deserving of the special relationship, \nmost certainly would not regard themselves as Indians.\n  In Alaska, the basic unit of native organization is the village and \nwhile some villages refer to themselves as ``tribes,'' many native \nvillages do not.\n  The Inupiaq Eskimo villages carry names like the native village of \nBarrow, the native village of Kaktovik, and the regional governing body \nof North Slope Inupiaq Eskimos refers to itself as the Inupiaq \nCommunity of the Arctic Slope.\n  Alaska's native peoples are Aleuts, Eskimos and Indians and their \nunits of organization include entities like traditional councils, \nvillage councils, village corporations, regional consortia and \nsubregional consortia. Yet neither the Congress nor the Federal courts \ndeny all fall within the purview of the Indian Commerce Clause.\n  Leading constitutional scholars, including our esteemed Chief Justice \nJohn Roberts, have argued that Native Hawaiians also fall within the \npurview of the Indian Commerce Clause. I think it is high time that \nthis Congress confirm that they do.\n  The American Indian Law Deskbook, 2d edition, authored by the \nConference of Western Attorneys General, an association of state \nattorneys general, quotes the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in United \nStates v. Antelope for this point.\n\n       Congress may not bring a community or body of people within \n     the range of its Indian Commerce Clause by arbitrarily \n     calling them an Indian tribe, but . . . the questions \n     whether, to what extent, and for what time they shall be \n     recognized and dealt with as tribes are to be determined by \n     the Congress, and not by the courts.\n\n  As anyone who has been to law school knows, when the courts apply \narbitrariness as the standard of review, they are highly deferential to \nthe initial decision maker, whether that decision is made by the \nexecutive branch or the legislative branch.\n  And the new 2005 edition of Cohen's Federal Indian Law treatise, \nwhich has historically been regarded as the definitive authority on \nFederal Indian Law notes that ``no Congressional or executive \ndetermination of tribal status has been overturned by the courts'' and \nindeed the Supreme Court has never refined the arbitrariness standard \nto which I referred.\n  The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act was most importantly, a \nsettlement of land claims. But it has turned out to be so much more for \nAlaska's native people. It created native owned and native controlled \ninstitutions at the regional and village level. These institutions, the \nAlaska Native Corporations, have functioned as leadership laboratories, \nhelping a people who traditionally lived a subsistence lifestyle gain \nthe skills necessary to run multi-million-dollar economic enterprises. \nI am not only referring to the profit-making corporations created by \nthe act, but also the people serving institutions that manage Indian \nSelf Determination Act programs.\n  The Alaska native health care delivery system is a prime example of \nPresident Nixon's self-determination policies at work. At one time the \nFederal Government administered the delivery of health care to the \nnative people of Alaska through the Indian Health Service. Today, the \nnative people administer their own health care delivery system under a \nself-governance compact with the Federal Government.\n  This healthcare system is recognized around the world as a laboratory \nfor innovation. It is a pioneer in the use of telemedicine technology \nto connect clinics in remote villages to doctors at regional hospitals, \nand at the advanced Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage. \nConfidence in the quality of care delivered by the native healthcare \nsystem rose when native people took over the system.\n  But for me the most gratifying thing is to see young native people \nwho are leading their communities into the new millennium. You see them \nin management and developmental positions everywhere in the Alaska \nnative healthcare system.\n  The institutions created and fostered by the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act have helped countless native young people pursue \neducational opportunities at the undergraduate and graduate level. \nYoung people from the villages of rural Alaska are going off to school \nand returning with MBAs and degrees in law and medicine, nursing, \neducation and social work.\n  As I visit the traditional native villages in my State of Alaska, it \nis evident to me that the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \naccomplished much more than settling land claims and creating native \ninstitutions. This legislation empowered a people. The Native people of \nAlaska have regained their pride in being native. Even as native people \nare pursuing careers that their ancestors never considered, there is a \nresurgence of interest in native languages and native culture in many \nof our native communities.\n  The empowerment of Alaska's Native people also enriches the broader \nAlaska community. Thousands of Alaskans participate in programs offered \nby the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage. The Athabascan Old \nTime Fiddler's Festival and the World Eskimo-Indian Olympics enable the \nnative people of Interior Alaska to share their culture with the Alaska \ncommunity.\n  At the time the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act became law, some \nbelieved that it would balkanize the State of Alaska and separate \npeople from one another. As we approach the 35th anniversary of the \nAlaska native land claims settlement, I can state with confidence that \nthis single step of recognizing the legitimate claims of Alaska's \nnative peoples has made our State a better place. It strengthened our \nties to the past. It strengthened our sense of community. It enables \nall of us, native and non-native alike to take pride in Alaska.\n  Some 112 years have passed since the overthrow of the Kingdom of \nHawaii, depriving the Native Hawaiian people of their self-\ndetermination and their land. Some 112 years after the Native Hawaiian \npeople came under the control of the United States, I am sad to note \nthat their status among the aboriginal peoples of the United States \nremains in controversy.\n  This controversy persists even though the Congress has enacted more \nthan 150 separate laws that recognize a special relationship between \nthe Native Hawaiian people and the United States. Among these laws is \nthe Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1921, which set aside lands for \nNative Hawaiians much like the Alaska Native Allotment Act set aside \nlands for Alaska Natives.\n\n[[Page S5578]]\n\n  Now you would think that if Native Hawaiians were regarded as not \nhaving the status of Indian people under the Commerce Clause, that the \nCongress would not have set aside land for them or made them eligible \nfor the sorts of programs and services for which native people are \neligible. But the Congress has done so time and time again and \nPresidents continue to sign these bills into law.\n  I am referring to the inclusion of Native Hawaiians in laws like the \nNative American Programs Act of 1974 and the Native American Graves \nProtection and Repatriation Act, which protect the interests of all of \nAmerica's native peoples.\n  I also refer to laws such as the Native Hawaiian Healthcare Act and \nthe Native Hawaiian Education Act which specifically rely on Congress's \nplenary power over matters involving Indians for their authority.\n  This controversy persists even though this Senate passed by a margin \nof 65-34, an Apology Act in 1993 which was ultimately signed into law \nas Public Law 103-150. Through this Apology Act, the Congress expressed \nits commitment to provide a proper foundation for reconciliation \nbetween the United States and the Native Hawaiian people.\n  The bill before us, S. 147, is the logical next step in the process \nof reconciliation. It is the product of many years of hard work by our \nesteemed colleagues, Senator Akaka and Senator Inouye. It has earned \nthe support of the Governor of Hawaii, the Honorable Linda Lingle, and \nthe support of the Hawaii Legislature. It is endorsed by every major \nIndian group in our Nation--the National Congress of American Indians, \nthe Alaska Federation of Natives and the Council on Native Hawaiian \nAdvancement. It has been carefully considered by the Senate Committee \non Indian Affairs which has reported the bill favorably to the full \nSenate.\n  First and foremost, it conclusively resolves the issue of whether \nNative Hawaiians are aboriginal peoples alongside American Indians and \nAlaska natives. This is a process that the native people of Alaska \nwaited 108 years to resolve. It is important for the Congress to \nresolve these issues in order to assure that the programs we have \nenacted for the benefit of Native Hawaiians are free of constitutional \nchallenge.\n  It provides for the organization of Native Hawaiians in a form that \nthe adult members of that community determine by an open and \ntransparent ballot. And it empowers that Native Hawaiian organization \nto negotiate with the State of Hawaii and the United States of America \nover the direction that Native Hawaiian self-determination may take. \nThis is a modest piece of legislation that simply establishes a \nframework for negotiations to take place in the future.\n  Some of the opponents of this legislation have set out a parade of \nhorribles that will flow from its enactment. I, for one, am unwilling \nto speculate on the outcome of the negotiations between the United \nStates, the State of Hawaii, and the organization of Native Hawaiians \nestablished by this legislation. This legislation on its face states \nthat it does not authorize Indian gaming, it does not vest the Native \nHawaiian organization formed under its provisions with civil or \ncriminal jurisdiction, and it does not require that Federal programs \nand services to other aboriginal peoples of the United States be \nreduced in order to provide access to the native peoples of Hawaii. It \nalso does not create Indian reservations in Hawaii.\n  Sharing and inclusion are fundamental values to the native people of \nAlaska. The Alaska Federation of Natives, which is the oldest and most \nrespected organization representing all of Alaska's native peoples, \nstrongly supports the inclusion of Native Hawaiians among our first \npeoples, just as it supports the legitimate claims of the Virginia \ntribes and those of the Lumbees of North Carolina. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the AFN's resolution of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   In Support of the Hawaiian People\n\n       Whereas: the aboriginal people of the Hawaiian Islands, \n     like Alaska Natives and Indians of the Lower 48 states, have \n     long been the victims of colonial expansionism and racial \n     discrimination; and\n       Whereas: the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a unit of state \n     government, has for years administered trust funds for the \n     benefit of Native Hawaiians under the aegis of a Board of \n     Directors elected by Native Hawaiians; and\n       Whereas: in the recent Rice v. Cayetano ruling, the U.S. \n     Supreme Court held that this electoral process violates the \n     Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which \n     prohibits the use of race as an eligibility factor in voting; \n     and\n       Whereas: the Rice decision opens the door to additional \n     lawsuits that would threaten the status and well-being of \n     Hawaiians--and could create serious implications for Alaska \n     Natives and other indigenous Americans; and\n       Whereas: the most experienced legal strategists in Hawaii, \n     including the Governor and the Congressional Delegation, have \n     determined that the best response to the Rice decision is \n     that the United States Congress enact legislation \n     specifically recognizing the Hawaiians as an ``indigenous \n     people'' of the United States; and\n       Whereas: the State of Hawaii, particularly when compared to \n     Alaska, has generally treated its indigenous population with \n     respect and it is now making a unified effort to avoid the \n     damage that Rice could do its own future; and\n       Whereas: there are several compelling reasons why AFN and \n     the statewide Alaska Native community should now stand up for \n     the Hawaiian people during the struggle for their appropriate \n     legal status:\n       (1) because it is the right and just thing to do;\n       (2) because all Americans have a vested interest in healthy \n     social relationships, racial tolerance, and political \n     cohesion; and\n       (3) because the Hawaiian Congressional Delegation--and \n     above all, Senators Daniel Inouye and Daniel Akaka--have \n     always been there for us in our long fight for Alaska Native \n     rights, including subsistence; Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Board of Directors of the Alaska \n     Federation of Natives declares its unqualified concern for, \n     and support of, the Hawaiian people in their quest for \n     federal recognition as indigenous people of the United \n     States; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska Federation of Natives' Board of \n     Directors direct the President and staff to assist the State \n     of Hawaii's political leadership in this critical effort, by \n     all appropriate means.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Celebrating the distinctive cultures and ways of our \nfirst peoples strengthens of us. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement \nAct has stood the test of time and proven to be a good thing for the \npeople of Alaska--native and non-native alike.\n  During his introductory remarks, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. \nAlexander, drew some distinctions between the situation of the Native \nHawaiians and those of Alaska Natives. I would like to offer a few \nobservations for the Record.\n  It is true that some Alaska Natives now and at the time the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act of 1971 was enacted live in Alaska Native \nvillages. Those villages have never been regarded as Indian \nreservations. Non-Natives live in Alaska Native villages alongside \nAlaska Natives.\n  But more significantly, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of \n1971 did not require that one reside in one of the Alaska Native \nvillages or even in the State of Alaska to be a beneficiary of the \nsettlement. All it required it that an individual have as a result of \none's ancestry a specified quantum of Aleut, Eskimo or Indian blood to \nbe an initial shareholder in an Alaska Native Corporation. The Federal \nGovernment determined who was eligible to receive stock by formulating \na roll of Alaska Natives.\n  Recognizing rates of intermarriage among Alaska Natives, Congress has \namended this legislation to give descendants of a corporation's \noriginal shareholders an opportunity to participate in the corporations \non a co-equal basis with those shareholders who had the requisite blood \nquantum.\n  At the time that the claims act was passed Alaska Natives resided in \nevery urban center of Alaska and many resided outside of the State of \nAlaska. They too lived as everyone's next door neighbor and were mixed \nin with the State's population.\n  In the 34 years since the claims act was passed more and more Alaska \nNatives have relocated to regional hubs, to Alaska's largest cities, \nand to locations outside Alaska. Today, Anchorage is regarded as \nAlaska's largest Native village. Some even live in Hawaii. Yet they \nhave not lost their status as Alaska Natives in fact as in law. All \nremain eligible for services customarily provided to American Indians \nand Alaska Natives under the law.\n  I trust in the judgment of my respected colleagues, Senator Akaka and\n\n[[Page S5579]]\n\nSenator Inouye, and my friend, Governor Lingle, that passage of S. 147 \nwill enrich the lives and spirits of all of the people of Hawaii.\n  I ask that my colleagues support cloture to enable us to debate S. \n147. With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for her \nsupport. I yield whatever time is left to the Senator from Arkansas, \nMrs. Lincoln.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 seconds.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, first of all, I compliment my colleagues \nfrom Hawaii, Senator Inouye, and Senator Akaka especially, for sharing \nhis time and for the incredible work they have done on behalf of the \npeople they represent in the State of Hawaii. I wanted to take this \nopportunity to----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The next 30 \nminutes, by unanimous consent, is to be controlled by the majority. \nDoes the Senator from Arkansas have a unanimous consent request?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Yes. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, and I have no desire to \nobject, my time was starting at 6 o'clock, and then Senator Sessions \nhas 10 minutes. He needs to leave by 6:20. He is not here. I think that \nwas the original agreement.\n  Would the Senator be willing to start at 6:20 and have 5 minutes \nthen?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. If there is an objection, I will certainly yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. That will still be on our time, as I understand it. If the \nSenator is agreeable, I suggest that at 6:20 she be recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I apologize to the Senator, but Senator \nSessions advised me he wants me to be completed by 6:10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                        Repeal of the Estate Tax\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to support the effort which is \nbeing pursued in the Senate in a bipartisan way, I certainly hope, to \nrid ourselves of the death tax, especially as it applies to smaller \nestates.\n  The death tax makes virtually no sense from a standpoint of tax \npolicy. Before I was elected to the Senate and before I got into public \noffice, I was an attorney. At the time, I went back to graduate school \nfor 3 years and got a graduate degree in tax policy and taxation, an \nLLM, as it is called. One of the areas I specialized in at that time \nwas estate tax planning. It always seemed ironic to me that this was \nthe only tax that was energized not by economic activity--in other \nwords, usually when you are taxed, you do something that generates \neconomic activity. You have a job so you have income; you make an \ninvestment and make a sale of that investment, so you have capital \ngains. Whatever it is, it is an economic event that you energize, that \nyou initiate, and it has generated some sort of income to you.\n  The death tax is the only tax we have which has nothing to do with \neconomic events. It just has to do with an unfortunate luck of the \ndraw. You are crossing the street and you get run over by a postal \ntruck and die, which is enough of an action to upset your day, and then \nthe IRS comes by and they run over you again. So you end up not only \nhaving your day totally ruined because you got run over by the postal \ntruck to begin with, but then your family has their day ruined because \nthey not only lost you, but they suddenly have to pay this huge tax if \nyou are an entrepreneur.\n  The problem is that it hits most discriminatorily that small \nentrepreneur in our society who basically creates jobs--the small \nbusiness person--a person who has made an investment and built an asset \nthroughout their life. Maybe it is people who go out and start a \nrestaurant, maybe employ 10, 15, 20 people; people who go out and start \na printing business or make an investment in real estate, an apartment, \nbuild housing for people. They are just getting going, they don't have \na whole lot of assets, and they are not very liquid usually--in fact, \nthese folks are not liquid at all because it is mostly tied up in real \nestate--and suddenly they have this traumatic event with the key person \nin the family dying who maybe built this business and then they get hit \nwith a tax.\n  Not only is it a tax which has nothing to do with economic activity, \nit is actually a tax which has the ironic and unintended consequence, I \npresume--but it is exactly what happens--of actually crushing economic \nactivity and reducing economic activity and, in many cases, costing \njobs because the small family business or the farm, which was being \noperated by this sole proprietor, in most instances, or this small \nfamily unit, suddenly can't find itself capable of meeting the costs of \npaying the estate tax--it didn't ever plan for that or if they did plan \nfor that the cost of planning for that was pretty high--and so they \nhave to sell their assets which usually means the people they employ \nare at risk or maybe they have to just close down the whole operation.\n  So the economic activity contracts, and instead of having a business \nthat might have been growing, you end up with a forced sale, the \npractical effect of which is you contract economic activity.\n  First you have this really incomprehensible concept that you are \ngoing to tax people not for economic gain, but simply because they had \na terrible thing happen, which is they died, maybe accidentally, and \nthen you are going to say that instead of encouraging economic \nactivity, which is what the purpose should be of our tax laws, you are \nactually going to create a tax which contracts economic activity. So it \nis discriminatory, inappropriate, and irrational, and on top of that, \nto make things worse, the United States has the third highest estate \ntax, death tax rate of the industrialized world. In fact, our rate is \nso high that we are even above--and this is hard to believe--we are \neven above France. When you get above France in an area of taxation, \nyou have really started to suffocate economic activity, \nentrepreneurship, and creativity because they are sort of the poster \nchild for basically how to make an economy nonproductive and encourage \npeople not to work and basically be a socialist state.\n  This whole concept of a death tax, first, makes no sense from the \nstandpoint of tax policy; it is not generated by economic events, and \nit makes no sense from the standpoint of economic policy because it \nusually leads to contraction of growth rather than expansion of growth. \nAnd it certainly makes no sense that the United States, which should be \na bastion of the promotion of entrepreneurship and a bastion of \nsupporting family farmers, the family restaurant, the family gas \nstation, the family entrepreneur, is taxing those families at a rate \nwhich is higher than the French do.\n  There is a proposal--in fact, really there is a series of proposals--\nin the Senate today and the next few days which will allow us to put in \nplace a more rationalized approach to the death tax. To get to that \npoint, we have to have, it appears, a cloture vote on full repeal, \nwhich was the House position. But three or four of our colleagues have \nput forward ideas that do not involve full repeal--I support full \nrepeal--but these are more modest approaches. Senator Kyl has been \nleading the effort in this area. Senator Baucus appears to be pursuing \nthis effort. Senator Snowe, I know, is pursuing it. There are options \nfloating around the Congress--the Senate specifically--which, \nhopefully, can be pulled together and moved forward.\n\n  It truly is time to do this. We need to put in place a clear \nstatement of what the tax policy is going to be if you have the \nunfortunate experience of being run over by a postal truck. And it \nshould be a clear statement that if you are a small entrepreneur with a \nfamily-type business or a farm, that your family is not going to be \nwiped out by the IRS coming in on top of this terrible event and taking \nbasically a disproportionate and inappropriate share of your assets and \nbasically contracting and eliminating your business and putting your \nfamily's livelihood at risk.\n  The reason we need to do it now, even though most of this won't take \neffect until 2010, I can tell you as an estate tax planner before I \ntook this job,\n\n[[Page S5580]]\n\nbefore I got into public service, you need that lead time to do it \nright. You just can't overnight plan for tax policy. You have to have \nlead time, you have to have a clear statement of what the tax policy is \ngoing to be, and consistency is critical. Putting this in place now so \nit will be effective in 2011, which is what most of the proposals are, \nis absolutely essential if we are going to have an effective reform of \nthis death tax law which we presently have.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Alabama is in the Chamber. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I couldn't agree more with Senator \nGregg's comments. He is someone who has had experience with the estate \ntax. He understands these ramifications well.\n  My college professor, Harold Apolinsky, in Birmingham, one of the \ngreat estate tax lawyers in the country, has dedicated his career in \nrecent years to eliminating this tax. He said it is the worst thing \nhappening to our country, and it absolutely ought to be eliminated. He \nsaid: Even if it affects my business, I am doing this because I think \nit is the right thing to do. He has inspired me to be active in this \narea.\n  I would like to share three stories.\n  I was traveling in a small town in Alabama. A man came up to me with \nhis son. They have three motels. He was sharing with me their \nfrustration that they had to take out an insurance policy that cost the \nfamily $80,000 a year because if something happened to him, they had no \ncash--they had built motels, they were investing in a growing economy \nand expanding this small business and they had no cash--and they would \nbe faced with a death tax.\n  I want my colleagues to think about this: Against whom is this small \nbusiness family competing? It is competing against Holiday Inn, Howard \nJohnson's, Courtyard Marriott, and who all else--huge international \ncorporations that never pay a death tax--never pay it. But this closely \nheld family business can be devastated. And if we don't change the law, \nas we all know, in 2011, this tax will again be 55 percent of net worth \nover the base amount.\n  We need to be encouraging these kinds of businesses. I got a call \nyesterday from Robert Johnson, the founder and CEO of Black \nEntertainment Television. He told me that the death tax was going to \nmake it impossible for African Americans to continue to develop wealth. \nHe said he is competing against CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox. He is not as \nbig as they are, but he is competing. He has made some money. If \nsomething happens to him, the family is going to have to take out of \nhis business huge amounts of cash reserves. What then will happen? BET \nwill be put on the sale block, and it will be bought, as he said, by \nsome big conglomerate. It will not be bought by an African American \nbecause they won't have the money to do it. He said we are capping off \nthe growth rate, instead of allowing that company to devolve to his \nheirs so it would continue to be run in that fashion.\n  Think about a person who may own 5,000 acres of land, let's say. That \nsounds like a lot. They have managed well. They have been a good \nsteward for 50, 60 years. They saved money. They drove an old pickup \ntruck. They have a modest home. They are frugal. We know people like \nthat.\n  What about International Paper? They own millions of acres of land. \nInternational Paper will never pay a death tax. But yet this landowner \nwho is competing--maybe they have a forestry business--competing, in a \nway, directly against International Paper. But every generation of this \nfamily, Robert Johnson, the motel owner, has to pay a tax the big guys \ndon't pay. Do you want to ask why we are seeing consolidation of wealth \nin America today? I submit to you that is the reason. Independent \nbankers, funeral home directors, they are selling out in large numbers. \nThey can't afford to manage their business. They have to get liquid so \nif something happens to them, they can pay the death tax. It brings in \nless than 1.3 percent of the income to the United States Government. I \nsubmit the way it is working today is destroying competition. It is \nhurting, savaging, killing off vibrant, growing small businesses, the \nfamily-owned entities that need to be competing against the big guys.\n\n  It reminds me of going into a forest of trees and there is this \nlittle tree trying to grow up in the middle of the forest and somebody \njust comes in every generation and chops off the top of the little \ntree. How can it ever compete against the big guys if it has to pay a \ntax they don't pay?\n  I believe it is important for us for a lot of different reasons. This \nis why I think we ought to eliminate the whole thing: some of these \ncompanies are $50 million, $100 million companies, but they are tiny--\n$200 million, $300 million, but they are tiny compared to these big, \ninternational corporations. Polls show that the death tax is the most \nunfair tax--Americans consider it the most unfair tax because people \nhave already paid their money. You earn money, and then you pay, if you \nare in the higher income bracket, a 35-percent tax rate, and then you \nbuy an asset with it, and a few years later, you die, and Uncle Sam \ncomes in and he wants 55 percent of it. What kind of a tax system is \nthat? It is really a confiscation.\n  Also, this is very important: Any good tax should be clear, fair, \neasy to collect, and does not cost a lot of money to collect. When you \nevaluate the death tax by those standards, it is the worst tax of all.\n  Alicia Munnell, a professor of finance at Boston College and a former \nmember of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, has written \ntwo times that in her opinion the cost of compliance and avoidance--as \nthe big, wealthy people spend a lot of money trying to avoid this tax--\nmay be as high as the revenue raised. How horrible is that, to have a \ntax that costs as much to collect as it brings in in revenue?\n  I have a deep concern about the scoring that has been produced by the \nJoint Tax Committee on this death tax repeal. I do not believe it is \naccurate. I have not believed it has been accurate for quite some time. \nThe Wall Street Journal just devastated their analysis a couple of days \nago in an article. I believe it is absolutely incorrect. I would note \nthat they scored the reduction of the capital gains tax a few years \nago, reduced it from 20 to 15 percent, as costing the Federal \nGovernment billions of dollars. The truth is, the Federal tax revenues \nfrom capital gains increased when the capital gains tax was reduced, \nand they missed it by more than $80 billion. They had a reduction \nprojected, we ended up with a substantial increase, and the difference \nbetween their projection and reality was over $80 billion. Do you know \nthey won't tell us how they compute this death tax cost? They will not \ntell the Members of this Senate what their working numbers are.\n  So I will give some more information on my concerns about the score, \nbut I will again note that it brings in less than 1.3 percent of the \nrevenue to the Government. It is time to eliminate it. It will be great \nfor our economy. It will eliminate a tax that costs as much to \nadminister as it does to collect. It will stop savaging small \nbusinesses. It will stop preying on families during the most painful \ntime in their lives: the death of a loved one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Alabama, Mr. \nSessions, on his remarks.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, Senator Sessions is absolutely correct, \nSenator Gregg is absolutely correct, and this Senate will be absolutely \ncorrect if we vote to go to cloture so we can proceed on the total \nrepeal, or at least an additional repeal, of the estate tax. There are \na lot of reasons, but I want to try and make my point succinctly and I \nwant to make it briefly because I want to point out how punitive the \nestate tax is today.\n  Most Americans are employed by small business; 75, 76, 77 percent of \nall Americans are employed by small business. It may be a restaurant, \nit may be a laundry, it may be a farm, it may be a construction \ncompany, it may be a utility contractor just like the ones that are in \ntown today lobbying all of us for the best interests of their business. \nMost people work a lifetime to build a business. They employ people to \nwhom they pay income. The people to whom they pay income pay income\n\n[[Page S5581]]\n\ntaxes. Yet when the tragedy of death comes, an individual owner of a \nsmall business dies, immediately they are confronted with one of the \nmost punitive and confiscatory taxes that has ever been devised in the \nhistory of taxation.\n  Granted, we did a good job when we passed the accelerated \nimprovements in the unified credit or the deduction on the estate tax. \nThis year, based on the bill we passed a few years ago, there is a $2 \nmillion exemption, and that is a help, and it goes to $3.5 million in a \ncouple of years. Then, magically, the estate tax is repealed in 2010, \nonly to return to us a year later, to return to us at 55 percent. So we \nare asking people who work a lifetime to save and build a business, to \nplan, based on a tax that is here today, gone tomorrow, and then \nreturns with a vengeance a year later.\n\n  To best illustrate what the estate tax does to American small \nbusiness, ranchers, and family farmers, I would like to do a little \ndemonstration on the Senate floor. For the sake of argument, let's just \nround the 55 percent estate tax off to 50 percent, and let's assume for \na moment that a small business owner, a family farmer, passes away and \ndies and their estate becomes taxed at 50 percent. After the credit \nthat is available now, or when we get back to 2011, no credit at all, \nthe United States of America and the department of revenue, the IRS, \nwant to tell the heirs of that estate that within 9 months of the death \nof that individual, they want this much of that person's estate. If one \nsheet of paper is the whole estate, they want half of it in taxation.\n  So when the first generation owner of a small business passes that \nbusiness on to the second generation, after the Government gets its \nhalf, there is only this much left.\n  Let's assume that family is able, because of savings and because of \nborrowing and because of productivity, to pay that 50 percent tax \nwithout liquidating the business, and that second generation small \nbusiness owner operates that business, employs the workers in that \nbusiness, pays them the income that pays the taxes, but let's assume \nthat second generation person meets their demise. And when they die, \nbefore they can pass that family business on to the next generation, \nonce again, the IRS gets half of what is left.\n  So in two generations, what was a full estate ends up with three-\nfourths of it going to the United States Government, and one-fourth of \nit left to the individual or family. Of course, that is in reality not \nreally what happens because before that last passing takes place, that \nbusiness is sold or liquidated, or it is leveraged to such an extent \nthat the amount of cost of the debt service on the leverage makes that \nbusiness go from profitable to unprofitable. That is why the estate tax \nis punitive. That is why it is wrong for this country.\n  I want to address another point that Senator Sessions made that is so \nimportant for us to focus on as we listen to the two sides of this \ndebate tonight and tomorrow. You will have some come and they will take \nthat score on how much the repeal is going to cost us, and they will \ntalk about that score, saying that is a reason we should not repeal the \nestate tax or the death tax. I submit, as Senator Sessions did, that \nscore is dead wrong because just as the scoring of the reduction in the \ncapital gains tax was dead wrong a few years ago, this scoring is \nequally dead wrong and it is wrong for this reason: If that family \nbusiness that was reduced to almost nothing has to be sold, then along \nwith what is sold is the jobs that went with it, the income that went \nwith it, and the future taxes that were paid because of it.\n  Think of this for a second. If someone has stock they have to sell \nand liquidate in order to pay the one-time capital gains tax, then it \nis gone forever from the standpoint of the income production that they \notherwise would pay with dividends year in and year out. Wouldn't we \nrather have people hold assets such as businesses and stocks and real \nestate and pay taxes on its profitability and its income year after \nyear after year? Wouldn't we rather that happen than all at once to \ntake 50 percent, cause the business to be sold, the stock to be \nliquidated, the real estate to be divided, and the revenue never to be \npaid again? It is short-sighted and it is wrong.\n  I hope the Members of the Senate, when we come to the cloture vote \ntomorrow, will recognize the death tax is the third bite of the apple. \nWe charge people income tax when they earn income, with what is left \nthey make investments, and then as those investments pay dividends or \npay income, we tax that, and then we say: When you die, we want half of \nthat asset. It is wrong. It is wrong for individuals, it is wrong for \nfamily farmers, it is wrong for landowners, and it is wrong for \nAmerica.\n  I urge all of my colleagues when the cloture vote comes tomorrow to \nvote yes to bring about a meaningful debate on the repeal of the estate \ntax or the death tax, and let's take that third bite of the apple away \nfrom the Government and put it back in the hands of the people, so \nthose assets, farms, and investments can be productive, not just for \none year, but for a lifetime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator should note that he is on majority time by a previous \nunanimous consent agreement. Is there objection to the Senator \nproceeding? There being no objection, the Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Chair repeat his statement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is speaking under the majority \ntime previously agreed to under a unanimous consent agreement. I \npresume there is no objection to the Senator proceeding.\n  Mr. DODD. I hear no objection, Mr. President. Since no one is on the \nfloor, obviously, that makes it easier.\n\n\n                     Marriage Protection Amendment\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I can, I wanted to spend a couple of \nminutes on a matter that this body voted on this morning. I was \nunavoidably absent this morning at a family matter in Rhode Island, so \nI was not here for the vote. But I wanted to just take a minute or so \nhere to say to my colleagues and to others that had I been present this \nmorning, I would have voted no on the motion for cloture, and had \ncloture been invoked, I would have voted against the amendment. I am \nspeaking of the proposed constitutional amendment that would have \nbanned same-sex marriages.\n  Like many of my colleagues who have spoken on this matter, I believe \nthis is a matter that belongs in the States. This is not a matter that \nought to be a part of the Constitution. I have been here for a number \nof years in the Senate, and over the history of this great country of \nours there have been over 11,000--more than 11,000 proposed \nconstitutional amendments. The Congress and the Nation in its wisdom \nover the years have adopted only a handful of those proposals--27 is \nthe number of amendments that have been adopted since the formation of \nour country. The reason for that, of course, is the Founders insisted \nthat it be not an easy matter to amend the Constitution and that we \nought to amend the Constitution to correct problems in the governmental \nstructures or to expand the category of individual rights such as the \nfirst 10 amendments achieved in our Nation.\n  Our Nation's constitutional history clearly demonstrates that change \nto our Constitution is appropriate on only the rarest occasions--\nspecifically, to correct problems in the government structure or to \nexpand the category of individual rights such as the first 10 \namendments which compose the Bill of Rights. Notably, the amendment to \nestablish prohibition is the only time that the Federal Constitution \nwas amended for a reason other than those I just mentioned.\n  It was repealed 13 years after its enactment and has been judged by \nhistory to be a failure insofar as it sought to restrict personal \nliberty.\n  The Framers deliberately made it difficult to amend the Constitution. \nThey did not intend it to be subject to\n\n[[Page S5582]]\n\nthe passions and whims of the moment. Time has proven their wisdom. \nSince 1789, when the first Congress was convened, there have been \n11,413 proposals to amend the Constitution. Sixty-four have been \noffered in this Congress alone. Luckily, only 27 have been successful. \nIf all or even a substantial fraction of these proposed amendments were \nadopted, our founding document would today resemble a Christmas tree, a \ncivil and criminal code rather than a constitution, and the United \nStates would be a very different Nation.\n  It is unfortunate that the majority leadership of the Senate does not \nshare James Madison's view that the Constitution should only be amended \n``for certain, great, and extraordinary occasions.''\n  Supporters of this proposed amendment would like you to believe that \nthere is currently an ``assault'' on traditional marriage by some \nAmerican couples and families that warrants Federal action in the form \nof a constitutional amendment to ``protect'' the institution of \nmarriage. They have utterly failed to marshal even a minimal degree of \ncredible facts to support such a claim.\n  Indeed the facts suggest that there is no such crisis. The Defense of \nMarriage Act, DOMA, was enacted in 1996 to provide a federal definition \nof marriage and to stipulate that no state should be required to give \neffect to a law of any other State with respect to a definition of \nmarriage.\n  There has been no successful challenge to the DOMA in the decade \nsince its enactment. Courts have never identified a Federal right to \nsame-sex marriage. States have never been forced to recognize an out-\nof-state marriage that is inconsistent with its own laws.\n  And no church, temple, mosque, or synagogue has been forced to \nperform marriages inconsistent with the beliefs of those who worship in \nthem. For Congress to step in now and dictate to the States how they \nought to proceed in this matter thus runs counter to the facts. It also \nruns counter to the principles of federalism and personal liberty that \nmany proponents of this constitutional amendment claim to hold dear.\n  I am disappointed that we find ourselves spending valuable time on \nthe Senate floor debating this issue. Less than 2 years ago, the \nmajority leader brought the same measure to the Floor. It failed by a \nvote of 48 to 50. There is no reason to think that it will not fail \nagain.\n  It is no coincidence that approximately 5 months before the upcoming \nmidterm elections the Senator floor is being held hostage by the \nmajority's misguided priorities. I fear that some of those leading the \ncharge on this legislation are more interested in dividing Americans \nfor partisan gain than uniting the country to solve problems.\n  Make no mistake: married couples are under considerable strain these \ndays. But the cause of that strain is not the conduct of other American \ncouples going about their daily private lives. Instead, married couples \nand all Americans are feeling the strain of high gas prices, soaring \nhealth care costs, schools in need of reform, a sluggish economy, and a \nwar in Iraq in which American men and women are fighting with courage. \nYet this administration and others in this body have little to offer to \nrelieve these strains. Instead, they seek legislation that will only \ndivide and distract Americans from the common challenges we should be \nfacing together.\n  This proposed constitutional amendment is not the best use of our \ntime. We should be addressing the real needs of American families. We \nshould be legislating. That is what we are elected to do--to address \nissues like autism, underage drinking, the growing problem of obesity \namong our nation's children, and the threat of terrorism. But today we \nhave not been afforded that opportunity. Instead, today feels like \nGroundhog Day.\n  It is another election year and we are here discussing another issue \nthat has nothing to do with the great challenges of our time.\n  Only on one occasion did we deviate from that practice and that was \nthe adoption of the amendment dealing with the prohibition of the \nconsumption of alcoholic beverages. That was a complete deviation from \nthe two situations in which the Founders intended that we would amend \nthe Constitution of the United States.\n  I might point out that it was only a few years after the adoption of \nthe amendment on prohibition that it was repealed by the Congress of \nthe United States and the people across this country.\n  It would be a mistake, in my view, to repeat another error like that \nwhich was committed in the early part of the 20th century when we \nadopted the prohibition amendment.\n  Supporters of this amendment like to say that this debate is about an \nassault on the institution of marriage. I do not believe that to be the \ncase. I do believe, however, that there is currently an assault on \nfamilies. I am disappointed this body is not spending the time \nallocated for this debate talking about the important issues families \ntoday. For example, we could be talking about the bill dealing with \nautism that my colleague from Pennsylvania and I have authored and we \nare trying to get attention on. Obviously the issues of energy prices, \neducation, health care--there are any number of issues I can think of \nthat we might have spent time discussing. We should be trying to come \nup with some answers rather than debate a question which has marginal \nsignificance and minimal importance for most people and which ought \nreally to be left to the States.\n  Let me also suggest that the motivations behind this may not be \nhelping families but instead inciting a political debate for the \nelections coming up this fall. What worries me more than anything else, \nhowever, is I think it is designed to make people angry, to divide us \nas a country. I am deeply concerned about the growing divisions \noccurring in our Nation. This is a time when we ought to be coming \ntogether, when our leadership ought to be asking us to sit down and try \nto come up with answers on some of the overwhelming problems we face--\nnot problems that are so overwhelming we can't answer them. Instead, we \nare spending that valuable time on a matter that is clearly designed to \ndo nothing more than inflame the passions of people in this country \nrather than appealing to calm, to rationality, to common sense, to good \ndiscourse as a way of addressing the underlying issues. This is a great \ndisappointment.\n  Again, I would have voted no on the motion to invoke cloture. I am \npleased my colleagues from both parties, in a bipartisan way, rejected \nthat cloture motion. It was a good conclusion reached here, and I \nregret I was not able to be here to cast a vote along with my \ncolleagues who expressed a similar point of view.\n\n\n                             The Estate Tax\n\n  If I may, I wish to turn to the matter at hand; that is, the debate \nregarding the estate tax. The last time this body was scheduled to \nconsider legislation to repeal the estate tax, the majority leader \ndecided to postpone consideration of this bill in the wake of the \ndevastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina. The general consensus was it \nwas unseemly for us to be talking about having one-half of one \npercent--and that is what we are talking about, one-half of 1 percent \nof the population of this country--receive a bonanza, if you will, by \nrepealing the obligation to share part of their estates to contribute \nto the growth and benefit of our Nation. The decision was it would be \nunseemly.\n  In fact, my good friend from Iowa, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, for whom I have a great deal of respect, said, ``It's a \nlittle unseemly to be talking about doing away with or enhancing the \nestate tax at a time when people are suffering.''\n  I agree with my colleague from Iowa. I agreed with him then; I agree \nwith him now. If it was unseemly to be talking about enhancing the \nwealth of the wealthiest in our society at a time when the Nation was \nsuffering from the devastation of Hurricane Katrina only a few short \nmonths ago, I suggest that problems have not abated so substantially \nthat we can now make the case that it is no longer unseemly, if you \nwill, to use his language, to adopt a provision here that would make it \nfar more difficult for us to address all of our other priorities as a \nNation.\n  I hope our colleagues will agree and join with others in voting \nagainst cloture on the motion to proceed to what I consider to be \nirresponsible legislation.\n  Today's discussion is about priorities, as it always should be. I \nhave\n\n[[Page S5583]]\n\nsupported lower taxes for working Americans, including responsible \nestate tax reform. I think it is wrong to have excessive estate taxes \nimposed on ordinary farmers and small businesses owners out there who \ntry to leave those businesses or land to their families. Because of the \nmodest incomes most people in these groups make, they could find it \nimpossible to do so under an excessive tax.\n  I note the presence of my good friend from Arkansas on the Senate \nfloor who speaks eloquently about the farmers in her State who have \nbeen left, generation after generation, farms and land for succeeding \ngenerations to continue their great traditions. The Presiding Officer \ncomes from a State with a strong agricultural tradition. All of our \nStates have strong small business components, and all of us understand \nthe importance of allowing those families to pass on to succeeding \ngenerations the ability to continue those efforts. But I hope my \ncolleagues agree as well, that talking about the total elimination of \nthis estate tax is, I think, irresponsible. It goes too far when we \nstart talking about providing such a massive benefit for only the \nlargest one-half of 1 percent of estates.\n  I represent the most affluent State in the United States on a per \ncapita basis. I presume as a percentage of my population I have a \nlarger number of estates that would benefit from total repeal than most \nof the other members of this body, with the exception of my colleague, \nSenator Lieberman. I can tell you that the few estates that can benefit \nas a result of the distinction we are making between reform of the \nestate tax and total repeal seems to go too far, considering the \nrevenue loss it would mean to our country.\n  We are talking about a revenue loss on an annual basis that exceeds \nthe entire amount of money we commit to elementary and secondary \neducation. Think of that. The entire amount of money in the Federal \nbudget toward elementary and secondary education would be lost as a \nresult of the complete and total repeal, rather than a modest, \nintelligent, thoughtful, rational reform of this estate tax. We should \nnot bankrupt our Nation's future for a measure that would deliver no \nbenefit to anyone outside a few extremely wealthy estates.\n  I might point out that some of the most wealthy Americans, people who \nwould benefit the most from this total repeal, have been the loudest, \nclearest voices urging us not to do so. We ought to take note that the \nGates family, people like Warren Buffett, people like John Kluge, \npeople who have made great fortunes in this country and made those \ngreat fortunes in their own time, through creative work, not inherited \nwealth, are urging us, despite the fact that they would benefit to the \ntune of billions of dollars with a total repeal--listen to the Warren \nBuffetts, the Bill Gateses, the John Kluges, when they tell you this \nwould be an unwise decision to make to just completely repeal a tax \nthat is so important for continuing our ability to meet our \nobligations.\n  Let's not forget we are a nation at war, with American troops \nfighting and dying in Iraq and Afghanistan, at a terrible human and \nmonetary cost. Repealing the estate tax will cost some $776 billion \nover 10 years, which would fully be applied beginning after 2011. Not a \npenny of this cost would be offset. It would all be added to our \nNation's debt, which is already now at $8.4 trillion.\n\n  I made the case a few weeks ago--how big is $8.4 trillion? If we were \nto go out on the Capitol steps out here and hand out a hundred-dollar \nbill every single second, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, how long do \nyou think it would take to pay off $8.4 trillion? I will tell you the \nanswer. It would take more than 2600 years--24 hours a day, 7 days a \nweek, a one-hundred-dollar bill every second, handing it out. It would \ntake 2,635 years. That is the amount of debt we have accumulated over \nthe last few years, and now we are about to add to that to the tune of \nalmost another trillion dollars here if you take what the revenue loss \nwould be and the added interest cost of some $213 billion. That would \nbe the revenue loss that would result from repealing the estate tax. \nMore than a trillion dollars that would benefit no one at all outside \nthe largest one-half of 1 percent of the estates in the United States; \n99.5 percent of the estates in the United States would not gain at all \nby the proposals to have a modification or reform of the estate tax. \nEach year of repeal on average would cost roughly the same in today's \nterms as everything the Government now spends on homeland security and \neducation.\n  Over the past 5\\1/2\\ years, the current administration has radically \naltered our Nation's economic and social well-being, in my view. Median \nincomes have stagnated, poverty rates have risen, and more and more \npeople are living without health insurance. Our troops have struggled \nwith inadequate body armor and other necessities of battle. Farmers, \nworkers, and small business owners are contending with rising interest \nrates, higher energy and health care costs, and growing global \ncompetition. While these problems have grown, the administration has \nseverely reduced our Nation's ability to meet them by driving our \nFederal budget from surplus into deep deficit.\n  Since the current President took office, the Federal budget has \ndeclined from a surplus of $128 billion to a deficit of more than $300 \nbillion. The national debt has risen to $8.4 trillion. In just 5 and a \nhalf years, the administration has added more debt from foreign \ncreditors than every other President in the history of the United \nStates combined--in the last 5 years.\n  Repealing the estate tax would make these problems far worse, not \nbetter, and further hurt America's ability to address our most pressing \nissues.\n  A few months ago, the administration and the majority of this body \nenacted a budget reconciliation bill, the so-called Deficit Reduction \nAct. This bill made deep cuts to health care, childcare, and education, \nwith the burden falling most heavily on working Americans--in \nparticular on low-income parents and children, the elderly, and people \nwith disabilities. The American people were told these cuts were \nnecessary because of the deep budget deficits our country was facing. \nYet here we are today, having been told only a few months ago that this \ngreat budget reconciliation act was necessary, despite the fact that we \nare going to ask those who are the least capable in many cases of \nproviding for their needs, feeling the tremendous pressure they are, \nhere we are today only a few weeks later being told that we can afford \nto take $1 trillion out of the budget to serve one-half of 1 percent of \nthe estates in this great country of ours.\n  Where is the logic in that? Mr. President, 99.5 percent of the \nestates in our country would not be adversely affected by what we are \ntalking about. They would not pay an estate tax. Only one-half of 1 \npercent would. Yet $1 trillion gets lost as a result of that decision, \nover the next 10 years, at a time, as I mentioned earlier, when we are \nnot paying for the war and we find ourselves in tremendous need if we \nstart talking about education, health care, and homeland security, just \nto mention two or three items.\n  Some proponents of the estate tax repeal have propagated the myth \nthat the estate tax disproportionately harms farmers and small \nbusinesses by forcing them to sell their family farm or business in \norder to pay the tax. This just is not true. It is a scare tactic used \nby those who will benefit from repeal to create support for their \ncause. In reality, when the New York Times asked the American Farm \nBureau Federation for real-life examples of a family farmer forced to \nsell by the estate tax, not a single example could be found. Not a \nsingle one.\n  Contrary to the misinformation that has been spread, no one but the \nvery largest estates would ever pay this tax on inherited wealth. This \nyear, an individual can pass on as much as $2 million and a couple can \npass on as much as $4 million to their heirs, completely free of any \ntaxation whatsoever. With these exemptions, 99.5 percent of all the \nestates in the United States would owe no tax at all. Those that will \nowe, only owe on the value of their estate that exceeds the $2 or $4 \nmillion that I just mentioned. With the exemption levels scheduled to \nrise in 2009 to $3.5 million for individuals and $7 million for \ncouples, the percentage who will owe a single cent in estate tax falls \nto a mere 0.3 percent of the population that would pay any estate tax \nat all.\n\n[[Page S5584]]\n\nSo 99.7 percent of the American population would have no obligation \nwhatsoever. Yet we are about to enact legislation here that would \nrepeal this altogether.\n  I do not understand that at all. How do you explain to people today \nthat your child or your spouse serving in Iraq or Afghanistan? We are \nbeing told we don't have enough money for body armor or to up-armor the \nvehicles they drive, or that homeland security has to be cut because we \ndon't have the revenues to support it. Yet we turn around and do \nsomething like this? Where is the logic in this? Under these rules, the \nnumber of Americans affected by the estate tax has declined \ndramatically already under current law, from 50,000 people in 2000 to \nonly 13,000 today, and by 2009 the number will fall to 7,000. Out of a \nnation of 300 million people, 7,000 people in our 50 States would not \nbe obligated to pay any estate tax at all.\n  Seven-thousand out of three hundred million, yet we lose $1 trillion \nin revenue.\n  Again, where is the logic or common sense in a proposal like that \ngiven the damage it would do?\n  As I said, my State of Connecticut ranks consistently year after year \nat or near the top of the Nation in per capita income and other such \nmeasures. In my State and across America, people of all incomes have \nworked hard, obviously, to get where they are.\n  I don't like class warfare. I don't like drawing those distinctions. \nMany of these people I mentioned, pay taxes and have worked hard, and I \nrespect that.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to some of the men and women who have \naccumulated the greatest wealth as a result of their ingenuity and hard \nwork. What are they saying about this in terms of the benefit to the \ncountry and the cost it would have?\n  In my State, I probably have a greater percentage of constituents \nthan almost any other State in the country who would benefit if there \nis a total repeal. I stand here today, telling you that an overwhelming \nmajority of the very people who would benefit from this, think it goes \ntoo far; that we are going too far with this proposal.\n  I urge my colleagues to join those who have urged us to be more \nmodest, to have a more commonsense approach than repeal or near-repeal. \nAgain, it would be a major failure to lose the revenue equal to that \nwhich we spend on all of the education for elementary and secondary \nschool students, all of the spending on homeland security, to once \nagain drive us further and further into debt. I think it is a great \ntragedy to be passing that on to the coming generations, to say we want \nto give a tax break only to the top five-tenths of 1 percent, or three-\ntenths of 1 percent of the population. That is an indictment that \nfuture generations will look back on and ask: What were they thinking \nat the beginning of the 21st century that they would take such a \nsignificant step as to deprive this Nation of the ability to have the \nrevenue we need in order to meet our obligations?\n  When the vote on cloture on this matter occurs, I urge Members to \nvote no.\n  There is a way to do this, and I think many of us are willing to \nsupport responsible reform in the estate tax area. But the notion of \ntotal repeal, I think, is highly irresponsible.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in the condemnation of that suggestion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n\n\n                     NATIONAL HUNGER AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to spend \na few moments to talk about the 36 million Americans, including 13 \nmillion children, who live on the verge of hunger.\n  I want to divert our conversation a little bit. I have actually \nwaited quite some time to be able to speak about it. I started \nyesterday trying to get just a few minutes on the floor to bring about \nan awareness because today is National Hunger Awareness Day.\n  I often think about the children and the working American families \nwho struggle to make ends meet. But I focus my thoughts and prayers on \nthem today because today is National Hunger Awareness Day, 1 day out of \nour year. I started yesterday trying to grab 5 minutes where we could \nbring our attention to something so incredibly important and something \nso easy to fix.\n  There is a time when Americans are called to remember the hungry \nchildren and adults living across our great Nation. Most importantly, \nit is a day when we are called to put our words into actions and to \nhelp end hunger in our communities and across America.\n  I guess the realization that I have come to in these last 24 hours \nis, I have searched just to capture 5 minutes on the floor of the \nSenate. I suppose I could have submitted my comments for the Record. \nAnd maybe I am foolish to think by coming to the floor I could spark \njust a little bit of interest in my colleagues or others across this \nNation to think about an issue that affects all of us--an issue where \nour fellow man is hungry, or another mother has a child out there that \nis suffering from hunger, that we can't stop for just a moment and \nrealize that hunger is a disease that has a cure. It has a cure--a cure \nthat we can provide, a cure that we all know about. And, if we took the \ntime to think about it, to address it, we could actually cure this \ndisease.\n  It is hard to find 5 minutes, it is hard to come down here and really \nmake the difference that we want to make, but I believe this day and \nthis issue are far too important to miss again the opportunity to talk \nabout 36 million Americans living in food insecurity.\n  Two years ago today, I joined with my friends and colleagues, Senator \nSmith, Senator Dole, and Senator Durbin to form the Senate Hunger \nCaucus. At that time, we pledged to raise awareness about the hunger \nexperienced by millions of Americans, a majority of which are children \nand elderly, and to forge a bipartisan effort to end hunger in our \nNation.\n  I am proud that we are working with local, State, and national \nantihunger organizations to raise awareness about hunger, to build \npartnership, and develop solutions to end hunger.\n  An example of a bipartisan initiative to end hunger is the Hunger \nFree Communities Act which I introduced along with Senators Durbin, \nSmith, and Lugar. This bill calls for a renewed national commitment to \nending hunger in the United States by 2015. Yet we find it hard to find \n5 minutes to focus our attention on such an incredible issue.\n  It reaffirms congressional commitment to protecting the funding and \nintegrity of Federal food and nutrition programs, and creates a \nnational grant program to support community-based antihunger efforts in \nfighting the disease on the battlefield, right there at the line of \nattack in our communities.\n  I am also proud to be a cosponsor of the FEED Act, the bill that \nwould award grants to organizations that effectively combat hunger \nwhile creating opportunity by combining ``food rescue'' programs with \njob training--not just feeding a fish but teaching a man or a woman how \nto fish so that they do not just eat for a day, that they feed \nthemselves for a lifetime.\n  Close to one-third of the food in this country that is processed and \nprepared goes to waste--one-third, whether it is in places such as \nWashington where there are multiple receptions going on at one time, \nbanquets and other events that happen across the country. One-third of \nthat food goes to waste.\n\n  This bill would help organizations safely recover unserved or unused \nfood while providing culinary skills training to unemployed \nindividuals. Two birds with one stone--using something that otherwise \nwould be thrown away. How simple that seems and yet how hard it is to \nbring it forward into the light of day and talk about making that \neffort a reality.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these worthy and commonsense pieces \nof legislation.\n  If it is so hard to find 5 minutes just to talk about it, I wonder \nhow long it is going to take us to pass these commonsense pieces of \nlegislation.\n  Some people may ask: What can I do to help end hunger in America?\n  I want to talk about some of the ways Americans can help join the \nhunger relief effort. Acting on this call to feed the hungry is \nimportant, and I urge all Americans who are able to take part in ending \nthis disease.\n  One critical component of this effort is the willingness of Congress \nand the American people to support the Federal food and nutrition \nprograms. These programs provide an essential\n\n[[Page S5585]]\n\nsafety net to working Americans, preventing the most vulnerable among \nus from suffering and even dying from malnutrition. Our continued \ninvestment in these programs is vital to the health of this Nation.\n  Why does it come to mind right now? Think about all of those children \nacross this great country who have received the nutrition they need in \nschool during the school year as school lets out for the summer. Where \nwill they go for that nutritious breakfast? Where will they go for that \nlunch that they need to sustain them because there is no dinner waiting \nat home?\n  These are critical and important programs. Without spending the time \nand the effort to not only make them a reality but properly fund them \nin a way where they can actually meet the needs of the children across \nthis country will take our attention.\n  The most significant of these programs is the Food Stamp Program. It \nprovides nutritious food to over 23 million Americans a year. More \nAmericans find themselves in need of this program every single year. As \ntheir wages are stagnant, as they have less and less opportunity to \nclimb a ladder of opportunity because they may not be getting the \neducation they need, they are finding more and more dependency on \nprograms like this to be able to feed their families.\n  I understand our current budget constraints. I know we all do. Yet I \ndidn't create this mess. The spending that has been freewheeling in \nthis Congress over the last several years has been unbelievable. Yet as \nmy colleagues mentioned, we failed to adequately support and fund \nissues such as our veterans' benefits; issues like educating our \nchildren and providing them with the skills they need to be \ncompetitive.\n  I come here to talk about the main sustenance of life. I understand \nthese budget constraints, but I believe as one man to another, as one \nwoman to another, one human being to another, food, simple nutrition, \nis something we cannot turn a blind eye to. Even in these tight fiscal \ntimes, I believe that we have to maintain our commitment to feed the \nhungry among us. We must first protect programs such as the Food Stamp \nProgram, the National School Breakfast and School Lunch Program, the \nSummer Feeding Program, the WIC, and the Children and Adult Care Food \nProgram. These are all critical programs that keep Americans who are on \nthe verge of hunger and destitution from finding themselves there \npermanently.\n  Another important tool for local organizations is the Community Food \nand Nutrition Program, and with support from this program, the Arkansas \nHunger Coalition has sponsored a Web site, a quarterly newsletter, an \nannual conference, a mini grant program, along with many civic, school, \nand community presentations on hunger which raise public awareness and \npromote innovative solutions.\n  Organizations such as the Arkansas Hunger Coalition operate on \nlimited budgets. Yet they are a vital source of information for food \npantries, soup kitchens, and shelters that together work to share the \nimportance of food security to the people of our home State of \nArkansas.\n  I urge Americans to contact their congressional representatives to \nvoice their support for these nutritional programs. This critical issue \nof ending hunger, the unbelievable number of hungry Americans is \nsomething that we have to bring greater awareness to not just today but \nevery day.\n  I urge my colleagues to protect them from cuts and structural changes \nthat will undermine their ability to serve our Nation's most vulnerable \ncitizens.\n  In addition to the Federal food programs, eliminating hunger in \nAmerica requires the help of community organizations. Government \nprograms provide a basis for support, but they cannot do the work \nalone. Community and faith-based organizations are essential to \nlocating and rooting out hunger wherever it persists.\n  We rely on the work of local food banks and food pantries, soup \nkitchens, and community action centers across America to go where \ngovernment cannot. The reason I have stayed so persistent in coming to \nthe floor of this Senate to talk about this issue on a day that we have \ndesignated for awareness is because I tried so desperately to put \nmyself in the shoes of other mothers who are not perhaps as lucky as I \nam. When a child looks into your eyes and says: Mommy, I am hungry, \nthey have no response, whereas I do.\n  This is a critical issue for us as a nation. It shows where the \nfabric of our community and our country lies. It shows where our \npriorities are, and it shows who we are as Americans and what values we \ntruly grasp for our fellow man.\n  Recently, I have been so proud as my twin boys have gotten \ninvitations to birthday parties. There is a note at the bottom of the \ninvitation. It says: Please don't bring a gift, but in lieu of a gift \nwould you please give to a worthy organization, our local food bank or \nshelter.\n  My children with their birthday coming up soon said: Mom, we don't \nneed those gifts again this year. Let's add something for those people \nwho need it the most. Let's make sure that we have fun at our party but \nthat we don't take the gift that we don't need and instead ask our \nfriend to help us in feeding the hungry and sheltering the homeless.\n  I will try, and I know my colleagues will, too, to work as hard as we \ncan to provide the resources these community organizations need to \ncontinue with the difficult but necessary work they perform, to \nencourage our neighbors, our children, our schools, and others to be as \nactively involved as they possibly can.\n  Private corporations and small businesses also have a role to play in \neliminating hunger in our great Nation. Our corporations and small \nbusinesses generate most of our Nation's health and have throughout \nhistory supported many of our greatest endeavors. Many corporations and \nbusinesses already contribute to efforts to eliminate hunger. I hope \nothers will begin to participate as opportunities to do so present \nthemselves in the future.\n  A couple of great examples of how business and nonprofits can partner \nto feed hungry people occurred these past few months. Together with \nAmerica's Second Harvest, Tyson Food, in my home State of Arkansas, \ndonated 6 million pounds of protein--one of the more difficult elements \nof nutrition to get into food banks is protein--6 million pounds of \nprotein from one corporate citizen. Wal-Mart raised $10 million to \nsupport food banks all across this country. I am so grateful to these \ncompanies and to nonprofit organizations for their leadership in this \neffort to feed those who have limited access to food and nutrition.\n  I have also seen some of the important work being done by \norganizations in the local Washington, DC, area. We see it all around \nus. All we have to do is open our eyes and make sure we are aware. The \nArlington Food Assistance Center works to provide food to those in need \nin the Arlington, VA, area. I have supported some of their efforts \nthrough the local school drive. Not only is it important in terms of \nproviding the needs of food assistance through the Arlington food bank \nsystem and the assistance center, but think what it does for our \nchildren. It gives them a learning experience of how they, too, can \ngive back not just to their community or their school but to their \nfellow man, someone desperately in need of a nutritious meal, a family \nwho needs a nutritious breakfast.\n  Think of what it teaches our children. Despite the fact that \nArlington County is one of the wealthiest areas in the country, plenty \nof local residents do not have enough to eat. The Arlington Food \nAssistance Center seeks to remedy the problem by distributing bread and \nvegetables, meat, milk, eggs, and other food items. Our church group \nroutinely goes for a ``gleaning'' program where local farmers allow us \nto get into the fields and collect part of their crops that have been \nleft in order to provide fresh fruits and vegetables in our area food \nbanks.\n  Lastly, this effort needs the commitment of individual Americans. Our \ngreatest national strength is the power that comes from individual \ninitiative and the collective will of the American people. I believe we \nare called by a higher power to care for our fellow man and our fellow \nwomen.\n  As a person of faith, I feel I am called to serve the poor and the \nhungry. I know many of my colleagues agree. If we believe in this call, \nwe must live it every day in our schools and in our\n\n[[Page S5586]]\n\nhomes, in our workplaces and our places of worship, in our volunteering \nand in our prayer. This personal responsibility is a great one, but it \nholds tremendous power. As we have seen throughout American history, \nwhen individuals in this Nation bind together to serve a common cause, \nthey can achieve the greatest of accomplishments. By sharing the many \nblessings and resources our great Nation provides, I am confident we \ncan alleviate hunger, a disease that we know there is a cure for, both \nat home and abroad.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to take a moment to honor on this day of \nawareness the very brave men and women and children who live in food \ninsecurity and whom we have an opportunity to serve.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Arkansas yield for a question?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Absolutely, I yield to my good friend from Illinois who \nhas done so much on the issue of hunger.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me say at the outset it is my great honor to cochair \nwith the Senator from Arkansas this effort relative to hunger, hunger \nawareness. It has brought us together in terms of offering resolutions, \nin terms of offering legislation, filling grocery bags. We have done a \nlot of things together in this effort.\n  I am fortunate to work with Senator Lincoln. She comes to this issue \ndriven by her faith and her family. They are linked together in her \nspeech today and in her life. There is hardly a decision she makes--I \nknow from having worked with her for so many years--that is not driven \nby her understanding of the impact of life on her family and what it \nmeans to so many other families.\n  As we have met in a variety of places, filling boxes and bags with \ngroceries, we both had cause to reflect on what leads to hunger in a \nprosperous Nation. How does a country so rich as America end up with \nhungry people? How can this be? Yet we know, as she knows, it turns out \nto be a lot of people are working hard to avoid hunger. It can be a \nmother with a low-wage, minimum wage job, a mother who has been stuck \nin a minimum wage that this Congress has refused to increase for 9 \nstraight years. Think about that: $5.15 an hour for 9 years. This poor \nmother, trying to keep her family together, put her kids in a \nbabysitter's hands or daycare, and then put food on the table finds \nthat many times one job, sometimes two jobs are not enough, and she \nends up at that food pantry.\n  We expect the poorest of the poor to come in there and many times \nfind the working poor. That is the face of hunger found with many of \nour senior citizens. I cannot imagine these poor people, many of them \nalone in life, struggling with medical bills and fixed incomes, never \nknowing where they are going to turn for a helping hand, who stumble \ninto a food pantry where they can find a loving face, a warm embrace \nand a bag full of groceries to keep them going.\n  I found that this last week when I was up in Chicago at the Native \nAmerican Center on the North Side where a lot of American Indian \nfamilies rely on their pantry. I said hello to the ladies who were \nrunning it. They said, sadly: Senator, business is just too darn good \nhere. There are a lot of people coming in from all around the city of \nChicago.\n  I find it in my hometown, Springfield, IL, at St. John's bread line, \nwhich has been there for years. I have been over there serving food \nonce in a while. So many people rely on them.\n  In Chicago, only 9 percent of the half-million people who seek \nservices from the Chicago Food Depository are homeless. The rest have a \nhome to go to but nothing in the refrigerator and nothing in the \ncupboard. These people cannot afford the food they need.\n\n  Think of that: 37 million people in America, this great and \nprosperous country, living in poverty; many low-income families \nsupported by jobs that do not pay a livable wage in a country where \nthis Congress will not enact a law to raise that minimum wage. It could \nbe that paying for health care has caused many of these families to be \nunable to afford food.\n  America's Second Harvest released a national hunger study showing \nthat in Chicago 41 percent of households neglected their food budget to \ncover utility costs. You can understand that in the cold winter in \nChicago. Last year, natural gas bills went up 20 percent. We were \nlucky. It could have been worse. And many of these families had to \ndecide: Pay the utility bill, risk a cutoff or buy some food? It may be \na combination of factors, but the food budget is often the first thing \nthey cut.\n  Today, June 7, is National Hunger Awareness Day. Senator Lincoln and \nI have come to the Senate encouraging our colleagues and all those \nfollowing this debate to celebrate and commend the heroic efforts of so \nmany emergency food banks, soup kitchens, school meal programs, \ncommunity pantries, and so many others that make a difference in \nfighting hunger.\n  I don't know if Senator Lincoln's hometown is the same as mine, but \nthere is a day each year when the letter carriers all pick up food. You \nput out the bags of food for them. They pick them up. God bless the \nletter carriers; they collect that food, give it to the pantries to \ngive to hungry people. Here are men and women who probably are footsore \nfrom all the miles they have to walk, and they walk an extra mile for \nthe hungry of America. My hat is off to them.\n  Federal nutrition programs are critically important and they are not \nreaching enough people. Many parents still skip meals so their kids can \neat. Many kids do not have the balanced meals they deserve.\n  Let me add, too, I am sure the Senator, as a mother of twins, will \nappreciate this. When I go to school lunch programs, sometimes it is \ndepressing. Giving kids a helping of tater tots, next to a slice of \npizza is not exactly my idea of fighting obesity, encouraging \nnutrition, and feeding kids the right things.\n  We need to have good nutrition programs. We need to work overtime to \nmake sure the food given to these kids does make a difference. At the \nNettlehorst School on Broadway Avenue in Chicago, which I visited a few \nweeks ago, we opened a salad bar for the kids for school lunch. Guess \nwhat. They were all crowded around, filling up their salad trays. They \nwill eat good food if you present it in the right way. We need good \nnutrition programs with good food to make sure our kids grow the right \nway.\n  Hunger drains the strength of the people who, for a variety of \nreasons, are unable to provide enough food, or the right kinds of food, \nfor themselves or their family. A few blocks away, near a school over \non Pennsylvania Avenue, in Southeast Washington, DC, get there early \nenough in the morning, around 8 o'clock, stand by the drugstore and \nwatch these kids file in to buy bags of potato chips and pop or soft \ndrinks to eat as breakfast on the way to school. Too many of these \nchildren rely on that for their only nutrition. I wish their parents \ncould do better or do more. I wonder, sometimes, if they are able to. I \ndon't know if they are. But what those kids are buying costs them \nmoney. Maybe those parents could have done a better job. Maybe the \nschool could do a better job. As a Nation, we all need to do a better \njob.\n  In a land of abundance, the kind of sacrifice that many families have \nto make to feed their family members is deplorable and unnecessary. We \nshould end hunger in the United States. Working together, we can.\n  I salute my colleague from the State of Arkansas. The hour is late, \nand she has a couple of kids at home waiting for her to get home, maybe \nto fix dinner. But whatever the reason, she took the time to come to \nthe Senate tonight to remind all of us of our civic responsibility, our \nsocial responsibility and our moral responsibility to view hunger as a \nchallenge that we can face and conquer.\n  I see the Senator from Alabama is probably here to speak. I have \nanother statement to make, but I will defer to him since he has been \nwaiting. Then when he is finished, I will ask to speak again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMINT.) The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                               Death Tax\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, with regard to the death tax, I will be \noffering some remarks later in the process that deal with the estimated \ncost of the elimination of this tax which does not account for the lack \nof stepped-up basis that will not occur if the death tax is eliminated \nand other factors that demonstrate that the allegations being made \nabout large losses of revenue are not true. That is an important\n\n[[Page S5587]]\n\nfactor in the debate. I will not go over that tonight.\n  I take this moment on another subject to read to the Senate a letter \nwe received, received by Senator Frist, the majority leader, today, \nfrom the administration, William Moschella, U.S. Department of Justice. \nHe deals with the Native Hawaiian bill.\n  I said earlier today, the Native Hawaiian legislation is exceedingly \nimportant. It has to do with whether this great republic is going to \nallow itself, through the vote of its own legislature, to create within \nits own boundaries a sovereign entity, a sovereign Nation, that, \naccording to those who support it, even on the Web site of the State of \nHawaii, indicates that it could result in an independent nation being \ncreated. So any principled approach--and the Senate, of all bodies in \nthe Government, ought to be principled; we should think about the long-\nterm--to dealing with this issue should convince us in the most stark \nway that this is not a path down which we should travel. This is not a \nway this Nation should go.\n\n  We should say no now and no to any other attempt to divide, balkanize \nor disrupt the unity of our Nation. We had a Civil War over that. The \nPresiding Officer is from South Carolina. I am from Alabama. That issue \nwas settled in the 1860s. We don't need to go back to it.\n  It is important that we read the language of the Department of \nJustice and how they deal with it. It is very similar to strong \nlanguage from the U.S. Civil Rights Commission that also voted to \noppose this legislation.\n  The letter is to Majority Leader Bill Frist:\n\n       Dear Mr. Leader: The Administration strongly opposes \n     passage of S. 147. As noted recently by the U.S. Civil Rights \n     Commission, this bill risks ``further subdivid[ing] the \n     American people into discrete subgroups accorded varying \n     degrees of privilege.'' As the President has said, ``we must \n     honor the great American tradition of the melting pot, which \n     has made us one nation out of many peoples.'' This bill would \n     reverse that great American tradition and divide people by \n     their race. Closely related to that policy concern, this bill \n     raises the serious threshold constitutional issues that arise \n     anytime legislation seeks to separate American citizens into \n     race-related classifications rather than ``according to \n     [their] own merit[s] and essential qualities.'' Indeed, in \n     the particular context of native Hawaiians, the Supreme Court \n     and lower Federal courts have invalidated state legislation \n     containing similar race-based qualifications for \n     participation in government entities and programs.\n       While this legislation seeks to address this issue by \n     affording federal tribal recognition to native Hawaiians, the \n     Supreme Court has noted that whether native Hawaiians are \n     eligible for tribal status is a ``matter of dispute'' and \n     ``of considerable moment and difficulty.'' Given the \n     substantial historical, structural and cultural differences \n     between native Hawaiians as a group and recognized federal \n     Indian tribes, tribal recognition is inappropriate for native \n     Hawaiians and would still raise difficult constitutional \n     issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             William E. Moschella,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  I am pleased the Department of Justice has given this letter to us. \nIt represents an opinion of the agency of Government charged with \njustice. The Department of Justice is well aware of equal protection \nrequirements. They are well aware of voting rights and the 15th \namendment. They are well aware of all of the issues involving tribal \nquestions. They have to deal with that on a regular basis. They \nunderstand this. This is part of what they do. The import of this \nletter is to say that the Native Hawaiians do not comply with tribal \nrequirements. Indeed, a lawyer for the State of Hawaii has admitted as \nmuch in previous filings with the Supreme Court. It is not a tribal \nsituation. It is a unique situation.\n  We are going to create under the bill, if the bill were to become \nlaw--hopefully, it will not, but I am troubled by the prospect of maybe \neven proceeding to this bill tomorrow. It is almost breathtaking to me \nthat that would occur. But what we will see as we go forward is that we \nare talking about creating an entity, a sovereign entity which will be \ncontrolled by individuals who are given a right to vote. And their \nright to vote in this entity will be entirely contingent upon their \nrace.\n  Indian tribes were different. Indian tribes were entities with long-\nestablished governing councils. They are native groups that have had \ncenturies of cohesion. Many of them entered into treaties with the \nUnited States and they were given certain rights and privileges. But \nHawaii came into the Union; 94 percent voted to come into the Union. \nThey bragged and were quite proud of their melting pot reputation. They \nnever suggested that they would later want to come back and have this \nsovereign entity be created. The reason it is fundamentally unfair is \nthat there was a queen in Hawaii in the 1880s, but she did not preside \nover a tribe. She didn't preside over a racial group. She presided over \nthe people in her territory of all races and entities. There were \nAsians, Irish, Filipinos, Chinese, and others that were there. They \nwould not get to vote in this race-based government, even if they were \nthere at the time she was queen. And she never pretended that she was \npresiding only over Native Hawaiians. Of course, I don't know how you \ncould say a third-generation Irish or Chinese American or Japanese \nAmerican who was in Hawaii, they are not a Native Hawaiian anyway, but \nthat is the way they are defining this. There is only that certain \nracial group.\n  So these would not be able to participate, even though they were \nmultigenerational residents of Hawaii at the time they became a State, \nat the time the queen's government was ended.\n  It is not the right thing to do. It would create a precedent of far-\nreaching implications and would jeopardize the unity and cohesion of \nour Government and would, for the first time, create a sovereign entity \nwithin the United States. You are not allowed to vote in it unless you \nbelong a certain race.\n  It is a bad idea of great significance. We should not go down that \nroad. I hope the Senate will not.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Chicago Schools\n\n  Mr. President, in 1932, America had suffered through three grinding \nyears of the Great Depression. Millions of Americans were out of work \nand out of hope. Many people feared that capitalism, as we knew it, and \ndemocracy had failed. Campaigning for President that year, Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt promised the American people bold, persistent \nexperimentation to alleviate the crisis facing this Nation.\n  He said: It is commonsense to take a method and try it. If it fails, \nadmit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.\n  I have just finished a book by Jonathan Alter of Newsweek about the \nfirst 100 days of Franklin Roosevelt's Presidency. If there is one \nthing that really was the hallmark of that Presidency, it was Franklin \nRoosevelt's boldness, his willingness to try new ideas. He just wasn't \ngoing to give up on America. He believed that there was no crisis, no \nchallenge we face that could not be overcome.\n  For the last 5 years, the Chicago public schools have been led by a \nteam of visionary leaders who also believe in bold, persistent \nexperimentation. Through their hard work and willingness to try to find \nnew solutions, Chicago Public School Board President Michael Scott and \nChicago public schools CEO Arne Duncan have helped transform Chicago's \nschool system into a national model for public school reform.\n  This past weekend, Michael Scott, my friend, announced that he will \nbe leaving his position as president of the Chicago public school board \nthis summer. Earlier today I met with him and Arne Duncan in my office \nin the Capitol. I have every confidence that Chicago public schools \nwill remain a national model for improvement under the leadership of \nArne Duncan and whoever the next school board president may be. I look \nforward to updating the Senate in the future about Chicago's continued \nprogress and our determination to truly leave no child behind.\n  Some may not remember, but former Secretary of Education William \nBennett went to Chicago and pronounced that school district as the \nworst in America. That may have been an exaggeration at the time, but \nnot by much. Some would have given up at that\n\n[[Page S5588]]\n\npoint, and many cities have. But not the city of Chicago. They made a \nconscious decision to change that school system.\n  Mayor Daley, Paul Valles, Arne Duncan, Michael Scott, and Gary Chico, \nthese were all names of leaders who stepped up, with many professionals \ngiving them support, and accepted the challenge to turn that school \ndistrict around.\n  Let me speak about Michael Scott in particular. His service has meant \nso much to the Chicago public schools, to the city of Chicago, and I \nbelieve, with his example, to the Nation. Michael Scott grew up on the \nwest side of Chicago, the Lawndale neighborhood. He didn't train \nhimself to be an educator. He went to Fordham University in New York \nwhere he earned a degree in urban planning. He moved back to the west \nside after his college years.\n  He started in Chicago politics as a housing activist in the same \nLawndale neighborhood where he was born and raised. In the tumultuous \ntime he lived, Michael Scott stood out as a consensus builder. \nEventually he served under three different Chicago mayors: Jane Byrne, \nHarold Washington, and Richard Daley. Five years ago tomorrow, Mayor \nDaley tapped Michael Scott as the first member of a new team charged \nwith the daunting mission of keeping Chicago public schools a national \nmodel for reform.\n  At the time he was a successful businessman and executive of AT \nWhen Michael Scott's appointment was announced, he said: This is not \nabout me; it's about the children.\n  For the past 5 years, Michael Scott has kept his word. Listen to \nthese statistics, if you want to understand how far the Chicago public \nschools have advanced due to the hard work of the people I mentioned \nearlier and Michael Scott.\n  In 1992, nearly half of Chicago's elementary schoolchildren tested in \nthe lowest 20 percent in reading and math compared to other students \nacross America. Now fast forward 12 years to 2004. Less than 25 percent \nof Chicago's students tested in the bottom 20 percent and student \nperformance has improved since 2004. That is real progress, real \nprogress against great challenges. Michael Scott believes that parents \nare the children's first and best teachers, and he has worked hard to \nmake parents active partners in the education of their children.\n  An annual 2-day conference that he personally founded, entitled ``The \nPower of Parents Conference,'' has been attended by more than 4,000 \nChicago parents since 2002. The belief that every child in every \nneighborhood has the right to attend a good public school, along with a \ncommitment to bold persistent experimentation, are the foundation of \nMayor Daley's Renaissance 2010 School Improvement Plan.\n  Under that plan and with the leadership of Mayor Daley, Michael Scott \nand Arne Duncan, Chicago has pushed to replace approximately 207 \nunderperforming schools with 100 new innovative schools, including \ncharter and small schools.\n  Michael Scott is a product of the Chicago public school system \nhimself. Michael brought an unusually broad range of experience to his \njob as one of the leaders of that system. His resume includes work in \ncommunity advocacy, corporate management, urban development, and local \ngovernment administration. He built new partnerships with all of those \nworlds to help improve Chicago's public schools.\n  In 2003, the Chicago public school system established the privately \nfunded Chicago board of education textbook scholarship program. The \nprogram awards a $1,000 scholarship to one graduating student from each \nof the city's 85 public high schools. The scholarships are funded by \nprivate business, many of which donated money on the spot when they \nheard Michael Scott make his appeal to fund this program.\n  Also under Michael Scott's leadership, Chicago public schools \nestablished a new office of business diversity to help Chicago's \nminority and women-owned businesses navigate the system's complex \nbidding process and ensure that they can compete fairly for contracts.\n  While student scores have gone up, spending in some areas has gone \ndown, thanks to the improved fiscal management in the public schools. \nOne example: By restructuring the transportation system, Chicago public \nschools saved $14 million--$14 million more that can be spent to teach \nthe kids.\n  Under Michael Scott's leadership, the bond rating for the Chicago \npublic schools was upgraded from A to A-plus, which will produce even \nmore savings for taxpayers and more funds for the kids. Someone once \nsaid that the real test of faith in the future is to plant a tree. \nBefore signing on as school board president, Michael Scott served as \npresident of the Chicago Park District. In that job, he saw that plenty \nof trees were planted. He strengthened the park district's finances, \nwhich is widely accredited with making neighborhood parks one of the \nbest features of one of the best cities in America.\n  As board president of Chicago public schools, Michael Scott helped \nplant something even more important to our future than trees. He helped \nplant the seeds of knowledge in the minds of tens of thousands of young \npeople. Together with Chicago students, parents, educators, and \nbusiness and community and political leaders, he has produced a model \nfor public school improvement from which all of America can learn.\n  While Chicago public schools will miss his leadership, they and the \nchildren who depend on him will continue to benefit for years from \nMichael Scott's outstanding public service these past 5 years.\n  In closing, I will quote from an editorial that appeared in the \nChicago Defender newspaper on April 28, 2003, about a third of the way \nthrough Michael Scott's tenure. The editorial was entitled ``Successful \nstudents will be Scott's, Duncan's Monument.''\n\n       Michael Scott and Arne Duncan are monument makers. Not in \n     the usual sense--the one that explains the ancient pleasure \n     taken by politicians who create structures commemorating \n     something that's a recreation of their self image.\n       Nor in the sense that Mesopotamia's Nebuchadnezzar built \n     Babylon's Hanging Gardens in the sixth century B.C., one of \n     the seven wonders of the world. Nor in the sense that his \n     successor Saddam Hussein erected bronze statues of himself, \n     monuments that came tumbling down recently with a noticeably \n     historic thump.\n       Scott, President of the Chicago Board of Education, and his \n     chief executive, Arne Duncan, are building neither stone nor \n     bronze images.\n       The two educators are building a human monument that will \n     rise and flourish in the term of educated, productive \n     graduates of Chicago's public schools. . . . Future students \n     will thrive in each newly renovated school. . . . That will \n     be Scott's and Duncan's monument.\n\n  As Michael Scott's tenure closes at the Chicago public school system, \nI want to acknowledge the fine contribution he made with his public \nservice, both in the park district and the Chicago public schools. He \nis such a talented man that he has brought his talent and given his \ntime to help others time and time again. That is the true definition of \npublic service.\n  I wish Michael the very best in his next endeavor. I am sure it will \ninclude not only the private sector, but also a public commitment \nbecause he is a person who believes that is part of our civic \nresponsibility. I thank him for all of his leadership in the Chicago \npublic school system, and I wish him and his family the very best in \nthe years to come.\n\n\n                               Estate Tax\n\n  Mr. President, at this moment in history, we are considering the \nestate tax. It is one of the many taxes that Americans face. Some have \ncharacterized it, with a very effective public relations campaign, as \nthe ``death tax.'' They have been so good at describing it as a death \ntax as to convince many people across America that when you die, you \npay a tax to your Federal Government. And unless you have been through \na death in the family that you followed closely, you might be misled \ninto believing that.\n  In fact, the public relations campaign has been so good in \ncharacterizing the Federal estate tax as a death tax that I had an \nexperience a couple years ago that I shared with my colleagues in the \nSenate. I drove out to Chicago O'Hare to take a flight to Washington. I \nstopped at the sidewalk there, United Airlines, and handed over a bag \nto be checked in. The person checking my bag took a look at me and \nlooked at the bag and said, ``Senator, please, if you don't do anything \nelse, get rid of the death tax.'' I didn't have the heart to tell that \nbaggage handler that unless he won the Powerball or the Mega-\n\n[[Page S5589]]\n\nmillion lottery soon, he would not have to worry about it because, you \nsee, the so-called death tax is an estate tax that is paid by 2 or 3 \nout of every 1,000 people who die in America each year. That is .2 or \n.3 percent of the people who die in America pay the tax. It is a very \nnarrowly gauged and narrowly directed tax to the wealthiest people in \nAmerica.\n  If you listen to the argument by the Republicans on the floor of the \nSenate, you think that this is an onerous, unfair tax, borne by some of \nthe most deserving, hard-working, common people in this country, who \nstruggle day to day to get by, and then find after they have passed \naway that the greedy hands of Government reach into their estate and \nyanks thousands of dollars out of it. That is not even close to \nreality. So we are actually going to debate on the floor of the Senate \nthe notion that we need to, if not repeal, virtually repeal the estate \ntax in America.\n\n  It is interesting to note that this estate tax is one that affects \nvery few. It is also interesting to note the context of this debate. \nThis was supposed to come up about 9 months ago. We were supposed to \nrepeal the estate tax on the wealthiest people in America, but then God \nintervened. Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf coast. For 24 hours, we \nwatched on live television as our neighbors, fellow Americans, \nsuffered. Some died, some drowned. Many were perched on their roofs \npraying to be rescued. Then we saw the devastation of the flood.\n  The sponsors of this estate tax repeal decided this may not be the \nbest moment to cut taxes on the wealthiest in America. Senator Chuck \nGrassley of Iowa, a man I greatly respect, said as follows on September \n14 of last year:\n\n       It's a little unseemly to be talking about eliminating the \n     estate tax at a time when people are suffering.\n\n  Senator Grassley was right. But I say to him that it is still a \nlittle unseemly to bring up this issue of eliminating the estate tax on \nthe wealthiest people in America when so many people are still \nsuffering around this country. We know what is happening in New \nOrleans, that devastation still has been unaddressed and people are \nstill out of their homes, hospitals are unopened, schools are unopened, \nand families are still separated from communities and neighborhoods \nthat they called home. It is still there.\n  Senator Grassley's point is still there as well. It is unseemly for \nus to be reducing the revenues of this country by cutting taxes on the \nwealthiest people at a time when there is so much need.\n  People ask, what could we do with this estate tax? If you took the \nrevenues that we will be taking out of the Federal Treasury by this \nreduction in the estate tax, here is what you could do with those \nrevenues: You could provide health insurance for every uninsured child \nin America and have enough left over to give them full college \nscholarships or give every family in America a $500 tax cut or \neliminate 75 percent of the shortfall in Social Security, thus buying \nyears of longevity and stability for Social Security, or provide clean \nfood and water to the 800 million people on Earth who lack it or pay \nfor the war in Iraq for the next 10 years.\n  It is not an insignificant amount of money that we are talking about \nhere. The elimination of the estate tax would take from the Federal \nTreasury funds which could have been used for tax relief for working \nfamilies. Instead, this Republican proposal is to give a tax cut to the \nwealthiest people in America.\n  How many people pay this estate tax? This pie chart tells it all. In \n2009, only .2 percent of estates in America will be subject to the tax. \nTwo or, at most, 3 out of every 1,000 people who die will pay any \nestate tax whatsoever. And now the Republican leadership has decided \nthese people need a break.\n  Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey decided to find out how repealing \nthe estate tax would affect three people. The first one was the Vice \nPresident. Under this proposed estate tax cut from the Republican side, \nit means more than $12 million in Federal tax liability will be \neliminated for the Vice President. And then Paris Hilton, with her \nlittle Chihuahua there, it is $14 million for her. Lee Raymond, former \nCEO of Exxon, a man who was given a $400 million going-away gift at his \nretirement by ExxonMobil--well, the repeal of the estate tax gives Mr. \nRaymond another going-away gift of $164 million in tax breaks.\n  These are truly deserving people, don't get me wrong. When I look at \nMs. Hilton, who looks like a lovely young lady, I can see how this $14 \nmillion could have a significant positive impact on her otherwise very \nspare and Spartan lifestyle.\n  You wonder how in good conscience we can be debating tax cuts for the \nwealthiest people in America when there are so many things, so many \ncompelling reasons for us to be more serious about in the work that we \ndo in the Senate. This effort reflects the same twisted priorities that \nthe Republican leadership continues to bring to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  We just have spent--wasted, I might add--the better part of the week \nof the Senate's time on the so-called marriage protection amendment. It \nwas called for a vote after all sorts of fanfare and announcements from \nthe White House, and the final vote was 49-to-48. This proposal for a \nconstitutional amendment didn't even win a majority of the Senators \nvoting; only 49 voted for it. It certainly didn't come up with the 60 \nvotes it needed to move forward in debate. It wasn't even close to the \n67 votes that are needed to enact it.\n  Why did we waste our time? Because the Republican leadership in the \nSenate knew that for political reasons they had to appeal to those \nfolks who believe this is a critically important issue. They want to \nfire them up for the next election. Even though the American people, \nwhen asked, said that this so-called gay marriage amendment ranked 33rd \non their list of priorities, they had to move it forward.\n  Now comes another plank in their platform for the November election, \nthe estate tax. The wealthiest people in America are pushing hard for \nthis estate tax. This morning, the Wall Street Journal printed an \narticle that said that 18 families--listen closely--18 families in the \nUnited States of America have spent $200 million lobbying to pass this \nchange in the estate tax--18 families.\n  Ask yourself why. Why would they spend $200 million? Because they \nwill earn a lot more if this estate tax is repealed. But the cost of \nthe estate tax is dramatic in terms of America's debts. If we repeal \nthe estate tax, we will have $776 billion as the cost of the estate tax \nrepeal in the first 10-year period fully in effect from 2012 to 2021. \nThe cost of the estate tax repeal explodes under the proposal that is \nbefore us, meaning, of course, this red ink is more debt for America.\n  Already we are facing a dramatically deteriorating budget picture in \nAmerica. Go back to the close of the previous administration, which \nshows a $128-billion surplus under President Clinton as he left office, \nand then look at the debt that has been built up under the years of the \nBush administration, a debt that will explode even higher with the \nrepeal of the estate tax on the wealthiest people in America, a debt \nwhich, unfortunately, we will have to pass on to our children.\n  Look at the wall of debt. When President Bush took office, the gross \nnational debt of America--this is our mortgage I am talking about--was \n$5.8 trillion. Now, by 2006, it is up to $8.6 trillion. How did he \nmanage that, almost a 50-percent increase in the debt of America in a \nmatter of 5 years? And now look where it is headed. By the year 2011, \nbecause of the Bush-Cheney tax policies, this national debt will be up \nto $11.8 trillion--$11.8 trillion for our national mortgage. This \nPresident has virtually doubled the debt of America with his policies \nin a matter of 8 years. How can he accomplish this? He can do it with \nterrible policies, and this is one of them.\n  President George W. Bush is the first President in the history of the \nUnited States of America to cut taxes in the midst of a war--the first. \nWhy? It defies common sense. We have a war that costs us between $2 \nbillion and $3 billion a week. It is an expense for our Nation over and \nabove all the other expenses we commonly face.\n  Every previous President, when faced with that challenge, has called \non Americans to sacrifice, save, and pay more in taxes to pay for the \nwar, but not President Bush. The Bush-Cheney\n\n[[Page S5590]]\n\npolicy is, in the midst of a war with skyrocketing costs, cut taxes--\nmeaning, of course, driving us deeper and deeper into debt, pushing \nmore of that debt burden on our children.\n  This is not a tax cut which the Republicans are proposing, it is a \ntax deferral. They want to cut the taxes on the wealthiest estates in \nAmerica and put a greater tax burden on our children and grandchildren. \nThat is the legacy of the Bush-Cheney tax policy.\n  But how does this President take care of the debt? First consider \nthis: As Senator Conrad has brought this chart to the floor before, \nPresident Bush has decided that the way to deal with our debt is to \nborrow from others. President Bush has more than doubled foreign-held \ndebt in 5 years. It took 42 Presidents, including his father, 224 years \nto build up the same level of foreign-held debt as President George W. \nBush has done in 5 years. For 224 years, we had about $1 trillion in \ndebt held by foreign governments. Under President George W. Bush, that \nfigure has virtually doubled in just 5 years.\n  The obvious question is, Who are these mortgage holders? Which \nforeign governments are financing America's debt? The top 10 foreign \nholders of our national debt are Japan, $640 billion, China--no \nsurprise--$321 billion, United Kingdom, oil exporters, South Korea, \nTaiwan, Caribbean banking centers, Hong Kong, Germany, Mexico, and the \nlist goes on and on.\n  It is no surprise that the same countries, which are our mortgagers, \nwhich are holding the debt of America, are the same countries which are \neating our lunch when it comes to sucking jobs out of the United States \nand pushing imports into the United States. They are the same \ncountries. That is what we are dealing with. And the Republican recipe \nfor this imbalance in this debt is to make it worse: Cut the estate tax \nin the midst of a war. It is not only unseemly, going back to Senator \nGrassley's quote, it is unthinkable that at a time when we are asking \nfor so much sacrifice from our soldiers--130,000 of them today risking \ntheir lives in Iraq, another 20,000 or 30,000 in Afghanistan, all their \nfamilies at home praying for their safe return, the anxiety of their \nfriends and relatives as they worry over them each day--at a time when \nso many in America are giving so much and sacrificing so much, comes \nthe Republican majority and says: Let us give the most comfortable, the \nmost well-off people with the cushiest lives in America a tax break--a \ntax break.\n  What are we thinking? Why would we be cutting taxes in the midst of a \nwar? Why would we be heaping debt on our children? Why? So that 2 or 3 \npeople out of every 1,000 who have huge estates worth millions of \ndollars can escape paying their Federal taxes. It is incredible to me, \nbut true, that when you look at this chart, the number of taxable \nestates in the year 2000 was 50,000 nationwide. Under this bill, the \nnumber of taxable estates has gone down to 13,000 and will be reduced \nto 7,000. So this tax responsibility that once applied to 50,000 \ntaxable estates annually in the United States will be a tiny fraction \nof that when it is over.\n  We also have to reflect on another reality as to why this issue is \nbefore us. I mentioned this to my Democratic colleagues, and I say this \nwith some understanding that it is an indictment on our political \nsystem, of which I am a part. Why is it that we are so focused on \nhelping the wealthiest people in America instead of focused on helping \nthe hardest working, the working families, the middle-income families? \nThe explanation is sad but true. We spend a lot of our time as Members \nof the Senate and House of Representatives in the company of very \nwealthy people. We run across them in the ordinary course of Senate \nbusiness, but there is another part of our lives as well. We are out \nraising money for political campaigns that cost millions of dollars. \nPeople who can afford to help us are often very wealthy themselves. \nSome are very wonderful folks, very generous, very helpful to each one \nof us. But we spend a lot of time in their lifestyle seeing where they \nlive, how they spend their time, understanding their hobbies and their \nlifestyles and naturally developing a friendship and empathy with the \nwealthiest people in America.\n  Our campaign financing system draws us into these situations. It is \nunderstandable that with this empathy comes an understanding that some \nof them are going to face taxes when they die for all the money and the \nwealth they have accumulated. Their pleas have not fallen on deaf ears \nin the Senate. Their pleas to repeal the estate tax have resulted in \nthis bill before us now.\n\n  I think it really is a testament to campaign financing in America \nthat instead of spending time with average people, working people \nstruggling to get by, dealing with their issues and their concerns, we \nwould instead draw the attention of the Senate to the most well-off \npeople in this country and how we can reduce their tax burden and their \nresponsibility to this Nation.\n  There are a few wealthy people who stand out in this debate. One of \nthem is a gentleman by the name of Warren Buffett who is with Berkshire \nHathaway, a company out of Omaha, NE, one of my favorite wealthy \npeople, the second wealthiest person in America. He is the first to say \nour tax system in this debate is an outrage and disgraceful. He said at \na luncheon he attended not long ago that it is true that America is \nengaged in class warfare, and as the second wealthiest person in \nAmerica, his class was winning. It is pretty clear he is doing pretty \nwell.\n  But Warren Buffett understands something which many of the families \nthat are pushing for this estate tax repeal don't understand. He \nunderstands he is the luckiest person alive because he was born in \nAmerica. He was given an opportunity people around this world people \nwould die for. He was given the opportunity to prove himself and \nsucceed, and he has done it. He was given a chance to accumulate his \nwealth and use it wisely, and he is now given a chance to pay back to \nthis country, which has given him such a great opportunity, something \nfor all he has benefited. And Warren Buffett considers that a pretty \nfair trade. I think it is, too.\n  To hear the Republicans on the other side of the aisle say the \nwealthiest people in America who live the most comfortable lives should \nbe asked to not pay taxes back to support schools, to support health \ncare, to support the defense of our country, to say that somehow they \nneed more disposable income--$14 million for Paris Hilton, I can \nunderstand that--from the Republican point of view, that is really \nhelping the truly needy. But from the point of view of most Americans, \nit is ridiculous that we would consider this kind of a tax cut at a \ntime when this country is facing mounting deficits, at a time when we \nare at war, at a time when we are asking so much sacrifice from so many \nwonderful American families.\n  So, Mr. President, I am opposed to this resolution. I hope we come to \nour senses. I hope we understand that we were elected to this body to \ndo more than just provide for those with great lobbyists and those with \nbig bankrolls and those who come here in the corridors of power and \ncatch our attention. We were elected to represent the people who are \nnot here--the voiceless, the powerless, the disenfranchised, the \nhomeless. The people expect us to step up on behalf of the entire \nAmerican family, not just those who are well off but the entire \nAmerican family, and do our best to help.\n  I hope we defeat this effort. I hope we stop it in its tracks. I hope \nwe put an end to this tax policy of the Bush-Cheney administration \nwhich has driven America to depths of indebtedness that one could never \nhave imagined. I hope we will put an end to this accumulation of \nnational debt which we are passing along to our children with abandon. \nI hope we will put an end to this foreign borrowing with which this \nadministration has become so enamored which has made us servile to some \nof the other nations around the world that would readily exploit our \neconomy, our businesses, and our workers.\n  If we are going to do that, we have to make a stand--a stand for \nsensible tax policy, a stand for prudence, a stand for something which \nwas once known as fiscal conservatism--fiscal conservatism.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today is National Hunger Awareness Day, \nand I rise to recognize the importance of ending domestic hunger.\n  Domestic hunger has affected the lives of more than 38 million people \nin the United States annually. This includes over 14 million children \nwho live below the poverty line.\n  The face of hunger is diverse. In Illinois, one in every ten people \nis food insecure. Homeless people are often hunger, but so are single \nmothers working two jobs to make ends meet. So are our senior citizens \nwhose income does not allow them to eat adequately.\n  In Chicago, only 9 percent of the half-million people who seek \nservices from the Chicago Food Depository are homeless. Many people \nsimply cannot afford the food they need and often seek emergency food \nprograms.\n  How can this happen in a country as privileged as ours?\n  Remember that 37 million Americans are living in poverty.\n  Many low-income families are supported by jobs that do not pay \nlivable wages.\n  It could be that paying the health care or housing bills is more than \nthey can manage.\n  America's Second Harvest released a National Hunger Study showing \nthat in Chicago, 41 percent of households neglect their food budget to \ncover utility costs.\n  It may be a combination of factors, but the food budget is often the \nfirst thing they cut.\n  Today, we celebrate and commend the heroic efforts of emergency food \nbanks, soup kitchens, school meal programs and community pantries \nworking to ease the pain of hunger.\n  Federal nutrition programs work, but they are not reaching enough \nhomes. Many parents are still skipping meals so their children can eat.\n  Hunger drains the strength of people who, for a variety of reasons, \nare unable to provide enough food or the right kinds of food for \nthemselves or their families. In a land of abundance, this kind of \nsacrifice is as deplorable as it is unnecessary.\n  We should end hunger in the United States and, working together, we \ncan.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, for the past 3 years I have come to the \nSenate floor on National Hunger Awareness Day to help raise concerns \nabout the far too prevalent problem of hunger, both here in the United \nStates and around the world. In fact, as a freshman Senator, I \ndelivered my maiden speech on this topic and have since made it one of \nmy top priorities in the Senate. Two years ago on Hunger Awareness Day, \nSenators Smith, Durbin, Lincoln, and I launched the Senate Hunger \nCaucus, with the express\n\n[[Page S5592]]\n\npurpose of providing a forum for Senators and staff to focus on \nnational and international hunger and food insecurity issues. Today we \nhave 37 Members dedicated to this cause. I have stated repeatedly that \nthe battle against hunger can't be won in a matter of months or even a \nfew years, but it is a victory that we can certainly claim if we \ncontinue to make the issue a top priority.\n  It is truly astounding that 34 million of our fellow citizens go \nhungry or are living on the edge of hunger each and every day. In my \nhome State of North Carolina, nearly 1 million of--our 8.6 million \nresidents are dealing with hunger. Our state has faced significant \neconomic hardship over the last few years, as once-thriving towns have \nbeen hit hard by the closing of textile mills and furniture factories. \nI know this story is not unlike so many others across the Nation. While \nmany who have lost manufacturing jobs have been fortunate to find new \nemployment in the changing climate of today's workforce, unfortunately \nhaving a steady income these days doesn't always guarantee a family \nthree square meals a day.\n  Our Nation is blessed to have many faith-based and other nonprofit \nservice organizations that seek to address this need. Feeding the \nhungry is their mission field--groups such as the Society of St. \nAndrew, the only comprehensive program in North Carolina that gleans \navailable produce from farms, and then packages, processes and \ntransports excess food to feed the hungry. In 2005, the Society gleaned \nnearly 7.2 million pounds of food--or 21.5 million servings--just in \nNorth Carolina. Amazingly, it only costs about 2 cents a serving to \nglean and deliver this food to those in need. And all of this work is \ndone by the hands of 13,000 volunteers and a tiny staff.\n  The Society of St. Andrew has operations in 21 other States, and just \nlast year, the organization saved 29.5 million pounds of fresh, \nnutritious produce and delivered 88.6 million servings to hungry \nfamilies in the 48 contiguous States.\n  We should be utilizing the practice of gleaning much more extensively \ntoday--considering that 96 billion pounds of good food--including that \nat the farm and retail level--is left over or thrown away in this \ncountry each year.\n  Like any humanitarian endeavor, the gleaning system works because of \ncooperative efforts. Private organizations and individuals are doing a \ngreat job--but they are doing so with limited resources. It is up to us \nto make some changes on the public side and assist in leveraging scarce \ndollars to help feed the hungry.\n  One of the single biggest concerns for gleaners is transportation--\nhow to actually get the food to those who need it. I am proud to say \nthat with the help of organizations like the American Trucking \nAssociation, America's Second Harvest, and the Society of St. Andrew, \nwe are taking steps to ease that concern. Last year, I reintroduced \nlegislation, S. 283, which would change the Tax Code to give \ntransportation companies incentives for volunteering trucks to transfer \ngleaned food.\n  I am also proud to be an original co-sponsor of S. 1885, the so-\ncalled FEED Act, with my colleagues Senators Lautenberg and Lincoln. \nThe basic idea behind this legislation is simple: Combine food rescue \nwith job training programs, thus teaching unemployed and homeless \nadults the skills needed to work in the food service industry.\n  It is astonishing that each year, approximately 20 percent of the \nfood produced in this country never even reaches a consumer's table. \nWith support from the FEED Act, community kitchens across our Nation \nhave the potential to make good use of this food and to serve more than \n2 million meals to those in need each year. In Charlotte, NC, the \nCommunity Culinary School is already recruiting students from social \nservice agencies, homeless shelters, halfway houses and work release \nprograms who rescue food from restaurants, grocers and wholesalers and \nthen prepare nutritious meals, while receiving training for jobs in the \nfood service industry.\n\n  Hunger also affects far too many children in our Nation. In fact, an \nestimated 13 million children in America are dealing with hunger. This \nis a travesty that can and must be prevented. As we know, when children \nare hungry they can not learn, but the obvious way to ensure that these \nchildren have a hot meal--and therefore the potential to do well in \nschool--is through the National School Lunch Program. It feeds more \nthan 28 million children in 100,000 schools each day. While the program \nprovides reduced price meals to students whose family income is below \n130 percent of the poverty level, State and local school boards have \ninformed me that many families struggle to pay this fee, and for some \nfamilies, the fee is an insurmountable barrier to participation. That's \nwhy I am a strong supporter of legislation to eliminate the reduced \nprice fee for these families and to harmonize the free income guideline \nwith the WIC income guideline, which is 185 percent poverty.\n  I am very proud that a five State pilot program to eliminate the \nreduced price fee was included in the reauthorization of Child \nNutrition and WIC in 2004. And this year, 13 of my colleagues, \nincluding the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, have joined me to encourage the Appropriations Committee to \ninclude funding for this pilot program. I look forward to working with \nthem on this important issue that truly has the potential to alleviate \nhunger for many American children and to help ensure their success in \nschool.\n  In closing, I implore our friends on both sides of the aisle--as well \nas the good people throughout our great country--to join us in this \nheartfelt mission--this grassroots network of compassion that \ntranscends political ideology and provides hope and security not only \nfor those in need today--but for future generations as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/07/senate-section/article/S5592-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5592-S5593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Marine Corporal Cory L. Palmer\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to set aside a few moments \ntoday to reflect on the life of Marine Cpl Cory L. Palmer. Cory \nepitomized the best of our country's brave men and women who have \nfought to free Iraq and to secure a new democracy in the Middle East. \nHe exhibited unwavering courage, selfless devotion to his country, and \nabove all else, honor. In the way he lived his life--and how we \nremember him--Cory reminds each of us how good we can be.\n  Cory was born to Charles and Danna Palmer on May 10, 1984. He was the \nyoungest of three sons. After graduating from Seaford High School in \n2002, Cory studied computer engineering at West Virginia University for \none semester and then decided to join the Marine Corps. Friends, \nfamily, and school officials recalled Cory Palmer as courageous yet \nhumble, fun-loving and adventurous, an all-around good person. He \nviewed the Marine Corps as an opportunity to gain life experience and \nas a way to serve his country.\n  Cory was proud to be a member of the Marine Corps 2nd Recon \nBattalion, A Company, 1st Platoon. After his initial recruit training \nat Parris Island, Cory underwent marine combat training at Camp Geiger, \nlocated in North Carolina. He excelled in all of his military training \nand graduated from sniper school, advanced sniper school, jump school, \ncombatant dive school and special survival training school. For his \ndutiful service, Cory had been awarded the Good Conduct Medal, the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, the \nGlobal War on Terror Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism \nExpeditionary Medal, the Iraqi Campaign Medal, and the Combat Action \nMedal.\n  Cory was on his second deployment in Iraq. His death was caused by \ninjuries sustained when the humvee he was riding in was hit by an \nexplosive device near Fallujah.\n  Cory was a remarkable and well-respected young soldier. His friends \nand family remember him as a kind-hearted and mischievous young man who \nloved the outdoors. Cory was an avid sportsman and explorer who had \nplanned on going hiking and fishing with his two older brothers, Thad \nand Kyle, upon his return. Cory also had a softer side that he wasn't \nafraid to show. He served as a mentor and role model to his friends and \neven took the time to hand-make gifts for his family.\n  As a youngster, Cory came to the Governor's Fall Festival in Dover \nthat I hosted as Governor and ran with many of us in the 5-kilometer \nrace that kicked off the festival every year.\n\n[[Page S5593]]\n\nWhen I visited Cory's family in their Seaford home a little more than a \nweek ago, they shared with me a photo of Cory running in one of those \nraces a decade before his tragic death.\n  I rise today to commemorate Cory, to celebrate his life, and to offer \nhis family our support and our deepest sympathy on their tragic loss.\n\n\n                      Staff Sergeant Curtis Haines\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it is with the greatest pleasure that I \nrise today to honor SSG Curtis Haines of Hope, AR. He is a member of \nthe Arkansas Army National Guard's Company A, 1-153rd Infantry of the \n39th Brigade Combat Team based in Prescott, AR. For his heroic service \nin Iraq, Staff Sergeant Haines was recently presented the Soldier's \nMedal for Bravery at a ceremony in the Prescott High School auditorium.\n  On May 6, 2004, at a military checkpoint in Baghdad, a car bomb \nexplosion occurred. An Iraqi citizen was seriously injured, on fire, \nand trapped in a burning vehicle. Without regard for his own safety, \nStaff Sergeant Haines rescued the man from his vehicle, carried him to \nsafety, and administered medical aid. Because of his heroic actions, \nStaff Sergeant Haines ultimately saved the man's life.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Staff \nSergeant Haines on receiving this well-deserved honor. Also, please \njoin me in thanking all of our brave men and women in uniform for their \nservice. They risk their lives every day to protect our freedoms and \ndeserve our respect and support for the sacrifices they have made and \ncontinue to make for our country.\n\n\n               Private First Class Nicholas R. Cournoyer\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to U.S. Army \nPFC Nicholas R. Cournoyer of Gilmanton, NH, for his service and his \nsupreme sacrifice for his country.\n  Nicholas, also called Nick by family and friends, grew up in \nGilmanton and was a graduate of the Guilford High School class of 2000. \nOn January 22, 2005, he answered a call to serve our country during \nthese tense and turbulent times by enlisting in the U.S. Army. He was \nsent to Fort Benning, GA where as a member of an infantry training \nbattalion he successfully completed Infantry One Station Unit Training, \nwhich combines in one location basic training with advanced individual \ntraining. Upon graduation, he left for assignment in June 2005 with the \n2nd Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 10th \nMountain Division, Light Infantry, Fort Drum, NY, where he served as an \ninfantryman. On August 11, 2005, he deployed with his unit to Iraq in \nsupport of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Tragically, on May 18, 2006, this brave 25-year-old soldier was \nkilled in action along with three of his comrades and an interpreter \nwhen an improvised explosive device explosion detonated near their \nmilitary vehicle during combat operations in the vicinity of Baghdad in \nIraq. His awards and decorations include the Bronze Star Medal, Purple \nHeart, Army Achievement Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, Iraq Campaign \nMedal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, \nOverseas Service Ribbon, Combat Infantryman Badge, and Weapons \nQualification Badge.\n  Patriots from the State of New Hampshire have served our Nation with \nhonor and distinction from Bunker Hill to Baghdad--and Nick served in \nthat--fine tradition. Daniel Webster said, ``God grants liberty only to \nthose who love it, and are always ready to guard and defend it.'' Nick \nwas a courageous and dedicated volunteer who loved his family and his \ncountry and was proud of being a soldier. He served honorably doing the \njob he wanted to do. This generous, fun-loving young man had a big \nheart and understood that the freedoms and opportunities provided by \nthis Nation need continuous defense and that they are among the most \nprecious gifts he can give to his family and loved ones.\n  My heartfelt sympathy, condolences, and prayers go out to Nick's \nparents, Denis and Lenda, his sister Natalie, and his family and \nfriends who have suffered this grievous loss. Because of his devotion \nand sense of duty, the safety and liberty of each and every American is \nmore secure. May God bless PFC Nicholas Cournoyer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/07/senate-section/article/S5593-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WEIGHT GAIN PREVENTION IN CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, one of my great passions as a Senator has \nbeen advocating for children and advancing initiatives that improve \ntheir health and welfare. I wish to share with my colleagues the \nresults of a new study, funded in part by the National Institutes of \nHealth, which reports on two simple steps that can be taken to counter \na serious health crisis among America's youth.\n  The crisis is obesity among all ages and most seriously among \nchildren. The Journal of the American Medical Association reported last \nmonth that one-third of all children in the United States are either \noverweight or dangerously close to becoming so and, as a result, are at \nincreased risk of becoming obese adults and developing diabetes and \nother health problems.\n  A new ``America on the Move Family Study,'' presented at the \nPediatric Academic Societies Meeting, April 30, 2006, provides the \nfirst clinical evidence that overweight children can effectively \nprevent additional weight gain by making small changes to their daily \nlifestyle. The study was conducted by the University of Colorado at \nDenver and Health Sciences Center, the primary research arm for America \nOn the Move Foundation, a national nonprofit dedicated to helping \nindividuals and communities across the country improve health and \nquality of life. This study was designed to evaluate whether overweight \nchildren could reduce their risk of gaining additional weight through a \ncombination of increasing physical activity and eliminating 100 \ncalories a day from their diet.\n  In the study, investigators randomized 216 families with at least 1 \noverweight child to either a lifestyle intervention group or a control \ngroup. Families in the intervention group were asked to eliminate 100 \ncalories a day from their diet by emphasizing a reduction of dietary \nsugar and an increase in physical activity by 2,000 steps daily. \nFamilies in the control groups were asked to monitor their diet and \nexercise levels. After 6 months, significantly more overweight children \nin the intervention group maintained or reduced their percent body mass \nindex, BMI, compared to the self-monitoring group, 67 percent versus 53 \npercent.\n  The results of this study are striking. By taking two simple, common \nsense steps--engaging in more physical activity and reducing caloric \nintake by small amounts--families can help their children control \nweight gain and reduce obesity. Such steps can have an enormous impact \non their health. I applaud this study for bringing this important \nmessage to the public's attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/07/senate-section/article/S5593-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5593-S5594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REDUCE KIDS' ACCESS TO GUNS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, researchers from the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention estimate that 1.69 million children in the \nUnited States live in households where firearms are kept unlocked and \nloaded. Tragically but not coincidentally, guns kill an average of \nnearly eight children and teenagers each day. In addition, the \nChildren's Defense Fund estimates that at least four times as many are \ninjured in nonfatal shootings. The vast majority of these shootings \ncould be prevented if safe gun storage practices were more widely used.\n  Some parents believe that simply educating their children about the \ndangers posed by firearms is enough to keep them safe. Unfortunately, \nthis is not the case. A new study shows that parents who keep guns in \ntheir home may have dangerous misperceptions about their child's \nfamiliarity with and access to guns.\n  The study, which was conducted by researchers from Harvard University \nand the San Francisco General Hospital, compared interview responses \nfrom 201 families who have guns in their homes. For each set of \ninterviews, children were questioned separately from their parents. \nMore than 70 percent of the children interviewed for the study said \nthat they knew where to find a gun in their home. Surprisingly, 39 \npercent of the parents who said their children did not know the storage \nlocation of their firearms were contradicted by their children. \nAdditionally, 22 percent of the parents who said their children had not \nhandled their guns\n\n[[Page S5594]]\n\nwere contradicted by their children. These discrepancies are troubling \nand indicate that simply trying to hide the location of firearms in the \nhome is not enough to adequately protect children from injuring \nthemselves or others with a gun.\n  According to recent published reports, an estimated 35 percent of \nhomes nationwide include guns. Common sense tells us that when guns and \nammunition are secured, the risk of children injuring or killing \nthemselves or others with a gun is significantly reduced. Last year, a \nstudy published in the Journal of the American Medical Association \nfound that the risk of unintentional shooting or suicide by minors \nusing a gun is reduced by as much as 61 percent when ammunition in the \nhome is locked up. Simply storing ammunition separately from the gun \nreduces such occurrences by more than 50 percent.\n  While educating children about the dangers of guns is certainly \nnecessary, the use of safe storage practices is critically important to \nthe safety of children and families when guns are kept in the home. We \nshould all urge firearms owners around the country to take steps to \nadequately secure their guns and ammunition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/07/senate-section/article/S5594-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           EMERGENCY ENERGY ASSISTANCE FOR DISABLED VETERANS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, recently I joined my colleague, Senator \nNelson of Nebraska, in introducing the Emergency Energy Assistance for \nDisabled Veterans Act. I am supporting this bill because I am concerned \nabout inadequate reimbursement rates offered to veterans who must \ntravel to VA facilities for treatment. The VA beneficiary travel \nprogram reimburses veterans 11 cents for every mile they are required \nto drive in order to visit a VA doctor. This reimbursement often is not \nenough to cover the cost of the trip, especially given high gas prices \nand the lengthy distances some veterans must travel.\n  The State of South Dakota is home to almost 77,000 veterans--\napproximately 10 percent of the State's population. Today gasoline \naverages $2.97 per gallon. In rural States such as South Dakota, many \nveterans must travel more than 120 miles each way in order to reach a \nveterans hospital. South Dakotans living in Selby and Gettysburg must \ntravel as much as 170 miles. With the price of gas rising, the fixed \nmileage reimbursement leaves these veterans behind.\n  Oil companies are reaping substantial profits without reinvesting \nthese profits in the infrastructure that helps keep gasoline markets \noperating smoothly. I am deeply concerned that these companies are \nbeing paid billions in profits while at the same time receiving tax \ncuts and incentives. On the opposite end of the spectrum, veterans are \nforced to make tough choices in order to afford driving to the VA for \ntreatment. The men and women who defended our Nation should not have to \nchoose between buying groceries and visiting a doctor at the VA.\n  For over 30 years, mileage reimbursement rates for veterans have \nremained stagnant, whereas Federal employees received an 8-cent \nincrease for a similar travel program in September 2005. Currently, \nFederal employees are reimbursed 44.5 cents per mile when using a \nprivate vehicle for official Government business. We owe our Nation's \nveterans the same benefit.\n  President Bush has consistently supported VA budgets that short \nchange veterans health care by billions of dollars. Unfortunately, \nunder current law, money to reimburse veterans for travel is allocated \nfrom the same accounts used to provide medical care. This bill changes \nthe funding formula and would mandate a separate allowance to reimburse \ntravel costs. This will reduce the competition between programs that \nare equally meritorious and necessary but are forced to compete for the \nsame pot of funds.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to support the Emergency \nEnergy Assistance for Disabled Veterans Act. It is time we rectified \nthis glaring injustice and provide our veterans with the support they \ndeserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/07/senate-section/article/S5594-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5594-S5595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST DOCUMENTED AIDS CASE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it was 25 years ago this week that a \nlittle-noticed report from the Centers for Disease Control documented a \npeculiar cluster of deadly pneumonia cases in Los Angeles. That report \nwas the first official mention of AIDS, although the disease had no \nname at the time. Since 1981, AIDS has become an international human \ncatastrophe, killing more than 25 million people, orphaning more than \n15 million children, and infecting more than 65 million people. Today, \nthere are 40 million people living with HIV.\n  This issue affects us on both a global and a domestic scale. There \nare over 1.2 million people in the United States living with HIV/AIDS, \nand there are over 40,000 new infections each year. While the United \nStates made great strides to contain the disease and reduce the number \nof deaths throughout the 1990s, it now appears that this trend is \nreversing. The death rate is beginning to destabilize, and the \ninfection rate is growing at a staggering rate among certain \npopulations, particularly people of color. African Americans have the \nhighest AIDS case rates of any racial or ethnic group--more than nine \ntimes the rate for Whites.\n  There is still much to be done in the United States to combat HIV/\nAIDS, but the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the rest of the world, \nparticularly in sub-Saharan Africa, is truly devastating. In my role as \nranking member of the Africa Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, I have seen firsthand the devastation this disease \nhas caused in Africa. Africa has accounted for nearly half of all \nglobal AIDS deaths, and it is estimated that by the year 2025 the total \nnumber of HIV infections in Africa could reach an astounding 100 \nmillion. In some African countries, the disease has caused the average \nlife expectancy to drop below 40. HIV/AIDS has ravaged countries, \neconomies, and families.\n  The most vulnerable in our global society are in many cases those who \nare most at risk from HIV/AIDS. Women and girls, who in Africa are \noften left physically, economically, and politically vulnerable, suffer \ndisproportionately from HIV/AIDS. Nearly 60 percent of all people \nliving with HIV in Africa are women; girls in sub-Saharan Africa aged \n15 to 19 are infected by HIV at rates as much as five to seven times \nhigher than boys their age. Gender inequalities, cultural norms, \ntransactional sex, and all forms of violence against women and girls \nincrease their susceptibility to HIV/AIDS. Women and girls desperately \nneed legal protection and economic empowerment so that they can make \nsafe health choices. These are fundamentally connected issues.\n  There is some cause for hope in our battle against this terrible \ndisease; the United States has committed an unprecedented amount of \nmoney to the fight, and we are beginning to see some results. This is \nno cause for complacency, however. According to a recent U.N. report, \nwhile the spread of HIV/AIDS appears to be slowing down worldwide and \nsome countries are reporting progress in bringing the pandemic under \ncontrol, others are failing to reach key targets for prevention and \ntreatment.\n  Most troubling is the fact that the rate of new HIV infections \ndramatically outpaces current efforts to reach people with life-\nsustaining antiretroviral therapy. According to Family Health \nInternational, for each new person who received antiretroviral therapy \nin 2005, another seven people became infected. We must bring increased \nfocus to prevention efforts and do a better job of reaching out to \nthose who are most vulnerable to this disease.\n  It is also becoming increasingly clear that we cannot address HIV/\nAIDS in isolation and that we need to deepen coordination between HIV/\nAIDS initiatives and other development goals. HIV/AIDS does not just \naffect isolated individuals but families, communities, and entire \neconomies. One problem that has become apparent as we commit increasing \nfunds to address HIV/AIDS is that international AIDS programs are \nsiphoning off trained local health care workers from national health \ncare systems. The World Health Organization has reported that the total \nnumber of health care workers per 1,000 people in Africa is 2.3--less \nthan one-tenth the density in the Americas. This ``brain drain'' issue \nmust be addressed. We need to\n\n[[Page S5595]]\n\nstrengthen national health and social systems by integrating HIV/AIDS \nintervention into programs for primary health care, mother and child \nhealth, sexual and reproductive health, tuberculosis, nutrition, and \neducation. Not only will it be more cost-efficient to work with \nexisting systems, but it will also increase access for people who \notherwise might not seek out counseling, testing, or treatment. As we \nlook ahead to the next 5, 10 years and beyond, strong national health \nsystems will be crucial for sustainability.\n  The 25-year anniversary of this terrible disease is an opportunity to \ntake stock of where we have been and to renew our commitment to \novercoming the challenges that lie ahead in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/07/senate-section/article/S5595-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL HOUSING CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 75th \nanniversary of the National Housing Conference, NHC, an organization of \nover 900 members dedicated to forwarding the cause of affordable \nhousing and community development. For the past 75 years, the National \nHousing Conference has been an important contributor to the national \ndebate on housing policy. Over the years, NHC has worked to achieve the \ngoal set forth in the landmark Housing Act of 1949: ``a decent home and \na suitable living environment for every American family.''\n  Organized in New York City in 1931 by the efforts of reformer and \nsocial worker Mary Simkhovitch, NHC has the distinction of being the \nfirst nonpartisan, independent coalition of national housing leaders \nfrom both public and private sectors. This pioneering advocacy group \nincluded bankers, builders, civic leaders, realtors, organized labor, \narchitects, and residents. Early on, NHC was instrumental in the \nefforts to raise public awareness in New York City about the plight of \nhundreds of thousands of its people and the consequences slums had on \nthe general welfare.\n  In 1945, NHC moved its headquarters to Washington, DC, and took on a \ntremendous challenge: get rid of the slums, and eliminate substandard \nhousing. Through the 1940s NHC forged partnerships and mobilized \ngrassroots forces around the country in an effort to pass Federal \nlegislation to meet this challenge. Finally, NHC's efforts were \nrewarded with the passage of the landmark Housing Act of 1949, the most \nsweeping, ambitious housing legislation the Nation had ever had. The \nact called for ``a decent home and a suitable living environment for \nevery American family.''\n  In the 1960s, NHC was again instrumental in the passage of the \nHousing and Urban Development Act of 1965, which resulted in the \ncreation of a Cabinet-level department devoted to housing.\n  Throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s NHC was a constant presence in \nthe national debate on housing policy, and continued to advocate on \nbehalf of better housing opportunities for all Americans.\n  NHC continues to be a force in shaping this Nation's housing policy. \nToday, as NHC celebrates this milestone, it has rededicated itself to a \ncentral mission: fulfilling the dream of the 1949 Housing Act--``a \ndecent home and a suitable living environment for every American \nfamily.'' I commend the National Housing Conference for its past \nefforts and honor the organization on this very special anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/07/senate-section/article/S5595-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COAST GUARD CUTTER ``ACACIA''\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today at a 10 a.m. the U.S. Coast Guard \nwill decommission the Cutter Acacia in a ceremony in Charlevoix, MI.\n  The Acacia's keel was laid in 1942 in Duluth MN, and was commissioned \non September 1, 1944. The cutter is named after the original Acacia, a \nU.S. Lighthouse Service vessel sunk off the coast of British West \nIndies by a German U-boat on March 17, 1942. The Acacia is the last of \nthe Coast Guard's 180-foot World War II era buoy tenders still in \nservice and has called Charlevoix, MI, home since 1990.\n  The Acacia has served as a buoy tender on the Great Lakes for 62 \nyears and its area of responsibility extends from Chicago at the south \nend of Lake Michigan to Alpena on Lake Huron. The cutter's primary \nmission is maintaining aids to navigation but has also performed search \nand rescue missions, as well as providing icebreaking assistance during \nthe winter. The Acacia, also know as ``The Big A'' or ``Ace of the \nGreat Lakes'' has performed an unheralded but vital mission in the \nGreat Lakes for more than six decades.\n  I commend the Acacia crew both past and present for their tireless \nservice to maintain the Great Lakes navigational aids. Each fall the \nAcacia and its crew begin a race against the Lakes brutal winter \nweather when they set out to remove buoys in Lake Michigan and Lake \nHuron. These buoys can weigh over 18 tons and are covered in ice. \nPulling buoys out of the frigid and unpredictable Great Lakes in \nOctober, November and December is back breaking work in rough seas and \nsub zero weather. However, it is crucial to keep these waterways open \nfor commercial shipping as long as possible before the ice closes the \nshipping lanes and grinds any buoys left behind into scrap metal.\n  Mr. President, the Acacia and her crew have served the Great Lakes \nfaithfully since the 1940s and we will miss her fondly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/07/senate-section/article/S5595-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PROCLAMATION\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, today I recognize and commend the \nfantastic work and accomplishments of the students and staff at the \nCollbran Job Corps located in Collbran, CO.\n  Last year, the Collbran Job Corps was awarded the outstanding \nOrganization of the Year award by the Colorado Special Olympics Hall of \nFame for their outstanding service and dedication to the Special \nOlympics in Colorado. This recognition was well deserved as Collbran \nJob Corps has actively participated and supported the Colorado Special \nOlympics for almost 20 years.\n  Recently, the students and staff at the Collbran Job Corps Center \ncollaborated to form a robotics team that competed in national \ncompetitions against other robotics teams from universities, colleges, \nand the private sector. In May, Collbran team was awarded 1st place \nhonors in a regional robotics competition in Denver and won an \nopportunity to compete in the International Robotics Competition in \nAtlanta against robotics teams from around the globe. The judges at the \ninternational competition in Atlanta\n\n[[Page S5596]]\n\nawarded Collbran the Engineering Inspiration Award for their ability to \ninspire other competitors.\n  The students and staff at the Collbran Job Corps certainly live up to \ntheir mission statement: ``Believe, Achieve, and Succeed.'' Their first \nplace victory at the Denver regional competition and excellent showing \nand award at the International Robotics Competition demonstrates that \nCollbran is meeting and excelling above and beyond this mission \nstatement.\n  Collbran Job Corps students are well known throughout western \nColorado for their achievements and commitment to the betterment of \ntheir community. They have actively been involved in community projects \nthat utilized the skills of students in the construction trades, \nincluding the CISCO Networking Program, business technology \noccupations, as well as those in culinary arts training. The \nlongstanding sense of commitment to enhancing community spirit and \noutreach serves as a benchmark to other Job Corps sites throughout the \ncountry.\n  Recently, the Department of Labor national Office of Job Corps \nselected Collbran Job Corps as a Career Success Standards, CSS, Pilot \nCenter and national trainer. The CSS sets a standard for behavioral \nexpectations of students participating in the Job Corps program in \nsupport of the President's High Growth Training Initiative. The \nCollbran Center was selected as a result of their outstanding core \nvalues, positive and engaging student culture, and consistent high \nperformance.\n  Collbran Job Corps highlights the positive impacts the Job Corps \nopportunity has had on the lives of the disadvantaged youth who \nparticipate and the positive effect those youth contribute back to \ntheir communities and the strong values of community. As the budget and \nappropriations process proceeds, I hope the Senate will continue to \nsupport the Job Corps program and keep the wonderful example of \nCollbran Job Corps in mind. I know I will.\n  I commend the Collbran Job Corps Center for believing, achieving, and \nsucceeding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/07/senate-section/article/S5596-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM ``J'' THOMPSON\n\n Mr. PRYOR.

DUVALL, III\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President. I take this opportunity to honor the \nlife of Bob Duvall, not only out of great respect for his contributions \nto technology advancements in the defense industry but also for all of \nthose who have played a key role in the strength of our Armed Forces \nand Nation's security. Warfighters and commanders among all service \ngroups have directly benefited from his engineering contributions. Mr. \nDuvall passed away on May 24, 2006. He was 61.\n  Mr. Robert L. Duvall, III, was born in Cheverly, MD, on October 8, \n1944 and grew up in the suburbs of Washington, DC. His father was an \nelectrical engineer for the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company \nand inspired him to pursue a career in engineering. In 1967, he \ngraduated from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, with a degree in \nelectrical engineering and subsequently went to work at Hughes Aircraft \nCompany in California. Mr. Duvall furthered his education with a \nmaster's degree in electrical engineering from the University of \nSouthern California in 1975.\n  After Mr. Duvall's placement within the defense industry, his \ntechnical expertise expanded to include a variety of disciplines, \nincluding circuit design, optics, infrared technology, optoelectronics, \nand systems integration. It was within the infrared technology and \nlaser systems integration sector that his contributions made the most \nnotable and recognized impact to the military capability of the United \nStates. Early contributions and developments during his 20-plus years \nwith Hughes Aircraft led to innovation in Naval and Air Force laser \npointing and tracking technology. His contributions are better known \nfor supporting the U.S. Army's Second Generation Forward Looking \nInfrared, FLIR, developments in the early 1990s.\n  Mr. Duvall's pioneering efforts with Hughes Aircraft and subsequently \nhis current position as vice president of advanced technology at DRS \nTechnologies have indeed made a difference for our present generation \nof warfighters. Our sons and daughters enter into battle with the \ndecisive ability to ``own the night'' and precisely target and defeat \nthe threat because of the incredible contribution he made as a member \nof our defense industry. There is no doubt Mr. Duvall contributed \ndirectly to the saving of many lives and the avoidance of great loss \nbecause of his efforts and expertise.\n  Mr. Duvall is survived by his wife Shirley and his two children Mark \nand Michelle. Their loss should not be felt alone and should not be \nremembered alone. It is indeed with great respect and admiration for \nhis contribution to our Nation's defense that we pause today to \nrecognize Mr. Robert L. Duvall, III. His effort will have a lasting \neffect on many, and no doubt others lives will continue because of \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/07/senate-section/article/S5596-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/07/senate-section/article/S5596-4", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which ws refered to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/07/senate-section/article/S5596-5", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5596-S5597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 9:22 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1235.

A bill to provide a national franchise and other regulatory \nrelief to video service providers who offer a-la-carte programming for \ncable television, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation. \n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Consumers \nHaving Options in Cable Entertainment, CHOICE, Act of 2006. This bill \nwould encourage broadcasters and cable companies that own cable \nchannels to sell their channels individually to subscribers. It would \nalso promote cable programming distribution over the Internet.\n  For almost 10 years I have supported giving consumers the ability to \nbuy cable channels individually, also known as a la carte, to provide \nconsumers with more control over the viewing options in their home and \ntheir monthly cable bill. Cable companies have resisted this and have \ncontinued to give consumers all the ``choice'' of a North Korean \nelection ballot. There is only one option available: buy a package of \nchannels, whether you watch all the channels or not. The alternative is \nto not receive cable programming at all. Why have cable companies and \ncable programmers refused to give consumers the ability to buy and pay \nfor only those channels consumers watch? Simply because they do not \nhave to. They are the only game in town. But not for long, I hope.\n  Telephone companies have realized that consumers want more and are \npoised to provide consumers across the nation with an alternative to \nthe local cable company. Many of these telephone companies, including \nAT, are also ready to offer consumers the ability to purchase \nchannels a la carte. Such companies will offer two crucial benefits to \nconsumers: more competition in the video service provider market, and \nmore options for programming packages. Together, these two offerings \nwill allow consumers to have greater control over the content that \nenters the home and the ability to manage their monthly cable bills.\n  According to a Government Accountability Office, GAO, report, in \ncommunities where there are two cable companies competing for \ncustomers, cable rates are 15 percent less than in communities without \nany competition. A subsequent GAO study suggests that in some markets \nthe presence of another cable competitor may reduce rates by an \nastounding 41 percent. Unfortunately, today less than 5 percent of \ncommunities have two companies competing to provide consumers cable \ntelevision service.\n  The CHOICE Act would help bring competition to the cable television \nmarket. Choice in cable television delivery is long overdue for \nconsumers who have suffered steep rate hikes year after year. Since \n1996, cable rates have increased 58 percent or nearly three times the \nrate of inflation. The Federal Communications Commission, FCC, has \nfound that rates increased 7 percent in 2001 and 2002, and 5 percent in \n2003. The FCC's most recent report found that rates again rose 5 \npercent in 2004, double the rate of inflation, but only 3.6 percent \nwhere the local cable company faced competition. I can only imagine the \nsavings consumers could reap if presented with a choice of providers of \ncable service and a choice of channels. For this reason I call on \nCongress to pass the CHOICE Act.\n  A recent USA Today/Gallup poll found that a majority of Americans \nwould like to buy cable channels individually and an AP/Ipsos poll \nfound that a remarkable 78 percent of Americans would like to do so. \nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, households receiving more than 70 \nchannels only watch, on average, about 17 of these. Consumers know that \nthey could have greater control over their monthly bill if given the \nability to choose their channels. This was recently confirmed by the \nFCC. This year the FCC found that consumers could save as much as 13 \npercent on their monthly cable bills if they could buy only the \nchannels they want.\n  Mr. President, consider the situation of a senior citizen on fixed \nincome living in Sun City, Arizona, who watches only a few news and \nmovie channels, but continues to pay for high priced channels such as \nESPN, Fox Sports, and MTV--channels that other consumers enjoy, but \nchannels that certain seniors may not want and possibly cannot afford. \nIn fact, the general manager of the Sun City cable system has told my \nstaff that he has tried to drop several expensive music video channels \nfrom the company's channel lineup to make room for channels his viewers \nwant to receive and to decrease costs, but the owners of the music \nvideo channels have forbid him to do so without serious repercussions. \nSo the residents of Sun City continue to subsidize the cost of these \nchannels for viewers around the country. That is why AARP, representing \n35 million senior citizens, supports the ability for viewers to buy \nchannels on an a la carte\n\n[[Page S5601]]\n\nbasis. But again, cable companies don't have to listen to these 35 \nmillion viewers because there is no real threat of losing them. They \nhave nowhere to turn.\n  The CHOICE ACT, Mr. President, is not a mandate on cable providers. \nInstead it is designed to encourage choice and competition by granting \nsignificant regulatory relief to video service providers, such as \ntelephone and cable companies, that agree to both offer cable channels \non an a la carte basis to subscribers and to not prohibit any channel \nowned by the video service provider from being sold individually. In \nexchange, video service providers would receive the right to obtain a \nnational franchise; would be permitted to pay lower fees to \nmunicipalities for the use of public rights of way; would benefit from \na streamlined definition of ``gross video revenue'' for the calculation \nof such fees; and would gain a prohibition on the solicitation of \ninstitutional networks, in-kind donation, and unlimited public access \nchannels.\n  In addition, broadcasters that have an ownership stake in a cable \nchannel would get the benefit of the FCC's network non-duplications \nrule if the broadcaster does not prohibit the channel from being sold \nindividually. The FCC's network non-duplication rule provides \nexclusivity for broadcasters by not allowing another broadcaster with \nthe same network affiliation from broadcasting in the same community. \nThe bill would also modify Section 616(a) of the Communications Act \nthat currently prohibits video service providers from using coercion or \nretaliatory tactics to prevent cable channels from making their \nservices available to competing companies to extend this provision to \ndistribution over the Internet.\n  For example, if Time Warner Cable offered CNN, a cable channel it \nowns, on an a la carte basis to its cable subscribers and allowed other \ncable companies, satellite companies, and video programmers who choose \nto distribute CNN to make it available on an a la carte basis, Time \nWarner Cable would be eligible for a national franchise and other \nregulatory relief. If Disney, which owns ESPN, allowed other cable \ncompanies, satellite companies, and video programmers who choose to \ndistribute ESPN to make it available on an a la carte basis, Disney's \nABC broadcast stations would have the benefit of the FCC's network non-\nduplication rule.\n  Mr. President, contrary to what some might want the American people \nto believe, the CHOICE Act does not force video service providers or \nbroadcasters to do a single thing. It is their choice whether to act or \nnot act. The bill provides them with such a choice even though they \ncurrently don't provide meaningful choices to their customers. This \nbill is incentive-based legislation that would encourage owners of \ncable channels to make channels available for individual purchase and \nwould do nothing to prevent cable companies from continuing to offer a \nbundle of channels or tiers of channels.\n  The cable industry regularly touts the value of its package of \nchannels, noting that it costs less than taking a family of four to a \nmovie or professional sporting event. However, watching cable \ntelevision is not always a family event. Several channels have \nprogramming that consumers find objectionable or that parents believe \nis unsuitable for young children. Complaints about indecent cable \nprogramming have increased exponentially in recent years. In 2004, the \nFCC received 700 percent more cable indecency complaints than it \nreceived in 2003. Most of the cable programs about which indecency \ncomplaints have been filed with the FCC aired during hours when many \nchildren are watching television.\n  Cable and satellite companies currently provide subscribers with a \nvariety of methods of blocking the audio and video programming of any \nchannel that they do not wish to receive. However, subscribers are \nstill required to pay for these channels that they find objectionable. \nThe ``v-chip'' does not effectively protect children from indecent \nprogramming carried by video programming distributors. Most of the \ntelevision sets currently in use in the United States are not equipped \nwith a v-chip; of the 280 million sets currently in United States \nhouseholds, approximately 161 million television sets are not equipped \nwith a v-chip. Households that have a television set with a v-chip are \nalso likely to have one or more sets that are not equipped with a v-\nchip.\n  Again, Mr. President, I am aware that not all consumers want to block \nand not pay for certain channels, but shouldn't all consumers have the \nchoice to do so? Cable programmers and broadcasters have started \noffering individual television programs for download on the Internet. \nThis is the purest form of a la carte--where one can watch and pay for \nonly specific programs they choose. In addition, many of these same \nbroadcasters and cable programmers make their channels available for \nindividual purchase in Hong Kong, Canada, and other countries. Why do \nthese cable programmers treat the American cable subscriber differently \nthan a subscriber in Hong Kong or Canada or an Internet user? It \nremains unclear.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I know that the cable programmers and \nbroadcasters will not be the only group that may have some concerns \nwith this bill. Many of my friends in local government are also likely \nto be interested in the reduced ``rights of way'' fee and streamlined \ndefinition of ``gross video revenue'' under this bill. Cable companies \npay these fees to municipalities to use the right-of-way land under \nsidewalks, streets and bridges to reach customers' homes and then pass \nthese fees on to subscribers. However, these fees often surpass the \ncosts of managing ``rights of way'' land, and municipalities use these \nfunds for other expenditures. Just last month at a hearing before the \nSenate Commerce Committee, Michael A. Guido, Mayor of Dearborn, \nMichigan, confirmed that these fees are often used to pay for other \ncity expenses, such as emergency vehicles.\n  In 2004, State and local governments collected approximately $2.4 \nbillion in these fees, slightly more than $37 per year from every \nhousehold subscriber. Americans for Tax Reform believes that the \n``franchise fee is just a stealth tax on our consumption of the cable \ntelevision,'' as do other economists and taxpayer advocacy groups. To \nthis end, the legislature in my home state of Arizona just recently \npassed a bill to reduce such fees and taxes on cable television \nsubscribers.\n  The Phoenix Center, a non-partisan legal and economic think tank, has \nfound that the introduction of competition to cable companies could \nallow the fee to be lowered ``significantly without doing any harm to \nlocal governments.'' Based upon this research, the CHOICE Act would \nreduce the fee from 5 percent to 3.7 percent for eligible video service \nproviders and allow local governments to petition the FCC for a higher \nfee if it is necessary to cover the costs of managing ``rights of way'' \nland. I believe this would provide some real cost savings to cable \nsubscribers.\n  I remain open to working with municipalities on this issue and look \nforward to working with all interested parties to ensure that American \nconsumers receive greater options for affordable and acceptable \ntelevision viewing. Mr. President, I hope the introduction of the \nCHOICE Act furthers the debate on the issue of a la carte channel \nselection and I look forward to the Senate's consideration of the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA:\n  S. 3475. A bill to provide housing assistance for very low-income \nveterans; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Homes for \nHeroes Act of 2006.\n  When we talk about veterans in Washington, I often think about my \ngrandfather, who signed up for duty in World War II the day after Pearl \nHarbor. He marched across Europe in Patton's army, and when he came \nhome to Kansas, he could have very easily faced some tough times.\n  He could have had trouble paying for college, or finding a job, or \neven finding a home. But at the time, he lived in a country that \nrecognized the value of his service--a country that kept its promise to \ndefend those who have defended freedom. And so he was able to afford \ncollege through the G.I. Bill, and he was able to buy a house through \nthe Federal Housing Administration, and he was able to work hard and \nraise a family and build his own American dream.\n  And after I think about my grandfather, and the opportunities he had \nas\n\n[[Page S5602]]\n\na veteran, I then think about a veteran I met named Bill Allen, who \ntold me that on a recent trip he took to Chicago, he actually saw \nhomeless veterans fighting over access to the dumpsters. Think about \nthat. Fighting over access to the dumpsters.\n  Each and every night in this country, more than 200,000 of our \nNation's veterans are homeless. And more than half a million will \nexperience homelessness over the course of a year. There is no single \ncause for this. Homeless vets are men and women, single and married. \nThey have served in every conflict since World War II. Many suffer from \npost-traumatic stress disorder; others were physically and mentally \nbattered in combat. A large number left the military without job skills \nthat could be easily used in the private sector.\n  All have risked their lives for their country. All deserve--at the \nvery least--the basic dignity of going to sleep at night with a roof \nover their head. And every day we allow them to go without, it brings \nshame to every single one of us.\n  This is wrong. It is because we're quick to offer words of praise for \nour troops when they were abroad, but quick to forget about their needs \nwhen they come home. It's wrong because we have the resources and the \nprograms in place to help solve this problem. And it is wrong on a \nfundamentally moral level--the idea that we would allow such brave and \nselfless citizens to suffer in such biting poverty. And so it is now \nour responsibility--it is now our duty--to make this right.\n  Last year, I introduced the Sheltering All Veterans Everywhere Act, \nS. 1180--the SAVE Act--to strengthen services for homeless veterans. \nThe SAVE Act would reauthorize and expand two of the most successful \nprograms in dealing with homeless veterans: the Homeless Providers \nGrant and Per Diem Program and the Homeless Veterans Reintegration \nProgram. In addition, the SAVE Act would expand the reach of the \nHomeless Veterans Reintegration Program to also include veterans at \nrisk of homelessness, so that we can work to prevent homelessness \nbefore it happens.\n  And while it is one thing to get veterans off the streets \ntemporarily; it is another to keep them off--to place veterans in real, \npermanent homes. In fact, the VA has consistently identified permanent \nhousing as one of the top three unmet needs in the fight against \nveteran homelessness.\n  That is why I'm introducing a bill today called the Homes for Heroes \nAct. This is a bill that would help expand access to long-term, \naffordable housing by creating a fund so that the community and \nnonprofit organizations could purchase, build, or rehabilitate homes \nand apartments for veterans.\n  So that we don't just leave them, to face their personal challenges \non their own, the organizations would also provide services like \ncounseling, employment training, and child care to the veterans who \nlive in this housing. And the Homes for Heroes Act would expand the \nnumber of permanent housing vouchers for veterans from the current \nnumber of less than 2,000 to 20,000. These are vouchers that have been \nhighly successful in giving veterans the chance to afford a place to \nlive.\n  Every day in America, we walk past men and women on street comers \nwith handwritten signs that say ``Homeless Veteran--Will Work For \nFood.'' Sometimes we give a dollar; sometimes we just keep walking. \nThese are soldiers who fought in World War II, Vietnam, and Iraq. They \nmade a commitment to their country when they chose to serve--and now we \nmust keep our commitment to them. Because when we make the decision to \nsend our troops to war, we also make the decision to care for them, to \nspeak for them, and to think of them--always--when they come home.\n  This kind of America--an America of opportunity, of collective \nresponsibility for each other--is the kind that any of our parents and \ngrandparents came home to after the Second World War. Now it is time \nfor us to build this America for those sons and daughters who come home \ntoday.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 3476. to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish \nemployee professional development programs at the Department of \nHomeland Security; to the Committe on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill help train and motivate our homeland security workforce. As the \nranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nFederal Workforce Subcommittee, I understand the challenges facing the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, DHS. Our committee and subcommittee \nhave held numerous hearings on a broad spectrum of DHS-related issues, \nincluding poor contract management, ineffective financial systems, and \nmajor human capital challenges. I have met with DHS employees and \nmanagement officials to discuss problems ranging from leadership \ndeficiencies and high employee turnover rates to management challenges. \nVacancies resulting from the recent departures of key, high level \nofficials further threaten employee morale and the Department's ability \nto provide for the security of our Nation. DHS cannot meet its mission \nif it does not have a well-trained and dedicated workforce. Failure to \nprovide adequate training and career development programs for employees \nwill have serious consequences for our national security.\n  My bill, the Homeland Security Professional Development Act of 2006, \nwill strengthen the workforce at DHS through the establishment of \nformal mentoring and rotational programs. The mentoring program will \npartner junior and entry level workers with more experienced employees \nto foster an understanding of how employees' roles and responsibilities \nfit into the Department's mission and to develop career goals. The \nvoluntary rotation program would place midlevel employees in a \ndifferent component of DHS for a period of time to provide for \nprofessional development; increased knowledge of the Department's \nvarious missions; and networking opportunities. Participants in the \nrotation program would be eligible for promotions or other employment \npreferences. Together the mentoring and rotational programs will \nimprove communication; strengthen recruitment and retention programs; \nhelp with succession planning; enhance networking opportunities; and \nprovide a pool of qualified future leaders.\n  I commend DHS for recognizing the need to strengthen its workforce. \nLast July, the Department unveiled its Homeland Security Learning and \nDevelopment Strategic Plan to align education, training, and \nprofessional development with the Department's strategic goals. The \nplan addresses the need to align education and professional development \nwith the Department's vision, mission, core values, and strategic plan. \nHowever, this plan alone will not address the daunting challenges \nfacing DHS. Congress must act to ensure that agency-wide employee \ndevelopment programs are in place to eliminate cultural and educational \nstovepipes.\n  My bill will increase employee organizational knowledge and technical \nproficiency in the critical homeland security skill sets required to \nkeep our Nation safe. For example, the Science and Technology \nDirectorate, S, would benefit greatly from rotational programs with \nother DHS directorates and components, including Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement, ICE, and Customs and Border Protection, CBP. \nRotations between these entities would ensure that S projects and \npriorities are correctly aligned with ICE and CBP requirements, in \naddition to ensuring a cohesive homeland security workforce.\n  Mentoring programs can hasten the learning curve for new employees, \nimprove employee performance, and alter the culture of the organization \nby creating a collaborative, team-based, and results-oriented \nstructure. Such programs have a proven track-record of success. \nAccording to the April 10, 2006, issue of Federal Human Resources Week, \nmentoring opportunities are welcomed by federal workers and help in \nrecruitment and retention efforts. This finding is not new. A 1999 \nworkforce study found that 35 percent of private sector employees who \ndid not receive regular mentoring planned to seek other jobs within the \nnext 12 months. This number was reduced to 16 percent when employees \nreceived regular mentoring. In addition, according to the International \nMentoring Association, employee supervision increases productivity by \nonly 25 percent. However, when training is combined with\n\n[[Page S5603]]\n\ncoaching and mentoring, productivity is increased by an astounding 88 \npercent.\n  One positive example of the benefits of mentoring is the apprentice \nprogram at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in my home State of Hawaii. \nEstablished in 1924, the Pearl Harbor apprentice program has graduated \nthousands of highly qualified and skilled journeymen to ensure that the \nU.S. Navy remains ``Fit to Fight.''\n  The Department of Homeland Security continues to face considerable \nmanagement, leadership, and human capital challenges. The Homeland \nSecurity Professional Development Act of 2006 will tackle these \nchallenges by building on the current training efforts of the \nDepartment and fostering a well-rounded and well-trained homeland \nsecurity workforce. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation and ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3476\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 503\n\n       Whereas, on May 27, 2006, a powerful earthquake measuring \n     6.2 on the Richter scale occurred in Indonesia, centered near \n     the City of Yogyakarta;\n       Whereas the earthquake and continuing aftershocks have \n     caused more than 5,000 deaths, resulted in serious injuries \n     to additional tens of thousands of people, and left hundreds \n     of thousands of people with damaged or destroyed homes;\n       Whereas thousands of people in the affected region are \n     living in temporary shelter or lack basic services, such as \n     clean water and sanitation, thereby increasing the risk of \n     additional suffering and death; and\n       Whereas the United States and donors from at least 20 other \n     countries have, to date, pledged several millions of dollars \n     in emergency and long-term reconstruction assistance, and \n     have begun to deliver humanitarian supplies to survivors of \n     the earthquake: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) mourns the tragic loss of life and horrendous suffering \n     caused by the earthquake that occurred on May 27, 2006, in \n     Indonesia;\n       (2) expresses the deepest condolences of the people of the \n     United States to the families, communities, and government of \n     the thousands of individuals who lost their lives in the \n     earthquake;\n       (3) expresses sympathy and compassion for the hundreds of \n     thousands of people who have been left with destroyed or \n     damaged homes or have been seriously affected by this \n     earthquake;\n       (4) welcomes and commends the prompt international \n     humanitarian response to the earthquake by the governments of \n     many countries, the United Nations and other international \n     organizations, and nongovernmental organizations;\n       (5) expresses gratitude and respect for the courageous and \n     committed work of all individuals providing aid, relief, and \n     assistance, including civilian and military personnel of the \n     United States, who are working to save lives and provide \n     relief in the devastated areas;\n       (6) urges the President and the Government of the United \n     States to provide all appropriate assistance to the \n     Government of Indonesia and people of the affected region; \n     and\n       (7) recognizes the lead role of the Government of Indonesia \n     in providing assistance and promoting recovery for the \n     affected population.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/07/senate-section/article/S5604-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5604-S5605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 504 EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT ACCEPT THE CREDENTIALS OF ANY REPRESENTATIVE OF \n THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBYA WITHOUT THE EXPRESSED UNDERSTANDING THAT THE \n  GOVERNMENT OF LIBYA WILL CONTINUE TO WORK IN GOOD FAITH TO RESOLVE \n OUTSTANDING CASES OF UNITED STATES VICTIMS OF TERRORISM SPONSORED OR \nSUPPORTED BY LIBYA, INCLUDING THE SETTLEMENT OF CASES ARISING FROM THE \n           PAN AM FLIGHT 103 AND LABELLE DISCOTHEQUE BOMBINGS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Graham Mr. Menendez, Mrs. Clinton, \nMr. Reid, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Biden, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kerry, \nMs. Stabenow.

Mr. President, in light of the recent announcement to \nremove Libya from the State Department's list of state sponsors of \nterror, I rise today to submit a resolution expressing the sense of the \nSenate that the Libyan Government should meet the terms of its \nfinancial commitment to the families of the victims of the Pan Am \nflight 103 bombing and other acts of terror supported by Libya before \nthe President accepts credentials of any representative of the \nGovernment of Libya. I am pleased that Senators Graham, Menendez, \nClinton, Kennedy, Biden, Lieberman, Levin, Kerry, Stabenow, Mikulski, \nSchumer, Boxer, Dodd, Bingaman, Allen, Collins, Burr, Salazar, DeMint, \nLincoln, Dorgan, Reed, DeWine, Kohl, Reid, and Santorum have agreed to \ncosponsor my resolution.\n  In May 2002, Libya made an unequivocal commitment to compensate the \nfamilies who lost loved ones in the Pan Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie, \nScotland, which killed 270 people, including 189 Americans. To date, \nLibya has not resolved these claims in full, particularly the last \ninstallment of compensation that is to be paid to each family upon \nLibya's removal from the list of state sponsors of terror. Now that the \nSecretary of State has announced Libya's removal from the list, the \nU.S. must ensure that Libya honors its commitment.\n  Before the U.S. normalizes its relationship with the Government of \nLibya, it is crucial that we underscore our expectation that Libya will \nfully honor its commitment to all these American families. The \nresolution also exhorts the President to press the Government of Libya \nto make a good faith\n\n[[Page S5605]]\n\neffort to resolve other outstanding cases involving U.S. victims of its \nstate-sponsored terrorism, including the 1986 bombing of the La Belle \nDiscotheque in Berlin, Germany, that killed two American soldiers and \nwounded dozens of others.\n  I am pleased that the Senate is considering this important resolution \nand urge its immediate adoption.\n\n                              S.

Bush \n     to rescind the designation of Libya on the list of state \n     sponsors of terrorism, thereby enabling the third trigger of \n     the agreement between the Government of Libya and the \n     families of the victims of the attack on Pan Am Flight 103 \n     for a final payment of $2,000,000 per victim;\n       Whereas, on May 15, 2006, Secretary of State Rice announced \n     the reestablishment of full diplomatic relations with the \n     Government of Libya, ending 26 years of isolation; and\n       Whereas the agreement between the Government of Libya and \n     the families of the victims of the attack on Pan Am Flight \n     103 incorporated a timeline for payment of the full \n     $2,700,000,000 that has not been met even though all of the \n     other conditions for such payment have been satisfied.\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) it remains an important priority for further \n     improvement in the relations between the United States and \n     Libya that the Government of Libya make a good faith effort \n     to resolve all outstanding claims of United States victims of \n     terrorism sponsored or supported by Libya;\n       (2) it is in the best interests of the long-term \n     relationship between the United States and Libya that final \n     payment be made to the families of the victims of the attack \n     on Pan Am Flight 103; and\n       (3) the President should not accept the credentials of any \n     representative of the Government of Libya without the \n     expressed understanding that the Government of Libya will \n     continue to work in good faith to resolve outstanding cases \n     of United States victims of terrorism sponsored or supported \n     by Libya, including the settlement of cases arising from the \n     Pan Am Flight 103 and LaBelle Discotheque bombings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/07/senate-section/article/S5605-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5605-S5606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 97--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n  IT IS THE GOAL OF THE UNITED STATES THAT, NOT LATER THAN JANUARY 1, \n2025, THE AGRICULTURAL, FORESTRY, AND WORKING LAND OF THE UNITED STATES \nSHOULD PROVIDE FROM RENEWABLE RESOURCES NOT LESS THAN 25 PERCENT OF THE \n  TOTAL ENERGY CONSUMED IN THE UNITED STATES AND CONTINUE TO PRODUCE \n          SAFE, ABUNDANT, AND AFFORDABLE FOOD, FEED, AND FIBER\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \nDeWine, Mr. Obama, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \nTalent, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Thune, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Kohl, and \nMr. Johnson) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry:\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a concurrent \nresolution which expresses the goal of the United States to provide 25 \npercent of the Nation's energy needs from renewable resources by 2025. \nI am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators Salazar, Lugar, \nHarkin, DeWine and Obama.\n  The goal of this 25 by 25 resolution is quite simple: to replace 25 \npercent of our total energy needs with renewable resources like wind, \nhydropower, solar, geothermal, biomass and biofuels by 2025. This is a \nbold goal, but given our current energy situation in the U.S., it is a \nnecessary goal.\n  In the past few years, we have seen the price of crude oil skyrocket \nfrom $25 a barrel to nearly $75 a barrel. This has caused prices at the \npump to escalate beyond $3 a gallon. Natural gas, used for electricity \ngeneration and industrial uses, has hovered above $6 per million BTU's, \nwhile hitting over $15 following the devastating hurricanes along the \ngulf coast.\n  The impact of these increased prices is being felt around the country \nby working families, farmers, businesses and industries. The increased \ncost for energy at the pump, in home heating and for industrial uses \nhas the potential to jeopardize our economic security and vitality.\n  And, because we are dependent upon foreign countries for over 60 \npercent of our crude oil, our dependence is a threat to our national \nsecurity. President Bush heightened the awareness of the problem by \nstating in his 2006 State of the Union Address that we are addicted to \nforeign oil. He highlighted as his goal to reduce our dependence on oil \nfrom the Middle East by 75 percent by 2025.\n  Our effort with this concurrent resolution is to signal to America's \nfarmers, ranchers and forestry industry, that we believe they have the \nability and resources to generate 25 percent of our energy needs. An \nthat it is in our economic and national security interest to do so.\n  There are many inherent virtues in producing our own domestic energy \nfrom renewable resources. It is good for our environment. It is good \nfor our national and economic security. It will provide an economic \nboost for our rural economies. And perhaps most importantly, it will \nensure a stable, secure, domestic supply of affordable energy.\n  Already, our farmers and ranchers are working hard to use their \nresources to produce electricity from wind, biomass and other \nagricultural wastes. In addition, corn, soybeans and other crops are \nbeing used to produce transportation fuels like ethanol and biodiesel. \nIt is evident that rural America has the drive to achieve this goal.\n  While this concurrent resolution states our renewable energy goal, it \ndoes not prescribe a way to achieve the goal. Rather, it recognizes the \nbenefit of implementing supportive policies and incentives to stimulate \nthe development and use of renewable energy. It also identifies the \nbenefits of technological improvements to the cost and market appeal of \nrenewable energy. The supporters of this goal commit to support \nsensible policies and proper incentives to work toward the goal.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues will recognize the importance and \ntimeliness of this effort, and will consider supporting us in this goal \nto produce 25 percent of our energy needs from renewable resources by \n2025.\n  There being no objection, the text of the concurrent resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 97\n\n       Whereas the United States has a quantity of renewable \n     energy resources that is sufficient to supply a significant \n     portion of the energy needs of the United States;\n       Whereas the agricultural, forestry, and working land of the \n     United States can help ensure a sustainable domestic energy \n     system;\n       Whereas accelerated development and use of renewable energy \n     technologies provide numerous benefits to the United States, \n     including improved national security, improved balance of \n     payments, healthier rural economies, improved environmental \n     quality, and abundant, reliable, and affordable energy for \n     all citizens of the United States;\n       Whereas the production of transportation fuels from \n     renewable energy would help the United States meet rapidly \n     growing domestic and global energy demands, reduce the \n     dependence of the United States on energy imported from \n     volatile regions of the world\n\n[[Page S5606]]\n\n     that are politically unstable, stabilize the cost and \n     availability of energy, and safeguard the economy and \n     security of the United States;\n       Whereas increased energy production from domestic renewable \n     resources would attract substantial new investments in energy \n     infrastructure, create economic growth, develop new jobs for \n     the citizens of the United States, and increase the income \n     for farm, ranch, and forestry jobs in the rural regions of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas increased use of renewable energy is practical and \n     can be cost effective with the implementation of supportive \n     policies and proper incentives to stimulate markets and \n     infrastructure; and\n       Whereas public policies aimed at enhancing renewable energy \n     production and accelerating technological improvements will \n     further reduce energy costs over time and increase market \n     demand: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that it is the \n     goal of the United States that, not later than January 1, \n     2025, the agricultural, forestry, and working land of the \n     United States should provide from renewable resources not \n     less than 25 percent of the total energy consumed in the \n     United States and continue to produce safe, abundant, and \n     affordable food, feed, and fiber.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/07/senate-section/article/S5606-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4192.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs be discharged \nfrom further consideration of H.R. 4311, and the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4311) to amend section 105(b)(3) of the Ethics \n     in Government Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App).\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today by amending and passing H.R. 4311, we \nmake another attempt to extend critical protections needed to keep the \nNation's Federal judges and their families safe. Last November, the \nSenate passed S. 1558, which extended for 4 years the ``sunset'' of a \nprovision granting the Judicial Conference of the United States the \nauthority to redact information from a judge's mandatory financial \ndisclosure in circumstances in which it is determined that the release \nof the information could endanger the filer or the filer's family. This \nprovision was first enacted in the ``Identity Theft and Assumption \nDeterrence Act of 1998'' and extended for 4 years in 2001. Chairman \nSpecter and I worked with Senators Collins and Lieberman to amend S. \n1558 to again include a 4-year ``sunset'' and also to extend its \nprotections to the family members of filers.\n  Like the more comprehensive court security measure Chairman Specter \nand I have introduced, S. 1968, the ``Court Security Improvement Act of \n2005, CSIA, from which it is drawn, S. 1558 provides judges and their \nfamilies with needed security by extending the judges' redaction \nauthority without interruption and expanding it to their families. It \nalso strikes the right balance with the need for continuing \ncongressional oversight to prevent the\n\n[[Page S5608]]\n\nmisuse of this redaction authority, which has been a matter of some \nconcern to me. I appreciate that the Judicial Conference is seeking to \nimprove its practices and the Senate passed S. 1558 because none of us \nwants to see judges or their families endangered.\n  However, the House failed to take up and pass S. 1558 before the end \nof the session. As I said last December, I was disappointed at this \nfailure, which allowed redaction authority to lapse at the end of last \nyear. Instead, the House passed a separate bill, H.R. 4311, which would \nmake redaction authority permanent and which fails to extend it to \ncover family members of filers. As passed by the House, H.R. 4311 would \nremove Congress' critical role providing oversight over the use of this \nextraordinary authority to redact financial disclosure forms. As \namended and passed today, H.R. 4311 restores the proper balance while \nextending the redaction authority, retroactive to its expiration last \nDecember, until December 31, 2007. It also makes protection of judges' \nfamily members explicit.\n  I hope that the House will join us without delay both in extending \nthe redaction authority and in expanding the scope of its protections \nto include family members, so that we can continue to protect the \ndedicated women and men throughout the Judiciary in this country who do \na tremendous job under challenging circumstances.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment at the desk \nbe agreed to, the bill as amended be read a third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statement relating \nto the measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4193) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to protect \n  family members of filers from disclosing sensitive information in a \n     public filing and to extend the authority to redact financial \n   disclosure statements of judicial employees and judicial officers)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. PROTECTION OF FAMILY MEMBERS.\n\n       Section 105(b)(3) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 \n     (5 U.S.C. App.) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A), by inserting ``or a family member \n     of that individual'' after ``that individual''; and\n       (2) in subparagraph (B)(i), by inserting ``or a family \n     member of that individual'' after ``the report''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF PUBLIC FILING REQUIREMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 105(b)(3)(E) of the Ethics in \n     Government Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C.

The question is on the engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill (H.R. 4311), as amended, was read the third time, and \npassed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/07/senate-section/article/S5608-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JUNE 8, 2006\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.
