Mr. President, words cannot express the sadness that my \nwife, Catherine and I felt when we learned Maggie Inouye had passed \naway.\n  Maggie was truly Dan's partner in life. Their courtship and marriage \nwas a love story for the ages.\n  As so many of us did during World War II, Dan put his education on \nhold to serve his country. When he met Maggie, Dan was finishing his \nundergraduate degree at the University of Hawaii. He knew instantly he \nwanted to marry her. On their second date, they were engaged.\n  From that point on, Maggie was a constant source of support and \nfriendship for Dan. She had a gift for teaching and a way with words. \nMaggie worked as a university speech instructor while Dan was finishing \ncollege. Many have praised Dan's speeches on the Senate floor, but few \nknow Maggie had a hand in our good friend's eloquence. As Frank Fasi, \nthe former mayor of Honolulu, once said, ``If anyone was responsible, \nshe was responsible for [Dan's] wonderful oratory.''\n  When Dan decided to go into politics, Maggie supported him, listened \nto him, and campaigned for him.\n  When Dan was elected to the House of Representatives in 1959, Maggie \ncame to Washington with him to help serve the people of Hawaii. It \ncould not have been easy to leave her family and friends in Hawaii \nbehind, but Maggie was a devoted wife--and in her own, quiet way, a \ndevoted public servant.\n\n[[Page S2146]]\n\n  In his autobiography, Dan tells the story of the day he was elected \nto the Senate. It was Election Day in 1962, and Dan and Maggie had gone \nto the polls. As they walked toward the voting booth Dan asked Maggie, \n``How do you think you'll like being a Senator's lady?''\n  Maggie looked at Dan and said, ``Being Dan Inouye's lady is what's \nimportant. The rest is just extra.''\n  That story really tells you who Maggie Inouye was. She was an elegant \nwoman. Her love for Dan was absolute, and she was completely devoted to \nhim.\n  Maggie lived her life with great dignity, grace, and optimism. It was \nthese qualities that drew Dan to her 58 years ago. Even illness could \nnot dampen her spirit.\n  Catherine and I extend our deepest sympathies to Dan, their son Kenny \nand his wife Jessica, and Maggie's five sisters. Maggie will be sorely \nmissed by all who knew her.\n  As everyone can tell, I too have a mentor in my wife Catherine. Dr. \nLindsey Hayes helped me prepare these remarks.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. In my capacity as a Senator from the State \nof Alaska, I ask the calling of the quorum be rescinded.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/15/senate-section/article/S2146-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3068\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thought the chairman of the Committee on \nthe Budget, Senator Gregg, might give us a little bit more texture \nabout the order of the day, but I think the majority leader pointed out \nwhat the schedule is going to be. The first amendment, as I understand \nthat is to be laid down, is an amendment which I now ask unanimous \nconsent to call up.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself and Mr. \n     Cornyn, proposes amendment numbered 3068.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To designate $2 billion in immigration- and homeland \nsecurity-related funding for interior enforcement purposes, including, \n    but not limited to: federal detention bed spaces and personnel; \n implementation of an expanded and user-friendly Electronic Employment \n Verification System; and, additional worksite enforcement personnel, \n    including additional immigration enforcement agents, forensics \n  auditors, fraud agents, intelligence research assistants, employer \n                    outreach assistants, and others)\n\n       On page 24, line 24, increase the amount by $2,000,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 25, increase the amount by $2,000,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 23, decrease the amount by $2,000,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 24, decrease the amount by $2,000,000,000.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Cornyn be \nadded as an original cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. By way of brief explanation, this amendment adds, with an \noffset from the function 920, a total of $2 billion to the fiscal year \n2007 budget for the purpose of additional immigration and Homeland \nSecurity resources. The actual tally of costs that we are probably \ngoing to have to bear exceeds this amount. But in effect, this will be \na downpayment toward the necessary work to be done in beginning to \nprepare for a temporary worker program, a worker eligibility or \nverification program and other elements of a comprehensive immigration \nreform that would be necessary to fit together once the Senate acts and \nthe House acts on such a system.\n  In addition, funding that could be included within this $2 billion is \nthe State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, or SCAAP funding, which \nthe budget currently does not fund but which historically has been \nfunded at up to about $600 million. Last year, it was a little more \nthan a third that much. Clearly, Congress needs to act to reinstate the \nfunding for the SCAAP program. This amendment can accommodate that \nfunding as well.\n  Let me list the primary elements of this particular amendment that \nfunds programs necessary to begin the development of the worker \nverification program in connection with comprehensive immigration \nreform.\n  One thing we need to do is to implement an electronic employment \nverification system and clean up the Social Security database and \nreissue a secure Social Security card and number to workers in the \nUnited States as the primary method of verifying worker eligibility. \nThat is going to require not only work to clean up the database itself \nbut a broadening of the current basic pilot program which is the only \nprogram currently in existence that can electronically verify \nemployment. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated it will take \nabout $450 million to erect the system and, in effect, to make the \nbasic pilot program through the Department of Homeland Security \nmandatory, rather than discretionary, over a period of 5 years, about \n$90 million each year.\n  The Social Security Administration has estimated costs with regard to \ncreating a system to produce a secure Social Security card and \ndistribute that. Those costs vary widely in terms of the estimates. One \nestimate that could be made, based upon information that has been \nprovided, would provide a cost of about $1.14 billion a year to \nactually get this entire system up and running. That cost, or part of \nthat for 1 year could be included within the $2 billion that is \nspecified in this amendment.\n  Second, we are going to need worksite enforcement personnel. One of \nthe areas that has been neglected in the current enforcement regime is \nthe following up or auditing of employers who, in many cases, are \nemploying illegal immigrants. The Bureau of Immigration Enforcement, \nresponsible for enforcing immigration laws at the worksite, has \nrequested 200 full-time employees, about a $23 million expense\n\n[[Page S2147]]\n\nin 2005. In 2006, an additional $18 million above the 2005 level, and \nthe 2007 budget requests $47.1 million for worksite enforcement to add \n206 agents and support staff for this effort.\n  However, there are clearly a lot more requirements to be met. Some 24 \nmillion business entities file income tax returns and the number that \ncan be checked is far less than that.\n  So it is clear we need additional administrative personnel so the \nauditing can be done and we can lay the basis for a workable worksite \nverification and enforcement program. Any immigration bill that passes \nthe Congress this year will fail unless the requisite number of \nworksite enforcement personnel is actually funded this year.\n  Let me just restate that. Whatever we do this year, we are going to \nhave to begin the process of adding the personnel, so that once we act, \nwe can begin to enforce whatever it is we pass. If we wait until after \nthe President signs a bill into law to do this, then there will be at \nleast a year delay as we ramp up the personnel and necessary other \nsystems to implement the law. So we need to begin this process now.\n  There is a potential to fund additional Border Patrol agents that \nwould be authorized under the program. There is, importantly, an \nestimate to increase the amount of detention space that we are going to \nneed that could be funded from this.\n  The 2007 budget for the Department of Homeland Security requests over \n$400 million to add about 6,700 additional detention beds, rather than \nthe 8,000 beds currently authorized each year, which would bring the \ntotal to 27,500. Clearly, at least 10,000 additional beds over the next \n5 years are going to be needed.\n  Let me explain the primary reason for this. The illegal immigrants \nwho are apprehended here, who come from countries other than Mexico, \ncannot easily be returned to their home countries in every case. In \nfact, in most cases, there is quite a delay. In fact, in some cases, \nthe countries will not even take them back. Clearly, either those \npeople have to be detained until they can be removed to their home \ncountry or they are released into our society.\n  The current policy has been one of ``catch and release,'' which means \nhundreds of thousands of people who come from countries other than \nMexico--many of them from countries of special interest; in other \nwords, countries from which terrorists have come--are simply melding \ninto our society, never reporting for removal. It is an unacceptable \nsituation, everybody recognizes.\n  In order to have the space to detain them until they can be removed \nto their home country, we need to appropriate additional money. This \nprovides the authorization for that additional detention space.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I mentioned the State Criminal Alien \nAssistance Program. The estimated cost to reimburse the States--about \n30 cents on the dollar--is $700 million this year. This funding \nprovided for in this amendment would enable us to provide that funding \nto the States and to the local governments, which have had to carry the \nburden of housing these illegal immigrant criminals, people who have \nbeen convicted in State courts of crimes, and then the States have had \nto pay the expense of their incarceration. The Federal Government has \nin the past deemed there is at least some responsibility to help bear \nthese costs. I think this amendment can go a long way toward meeting \nthis responsibility.\n  This additional $2 billion in no way covers all of the expenses that \nwould need to be covered. But in addition to that which is already \nprovided for in the budget--I have to take one second to compliment the \nchairman of the Budget Committee and the ranking member for their hard \nwork to gain additional resources in the budget for a variety of \nprograms to deal with comprehensive immigration reform. Their additions \nthis year are historic and welcome and needed. What this funding does \nis to complement that in some additional areas they have not covered so \nwe can get a start on comprehensive immigration reform and not be \nlagging behind 2 or 3 years simply because we did not anticipate the \nkind of expenses that would be needed to make such a program work.\n  So I compliment the members of the Budget Committee for their hard \nwork. I think this amendment should be accepted as an additional \ncomplement to what they did.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor at this time and hope to hear from \nmy cosponsor, Senator Cornyn from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Arizona for his \ntremendous leadership in this area. I wish to detail some of that \nleadership and some of the work he has done. I have been proud to work \nwith him.\n  I think what the amendment really helps to do is to serve as a wake-\nup call, a wake-up call to the Senate, a wake-up call to the Federal \nGovernment, and really a message that is being delivered day in and day \nout by people in my State and people all across America, who say they \nare sick and tired of the Federal Government not living up to its \nresponsibilities when it comes to securing our international borders.\n  We all know in minute detail how porous our borders are, and we know \nthat in the past the American people have been asked to accept \nsolutions--like amnesty in 1986--on the condition that the Federal \nGovernment would provide a means whereby employers could determine the \neligibility of prospective employees to work legally in the United \nStates. But while the American people were given an amnesty program, \nlegalizing roughly 3 million individuals, the Federal Government did \nnot provide the means for employers to determine whether that \nprospective employee could legally work in the United States.\n  The Senator from Arizona mentioned the basic pilot program which was \nsupposed to be the means to that end, but it was a purely voluntary \nprogram, and thus employers were left with a conundrum. They needed the \nworkforce, but they did not necessarily have access to a means to \ndetermine the legal status of prospective employees. So what they \nrelied upon were oftentimes what turned out to be fake identification, \nwhether driver's licenses, Social Security cards, passports, or the \nlike. We do not expect the employers in this country to try to be FBI \nagents or to conduct an independent investigation as to the legal \nstatus of prospective employees.\n\n  What this amendment will do is two important things. No. 1, it will \nbegin to cause the Federal Government to step up to finally begin to \nprovide the resources necessary to have a bona fide electronic \nverification system. But perhaps more importantly, it will demonstrate \nthe seriousness of the Federal Government to finally live up to its \nresponsibilities.\n  The people across America, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--we are \nhearing a lot from sectors of the employment community saying they need \na temporary worker program, a guest worker program. I think we all \nacknowledge it is important for us to determine who the 10 or 11 \nmillion people are who are currently in the country who have come here, \nperhaps legally in the first instance, but at least 40 percent of them \nhave outstayed their visas and are currently out of status or people \nwho have literally walked across or swam across the Rio Grande River to \ncome here.\n  But in a post-9/11 world, there can be no doubt we must know who is \nin our country and what their reasons are for being here, so we can \ncull out the criminals, the people who come here to do us harm, and \nincluding the potential prospects of terrorists exploiting these known \nvulnerabilities in our way too porous border. So we need a national \nstrategy to deal with that.\n  As the current occupant of the chair knows and the Senator from \nArizona knows, as members of the Judiciary Committee, we are working \nhard to try to come up with a solution to this extraordinarily complex \nproblem. The difficulty is compounded by the fact that, here again, we \nare playing catchup.\n  But the purpose ultimately served by this amendment as well as the \nbudget resolution that is pending on the floor--and the Senator from \nArizona rightly praised the chairman of the Budget Committee for moving \nfunds into building infrastructure along our border--the American \npeople need to know we are making a firm and solid\n\n[[Page S2148]]\n\ncommitment to do whatever it takes to make this system work and to \nfinally bring it under control. Because people are not going to accept \nthe bait and switch that essentially was foisted upon them in 1986, \nwhen they said take an amnesty, and then, on the condition we will have \nan employer verification system, we will actually sanction people for \nhiring people who cannot legally work in the United States, I do not \nthink people will be fooled again. I certainly do not plan to be part \nof that.\n  I know there are many in Congress and in the Senate who are \nabsolutely committed to coming up with a solution to this problem. It \nis not easy. But again, I do not believe the American people or our \nconstituents sent us here necessarily to do just easy things. They \nexpect us to come here and do more than go to receptions or meetings at \nthe White House. They actually expect us to do some real work. But it \nis going to take some real work, and it is going to take some real \nmoney to finally make the investment the Federal Government has to make \nin order to bring this broken system under control.\n  So I gladly join as a cosponsor of this amendment and ask for the \nsupport of all of our colleagues for this very important step forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me say on this side we agree entirely \nwith the need to put more resources into enforcing the border. And that \npart of the Senator's amendment on our side we strongly support.\n  Let me just register, as I have registered on previous amendments, \nthat the problem I see with this amendment is how it is paid for. It is \npaid for out of section 920. But there is no money in section 920. We \nkeep passing amendments that are theoretically funded by that source. \nBut before we started voting for additional amendments taking money out \nof 920, 920 was already $500 million underwater.\n  So what happens? What is the practical effect? The practical effect \nis that there will be an across-the-board cut on all discretionary \naccounts. We have now passed $10 billion in amendments that will be \nfunded by across-the-board cuts in discretionary accounts. That means \nwe will reduce homeland security, we will reduce law enforcement, we \nwill reduce national defense in order to pay for these amendments which \nare theoretically funded out of 920 because there is no money in 920.\n  So what we are left with is, at the end of the day, the appropriators \nhad $873 billion before this amendment, and after this amendment they \nwill have the same amount of money--$873 billion. If they are to use \nmore money within that allocation for this purpose, they will simply \nhave to reduce the other discretionary accounts. Of course, the biggest \none is defense. They will have to reduce homeland security. They will \nhave to reduce law enforcement. They will have to reduce the others. \nThat is the practical effect.\n  I know there are a whole series of other amendments that use 920 as a \nfunding source, when there just is no money in 920. So at the end of \nthe day, what is going to happen is there will be an across-the-board \ncut in all domestic accounts, and that will include defense, that will \ninclude homeland security, that will include law enforcement. So that \nis the practical effect.\n  The hard reality is, we had $873 billion for the appropriators before \nthis amendment. After this amendment, we will have that same amount of \nmoney for the appropriators. They will ultimately have to decide how it \nis funded.\n  With that, I want to indicate we would be willing to take this \namendment on a voice vote, if the Senator from Arizona would be willing \nto so do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I certainly am.\n  Let me, first of all, say I think the comments of the ranking member \nof the Budget Committee are entirely appropriate, and they are \nabsolutely accurate. It is a matter of setting priorities.\n  And to the point that we are requiring the appropriators to engage in \na very difficult job of setting those priorities and having to choose \nbetween different programs, I certainly take his point. He is 100 \npercent right. It is our view that, of course, among the highest of \npriorities is national defense, homeland security, and this is part of \nthat.\n  We hope to work with him and with the members of the Appropriations \nCommittee to try to make sure the priorities are established in the \nappropriate way. I do appreciate his cooperation here, and we are ready \nto take the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3068) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The regular order is now to go to Senator Nelson, is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the amendment by the \nSenator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator from North Dakota yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I would proffer a unanimous consent request \nthat since the Senator from Iowa is not able to be here right now--it \nis my understanding he is delayed in traffic--I be able to proceed by \noffering my amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Gregg and I have an agreement that \nneither one of us do unanimous consent requests without the other \ninformed or on the floor. I have been told by his staff that it is OK \nwith Senator Gregg. With that assurance, I have no objection. I thank \nSenator Nelson very much for being here to expedite the business of the \nSenate. It is gracious of him to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that the next \namendment be my amendment instead of the regular order of the Grassley \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3009\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I call up amendment 3009.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3009.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to protect \n  medicare beneficiaries who enroll in the prescription drug benefit \n                              during 2006)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND TO PROTECT MEDICARE \n                   BENEFICIARIES WHO ENROLL IN THE PRESCRIPTION \n                   DRUG BENEFIT DURING 2006.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate \n     levels and limits in this resolution for a bill or joint \n     resolution, or an amendment thereto or conference report \n     thereon, that would--\n       (1) extend the annual open enrollment period under the \n     Medicare prescription drug program under part D of title \n     XVIII through all of 2006 without imposing a late enrollment \n     penalty for months during such period; and\n       (2) allow a one-time change of plan enrollment under such \n     program at any time during 2006;\n\n     by the amount provided in such measure for those purposes, \n     provided that such legislation would not increase the deficit \n     for the period of fiscal years 2006 through 2011.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this is the deadline amendment \non the Medicare prescription drug, Medicare Part D, that the Senate has \nheard about now over the course of the last 6 months. Each time we have \nbeen in a parliamentary procedure where we have been able to receive a \nmajority of votes, in excess of 51 votes, but because of the \nparliamentary procedure we have found ourselves in, a 60-vote majority \nwas required. Not so today. This amendment can pass with a simple \nmajority vote, according to how many Senators are here, whatever is the \nsimple majority.\n  It is an amendment all of our Senators have been hearing a lot about. \nAs we have gone home to our States,\n\n[[Page S2149]]\n\nclearly every Senator has received an earful from senior citizens of \ntheir States in which the seniors have not only implored but in some \ncases begged for an extension of the May 15 deadline for signing up for \nthe Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  Why? Why are senior citizens confused and bewildered and, in some \ncases, frightened? They are confused because they are facing a \nmultiplicity of plans. For example, in my State of Florida, 18 \ncompanies are offering 43 stand-alone plans, 43 prescription drug plans \nthat a senior citizen is to try to make a determination about which is \nthe best for them according to the prescription drugs they need. They \nare confused and bewildered and, in some cases, frightened. Why are \nthey frightened? Because they know if by the deadline they don't make a \nchoice, they are going to be penalized 1 percent of the overall drug \npremium prices per month or 12 percent a year.\n  Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office, in determining what is the \ncost of this amendment over 5 years, has taken that into account and \nhas said it is going to be an additional cost on average to a senior \ncitizen of 6 to 7 percent. Our senior citizens cannot afford that. So \nthey are frightened.\n  They are also frightened in knowing if by the deadline they are \nconfused and they pick a plan hastily in order to satisfy the deadline, \nthey know if they happen to choose the wrong plan, they are stuck for a \nyear. That causes considerable consternation and fright, because the \nmedicines they take often are life giving. And thank the good Lord, we \nhave progressed to the point that now the miracles of modern medicine \nthrough prescriptions have become an opportunity for us to have a much \nhigher quality of life. A lot of the ailments that afflicted us 20, 30, \nand 40 years ago that had to be dealt with in a hospital by surgery and \nhospital procedures today can be taken care of, in large part, by \nprescription drugs. Naturally, senior citizens are confused. They are \nbewildered and, in some cases, they are frightened.\n  Every one of the Senators here has been hearing from their folks back \nhome who are saying: Help us. Yet this body has taken a position. We \nare looking out for Medicare instead of looking out for the people \nMedicare serves. It is the beneficiaries of Medicare, the senior \ncitizens of this country, we ought to be looking out for. So we have \nhad this issue twice in front of us with a majority vote. We are going \nto have another opportunity today.\n  The stakes are high because simply we need to provide our seniors \nwith the time and the resources they need to make an informed decision. \nIn some cases, this is a matter of life or death, especially for those \nwho are frail. How do we expect an artificial deadline to be handled \nwith someone who has the onset of dementia?\n  Further complicating matters, the Medicare prescription drug benefit \nhas been marred by implementation problems. These appear to be \nwidespread, and they are clearly adversely affecting vulnerable \nbeneficiaries. How many news stories have all of us read that talk \nabout the senior citizen who is distraught because they go to the \npharmacy and the pharmacy says: Your particular prescription is not on \nthe formulary of the new plan. We saw that in what is called dual \neligibles, in the shifting of Medicaid recipients over to Medicare. \nHopefully that is going to be worked out, but it is all a part of this \nimplementation of a new program that is having difficulty. Hopefully we \nwill get it right, but we need to give senior citizens a break and not \nhold them with the guillotine over their head with an artificial \ndeadline of May 15.\n  If we pass this amendment by delaying the late enrollment penalties \nand giving every beneficiary a chance to change plans once during the \nfirst year of the prescription drug benefit, then we can make sure our \ncitizens are not going to have to make hasty decisions.\n  This amendment that I offer on behalf of a bipartisan group of \nSenators, including Senator Snowe of Maine, instructs the Senate \nFinance Committee to extend the annual open enrollment period under the \nMedicare prescription drug program through all of 2006 without imposing \na late enrollment penalty and to allow a one-time change in the plans \nat any point in 2006.\n  We are going to hear some Members oppose this amendment by saying \nthat the Congressional Budget Office recently rescored the cost of \nextending the deadline. When the amendment was here before us a month \nor so ago, CBO had scored it at about a $300 million cost over 5 years. \nCBO now says it is going to cost $2 billion over 5 years. It is \nimportant to note that the new score by CBO is mainly due to the fact \nthat the enrollment program has gone so poorly. The new cost reflects \nthe fact that 10 million fewer people will be signing up for the drug \nbenefit than previously estimated. That is not the senior citizens' \nfault. Why should they be penalized by saying this is going to cost \nmore when, in fact, it has had such a problem in its implementation and \nit is not quite as attractive to seniors as the administration had once \nthought?\n  According to CBO's new estimates, if we extend the deadline for \nsigning up through all of 2006, 1.1 million more beneficiaries will \nsign up before the end of the year. In addition, 10 million \nbeneficiaries will pay lower premiums because they will have fewer \npenalties. So on the one hand, CBO is saying it is going to cost more \nbecause the enrollment program has gone so poorly, but on the other \nhand, the Congressional Budget Office is saying, indeed, if we extend \nit, we are going to have more beneficiaries sign up, over a million \nmore, they are saying, will sign up if we extend the deadline. And they \nare saying the beneficiaries who sign up--they are estimating 10 \nmillion--will pay lower premiums because they will have fewer \npenalties. What Senator would want to vote against this amendment and, \ntherefore, increase the cost to the senior citizens?\n  By opposing this amendment, if, indeed, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley, is going to oppose it, it would seem that \nthose who would oppose would suggest that you don't want to allow an \nadditional million beneficiaries to enroll in the program. I would \nthink we would want to enroll everybody as much as possible. And why \nwould we want to punish 10 million beneficiaries with higher premiums \nthrough penalties?\n  It is kind of arcane language but also, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, they have reevaluated the cost of the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit, and it is now projected over the \nnext 5 years, the overall program, to cost $5 billion less than \noriginally estimated by CBO. They also say by extending the deadline, \nit is going to cost another $2 billion over 5 years. That means that \nnet, it is going to be costing $3 billion less than originally \nanticipated. So in every way we look at it, it is a win-win.\n  It is a win for the seniors. It is certainly a win for the seniors in \ntaking them out of the confusion and bewilderment. It is a win for the \nseniors in them not paying more on their premiums with the penalties \nthat the CBO estimates. And it is also a win in that the overall cost \nof the program would be net less than what it was originally expected \nto cost.\n  This is a time-limited, very important step which would help ease the \npressure of the first year of this new drug program. So I think it is \ntime that we now go on the record with a majority vote and pass the \nextension for the relief of our senior citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have some points I would like to make. \nBefore I do that, I will respond to a couple of points that the Senator \nfrom Florida made. One was his speaking about the bewilderment among \nseniors about the program. I would say that a great deal of the \nbewilderment comes from the confusion that people have because of the \nrhetoric of people who don't like this plan and have tried to kill it \nwith rhetoric because they didn't have the votes on the floor of the \nSenate. That has not created a very good environment.\n  On the other hand, I can say that at my town meetings--I held 16, \nMonday through Thursday, during our last break--people who came \nexpressed some wonderment about exactly what program to get into. But \npeople who also had already selected a program gave very positive \ncomments about the benefit of the program to them.\n  The other point I would like to make, Mr. President, is the point \nthat was made that maybe the cost is coming in\n\n[[Page S2150]]\n\nless than what was anticipated because not enough seniors are coming \nin. I think it is very clear that the reason this is costing $8 billion \nless than what 3 years ago CBO estimated it would be for this year is \nbecause of the competition. As a conferee, as I was going through \nironing out the differences between the House and Senate on this bill, \nwe were very nervous that our anticipation of the premium being $37 a \nmonth, on average, might end up being much higher. And we, as writers \nof this legislation, would be embarrassed about that.\n  Competition has brought that premium down to $25. Instead of $37, the \naverage premium is $25. We were estimating that there would be all \nsorts of savings from competition because we were patterning this \nprogram after what the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan had been \nfor 4 years. It worked so well for Federal employees, we felt it would \nwork very well for seniors, and it is working very well in this respect \nfor seniors. But we estimated there would be certain savings.\n  Quite frankly, we were nervous about whether these savings would \nmaterialize. But they did materialize--to the point of adding up to \nthat $8 billion that I have referred to. But with specific drugs--we \nhave drugs and pharmacists coming in under these plans--brand-name \ndrugs are coming in on an average of 18 percent less than otherwise in \na pharmacy. If it is mail order, it is about 26 percent less. In the \ncase of generics bought at a pharmacy, it is 55 percent less, and for \nmail order it is 66 percent less.\n  So I suggest to the Senator from Florida that enrollment has nothing \nto do with it. The savings are coming because competition is working.\n  Now, another confession we have to make is that as we were writing \nthis bill, we wondered whether we would have enough plans sign up so we \nwould have this competition that works so well in the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Plan--even to the point where we decided we needed a \nbackup plan. Just in case only one plan signed up, we would make sure \nthe Government set up a competitive plan so that there would be some \nchoice for our seniors. We ended up with lots of plans, and we hear \nfrom the other side there are too many plans. Well, the marketplace \nbrought plans in and drove down the price. Some of these plans are \ngoing to get out because the marketplace is going to drive them out. \nHopefully, we still have plenty of choice when this all happens. But \ncompetition is working.\n  Now, also, I hear the rhetoric about too many plans being confusing. \nI just read in the newspaper in a whole other area, but to throw it out \nfor comparison, I heard that in regard to people signing up for health \nsavings accounts--HSAs--you have to have a catastrophic insurance \npolicy go with it. There are 96 companies selling catastrophic \npolicies. Yet we have had 3 million Americans sign up in less than a \nyear for catastrophic policies. I don't know whether it is confusing to \nthem or not, but they are joining. That is twice as many plans that are \navailable. We don't hear people complaining about too many plans out \nthere for health savings accounts.\n  So I don't know why--except for rhetoric to gain political \nadvantage--we talk about too many plans out there for seniors. The more \nplans, the more choice.\n  Do you think Congress has the ability to write one plan that is going \nto fit the needs of 44 million seniors and disabled people? First of \nall, if you did that, it would have to be mandatory. If you make it \nmandatory, it would be evidence that you never learned a lesson from \nthe last time we tried to extend Medicare and make it mandatory when we \nput a catastrophic program in in 1988 or 1989, which passed this body--\nI don't know--it was a closer vote than it was repealed.\n  But when you go home to the grassroots of Iowa, and every other State \nin the Nation, there is an uproar because it was mandatory and people \nhad to pay for something they didn't want to use. And in a year or two \nit was almost unanimously repealed by this body. So we believed it \nought to be voluntary, and it is voluntary. So if you don't want to \njoin, you don't have to join.\n\n  But if you want to join, everybody has different needs and desires \nand you ought to have some choice, just like Federal employees have. If \nit has worked 40 years for Federal employees, it seems to me that it is \na pattern that we ought to have enough respect for the seniors of \nAmerica to give to them.\n  Mr. President, I would like to go to the issue before us, an issue \nthat we have discussed before, not an issue that I entirely disagree \nwith the Senator from Florida on because I don't know what the \nsituation is going to be by May 15. But I know if you had an amendment \nup to extend the deadline for filing income tax on April 15 and you \nmoved it to May 15, everybody would be going to the post office on May \n15 to drop in their income tax forms, and I would be one of them. \nAmericans procrastinate until the last minute. Some are going to \nprocrastinate until the last minute on joining one of these plans.\n  The extent to which people benefit from this plan, particularly lower \nincome people, because it is highly subsidized--up to 98 percent--it \nseems to me the extent to which you want to give them more leeway, you \nare not being very humane to them if they can benefit from the program \ntoday instead of tomorrow.\n  So you may be right, but today you are not right. You may be right on \nMay 1. Maybe your timing is off. Maybe I am conceding too much. My \nstaff will probably tell me when I am done I was too good to you, that \nyou are too right. But there are other ways of doing what you want to \ndo, and I am going to suggest a way. You are probably going to disagree \nwith it.\n  Before I get to that point, I want to give some background. The \namendment by Senator Nelson is going to extend the open enrollment \nperiod. Information on the Medicare prescription drug benefits first \nbecame available last October, and then the open enrollment period \nbegan November 15. So today the open enrollment period has been going \non for 4 months, and there are still 2 months left before open \nenrollment ends on May 15.\n  I personally think that enrollment is going well. About a quarter \nmillion people--250,000 beneficiaries, in other words--enroll each \nweek. Enrollment in stand-alone plans in my State of Iowa increased by \n71 percent between January and February. At this rate, Medicare is on a \ntrack to reach the goal of 28 million to 30 million beneficiaries with \ncoverage by May 15.\n  I think making decisions about one's health care can, in fact, be \ndifficult. That is why information about the available plans went out \nway back in October. That is why beneficiaries have 6 months to make a \ndecision. That is why there are many resources to help beneficiaries \nlearn about their options and make their decisions. That is why \nbeneficiaries can change their plan choice once before May 15. But that \nsaid, I know there is concern that beneficiaries may need more time. So \nthe amendment I am offering would grant the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services the authority to extend the enrollment period. We are \njust 2\\1/2\\ months into this new benefit--the first expansion of \nMedicare in 40 years.\n  Personally, I think it is premature to change this date. So I offer \nthis amendment as a compromise. The amendment would grant the Secretary \ndefinitive authority to extend the enrollment period. It would waive \nthe application of the late enrollment penalty, and it would extend \nbeneficiaries' rights to change their plan, and to change it once. \nDespite the rhetoric that we constantly hear around here, I hope \neveryone wants this benefit to be successful.\n  I know there have been some disappointing startup problems, \nespecially for some of our Nation's most frail and vulnerable \nbeneficiaries. But what would you expect when, on January 1, you have \n44 million people rushing into a brand new Government program? There \nare obviously going to be some roadblocks, when people sign up on \nDecember 31 and go to the drugstore on January 2 to get drugs under a \nplan that you are trying to squeeze 44 million Americans into. It is \nquite obvious that there would be some problems.\n  I think the administration has made great progress in getting these \nproblems solved. The Secretary of HHS has sat down with our committee \non three occasions to hear both Republicans and Democrats, to listen to \nwhat the problems are.\n  I think it is mutually agreed that there were about seven areas where \nthere were problems. The question I\n\n[[Page S2151]]\n\nasked three times was: Is there any change in law that is necessary for \nthe Secretary of HHS in order to grapple with these problems? And the \nSecretary said, no, he had ample authority to do that. He pointed out \nto us the seven problems. He pointed out to us how he was going to \nsolve those problems. Between meetings, he gave us updates on progress \nbeing made toward solving those problems.\n  So I think we have a Secretary of Health and Human Services and we \nhave a director of CMS who are working more than full time, and a lot \nof these problems, quite frankly, are simply the technicians it takes \nto make sure the computer software is working right.\n  What is the problem?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator will note that the \ntime on this amendment has expired, although the amendment of the \nSenator from Iowa is next in line and it would be appropriate to \nproceed to that amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think we have a Secretary who is \nworking hard on it. There are problems, but at the same time, we are \nwriting a million prescriptions a day without incident. Beneficiaries \nare saving a lot of money.\n  I spoke with the Senator from Florida about how the average premium \nis now $25 a month, 20 percent lower than we first projected. I spoke \nwith the Senator from Florida about the lower drug costs, saving the \ntaxpayers dollars as well. Just this year, the benefit, as I said, will \ncost $8 billion less than originally thought. The 10-year cost has \ndropped by $180 billion.\n  I heard from a couple in Iowa who are saving nearly $2,800 a year. \nAnother Iowan is saving $1,750 a year. And here is another one. A \nperson from Massachusetts is saving $17,000--$17,000--a year on \nmedicine because they are participating in this program.\n  Getting this level of savings depends on strong competition among the \nplans, and we have that. Many people will remember the skepticism on \nwhether many plans would participate at all. Some would say that we \nhave too many choices and that is why beneficiaries need more time. \nThose choices, in fact--let me put it this way: It is not just choices, \nbut because of choice, we have competition keeping premiums low, and \nthey are letting people pick the plan that best suits their medical \nneeds.\n  My amendment strikes an effective compromise, I believe, to Senator \nNelson's amendment, which is before us. Senator Nelson's amendment \ncalls for a unilateral extension of the enrollment deadline right now, \nand it would extend it until the end of the year and into the \nenrollment period of next year.\n  As I said, I think it is premature to make that decision now. Some \npeople think 6 months is not enough time to make a decision on a plan. \nYet millions are enrolling even now.\n  Many people are also concerned about the late enrollment penalty. \nThis penalty is modeled after the way Medicare Part B has worked since \nits origination in 1966. There is a late enrollment penalty in Part B \nthat anybody who doesn't sign up for it when they get to be 65 will \npay, and that is there to encourage people to enroll early and to think \nof Part B as not some Government program, just a Government program, \nbut to see all of this--whether it is Part B or it is Part D, as in \ndrugs--as an insurance policy.\n  People who are 65 today thinking about signing up for the Part D drug \nprogram under Medicare may be very healthy and may think they have \nnever taken a pill in their life and that they will never take a pill, \nbut that is today when they are 65. They are not going to know what \ntheir health needs are when they are 70 and maybe get sick and have to \ntake a lot of medication.\n  It is a little bit as if you were never going to have a car accident, \nyou would never buy car insurance. If you were never going to have a \nfire in your house, you would never buy fire insurance. But Americans \nsee insurance as a very useful tool, a necessary tool to manage their \nrisks, and our seniors and disabled people ought to see this as an \ninsurance policy, maybe not needed today, but that will be needed some \nday, and they ought to be enrolled.\n  Obviously, if you didn't have that penalty in Part B and now in Part \nD, the drug part, then who would ever sign up until the day before they \nhave to buy their first pill, just as you would not buy your car \ninsurance policy until the day before you were going to have a car \naccident.\n  So I hope people see it as a good investment, as an insurance policy, \nas it has been for Federal employees for the last 40 years.\n  The late enrollment penalty is designed to encourage enrollment, and \nas with other coverage of insurance, it spreads these costs across many \nenrollees. The more people enroll, the lower the costs are for \neveryone.\n  So if the Senator from Florida wants to keep these costs continually \nlow, get more people under the umbrella, sell an insurance policy, as \nhe has been so successful selling people on the importance of keeping \nSenator Nelson in the Senate.\n\n  The open enrollment creates an enrollment deadline. The deadline that \nis involved in the open enrollment period encourages people to act, to \nget the protection against unexpected drug costs. We all know that \npeople sometimes wait until they need coverage to get it. It would be \nthe same as if only people with a burning house get fire insurance. If \nyou waited until the day before your house was going to burn down to \nbuy fire insurance, fire insurance would be awfully expensive. That \nleads to higher costs for everyone.\n  For the same reasons then, there is an enrollment period and a late \nenrollment penalty under Medicare Part B, not at all a new idea. The \npremise of the Nelson amendment is that Congress needs to override that \n6-month open enrollment period and make it even longer. The Nelson \namendment would do that today even though enrollment is on track. It \nwould extend the open enrollment period now even though we don't know \nwhether it will be necessary 2 months from now. It presupposes a bad \noutcome to the enrollment of Part D of Medicare. It plans for failure, \nand I think this plan, particularly with how successful the competition \nis, for failure is wrong.\n  Frankly, I think Senator Nelson's amendment has the potential to do \nmore harm than good, regardless of his good intentions. Without the \npressure of that May 15 deadline, many beneficiaries may forgo savings \nby putting off their decision.\n  Now, it may turn out that the enrollment period needs to be extended, \nas I said in my first remark to my colleague from Florida. And if that \nis the case, then my amendment would give the Secretary the authority \nto do that right away. No further congressional action would be needed.\n  Under my amendment, if in 2 months the Secretary determines the \nenrollment period should be extended, if enrollment is lagging, for \nexample, then he has clear authority to do that.\n  My amendment would also automatically delay the late enrollment \npenalty if the enrollment period is extended by the Secretary of HHS.\n  My amendment would provide the funding needed to continue the open \nenrollment period. This funding is needed to continue the round-the-\nclock operations of the 1-800 Medicare number, and the expanded \noperations for that open enrollment period.\n  I close this debate by reading an editorial from the New York Times \nin 1966. This was an editorial about the implementation of the original \nMedicare Program we have had on the books since 1966. A quote from the \nNew York Times:\n\n       But as Medicare gets underway, the danger is that the \n     strains on it will generate pressures for unsound change. \n     They will come from those who will be disappointed because \n     they have been led to expect too much as well as from those \n     who see failure in every shortcoming. Changes will come in \n     time, but they should be made on the basis of Medicare's own \n     experience. This great new experiment must be given ample \n     time to get over its growing pains.\n\n  Those growing pains for Part D Medicare are now just 2\\1/2\\ months \nold. So I go back to the first sentence, for the consideration of my \nfriend from Florida, ``that the strains on the system will generate \npressures for unsound change.'' I think his is an unsound change. This \nquote speaks volumes about our current situation with Part D Medicare.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and to oppose the Nelson \namendment.\n  Mr. President, do I have to ask to have a previous amendment set \naside\n\n[[Page S2152]]\n\nin order to send my amendment to the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, but the Senator should seek consent that \nthe time already used be charged against this new amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. You mean the time I used off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that time be \ncharged to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3073\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3073.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a reserve fund to allow for deficit-neutral \nlegislation that would provide for an extension of the Medicare part D \n                           enrollment period)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. RESERVE FUND FOR EXTENSION OF THE MEDICARE PART D \n                   ENROLLMENT PERIOD.\n\n       If the Committee on Finance of the Senate reports a bill, \n     or if an amendment is offered thereto, or if a conference \n     report is submitted thereon, that--\n       (1) authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     to extend the initial open enrollment period under part D of \n     title XVIII of the Social Security Act beyond May 15, 2006;\n       (2) provides funding to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \n     Services and the Social Security Administration for the \n     purpose of conducting enrollment activities for the period of \n     any extension of the initial open enrollment period;\n       (3) waives the application of the late enrollment penalty \n     for the period of any extension of the initial open \n     enrollment period; and\n       (4) permits beneficiaries to change their enrollment \n     election in such part D once during the initial open \n     enrollment period, including throughout any extension of the \n     initial open enrollment period;\n\n     the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may \n     make the appropriate adjustments in allocations and \n     aggregates to the extent that such legislation would not \n     increase the deficit for fiscal year 2007 and for the period \n     of fiscal years 2007 through 2011.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a \nquestion about this amendment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Let me get a copy of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has control of the time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will yield to whatever the Senator \nwants me to listen to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to ask the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa, does his amendment waive the penalties to senior \ncitizens or does it give the Secretary of HHS discretion to waive the \npenalties?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, to the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, \nif the Secretary extends the period, it automatically then waives the \npenalty for that period of time.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished \nSenator, if the Secretary waives the requirement--so the Senator's \namendment gives the Secretary discretion to waive the requirements of \nthe May 15 deadline?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The purpose of my amendment is--I think I am answering \nthe Senator's question. Let's say May 14 comes and the Secretary \ndecides we need more time and he makes a decision to extend that period \nof time. Let's say he extends it from May 15 to September 15. During \nthe period of May 15 to September 15, there would be no penalty.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for \nanswering the question.\n  I would inquire of the Chair, under the previous order, does the \nSenator from Florida have time to discuss the Senator's amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time in opposition is controlled by the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time do I have on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now a total of 13 minutes 30 seconds \nin opposition.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I \nunderstand the good intentions of the Senator from Iowa in what is a \ndifficult situation for him. The Senator from Iowa has indicated he had \na number of townhall meetings, of which there seemed to be complete \nacceptance and happiness with this prescription drug benefit. I want \nthe Senator to know that I, too, have had innumerable townhall meetings \nin my State of Florida, and I get exactly the opposite result. Perhaps \nthat is because it is a demographic fact that Florida has a higher \npercentage of senior citizens than most States. Perhaps it is that our \nsenior citizens are very aware and current on events and on news. \nPerhaps it is also because there is a great deal of activity in our \nState of Florida with regard to wanting to sign up for this plan, \nbecause we have the beneficence of the fact that so many seniors around \nthe country, including from the State of Iowa, the State of the \nSenator, retire and move to the State of Florida. So there is great \nconsternation, I want the Senator to understand, among seniors in our \nState.\n  The Senator mentioned earlier in his comments--and I don't take the \ncomments personally--he said there was a politicizing of this \nparticular issue. This Senator from Florida has an obligation to stand \nup and fight for his people. I can tell you that the senior citizens of \nmy State are concerned and they are confused and they are bewildered \nand, in some cases, they are frightened because of this. I will concede \nto the Senator from Iowa that what he said is true, that normal human \nbehavior is when we have a deadline, we wait until it is close to that \ndeadline to sign up. However, I would suggest to the Senator in his \nconsideration of this issue, and to the Senate as they decide between \nthe amendment of the Senator from Iowa or this Senator's amendment, we \nshould be looking at what is not best for the Medicare Part D benefit \nbut what is best for the beneficiaries, the senior citizens. When the \nSenator from Iowa tells us in fact his amendment is going to give the \ndiscretion to the Secretary of HHS, look what the Secretary has said; \nhe throws it right back to the Congress. He says:\n\n       If people haven't had time to enroll, that is a policy \n     decision that Congress has to make.\n\n  He said that a month ago, the Secretary of HHS, a distinguished \nSecretary in the President's Cabinet.\n  I would suggest to the Senator if we are going to make the policy \nhere, let's consider these people, these senior citizens who are \nanguished at this point.\n  I will simply close with this: Medicare first thought they were going \nto have about 35 million seniors enrolled in this program. Now they are \nexpecting that they are going to be about 10 million short, that there \nis going to be only about 25 million enrolled. CBO has estimated if we \nextend the deadline, we are going to get at least another million \nenrolled this year, and over the life of the program we will get that \nadditional 10 million. So why would we not want to go on and extend the \ndeadline and prohibit those penalties that CBO said will average to \nsenior citizens 5 to 7 percent? Why would we not want to go on and \nextend that deadline instead of leaving it to the discretion of the \nSecretary of HHS?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has used the 5 \nminutes allotted to him.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have 35 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 35 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I only want to clarify two things. One, \nif I said there were no complaints at my town meetings about the \nprogram, there were, but I found a great deal of people who had \nenrolled very satisfied and also satisfied with the process.\n  The second thing is, it has to be a policy decision by Congress to do \nwhat I want to do, so it is still up to Congress to make this decision. \nI would be willing to make this decision if it was made first, but your \namendment is up today. So it is still a choice we are making.\n\n[[Page S2153]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, was the Senator in the middle of his \nthought that he wanted to complete? Can he do that?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Of course.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nFlorida, and then we are going to go to the Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor 5 minutes, and then we are going to come back on this amendment. \nThe Senator from Pennsylvania has another obligation, so we want to try \nto accommodate him on that. But I give an additional minute at this \ntime to the Senator from Florida, and I will tell him we will have more \ntime for him momentarily after the Senator presents his amendment.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I can sum this up in 60 \nseconds. The choice here is between a direction by the Congress to \ndefinitely extend the deadline, or the alternative Senator Grassley is \noffering, which is to give the Secretary of HHS the discretion to \nextend the deadline.\n  The policy of the administration is clear. I asked Dr. McClellan, the \nhead of CMS, his position on extending the deadline and he said:\n\n       Senator, we are not supporting that legislation at this \n     time.\n\n  So I think it is clear, the choice is clear for the Senate between \nthese two amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, now we will go to the Senator from \nPennsylvania for 5 minutes to offer his amendment, and then we will \ncome back to this subject. So I alert the Senator from Florida, we have \nsome time remaining.\n  I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3050\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 3050.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum], for himself, \n     Mr. Coleman, Ms. Collins and Ms. Snowe, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3050.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase funding for the Community Development Block Grant \n                                Program)\n\n       On page 17, line 22, increase the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 23, increase the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 2, increase the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 3, increase the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 6, increase the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 7, increase the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 10, increase the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 11, increase the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 14, increase the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 15, increase the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 23, decrease the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 24, increase the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 1, decrease the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 2, decrease the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 4, decrease the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 5, decrease the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 7, decrease the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 8, decrease the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 10, decrease the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 11, decrease the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this is an amendment I am offering on \nbehalf of Senator Coleman as well as Senator Collins and Senator Snowe \non the CDBG Program. This is an amendment I worked with Senator Coleman \non last year. He offered it last year, and I want to thank him for his \ncooperation in allowing me to step forward.\n  This is an important issue to my State. It is an important issue to \nmost States across America. This is a program that is, I believe, one \nof the most effective programs we have in the Federal Government to \nhelp localities deal with housing problems, local economic development \nproblems, and community problems we have. In Pennsylvania we get well \nover $50 million a year for this program. I don't know of anything that \nunites Republicans and Democrats on a local level more than the CDBG \nProgram.\n  The Community Development Block Grant Program, CDBG, is a program \nthat takes money from the Federal Government and distributes it into \nthe local communities for local priorities. There is a broad degree of \ndiscretion in this program and it allows the local communities to \nleverage Federal dollars to attract, in some cases, private dollars \nand, in some cases, other State dollars or philanthropic dollars that \nare used for projects that are vital to the local community.\n  Unfortunately, in the last few years, the President has reduced the \nfunding allocation for this program. Last year we were able to put back \nsome of that money into CDBG. We ended up with about $3.7 billion for \nthe CDBG last year. My amendment would add $1.3 billion. That would \nbring it up to $4.3 billion for this year. That level, by the way, is \nexactly the level that was appropriated for CDBG in the year 2004. So \nwe are not talking about an outrageous increase; we are just trying to \nget back to historic levels of funding for this program.\n  Again, it is a program that is vitally important for the local \ncommunity. This is offset with section 920. I have heard the Senator \nfrom North Dakota talk about there being no money in section 920, and \nhe is absolutely right, there is no money in section 920. But what this \namendment does is set priorities. It says to the appropriators that the \nCongress--I think this amendment will be approved overwhelmingly--that \nthe Congress and the Senate believe this is a program that needs more \nrobust funding. This is a program that is a priority for the Senate and \nfor folks on both sides of the aisle.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to come here to speak on this very \nimportant amendment. It sends a very clear signal that this is an area \nwe need more resources devoted to. I thank the Senator from North \nDakota and the Senator from New Hampshire for allowing me the \nopportunity to speak at this time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3073\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is now \nrecognized to go back to the previous amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Chair inform me how much time I have on that \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6 minutes 12 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will not take all of that time. Let me \nsay this: I voted for the Medicare prescription drug program. I voted \nfor it because I think it will help a substantial number of my seniors. \nAlso, that legislation contained provisions to make Medicare \nreimbursement for rural hospitals more equivalent to what urban \nhospitals receive. In my State, under the old law, our hospitals were \nreceiving about one-half as much to treat the same illness as a more \nurban hospital. That was in part corrected in the Medicare prescription \ndrug legislation.\n  Let us be frank. The handling of the Medicare prescription drug \nimplementation has been a fiasco from beginning to end. I think every \none of us has heard loudly and clearly from our States--I certainly \nhave. I have done nine meetings in my State, including hosting \nSecretary Leavitt, on this question. It has been botched. The \nimplementation of the Medicare prescription drug bill has been \nbotched. On the day, the initial day, I have never seen such chaos. You \ncouldn't get through on the phones. You couldn't get through on the \nInternet. You couldn't get accurate information. Cards weren't in \npeople's hands. They automatically enrolled those who were eligible for \nboth Medicare and Medicaid in plans that often didn't cover the drugs \nthat they were on.\n\n  That is a fact. This was very badly handled by the administration, as \nbadly handled as anything that I have seen in 20 years representing my \nState\n\n[[Page S2154]]\n\nin the Senate. It was an absolute fiasco. That is a fact.\n  The question is, What do we do to try to improve the circumstance? \nThe Senator from Florida, who has a very large elderly population, has \nmade one constructive suggestion. He has said let's extend the \ndeadline.\n  Let me just say, in my State, 37 or 38 percent of the people who are \neligible have signed up so far. We have over 100,000 people eligible \nand only 37,000 have signed up and about half of those were \nautomatically enrolled. So the true signup, the voluntary signup is \nvery low.\n  It is clear we need more time. One of the problems is there are so \nmany plans that it just confuses people. There are 41 plans in North \nDakota. In all of the meetings I have had, people have said to me: \nSenator, how can you make any sense out of this, especially since, when \nyou go to the phone lines you can't get an answer; when you go to the \ncomputer, the Internet sites, you can't get an accurate answer? I think \nthe Senator from Florida is responsible in saying we ought to extend \nthe deadline.\n  According to the department, we now know that some 10 million people \nwill not have signed up in time. That means they will start to have \npenalties imposed on them. Ten million seniors, many of them frail and \nelderly, will start to be penalized because they can't make sense out \nof this profusion of plans and this confusion.\n  Senator Nelson has a very straightforward approach. He extends the \ndeadline. The Senator from Iowa has an alternative. His approach is to \ngive the department that has botched this signup the decision about \nwhether the deadline is extended. That is a very clear choice. Do we \nreally want the decision whether the deadline is extended to be made by \nthe people who made a hash of this program's implementation? Or are we \ngoing to take responsibility and extend the deadline so 10 million \npeople aren't penalized through no fault of their own. I think that \nchoice is very clear.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, as I have been traveling across the \nState of New Jersey on a listening tour, I have heard from countless \nseniors and their loved ones that the new prescription drug plan has \nbrought much confusion, concern, and difficulty.\n  In townhall meetings and in senior homes, these sentiments of \npuzzlement are echoed over and over again.\n  Knowing the challenges seniors are facing, I am committed to doing \nwhatever it takes to make this drug benefit something that helps \ninstead of hurts, which is why I am speaking in support of Senator \nNelson's amendment.\n  This amendment will make sure that instead of penalizing our seniors \nfor taking a little more time in choosing a plan, it will accommodate \nthem.\n  This amendment will make sure that instead of penalizing our seniors \nfor choosing the wrong plan, it will give them the flexibility to \nchange to the right one.\n  It is already March 14, just about 2 months before the May 15 \ndeadline for seniors to signup for a plan without being penalized by \nthe late enrollment fee.\n  And the tune I hear in New Jersey and across the country hasn't \nchanged. Seniors need more time to figure out how the new program works \nand which drug plan is best for them.\n  And it isn't just the seniors that need more time--let's not forget \nthat the Federal Government needed more time, too.\n  As a matter of fact, when the new drug plan was implemented, New \nJersey, like many other States, stepped up to the plate to provide \nemergency drug coverage to ensure that no one went without the \nlifesaving drugs they needed.\n  They did not do it because that was planned; they did it because it \nwas the right thing to do. They did it to make sure that there was no \nloss of life or emergency hospitalization due to the inability for \nindividuals to get their lifesaving and life-enhancing drugs.\n  The Federal Government dropped the ball, and our States picked it up. \nWhile the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid have agreed to reimburse \nNew Jersey and other States for their emergency coverage costs, our \nStates still haven't seen a check, and it will probably be a while \nuntil they.\n  I think our seniors deserve the same flexibility and understanding \ngranted to our Government.\n  We have a responsibility in Washington to ensure that the initial \nconfusion and problems with implementation do not go any farther.\n  Our seniors should not be punished for the shortfalls of this new \ndrug benefit. It is an issue of fairness. It is about keeping your \nword, about being accountable. And today we have the opportunity to \ngive our seniors the much needed extension of time and flexibility they \nneed to choose a plan.\n  I voted against the Medicare Modernization Act at the time because I \ndidn't think it would provide adequate assistance, and I have been \nsorry to see that the implementation has not gone as promised.\n  However, this is the prescription drug plan we have, and we must do \neverything we can to make it as helpful and beneficial as possible.\n  For that reason, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting \nSenator Nelson's amendment. It is the least we can do to make things \nright.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, has all time been yielded back on the \nother side on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been consumed.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All time has been consumed. I am prepared to yield back \nthe time on my side on this amendment so we can then go to Senator \nMurray so she can respond on Senator Santorum's amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask after we complete the Santorum debate \nwe move to your amendment on avian flu and then that be followed by--\nyou have another amendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have an amendment by Senator Wyden, or Senator Byrd, \nthat is next in the queue. I think Senator Wyden is our next amendment, \nand we will be prepared to go to that.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that after we complete the \nSantorum amendment we go to the Conrad amendment on avian flu, and then \nwe go to the Wyden amendment on Medicare.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let's reserve on that one until I make certain.\n  Mr. GREGG. Other than that, go to yours.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3050\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time is left on the amendment of Senator \nSantorum?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition on that amendment has the full \n15 minutes available.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield the full 15 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington for her use, or anybody she would designate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am here because the Senator from \nPennsylvania came to the floor this morning and offered an amendment on \nfunding for Community Development Block Grant Programs. First of all, I \nam delighted that the other side recognizes that the assumption in this \nbudget, to cut $1 billion from Community Development Block Grant \nPrograms, is absolutely unacceptable. Their assumption is absolutely \naccurate.\n  Across our country today, mayors and other community leaders are up \nin arms about the billion-dollar cut to Community Development Block \nGrant Programs that is in this budget, on top of what I might remind \nall of my colleagues was the $500 million cut from last year.\n  We all know these essential programs. They are essential for housing, \nan absolutely critical part of our infrastructure, making sure we help \ndevelop many of our neighborhoods across this country with that \ncritical seed money that brings those communities back up to standard \nand makes sure people have adequate housing while it creates jobs and \neconomic development in communities across our country. Robbing those \ncommunities of those funds right now when our country is struggling to \nget back on its feet is the\n\n[[Page S2155]]\n\nwrong thing to do, and the Santorum amendment recognizes that.\n  Here is my problem. Last night I was on the floor of the Senate. I \noffered a real amendment to restore the funding for Community \nDevelopment Block Grant Programs. It provides $1.3 billion, and it does \nit by adding real money to the budget amendment by closing corporate \nloopholes. The amendment offered by Senator Santorum is simply a \n``let's not worry, be happy until after the election'' amendment and \ndoesn't provide one dollar.\n  How do I know that? I keep hearing the other side go to the floor \nand--whether it is veterans or Community Development Block Grant \nPrograms or defense--say we are going to take money out of function \n920. I went to the budget resolution book and I looked up 920 to see \nhow much money was left. I was astounded to find out there is no money \nin function 920. In fact, they are half a billion dollars in the hole \nright now.\n  I see the ranking member, Senator Conrad, on the floor. If he \nwouldn't mind, I wanted to ask him a question because he knows this \nbudget better than anybody.\n  I ask, through the Chair to the ranking member, am I wrong, in \nlooking at this budget resolution, that the Republican Members are \ncoming to the floor offering amendments to pay for funding for CDBG or \nveterans or defense, when there is no money? I ask my colleague if he \ncould respond?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, unfortunately the Senator is completely \ncorrect. There is no money in function 920. The Senator is absolutely \ncorrect that when we started this process, function 920 was $500 \nmillion in the hole.\n  I guess what is even more remarkable is we have now had $10.5 billion \nof additional funding supposedly covered by function 920 when there \nnever was any money to begin with.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask my colleague, the ranking member of \nthe Budget Committee, then am I to assume that function is now $11 \nbillion in the hole? And we are hearing our colleagues on the other \nside say: Don't worry, be happy; simply take it out of the function \nwhere there is no money? I ask my colleague, the ranking member on the \nBudget Committee, is that real?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, it is not real. What is happening now--I must say my \ncolleagues on the other side have got an increasing habit of spending \nmoney that doesn't exist. We started out with function 920 having no \nmoney, in fact, being $500 million in the hole. They have now passed \namendments that take another $10.5 billion out of a function that has \nno money. What will the practical effect be? The practical effect will \nbe an across-the board cut in all the domestic discretionary accounts. \nWhat are they? It will cut defense, it will cut homeland security, it \nwill cut law enforcement. That is what is really happening.\n  It is the difference between doing something and acting like you are \ndoing something but not doing it. The fact is, as to the amendments \nthey have offered, before they offered them there was $873 billion \navailable to the appropriators for the domestic accounts. When all \ntheir amendments are finished, the appropriators will have--guess \nwhat--$873 billion, not a nickel more. So this is all a sham. It is \ncreating funding that does not exist. The Senator is correct. The \namendment that she offered really did offer new funds, additional funds \nto buttress the community development block grant.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, that sounds completely irresponsible to \nme, to send a false promise by some kind of sham vote that you are \nsupporting veterans or Community Development Block Grant Programs or \nall the other programs that we hear from the other side. I heard the \nSenator from Pennsylvania say this will just tell the Appropriations \nCommittee that this Senate says you are to spend that money.\n  I am the ranking member on the Transportation-HUD subcommittee. We \nare already looking at a transit cut of $100 million, an Amtrak cut, \nwhich I know the Senator from Pennsylvania cares about, a cut of $394 \nmillion, and the FAA is cut by $561 million, a safety factor.\n  I say to my colleague from North Dakota, I am completely worried \nabout the irresponsible message that these amendments are sending and \nthe sham that they are. I heard last night when I offered my amendment, \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee said we were raising taxes to pay \nfor our amendments on this side.\n  I want to ask this of the ranking member on the Budget Committee. My \namendment I am offering today is to restore Community Development Block \nGrant Programs at a real, significant number. The $1 billion cut in the \nbudget is irresponsible. Trying to pay for it out of sham money that is \nnot there is irresponsible. We are asking for $1.3 billion by closing \ncorporate tax loopholes. I heard those on the other side say that is \nraising taxes. I know my colleague, who happens to be the ranking \nmember, who happens to be one of the most fiscally responsible Members \non this side, is also a member of the Finance Committee. I would like \nto ask him, through the Chair, how he would respond to that being a tax \nincrease.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I do not believe it is a tax increase, to require people \nto pay taxes that are legitimately owed and due now that they are \nfailing to pay.\n  We could easily pay for the amendment of the Senator by shutting down \ntwo sham operations. Let me describe them. One is American companies \nand American wealthy investors--this will be hard to believe, but this \nis really going on--buying sewer systems in Europe, depreciating them \non their books to reduce their taxes in America, and leasing back those \nsewer systems to European cities so that they can run them. Shutting \ndown that scam, is that a tax increase? I don't think so.\n  Let me describe one other. The other day my colleague showed an \noffice building in the Cayman Islands, a five-story office building \nthat is the home to 12,700 companies. I say that is a remarkable \nbuilding. That is a real smart building, to be able to house 12,700 \ncompanies.\n  What is really going on? What is really going on is a giant tax scam. \nThey say they are doing business in the Cayman Islands. They are not \ndoing any business in the Cayman Islands. They have a file clerk in \nthis building who takes their financial records so they can claim they \nare doing business there. Why do they want to be doing business in the \nCayman Islands when they are really not doing business in the Cayman \nIslands? Because the Cayman Islands is a tax haven. It is a place where \nyou can show your profits and not pay taxes.\n  We could pay for your amendment five times over by shutting down \nthose two scams alone. That is not a tax increase. That is stopping a \ntax scam.\n  I might say, of the the amendments that have been passed so far that \nhave been theoretically funded by section 920, we had an amendment to \nincrease defense by $3 billion. That was funded out of section 920 when \n920 had no money. We passed an amendment for veterans, supposedly to \nincrease funding for veterans by $823 million, funded out of section \n920 when section 920 has no money.\n  We funded an increase in education by $2 billion out of function 920 \nwhen there is not any money. We had border security this morning, and \n$2 billion was supposedly paid for out of function 920 when we all know \nthere is no money in 920. So what will happen is there will be across-\nthe-board cuts and they will cut defense, they will cut homeland \nsecurity, they will cut law enforcement, and cut everything else. The \nfact is there is no new money to pay for any of them.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member for clarifying \nthat. I think it is important for all of us to understand that.\n  These votes we take today will have real consequences. How do I know \nthat? Not just because of the respect I have for the ranking member and \nhis explanation, because this is exactly what happened on this floor \nlast year when the Senators on the other side of the aisle offered a \n``don't worry, be happy'' amendment to restore funding for community \ndevelopment block grants, critical money for neighborhood restoration, \nfor low-income housing for our communities across the country.\n  Do you know what happened when we got to Appropriations? We didn't \nhave the flexibility because our subcommittee also has to fund Amtrak, \nairlines, transit, and other housing programs. There was no way to do \nit\n\n[[Page S2156]]\n\ndespite what the Senate voted on. They ended up having to cut $.5 \nbillion from the community development block grants.\n  It is a sham to me to watch these amendments march through here on an \naccount that has no money, that is deficit spent already, and try to \nsell to their constituents that we are doing something about it when \nevery Senator on this floor knows we ran into a train wreck last year \nwhich lasted well into this year on the Appropriations bills. Who was \nhurt? Not the Senators who voted for it, but our neighbors and friends, \nmayors and city councils and people on the ground across this country \nwho are trying very desperately today to try make sure that the most \nimportant citizens have critical housing infrastructure, that we create \njobs, that we have economic development, and that our communities \nbecome strong again.\n  I have said time and time again on this floor that we need to make \nour country strong again. The most important way we can do it is to \ninvest real dollars in our infrastructure. The CDBG Program is one of \nthe best ways to do that. Every Senator here knows it. The votes we \nwill take later today will be for sham accounts or a real vote. And \nwhen will it count? Next fall, when our friends and neighbors see the \nreality of these amendments and the budget impact on it.\n  I will conclude by saying that I have been around my State talking to \nmany mayors, talking to many community developers, hearing story after \nstory about how our communities have taken this small amount of money \nfrom the Federal Government and invested it wisely, created jobs, \ncreated housing, improved the lives of our citizens.\n  I know this CDBG cut, if we don't pass real money, will mean that \nPennsylvania will lose $46 million in funding. It means Minnesota will \nlose $15 million in funding. In my home State, it means $16 million. \nThose are not just items on a budget; those are real dollars that make \na difference in the lives of our friends and neighbors and communities \nacross the country.\n  This afternoon we will have an opportunity to cast votes for a real \namendment--the Murray amendment--that restores funding and makes sure \nour Appropriations Committee has the allocation that will allow us to \nfund the CDBG, or we can take a political vote and be happy for a day. \nBut it will not change anyone's life at home, and it will not restore \nhope and opportunity that this country so desperately needs today.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is regrettable, and it is frustrating, \nthat once again we find ourselves having to speak out on the shortfalls \nin the budget resolution for key community and economic development \nprograms. The budget before us slashes Federal assistance to distressed \nand underserved communities. These cuts are shortsighted, they are ill-\nadvised, and they represent a significant retreat from our longstanding \ncommitment to invest in our Nation's communities.\n  In just a few weeks, the Senate will again be asked to appropriate \ntens of billions more to help Iraq. Though the President's request for \nIraq funds is once again off the budget so that it avoids our normal \nbudget rules, the Iraq supplemental funding request once again is for \nreal taxpayers' dollars--no less real than the domestic cuts that the \nBush-Cheney budget proposes for the priorities of the American people \nhere at home.\n  That is why I am proud to join Senators Murray and Sarbanes, as well \nas 14 more of our colleagues--17 of us in all--in offering an amendment \nto the fiscal year 07 budget resolution to provide for an increase of \n$1.3 billion to restore the community development block grants, or \nCDBG, to the fiscal year 04 level of $4.3 billion. We fully pay for the \nincrease in funds by closing egregious tax loopholes that more than 90 \nMembers of this Chamber have already gone on record in support of \nclosing.\n  Our amendment is supported by those who know best how effective and \nimportant this program is to America's communities. The list of \nendorsements includes the National Association of Counties, the \nNational League of Cities, the National Conference of Black Mayors, the \nNational Association of Local Housing Finance Agencies, the National \nAssociation for County Community and Economic Development, the National \nAssociation of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, the Council of \nState Community Development Agencies, and the Local Initiatives Support \nCorporation. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from these groups in \nsupport of our amendment be printed in the Record.\n  The CDBG Program is the centerpiece of the Federal Government's \nefforts to help States and localities meet the needs of low-income \ncommunities. CDBG funds vital housing rehabilitation, supportive \nservices, public improvements, and economic development projects in \ncommunities across the Nation. It serves more than 1,100 entitlement \ncommunities, urban counties and States, and more than 3,000 rural \ncommunities. These investments help change the face of our communities \nfor the better and help improve the standards of living of Americans \nacross the Nation, right where they live, in their communities.\n  CDBG is one of the most effective Federal domestic programs helping \nto revitalize neighborhoods, and it has a proven record of results. For \nexample, in 2005, Vermont used CDBG grants to rehabilitate 771 units of \naffordable housing and to help create or preserve more than 500 jobs, \ndirectly helping to raise the standard of in Vermont's communities. \nThere are hundreds of similar stories across the Nation, but in each of \nthem the message is the same: CDBG funds are critical building blocks \nfor improving our communities, our neighborhoods, and our economy.\n  The CDBG formula allocation was $4.41 billion in 2001. Since then it \nhas decreased by $670 million, or 15.2 percent, with a 5-percent cut in \nfiscal year 05 and a 10-percent cut in fiscal year 06. The budget \nresolution for the coming year would further reduce the formula funding \nby 25 percent, cutting the formula allocation by over a third in just 3 \nyears. Communities that benefit from CDBG will be devastated if further \ncuts in funding are made to this program.\n  I recently led a bipartisan letter with Senator Coleman to the Budget \nCommittee attesting to the effectiveness of CDBG and urging that it be \nfunded at $4.3 billion in the coming fiscal year. Fifty-three Members \nof the Senate from both sides of the aisle joined me in this letter, \nwhich I ask to have printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. LEAHY. I wish to take a moment to explain the differences between \nthe Murray-Sarbanes-Leahy CDBG amendment and the amendment offered by \nSenators Santorum and Coleman. The amendment we offer facilitates \nrestoring these CDBG funds by increasing the budget cap by closing tax \nloopholes that the Senate has already supported closing, in previous \nvotes. This, in turn, makes real money available to the Appropriations \nCommittee to be able to spend for next year.\n  Increasing the cap is important because the budget resolution we are \nconsidering assumes domestic spending will be capped at the same level \nas the President's request. Simply put, the budget resolution assumes \nthat funding for CDBG will be reduced by the same amount as the \npresident has proposed, which would be a cut of $1 billion from fiscal \nyear 06 levels.\n  A separate amendment offered by our colleagues, Senator Santorum and \nSenator Coleman, also supports an increase of funding for CDBG, but it \nwould do so by asking the Appropriations Committee to impose across-\nthe-board cuts on all other domestic programs.\n  Speaking as an appropriator, I can tell you that all their amendment \nwill do if it passes is to tell the Appropriations Committee that the \nSenate supports CDBG. But that will not be enough to guarantee that the \ncommittee will hear and provide the Transportation-Treasury-HUD, TTHUD, \nAppropriations Subcommittee with a higher allocation to increase \nfunding for CDBG.\n  My colleagues should note that the Santorum-Coleman amendment is the \nsame as the CDBG amendment that passed last year. However, because it \nprovided no additional funding to the Appropriations Committee, the \nTTHUD Subcommittee received an allocation\n\n[[Page S2157]]\n\nthat was inadequate to fund all of the programs within its \njurisdiction. CDBG was the program that was on the chopping block, \nsuffering cuts of more than $400 million.\n  So if my colleagues want to simply signal their support for CDBG \nfunding to the Appropriations Committee, then they should vote for the \nSantorum-Coleman message amendment. Unfortunately, if they choose to do \nthat and that amendment passes at the expense of our amendment, they \nwill find that when it comes time to write the TTHUD appropriations \nbill, they will have failed to protect this important program from \nfurther cuts.\n  The choice is clear. Those who want to vaguely express support for \nthe CDBG Program can support the other amendment, which is a nice \nsentiment, like a Candygram. But for those who also really want to get \nthe job done, I urge support of our amendment.\n  I challenge each Member to go back to their States and to take stock \nof the benefits that communities have reaped through CDBG investments. \nI challenge each Member to visit with their local community action \ngroups and hear how they use the community services block grant to \nsupport the neediest in their communities. These programs fill a real \nneed and have proven results.\n  A cut of $1 billion in Federal funds, which is proposed in this \nbudget resolution, will result in the loss of at least $9 billion in \nmatching funds from local and State governments and nonprofit and \nprivate sector investments. I fail to see the wisdom in dismantling \nprograms that are so vital to our communities.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of the Murray-\nSarbanes-Leahy amendment and express their real support for these \nimportant programs.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                   March 14, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned organizations thank you for \n     joining 52 of your colleagues in signing a letter (attached) \n     to the Budget Committee leadership in support of a budget \n     allocation sufficient to fund the Community Development Block \n     Grant (CDBG) program at $4.3 billion for FY 2007. The \n     resolution approved by the Senate Budget Committee last \n     Friday would not allow for such a funding level. In fact it \n     adopts the funding level proposed in the President's FY 2007 \n     budget, which cuts CDBG formula grants by an additional $1 \n     billion over this year's $3.71 billion. Today the Senate will \n     consider alternative amendments to the budget resolution to \n     increase CDBG funding. We support a Murray/Leahy/Sarbanes \n     amendment to increase funding for the CDBG program by \n     increasing the overall discretionary cap. It is offset by \n     closing corporate tax loopholes, an approach that has had \n     overwhelming support by a bipartisan group of Senators. This \n     is the only way that the Appropriations Committee can \n     increase CDBG funding because it means additional dollars. \n     Reluctantly, we cannot support an amendment by Senators \n     Santorum and Coleman that increases funding for CDBG paid for \n     by an across-the-board cut in other domestic programs \n     (Function 920). This amendment is similar to an amendment \n     offered by Senator Coleman last year that passed the Senate. \n     In spite of this, the final FY 2006 appropriations bill cut \n     CDBG formula grants by 10 percent.\n       We strongly urge you to vote for the Murray/Sarbanes/Leahy \n     amendment that would allow appropriators to restore the CDBG \n     formula amount to the FY 2004 funding level. Thank you for \n     your continued support of the CDBG program and the good work \n     it does in our nation's urban, suburban and rural areas.\n           Sincerely,\n       National Association of Counties.\n       National League of Cities.\n       National Conference of Black Mayors.\n       National Association of Local Housing Finance Agencies.\n       National Association for County Community and Economic \n     Development.\n       National Association of Housing and Redevelopment \n     Officials.\n       Council of State Community Development Agencies.\n       Enterprise.\n       Local Initiatives Support Corporation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 2006.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Chairman Gregg and Ranking Member Conrad: As you near \n     consideration of the FY 2007 Budget Resolution, we urge the \n     Budget Committee to oppose the budget proposal to cut funding \n     for the Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) Program by \n     nearly $1 billion, or 25 percent. Instead, we urge the Budget \n     Committee to maintain the Federal government's commitment to \n     community development programs at the Department of Housing \n     and Urban Development (HUD) and support a budget allocation \n     of $4.3 billion in Function 450 for CDBG.\n       The communities that have benefited from CDBG will be \n     devastated if the HUD proposal to cut funding is enacted. \n     CDBG serves more than 1,100 entitlement communities, urban \n     counties and states, and more than 3,000 rural communities \n     nationwide. It is the centerpiece of the Federal government's \n     efforts to help states and localities meet the needs of low-\n     income communities. The Program funds vital homeownership, \n     housing rehabilitation, public improvements, public services \n     and economic development projects in communities nationwide. \n     It also supports community-based organizations and the \n     crucial work they do to deliver human services and rebuild \n     neighborhoods.\n       CDBG is one of the most effective Federal domestic programs \n     to revitalize neighborhoods with proven results. Over 95 \n     percent of the FY 2005 CDBG funding went to activities \n     principally benefiting low- and moderate-income persons. \n     Twenty-eight percent of CDBG funds supported housing \n     activities in distressed communities, 24 percent supported \n     public improvements, 15 percent went to the provision of \n     public services, and 7 percent supported economic development \n     activities. In FY 2005, CDBG housing projects assisted over \n     166,000 households, including financial assistance to new \n     homeowners and rehabilitation assistance to the elderly and \n     other existing homeowners. Economic development programs \n     benefiting from CDBG last year created or retained over \n     91,000 full-time jobs. CDBG also has a strong record in \n     business retention: CDBG has ensured that over 80 percent of \n     the businesses assisted through the program were still in \n     operation after three years.\n       The CDBG formula allocation was funded at $4.41 billion in \n     FY 2001. Since then, the formula allocation has decreased by \n     $670 million, or 15.2 percent, with a five percent cut in FY \n     2005 and a 10 percent cut in FY 2006. The FY 2007 HUD budget \n     would reduce the formula funding by an additional 25 percent, \n     cutting the formula allocation by over a third in just \n     three years.\n       In light of these drastic cuts, communities have struggled \n     to continue their programs and have discontinued critical \n     projects for low- and moderate-income persons. We therefore \n     ask you to reject the proposed cut and ask you to support \n     $4.3 billion in funding for the CDBG Program.\n       Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to \n     working with you to ensure that communities across the \n     country can provide good jobs, affordable housing, and public \n     services to meet the needs of all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n         Norm Coleman; Tim Johnson; Mel Martinez; Byron L. Dorgan; \n           Dianne Feinstein; Barbara A. Mikulski; Patrick Leahy; \n           Deborah Ann Stabenow; Daniel K. Akaka; Frank \n           Lautenberg; Paul S.

Mr. President, I rise to express my strong \nsupport for Senator Santorum's amendment to restore budget cuts to the \nCommunity Development Block Grant Program, or CDBG. I was proud to \nsponsor a similar amendment during last year's budget, and today I am \npleased to work with my good friend from Pennsylvania to restore CDBG \nfunding in this year's budget.\n  I am also pleased to have worked with the Senator from Vermont, \nSenator Leahy, in leading a bipartisan coalition of 53 Senators this \nyear in sending a message to the Senate Budget Committee expressing our \nstrong commitment to CDBG and reminding folks that cities from \nMontpelier to Minneapolis need CDBG to create economic opportunity and \nto grow jobs.\n  When we consider the budget, there are always a lot of tough choices \nto be made. We need to be fiscally responsible, and this is a fiscally \nresponsible budget. We need to look at the myriad of Federal programs \nand ask ourselves, does the program work? Is it cost-effective? Is it \nachieving its goals?\n  In the case of CDBG, the answer is yes, yes, and yes. CDBG was \nenacted in 1974 and has been assisting America's communities for 30 \nyears. It is a public-private partnership that helps State and local \ngovernment address community development challenges, including \ninfrastructure and housing. Over the first 25 years, it has created 2 \nmillion\n\n[[Page S2158]]\n\njobs and contributed in excess of $129 billion to the Nation's gross \ndomestic product. Dollar for dollar there is no better initiative to \nhelp States and localities undertake important economic development \nactivities than the Community Development Block Grant Program.\n  CDBG is not some abstract community and economic development program \nbut rather one that provides practical and long-lasting individual and \ncommunity wide benefits.\n  CDBG success stories abound in every State--just ask all the local \nmayors who are visiting our offices this week. They will tell you that \nCDBG is the lifeblood of community development.\n  As a former mayor, I know first hand the importance of the CDBG \nprogram. While mayor of St. Paul, CDBG provided funding that helped \nmake the Main Street Program--a downtown economic revitalization \nprogram--a success.\n  However my city of St. Paul is just one of many small and large \nexamples of CDBG's success in Minnesota.\n  In the city of Moorhead, CDBG has provided critical affordable \nhousing and rehabilitation assistance to the city's low and moderate \nincome families. By way of example, CDBG funding has enabled Moorhead \nto provide energy, electrical and structural repairs to John and Avis \nPearson both senior citizens with a combined income of $25,000. CDBG \nfunding has also helped to revitalize Romkey Park, a formerly blighted \narea of the city, through the rehabilitation of run down apartments.\n  In Anoka County, a major suburb of the twin cities, CDBG has provided \nfunding for the replacement of dilapidated mobile homes and the \nredevelopment of the city of Centerville. These are the sorts of \nprojects that improve the quality of life not just for those least \nwell-off but for the entire community by making it a more attractive \nplace to live and do business in.\n  Then there is the small town of Brewster which was awarded a one-time \nCDBG grant a few years ago. Thanks to that grant, Brewster was able to \nrevitalize a run down part of the town and in turn attract the \nMinnesota Soybean Processor, which led to the creation of 40 jobs. The \ncompany has now also opened a biodiesel division, which now employs \nadditional workers.\n  Despite the longstanding Federal, State and local bipartisan support \nfor this program and its long record of achievement, the future of CDBG \nis in serious jeopardy given the President's budget proposal to reduce \nfunding by $1 billion to $2.7 billion. Since fiscal year 2001, the \nprogram has endured a 15.2 percent reduction. In my home State, funding \nhas steadily declined during the past several years with funding \ndecreasing from $68.4 million in fiscal year 2004 to $58.5 million for \nthe current fiscal year. At the President's proposed funding level, \nMinnesota would receive approximately $43.7 million for fiscal year \n2007 or a 36 percent reduction from the fiscal year 2004 level.\n  I came to the Senate promising to be Minnesota's mayor in Washington. \nAs a mayor, I know that CDBG works, and as a Senator, I am proud to \nsupport this program and urge my colleagues to support the Santorum \namendment, which would provide the funding necessary for the program to \neffectively assist States and localities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield it. I thank the President.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1 o'clock \ntoday the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Murray amendment \nNo. 3363, to be followed by 2 minutes of debate and a vote in relation \nto the Santorum amendment No. 3050; provided further that following the \nvote on the Santorum amendment, the Senate recess until 3 p.m. in order \nfor the Senate to proceed to the House for the joint meeting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I have \nno intention of objecting, I want to clarify what the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member said--and they have been very helpful. My \nunderstanding is that we go to the Conrad amendment after that, the \navian flu amendment. It is my understanding per the agreement between \nthe chairman and ranking minority member that after the Conrad \namendment has been discussed, we would next go to the Snowe-Wyden \namendment.\n  Is that the understanding of the chairman and the ranking minority \nmember?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, actually there will be another amendment \ndealing with the avian flu by Senator Burr, and then we would to go to \nthe Wyden-Snowe amendment.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, is there a time limit for these amendments?\n  Mr. GREGG. They are all 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. That would mean that somewhere in the vicinity of a half \nhour or 40 minutes or so we would deal with it.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Wyden-Snowe amendment would be up sometime around \n11:25.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Without being argumentative, it is the Snowe-Wyden \namendment, but we are talking about the same thing.\n  I thank both the chairman and the ranking minority member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to claim the remainder of the time \non the Santorum amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 9\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair.\n  This discussion which recently occurred between the Senator from \nWashington and the Senator from North Dakota----\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a moment? It \nhas been brought to my attention that these amendments which we have in \ntrain, while we have an agreement they would be 15-minute amendments, \nthat has not been agreed to in a unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendments \nwe have outlined so far--the Conrad amendment, the Burr amendment, the \nWyden-Snowe, and if there is an agreement from our side in response to \nWyden-Snowe, they will all be 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, without second degrees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand I have 9 minutes. Good.\n  The discussion which just occurred between the Senator from North \nDakota and the Senator from Washington is a discussion which reflects \nthe difference between our views and how you should budget. Essentially \nwhat the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from Washington said \nis we should break the cap, we should spend additional money, and we \nshould raise taxes. Their approach to budgeting is to tax and spend. \nOur approach, on the other hand, has been to say if there is a priority \nwhich the Senate feels is a high priority, whether it is veterans' \nbenefits or CDBG--and there will be other amendments like these--that \nthe Senate should declare there is a priority and set up a process \nwhere other programs will have to be reduced in order to pay for that \nprogram within the cap. The Senator from North Dakota correctly \nreferred to it as an across-the-board cut.\n  Section 920 is a technical event. It does not have money in it, and \nit never has. But when you identify a 920 expenditure, it creates a \nmechanism where another program activity would be cut across the board.\n  That is the philosophical difference between our parties.\n  This budget increases the size of Government from last year to next \nyear by over $100 billion. That is the growth in this budget--over $100 \nbillion. The growth in the discretionary account will be about $30 \nbillion under this budget. Those are huge numbers of growth. That is \nexpanding the Government in a very dramatic way and a very significant \nway, much more so than I would personally wish to do. I wish to see us \ncontrol, for example, entitlement spending a little more aggressively \naround here, which is the\n\n[[Page S2159]]\n\nmajority of growth. But the fact is that is the growth.\n\n  What the Democratic proposals are saying--there have been innumerable \nones--is we should grow Government even more, we should expand \nGovernment even more, and then we should raise taxes to pay for that. \nThe traditional Democratic approach to Government is basically no end \nto the size of Government. There is no end to the amount of taxes they \nare willing to raise.\n  And this argument that they are going to use loopholes, I have to \nsay, is a little shallow. There was this loophole around here called \nCustoms fees which would be used to pay for new spending around here 45 \ndifferent times. People said we are going to take it out of Customs \nfees, and then they offset it because they didn't get a budget point of \norder against it.\n  This building in the Caymans is the new Customs fee. The simple fact \nis if you eliminated all the loopholes which they are talking about--\nthey may or may not be loopholes; I certainly think some of them sound \nlegitimate--that would be $11 billion you would raise over 5 years, all \nof them. They have proposed $133 billion in new taxes. So they are $121 \nbillion short.\n  Where is that going to come from? That is going to come from \nincreasing maybe the death tax, increasing rates, and increasing taxes \non working families, on small businesses, so they can expand \nGovernment. That is the difference of opinion which we have.\n  We don't believe that is the way you control the size of Government, \nto grow it and then raise more taxes to pay for it. We believe the way \nto control the size of Government is to set a hard spending level, \nwhich we have done, $873 billion, and hold that, and then within that \nspending level set priorities.\n  A lot of amendments come through here saying what the priorities \nshould be. I think they are fairly reasonable; some aren't. The fact is \nthey will all have to be shoehorned under that hard spending cap as \nlong as we maintain that spending cap, as we have done so far in this \nbudget process.\n  But every amendment offered so far from the other side of the aisle \nhas been a spending amendment which has broken that spending cap--\nincrease the size of Government; grow the Government; then raise taxes \nto pay for it, representing that it is a corporate loophole closing, \nwhich it can't be because they have already gone well beyond the \nestimates that are reflected in those loopholes which they allege \nexist.\n  There is a difference of opinion here. We happen to think we are \ndoing it the right way by setting the priorities under the cap. They \nthink they are doing it the right way by growing the size of Government \nbeyond the spending cap and then paying for it with tax increases on \nworking Americans. It is a difference of opinion.\n  I yield the remainder of our time on the Santorum amendment and we \ncan move on to the Conrad amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor the Conrad amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, before I go to the Conrad amendment, I \nwill take 5 minutes off the resolution.\n  The Senator is correct; we are now talking about the fundamental \ndifferences between us. We believe you ought to pay for your spending. \nWe believe we ought to pay the bills we are generating. We believe on \nthe Democratic side that you ought to match your spending with your \nrevenue so you are not increasing the debt.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle have taken a distinctly \ndifferent position. Their position is you increase spending. The \nSenator has identified the increased spending in his own budget, but he \nwill not raise the revenue to cover his spending. He won't make the \nhard choices. He won't cut his spending to match the revenue he is \nwilling to raise, and he will not raise revenue to cover his increases \nin spending.\n  The result is the debt is mounting dramatically because our friends \non the other side of the aisle refuse to pay the bill. They want to \nspend the money, but they do not want to pay for it.\n  When I grew up, common sense told you, responsibility told you, that \nyou pay your bills. You pay your bills. If you don't have the money, \nyou don't spend the money. That is the way I was raised.\n  Here is what is happening.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, I will not. I had a chance to listen and now I will \nhave a chance to answer.\n  Mr. GREGG. Do we know how long we are going with this little aside?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I don't know until I have completed my thought.\n  Here is what is happening with our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle. Here is what is happening to the budget. The debt is going \nup, up, and away. Every year under this budget plan they are going to \nadd to the debt. Here it is. We have a 5-year budget plan out here and \nthey are going to add to the debt $680 billion in 2007; $656 billion in \n2008; $635 billion in 2009; $622 billion in 2010; $662 billion in 2011, \nbecause they won't pay the bills.\n  They are running up the debt of this country in a way that is \nunprecedented, which risks our economic security, which risks our \nnational security, and it is utterly reckless and it is \nirresponsible. This budget is going to lead to interest rate increases. \nIt will hurt the economy. It is going to endanger our national \nsecurity.\n\n  The Senator is entirely right. We have a fundamental difference in \nview about how to handle the fiscal affairs of our country. We believe \non our side if you want to spend the money, pay for it. That is what we \nhave done with our amendments. When we have sought to increase funding \nor eliminate the cuts that the President's budget proposes--for \nexample, the President's budget proposes cutting education $2 billion. \nWe do not believe it is right to cut the budget of education $2 \nbillion. However, we also do not believe it is right just to put it on \nthe charge card, run the debt up--we paid for it.\n  The Senator talked about the amendments we offered in committee. He \nsaid we spent $126 billion. Yes, we did. And we raised the money, more \nthan enough money, to pay for it. We raised $133 billion. The Senator \nsays over and over that we increased the taxes to do it. No, we did \nnot. We paid for it by, No. 1, closing the tax gap--the difference \nbetween what is owed and what is being paid. That gap now is $350 \nbillion a year. That is no tax increase, to insist that people pay what \nthey owe.\n  Now the other side says there is not the money in the tax gap to pay \nfor that. Yes, there is. The Revenue Commissioner testified we could \nrecover $50 billion to $100 billion a year by getting companies and \nindividuals to pay what they legitimately owe. That is just a fraction \nof the tax gap.\n  I yield myself an additional 5 minutes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes and gives \nhimself an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. What is the regular order?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is recognized and the Senator continues to \nhold the floor, and I have an additional 5 minutes I have granted \nmyself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The consent order to go to amendments does not \npreclude yielding time off the resolution. That is what is occurring \nnow--time off of the resolution from the Senator's time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we also paid for our amendments by closing \ncorporate loopholes.\n  The Senator says there wasn't the money in corporate loopholes to \ncover the spending we have provided. That is not true. In fact, we have \ntaken a corporate loophole closing this body has previously passed and \nused it to fund high priorities such as money for education, such as \nmoney for veterans.\n  How has the other side done it? They have offered a series of \namendments to add more spending, but they have taken it out of a \nfunction that does not have any money in it. They have raised money for \ndefense, but they took it out of function 920, which does not have a \ndime in it. They said they raised spending on defense $3 billion. There \nis no money in the fund from which they say they are taking the money.\n  It is right here in the budget book, page 29. Go to function 920. \nHere it is. It says function 920 is $500 million in the hole. That is \nbefore they increased defense spending by $3 billion and supposedly \ntook it from function 920. That is before this morning, when they took \n$2 billion to supposedly strengthen our\n\n[[Page S2160]]\n\nborders. They took it out of function 920, where there is no money. It \nwas $500 million in the hole.\n  The Senator is exactly right. This does define the differences \nbetween our parties. We think we ought to pay for the spending; the \nother side just wants to put it on the charge card, run up the debt. \nThey have become a party of borrow and spend, borrow and spend, spend \nand borrow, run up the debt. That is exactly what they are doing today. \nThey are running up the debt of this country in a way that is reckless, \nthat is radical and should be stopped. That is why we are going to urge \nour colleagues to vote against this budget when the opportunity comes.\n  Let me go back to exactly what is happening. This chart shows \ngraphically the dramatic runup in debt in this country. When this \nPresident came to office, the debt of the country was $5.8 trillion; \nthat was the end of his first year. Today, the end of this year, it \nwill be $8.6 trillion. If this budget is agreed to, it will be $11.8 \ntrillion. They will have doubled the debt with this policy of borrow \nand spend.\n  That does define the differences. I am glad we have had a chance to \nhave this discussion.\n  I understand the Senator from Maryland has an inquiry?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield an additional 5 minutes to myself off of the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This borrow-and-spend policy which the other side of \nthe aisle is pursuing is the direct cause of the runup in the national \ndebt, is it not? This chart which shows the incredible expansion of the \nnational debt is the consequence of pursuing this policy. We are \nrunning record budget deficits, is that correct, I ask the Senator?\n  Mr. CONRAD. This has been the largest deficit in dollar terms in our \ncountry's history. But of course the size of the deficit does not equal \nthe increase in the debt; the increases in the debt that these budgets \nare providing are much more than the deficit. For example, the year we \nare in now, they say the deficit will be $371 billion, but the debt is \ngoing to go up by about $650 billion.\n  Our friends on the other side do not want to pay the bills. They want \nto spend the money, but they do not want to raise the revenue to cover \ntheir spending. That is what is really going on. They are unwilling to \ncut the spending to match the revenue they are willing to raise, and \nthey are unwilling to raise the revenue to meet their spending. Either \nway, they will not cut the spending to match the revenue, and they will \nnot raise the revenue to match their spending. The result is they tack \nit on the debt. Borrow, borrow, borrow.\n\n  They say things are getting better. Really? Things are getting \nbetter? Here it is. Here is what will happen if this budget passes. \nThey will add to the debt every year for the next 5 years more than \n$600 billion a year until we get to a point of over $11.8 trillion in \ndebt.\n  The proof is in the pudding. Later today, they will come before the \nSenate and ask to raise the debt limit in one fell swoop by $781 \nbillion--a further confirmation of the policy of this administration \nand our colleagues, which is a policy of borrow and spend, spend and \nborrow, borrow, borrow, borrow, run up the debt. That is where we are.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This also reflects or demonstrates a sense of \npriorities.\n  To take the amendment we were just considering, the Murray amendment, \nand then the Santorum amendment, the Murray amendment sought to avoid \nincreasing the deficit by adding money for the community development \nblock grant. All of the State and local governments are petitioning \nCongress for this. It is desperation time for them. She was prepared to \npay for it by closing some corporate tax loopholes, all of which have \npreviously been approved by the Senate, as I understand it.\n  So in terms of priorities, in effect, we are saying: Support the \nCommunity Development Block Grant Program, but pay for it by closing \nthese corporate tax loopholes; that is a higher priority. You do not \nraise the deficit, and you do not increase the debt by that amount. Is \nthat correct, I ask the Senator?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is entirely correct. That does define the \ndifferences here.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania, on the Republican side, offered an \namendment to add $1.3 billion for community development block grants. \nBut his amendment seeks to fund that amount how? By taking it out of \nfunction 920, just as we have had one amendment after another from the \nother side seeking to fund things out of function 920, where there is \nno money. They were $500 million in the hole when we started this \nprocess, and they have increased defense $3 billion. How did they pay \nfor it? By function 920, where there is no money. And then this \nmorning, $2 billion to strengthen our borders. How did they pay for it? \nFunction 920, where there is no money. They say that is responsible \nbudgeting, that this is the difference which defines our parties. They \nare exactly right--this is the difference which defines our parties.\n  When Democrats were in control, we paid down the deficit. We actually \nwere in surplus and, in fact, we were able to stop taking Social \nSecurity money to pay other bills. Now, with them taking over, we have \nreversed course, going from record surpluses to record deficits and \neven higher running up of the debt.\n  What they propose with this budget is more of the same--borrow and \nspend, spend and borrow, put it off, put it on the charge card, do not \nworry about it, tell the American people: You can have every tax cut \nand every spending increase, and you do not have to pay for anything.\n  I yield myself another 5 minutes off the resolution.\n  Does the Senator inquire further?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I inquire of the Senator, when the Bush administration \ncame in in 2001, wasn't the Federal budget in surplus?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. The Federal budget was in surplus by $128 billion. \nIn fact, we had a string of surpluses as the Clinton administration \nduring those 8 years brought spending down and revenue up. So we paid \nour bills. We stopped raiding Social Security. Now it has all been \nreversed, and we have record deficits with bigger amounts adding to the \ndeficit, and they are taking the Social Security surplus to pay other \nbills. Under this budget plan, they will take almost $180 billion of \nSocial Security surplus--money that is not really in surplus; it will \nall be needed, it will all have to be paid back--and they are taking \nevery dime to pay other bills. Just more of the same--run up the debt, \nand we will worry about it tomorrow.\n  At some point, we better start worrying about it today. The result of \nthese policies is that foreign holdings of American debt have exploded, \nabsolutely exploded. It took 224 years to run up $1 trillion of \nexternal debt. That is U.S. debt held by foreigners. This President has \nmore than doubled that amount in just 5 years. It is stunning, but that \nis what is happening.\n  The Dubai Ports deal, what is that about? I suggest that part of it \nis a result of our fiscal policy which is running up these massive \ndebts, increasingly funded by foreigners, so foreigners are holding all \nthese dollars. What are they going to do with them? In part, they are \ngoing to buy U.S. assets. They might as well put up a for-sale sign on \nthe country because what is happening is all this money we are \nborrowing because our friends will not pay the bills, they just want to \nborrow the money, and the result is we owe Japan $668 billion and we \nowe China over $263 billion. And guess what. They are sitting on all \nthis money. We owe the Caribbean bank centers almost $100 billion. They \ntake that money. They have to do something with it. What are they \ndoing? They are buying American assets.\n\n  So if you like the idea of shipping American jobs overseas, if you \nlike the idea of running up the debt, if you like the idea of going \ndeeper and deeper into the ditch, this budget is the one you ought to \nvote for because it continues this policy. At some point, this is going \nto have to come to a screeching halt because the bill is going to come \ndue.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question? Isn't more and \nmore of this debt we are running into being held overseas rather than \nhere at\n\n[[Page S2161]]\n\nhome? Hasn't there been a shift in who holds the debt, so we are \nbecoming increasingly dependent upon strangers to finance this deficit \nand this debt? Is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is exactly correct. Of the publicly held \ndebt, now almost 50 percent of it is held by foreigners. Isn't that \nstunning?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Absolutely stunning.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It used to be we borrowed the money from ourselves.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Not anymore. Now we are borrowing from Japan primarily. \nChina is next. Great Britain is third. The Caribbean banking centers \nare fourth. We owe them $98 billion. We even owe the South Koreans $60 \nbillion.\n  As to our colleagues on the other side, it is fine with them: Keep \nborrowing the money. Spend the money. Borrow the money. This is the \ndefining difference. I am glad our colleague, the chairman of the \ncommittee, made the point that this defines the difference. It \ncertainly does. We do not believe the appropriate policy is to keep \nrunning up the debt of the country, to keep borrowing the money, but \nthat is what this budget does.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Furthermore, doesn't this budget make it clear their \nprime priority on the other side is to provide these tax cuts, which \noverwhelmingly benefit the wealthy? The consequence of that is either \nwe run up the deficit and debt or we cut programs that are badly needed \nacross the country, particularly for working people.\n  So the priority that is being established is tax cuts first and \nforemost, which upon analysis are seen to benefit--I understand the tax \nbreaks for millionaires that have passed under the Bush administration, \nthe people with more than $1 million of income each year, amount to $41 \nbillion in the coming year--$41 billion. The community development \nblock grant proposal was for $984 million, one-fortieth of the amount \ngoing out in the tax cuts.\n  So those are the priorities that are being established here--the tax \ncut first and foremost--and the consequence is, you run up the deficit \nand cut programs which are badly needed by ordinary citizens all across \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator's 5 minutes has \nexpired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield myself--the Senator from North \nDakota and the Senator from Maryland took about a half an hour. I took \nabout 5 minutes. So I am going to yield myself 25 minutes to discuss \nthis issue in some depth because it is an important issue. I do believe \nthe characterizations here are interesting but inconsistent with the \nfacts.\n  The Senator from North Dakota says we are running up the debt. I \nsuppose you can argue that is true, yes, because we are operating the \nGovernment. But the second question would be, Who is running up the \nsize of the Government? That would be probably a more appropriate \nquestion. If you look at the Democratic proposals, as they have hit the \nfloor of the Senate, they are running up the size of the Government. \nThat is their goal.\n  They proposed amendments in committee that increase the size of the \nFederal Government by $127 billion. That is a huge expansion of the \nFederal Government. I give them credit, they pay for it with taxes on \nthe American people, raising them $133 billion. And they are not tax-\nloophole closers.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has claimed: Well, if you just \ncollected taxes that are owed, you might get up to $100 billion. That \nmay or may not be true, and we are going to try to do something to \naccomplish that. But as he well knows, CBO will not score that. They \nscore that as zero. So in order to get that $133 billion, they are \ngoing to have to raise taxes on working Americans because loophole \nclosers simply do not generate anything like that. The maximum amount \nyou can score for loophole closers is about $11 billion. So they are \ngoing to have to raise taxes at least $121 billion on working \nAmericans.\n\n  And then the Senator from Maryland says there is $41 billion out \nthere that you can just take from high-income Americans. If you grab \nthat, well, that is clearly a rate increase and a tax increase. But it \nis an inaccurate statement. Actually, the high-income Americans today \nare paying more--paying more--than they have paid at any time in \nhistory as a relative burden of taxes. Their number has gone up \nsignificantly. In fact, the time when they got the best deal, \nironically, was during the Clinton administration.\n  During the Clinton administration, high-income Americans actually \npaid less as a percentage of the gross tax burden, total tax burden in \nAmerica, than at any other time. It is only in the last few years that \ntheir percentage of the burden has gone up.\n  Why is that? Well, it is something called economic activity. When \npeople go out and they work hard and they are being productive, they \nend up paying more taxes. When tax rates are high, people seek tax \nshelters, and they hide income, and they invest it in things that give \nthem avoidance of taxes. Some of the things the Senator from North \nDakota would like to eliminate I would like to eliminate, too, that are \ninappropriate. But they also do things that are appropriate to avoid \ntaxes so they do not have to pay that high tax rate.\n  When you have a capital gains rate of 30 percent, people do not sell \ntheir assets. They hold on to them because they do not want to pay all \nthat money to the Federal Government, especially high-income people. So \nwhat we have seen is when we cut rates, high-income people started \ndoing things that generated revenue for the Federal Government, and it \nalso generated a tax burden on them that was higher. They were willing \nto take that because they were making more money. And it is shown \ndefinitively by the revenues we have received as a Federal Government \nas a result of the cut in the capital gains rate.\n  Now, the other side of the aisle considers the cut in the capital \ngains rate to be poison. They think it just benefits the rich and it \nshould not have occurred. They want to repeal it. They tried to put in \nplace pay-go to force the repeal of it, and they have all sorts of \nideas for how you eliminate it because this is the rate they see as the \nproblem in America, the capital gains rate being 15 percent instead of \nwhat it was. It used to be 30 percent.\n  What was the effect of cutting capital gains rates? It actually \ngenerated huge revenue to the Federal Government. Why? Because people \nwent out and started to undertake economic activity. They went out and \nsold stock. They went out and sold small businesses. They went out and \nsold real estate. That generated economic activity, which generated \ntaxes to the Federal Government, taxes which we did not expect to get \nof $81 billion. Then they took the money they generated as a result of \nselling those assets and reinvested it in more productive activity and \ncreated more jobs, took more risks. As a result, the economy is \ngrowing.\n  We have had month after month after month of growth in this economy. \nWe created 5 million jobs. We have had, I think, 30 months of growth in \nthis economy. And the 5 million new jobs we have created actually \nexceeds the combined jobs created in Japan and Europe during that same \nperiod of time. That is good economic policy.\n  Just last month, we created 234,000 jobs. Why? Because we created an \natmosphere where people are willing to go out and take a risk, where \nthey are willing to go out, invest their money, take a risk, and create \na job as part of taking that risk, and create revenue for the Federal \nGovernment because they create income. As a result, the revenues have \ngone up in this country.\n  So another chart is pretty dramatic. These are the revenue growths--\nthe yellow lines--in the last few years and what we project out into \nthe future--a 14-percent jump in revenue last year. Now, the other side \nwill say: But that is from a historic low. Yes, it is a historic low, \nwhich was driven in large part by the Internet bubble of the late \n1990s, the largest bubble in the history of this country or in the \nworld. It was a bigger bubble than the tulip bubble or the South Seas \nbubble. When the Internet bubble collapsed, we went into recession, and \nthat dropped revenues dramatically. Then we were attacked on 9/11, and \nthat dropped revenues even more.\n  So the President, with considerable foresight, I would say, decided \nto cut\n\n[[Page S2162]]\n\ntaxes before we got deep into the recession. As a result, there was \neconomic activity generated, and that has produced a significant upturn \nin revenues--one of the most significant upturns in revenue in history.\n  Now, here is the bottom line of this whole argument: We are reaching \na point where we are back to a historic level of what taxes have been \nin this country. Historically, taxes in this country have represented \nabout 18.4 percent of gross national product. And yes, they dipped well \nbelow that because of the Internet bubble and because of the attack on \n9/11 and the economic slowdown that occurred. But now they are headed \nback up because of the economic policies this President has put in \nplace, including creating more incentive for people to go out and be \nmore productive.\n\n  So within a year, or maybe a year and a half, we are going to be back \nto a tax burden in this country which is generating essentially what \nhas been the historic norm, which is about 18.4 percent--18.4 percent--\nof gross national product, with a Tax Code that does it by saying to \npeople: Go out and take a risk. Create a job. As a result of doing \nthat, give us some more revenue--because there will be more people \npaying taxes.\n  But if you look at the Democratic proposals which have come forward \nunder this budget, what they are suggesting is that this tax burden, \nthis historic tax burden of 18.4 percent, is not high enough. The \nAmerican people are fundamentally undertaxed, they are saying. They \nhave to be taxed more. And Government has to grow more. Government has \nto grow a lot more. We have to grow Government by $127 billion more, \nand then we have to hit people with another $133 billion in taxes. We \nwill get that tax burden up around 19 or 20 percent of gross national \nproduct, maybe get it up to 21 percent, 22 percent. Who knows how high \nit is going to go. It is going to go as high as they want to spend \nmoney. That is the difference between our parties. They believe in \nexpanding the Government and expanding taxes to pay for it.\n  When our members have come to this floor and suggested there is a \npriority for CDBGs or there is a priority for veterans, what they have \nsaid is they want that money to be spent there, but they are willing to \ndo it under a cap. They are going to control spending on the \ndiscretionary side of the ledger.\n  When the members from the other side have come to the floor and said \nthere is a priority for veterans or there is a priority for CDBG, they \nhave said: We don't want to have to be limited to any spending regime \naround here. We want to blow that cap. We want to add another $127 \nbillion to the cost of Government, grow the Federal Government, and we \nwill raise taxes to pay for it.\n  At least they have integrity on that point. I agree with that. They \nare saying: Grow Government, grow taxes, take that tax burden over the \nnorm of 18.4 percent. Take it up to 20 percent. Take it up to 19 \npercent of gross national product. And then take the size of Government \nand drive it up, too, over 20 percent, 21 percent, 22 percent.\n  What our people are saying--\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. No, I am not going to yield. Your side did not yield to me \nwhen you were talking.\n  What our people are saying is we have priorities, too. We recognize \nthat some things need more money than other things. We are willing to \ndo it within a controlled atmosphere of a spending cap that is $873 \nbillion. Within that cap, we are going to offer amendments to spend \nmoney on this item or that item, and in exchange for that we are going \nto cut across the board under 920. That is what it does. That is the \ndifference. We are willing to set priorities and limit spending. They \nare willing to set priorities, increase spending, and raise taxes to \npay for it.\n  This argument that these taxes are going to come out of some nonpenal \nevent to the American people, that it is not going to affect the \nAmerican people's income, that it is going to come from some corporate \nloophole or that it is going the come from some Cayman Islands place, \nis just--well, it is like the Customs fees. Forty-five times we used \nCustoms fees around here to claim we could raise spending. Finally, we \nactually did use the Customs fees, so we don't here about them anymore \naround here. Hopefully, someday we will wipe out the Cayman Islands \nbuilding so we won't hear about that anymore, either. But in the \nprocess, you cannot generate enough revenue from doing that to address \nthe $133 billion of taxes that are being raised here. The maximum you \ncan generate out of those items is $11 billion.\n  So this has been an interesting aside, well discussed, well \npresented. But I would like to suggest to the Senator from North Dakota \nthat we get on to the amendment process.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am not yielding the floor. I am asking the Senator from \nNorth Dakota if he would like to get on with the amendment process. I \nhave not yielded the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Momentarily----\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am not going to ask a question. I will respond to your \nquestion and just say, I think this is a healthy thing. Debate has \nbroken out here, which is a rare occurrence. You have done an excellent \njob of presenting your view. I have tried to represent our view. I \nwould like to respond briefly to some of the points you have made. \nPerhaps you would then like to respond briefly to some of mine.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would suggest, then, that we spend another 6 minutes on \nthis. You take 3; I take 3. Then we move on to your amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I wouldn't be prepared in 3 minutes to respond to your \nvery excellent presentation over the last 15. It will take me a little \nbit of time to respond to these things. I do think it is a healthy \ndebate. It will actually, perhaps, save us time because maybe we can \nthen reduce our wrap-up time at the end of the debate.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will yield the floor, recognizing that I will probably \nreclaim it for the amount of time that the Senator from North Dakota \nuses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, for whom I have \ngreat respect, the chairman of the committee, we have a very real \ndifference. We are highlighting that difference. That is a healthy \nthing. It is a debate.\n  Let me respond to something the Senator said. I have the same chart, \na little different colors, that looks at the spending and revenue lines \nof the Federal Government going back to 1980. The red line is the \nspending line. The green line is the revenue line. This is as a \npercentage of GDP. What you see is that during the Clinton years, the \nspending came down as a share of GDP each and every year. The revenue \nwent up. The result was, we stopped deficit spending. We stopped \nrunning up the debt. In fact, we were paying down the debt. Then \nPresident Bush came into office. The spending went up.\n  They make the assertion that we are the big spenders, but the fact \nis, during the Clinton years, spending went down each and every year as \na share of gross domestic product. During the Bush years, spending has \ngone up virtually every year.\n  On the revenue side of the equation, when President Bush came in, the \nrevenue side of the equation collapsed. The Senator says it collapsed \nbecause of economic slowdown, because of the Internet bubble. Yes, in \npart it did. But he never mentions the tax cuts. Hello? The tax cuts \naccounted for half of this drop. The result was discretionary spending \nwent up. Why did discretionary spending go up? For defense, homeland \nsecurity, and rebuilding New York. All of us agreed with that. On a \nbipartisan basis we agreed to spend more money to respond to the \nattacks on our country. So spending went up, but the revenue went way \ndown. The result is, more and more deficit, more and more debt.\n  Here is our fundamental difference. Our Republican friends want to \nspend the money, but they don't want to pay for it. They don't want to \nraise the revenue to meet their spending line, and they don't want to \nreduce their spending to match their revenue line. The result is the \ndebt is skyrocketing.\n  Here it is. This is the result of their policies. This is what the \ndebt was at the end of President Bush's first year, $5.8 trillion. We \ndon't hold him responsible for the first year because he was\n\n[[Page S2163]]\n\nstill under the Clinton budget. But look what has happened since. The \nPresident told us he was going to have maximum paydown of the debt. At \nthe end of this year the debt will be $8.6 trillion. It has gone up, \nup, and away. And if this budget is approved that our colleagues on the \nother side have put before us, and the President has put before us, the \ndebt is going to go to $11.8 trillion. They will have almost doubled \nthe debt.\n  Our colleagues on the other side have a mistaken notion on the issue \nof taxes. I would love to cut taxes 50 percent across the board. I \nwould be a huge beneficiary myself if we did that. But what would \nhappen? The debt would go up even more. Since we are borrowing almost \nhalf of this debt from abroad, we would be even more in debt to \nforeigners, the Japanese, the Chinese. Is that what we want to do for \nour future? I don't think so. I think that weakens us.\n  Our colleague keeps saying: If you cut taxes, you get more revenue. \nThe only evidence my colleague presents is in one type of tax, capital \ngains. He doesn't want you to look at the whole revenue picture because \nhe knows what I know: Revenue has not gone up with all these tax cuts.\n  Here is what has happened to total revenue. Remember, he has just \ntalked about a small part of the revenue base, capital gains. But here \nis total revenue. In the year 2000, total revenue for our country was \njust over $2 trillion. The next year it went down. And in that next \nyear, 2001, we had massive tax cuts. What happened to revenue the next \nyear? Did it go up or did it go down? It went down to $1.85 trillion. \nHow about the next year; did the revenue go up or did it go down? It \nwent down again, to $1.78 trillion. How about 2004; did the revenue at \nthat point exceed what it was in 2000? No. It was still far below what \nwe got in 2000. It was $1.88 trillion. We didn't get back to the \nrevenue base of the year 2000 until 2005. Those are the facts. Their \nidea didn't work. But they can't admit they were wrong. The result is \nthey keep on spending the money, but they won't raise the money to pay \nfor their spending. So what happens? The debt goes up, up, up.\n  Our colleague said the economy is really humming under their plan. We \nare seeing modest growth. But let's look in comparison to other times \nin our history when we were going through an economic recovery. First, \nmedian household income has declined for 4 straight years. That is not \na good sign. When we look at economic growth and we compare this \nrecovery to previous recoveries and we look at the nine recoveries \nsince World War II, nine periods when we were coming out of a \nrecession, on average in those nine other recoveries, economic growth \naveraged 3.2 percent. This time it is only 2.8 percent.\n  In addition, we looked at business investment. We went back and \nlooked at the nine previous business cycles, the nine recoveries since \nWorld War II. That is the dotted red line in terms of business \ninvestment. If at this stage in the cycle, we compare it to this \nrecovery, which is the black line, do you know what we find? Business \ninvestment is running 62 percent behind the average of the \nnine previous recoveries. And job creation? They are bragging about job \ncreation. Let me just say, there were 22 million jobs created during \nthe Clinton years. When we compare this recovery to the nine previous \nrecoveries since World War II, again, the dotted red line is the \naverage of the nine previous recoveries--job creation in this recovery \nis the black line--we are 6.6 million private sector jobs short of the \naverage recovery since World War II.\n\n  Again, I go back to the fundamental difference that we have. Our \nRepublican friends have a budget before us that is going to increase \nthe debt over the next 5 years by $3.5 trillion. That is their plan. Is \nthat what we want to do? Half of it is funded by foreigners. So the \nbizarre thing they are doing--because this budget increases spending. \nThis is their budget. It increases spending. The chairman has described \nthat. And it cuts taxes, even though we can't pay our bills now. So \nguess what. We get more debt funded by foreigners, more vulnerability \nto the country, more money we owe the Japanese, more money we owe the \nChinese. And then we wonder why the Dubai Ports deal occurred. There \nare going to be a lot more Dubai Ports deals under this fiscal plan \nbecause, under this fiscal plan, we are going to owe a boatload more of \nmoney.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, for the sake of figuring out where we are \ngoing, I can never remember who is the junior or senior Senator any \nlonger because the Senator from North Dakota came, went, and came back. \nHow much time do you think Senator Dorgan would like?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would like 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Why don't we give 5 minutes to Senator Dorgan, and then I \nwill respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this has been fascinating. I came in at \nSenator Gregg's presentation, nearly at a fever pitch, depending on \nwhat appears to be the indefensible. But it reminded me of how one \nargues in court. You take the best you have and then go at it with \nvolume--if possible, as much volume as is possible--and hope some of it \nsticks. It reminded me a little bit, too, of the message that Gen. \nGeorge Armstrong Custer received just before they actually got to \nHarden, MT, with the 7th Calvary. His scouts came back and said: Things \nlook pretty good up ahead. Things look pretty good.\n  General Custer got that message. It is the message I heard this \nmorning as I walked onto the floor of the Senate from our colleague, \nSenator Gregg: Things look pretty good up ahead.\n  Let's look up ahead for a moment. On page 28 of the resolution that \nsits on the desks of Members of the Senate, let's look up ahead, see if \nthings look pretty good up ahead. It doesn't matter how many trees you \ncut down to produce the charts, how much ink you use to create your bar \ngraphs. That doesn't mean a thing. Let's look up ahead just a bit.\n  In 2011, what is going to happen to this country under the best of \ncircumstances, under the most optimistic circumstances offered by the \nmajority party in their resolution? In 2011, we will be required as a \ncountry to borrow over one-half of a trillion dollars. That is how much \nthe debt will increase in 2011. So somebody brings this to the floor of \nthe Senate and says: We have a plan. Our plan is to put our fiscal \nhouse in order, and 5 years from now we are going to borrow over half a \ntrillion dollars and we call that order.\n  I said yesterday, I yearn for the old Republican Party. Both \npolitical parties provide grand opportunities for this country, and \nhave for two centuries. They both contribute to the well-being of \nAmerica and to the building of this great Nation. But there was one \nthing you could always count on the Republican Party to do, and that is \nthey wore gray suits. They were conservative. They would wear wire rim \nglasses, and they would look like they just swallowed a lemon. They \nwere very serious. You could always trust them to stand for fiscal \nresponsibility--always. Pay your bills, they would say. Balance your \nbudget. That is what you would count on them for.\n  That has changed a lot because the new majority party here says this \nis paying our bills and balancing our budget, page 29. Five years from \nnow, they say, their plan will have us borrow over one-half trillion \ndollars in that year alone. During the entire 5 years, as my colleague \nhas said, we will borrow over $3.5 trillion. And that is putting our \ncountry back on track? I don't think so.\n  It is time that even when we look in the mirror we be honest. It is \ntime this Congress be honest with itself. It doesn't take charts, \ndoesn't take the ink on charts. It reminds me of that old western movie \nline: What are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?\n  Let me choose to believe my own eyes. Let me choose to believe what \nis in the most optimistic assessment in this fiscal policy. This \ncountry is deep in debt, going deeper in debt. And, by the way, we are \ngoing to borrow about $600 billion this year, and that doesn't include \nthe $700-plus billion of trade deficit. So we are going to borrow about \n$1.3 trillion this year alone, just in this year alone, and we are \ntold: Gee, things are good. Things are good. Just like General Custer's \nscouts,\n\n[[Page S2164]]\n\nthings are really good up ahead. They are not. This country deserves \nthe seriousness of purpose on the part of Republicans and Democrats who \nare willing to stare truth in the eye. The truth is on page 28.\n\n  This country is off course, off track, and it is unsustainable. Yes, \nin trade it is off track. We are shipping jobs overseas at a wholesale \nrate, we are closing American plants, and we are up to our neck in \ndebt. We are selling America piece by piece, $2 billion a day, 7 days a \nweek, all year long.\n  In fiscal policy, we are borrowing and borrowing. My colleague from \nNew Hampshire talks about taxes. I understand the issue of taxation. I \nespecially understand the issue of those who don't want to tax but want \nto borrow and spend and say let the kids pay for it. That is not \nconservative. That is a new conservatism that, in my judgment, doesn't \ndo well by this country's future.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota makes my \ncase. The seriousness of purpose would require that they present a \nbudget, and if they did, they would be presenting a budget that had \ndramatic tax increases in it and dramatic expansion of the Federal \nGovernment, as has been shown by the amendments they have brought to \nthe floor--over $127 billion of expansion of the Federal Government, \nover $133 billion in tax increases.\n  That is just the start. The senior Senator from North Dakota \nbasically questioned this recovery. I suppose you can always walk \naround with a dark cloud over your head and claim there is no sunlight \nwhen the sun is shining on you. The fact is, this recovery has been \npretty good, especially in the context of the fact that we are fighting \na war and we have had basically the entire Gulf States wiped out as a \nresult of catastrophic natural events, Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane \nRita. If we look at some of the issues that affect people the most in \nthis recovery, let's look at the price of homes. They have gone up; \nthere have been historic increases. When that happens, everyone's net \nworth in America jumps. All homeowners' net worth jumps when the price \nof homes goes up. So everybody who is a homeowner has a little more of \na cushion to their life.\n  Dividend income has jumped dramatically as a result of the cut in \ndividends. Why? Because corporations, instead of borrowing and instead \nof using mechanisms where they reinvest maybe overseas--which seems to \nupset our colleagues on the other side--have decided to pay out \ndividends. So people who own stock in this country--the vast majority \nof Americans, by the way, either directly or through pension funds--are \nbenefiting from the fact that dividend income has jumped radically \nunder this administration.\n  Unemployment, during a period of fairly significant recession at the \nbeginning of this administration, and a period of war that has been \ngoing on throughout this administration, and a period where the gulf \ncoast has been overwhelmingly hit by an economic downturn as a result \nof the impact of the catastrophic events of Katrina and Rita, \nunemployment continues to drop.\n  In fact, I remember a couple years ago, under this administration, \nwhen the other side of the aisle was claiming we weren't creating \nenough jobs. We don't hear that routine anymore. Jobs are being created \nat a significantly faster rate than historic norms, and we are seeing a \nlot of people being employed--5 million jobs added, which is more than \nthe combined increase of Japan and Europe--which, by the way, has a \npopulation of about half again as large as ours--over the same period \nof time.\n  Productivity growth. This is an important one because it is a \nfunction of the tax laws that we put in place. Productivity growth is \nhigher than almost all prior business cycles. We have maintained \nextremely high productivity growth as a result of the fact that we have \ncreated a tax climate where people are having incentive to invest and \ncreate jobs, which we have talked about earlier. That is a hugely \nimportant factor, something that if you listen to former Chairman \nGreenspan, who I think is a fair arbiter of economics in this country, \nhe will tell you productivity growth is probably the most important \nthing. If you can keep that ahead of inflation, you are going to have a \nrobust economy, and we have certainly done that as a result of the \npolicies of this administration.\n  We have had 17 consecutive quarters of economic growth, economic \nexpansion. That is a very robust recovery under any definition of \nrecovery--17 consecutive months. It may not be as strong as other \nrecoveries, but it is certainly a very strong recovery and something we \nas a nation should be taking a fair amount of pride in.\n  That brings us back to the issue of tax policy because if you listen \nto the other side of the aisle, you would think that revenues were \nstill down as a result of Katrina, as a result of the attack of 9/11, \nand as a result of the burst of the Internet bubble, and they claim it \nis as a result of tax cuts. Revenues are not down; they are proceeding \nto go up. They continue to grow. At least their chart shows they are \nback to a historic level. That level that they are at is essentially \nthe level they should be at, which is the historic level that we pay \ntaxes as a percentage of gross domestic product. The Federal Government \nshould not be taking more than 18.4 percent of GDP out of the economy \nfor tax purposes. We are growing at a dramatic rate. These bars go up \nsignificantly, and they are going to continue to go up significantly \nbecause of the fact that we have in place tax policy that encourages \neconomic activity, risk taking, and job creating, which is so critical \nto the generation of revenue to the Federal Government. So we get back \nto what is the essence of the debate because I think it needs to be \nrestated.\n\n  The essence is this chart--they have their chart, and it is basically \nthe same chart, but we look at them differently. We agree that the \nchart is the same. The point is this: Revenues are coming back to their \nhistoric levels, 18.4 percent of gross national product. Spending, \nhowever, is not coming down as much as it should, and it is not coming \ndown not because we have not made a commitment to try to control \nspending--we have done that. Last year, we passed the first deficit \nreduction attempt on entitlements in 8 years. We got two votes from the \nother side of the aisle. There was no attempt to control entitlements \nfrom the other side of the aisle last year. There was opposition to \nspending control there. Then we put into place a cap on spending, and \nagain we didn't get any votes from the other side of the aisle.\n  What their proposal is, is shown in their amendment, which \nessentially says we are going to grow the size of Government, grow it \nabove that line where it is now, which is 20 percent; and we are going \nto raise taxes and grow the revenues well above the 18.4 percent, which \nis the historic norm. So they are basically saying they are willing to \ntake much more out of this economy to grow the Government, make the \nGovernment bigger than what has historically been the case, and they \nare also willing to take much more in taxes.\n  We don't think we should go that way. We think we should put into \nplace spending restraint. We would love it if the other side of the \naisle would support this. But there is no attempt to support the caps \nfrom any amendment offered on the other side of the aisle. Every \namendment that has come forward from them has raised the caps, raised \nthe size of Government.\n  There was no support for entitlement control on the other side of the \naisle--none. Well, there were two votes, I am sorry. I respect those \nvotes and I thank them. But the vast majority of the other side of the \naisle didn't want to do any entitlement restraint. To the extent we \nhave seen spending go up, it has only gone up in two categories--\nentitlements and national defense. National defense is something you \nhave to do when you are at war. So when the Senator from the other side \nof the aisle points to the spending chart going up, he knows and I know \nthat the extent that is discretionary spending, it is 95 percent \nnational defense because that is what we have to do when we are at war.\n  So if you are going to control the rate of growth of Government, you \nhave to control the discretionary side and the entitlement side. There \nis no attempt to do that on the other side. There is an attempt to \nexpand it. Yes, the debt goes up. Their argument is that we are \nexpanding debt. Well, that is true because we are fighting a war that \nwe have to pay for and because we\n\n[[Page S2165]]\n\ncannot get any support in a bipartisan way to address what is driving \nthe debt most, which is entitlement spending.\n  The President comes forward with a proposal on Social Security and \nsays everything is on the table. The other side says we won't accept \nanything. He comes forward with a Medicare proposal. Immediately, the \nleader on the other side of the aisle said the proposal was \ninexcusable, even though it was put forward by MEDPAC, an independent \norganization of health professionals, which suggested you can restrain \nthe rate of growth nominally with a couple of changes.\n  The same is true of Medicaid. What a battle we had last year to save \n$5 billion in Medicaid spending, with over a $1.2 trillion base, so we \ntook the rate of growth from 40 percent to 40 percent. We didn't even \nchange it. There was opposition every step of the way from the other \nside.\n  So it is very hard to give a lot of credibility to the idea that \nthere is a desire to control spending on the other side of the aisle. \nWhat this is on the other side of the aisle is shown by this chart, \nwhich is to increase spending, increase the size of Government, \nincrease taxes and, as a result, we refer to that as tax and spend, a \nterm which I believe is reasonably accurate in this context.\n  At this point, I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to myself off the \nresolution. We have heard from the other side that we have proposed \nadditional spending in the committee. Yes, we did. The difference \nbetween our spending and the spending the other side offered--and they \nhave offered, repeatedly, amendments to increase spending--is that we \npaid for ours. We paid for it.\n  The Senator has a list that shows we offered in committee amendments \nthat have increased spending $126 billion. Let me explain where almost \nall of that spending was. One amendment. One amendment to say that \nveterans of our country should have their spending considered mandatory \nrather than discretionary--mandatory rather than discretionary. I think \nmost Americans would say spending on veterans is not a discretionary \nmatter.\n  We asked them to go to war, asked them to put their lives on the \nline. In many cases, they have come back wounded, injured, and in need \nof care. Is it discretionary to fund those accounts, to take care of \ntheir medical needs? We don't think so. We think it should be on the \nmandatory side of the ledger. That is scored as $104 billion of our \n$126 billion of spending.\n  Now, yes, I will look anybody in the eye and say that was spending \nthat was responsible, to keep the promise made to our Nation's \nveterans. And we paid for it. We didn't just run up the debt the way \nour colleagues do. Over and over, they have voted for spending. We have \nshown the lines. Spending has gone up under this administration. But \nrevenue has gone down. They voted for all the spending, and they voted \nfor all the tax cuts, and the result is the debt is going up, up and \naway. So they are the party of borrow and spend. Borrow and borrow, \nspend and spend. They don't want to reduce any spending.\n  I don't see any amendments that they have offered to cut spending. \nThey offered amendment after amendment to increase spending, but they \ndon't want to pay for it.\n  The Comptroller General has told us that ``continuing on this \nunsustainable fiscal path will gradually erode, if not suddenly damage, \nour economy, our standard of living, and ultimately our national \nsecurity.'' He is talking about this runup of debt.\n  I want to conclude. My colleague said they had a deficit reduction \nplan and they didn't get a single vote from our side for it. He is \nright. They didn't have any deficit reduction. There is no deficit \nreduction in their plan. The deficit went up. They passed their plan \nand the deficit went up. In 2005, the deficit was $319 billion. They \npassed their deficit reduction plan without a single Democratic vote. \nIn fact, some on their side voted against it. And now the deficit is \ngoing to be $371 billion.\n  So the Senator is absolutely correct. We didn't vote for their so-\ncalled deficit reduction plan that didn't reduce the deficit; it \nincreased the deficit. And we are not going to vote for this plan that \nruns up the debt $600 billion a year each and every year for the next 5 \nyears, taking us to a debt of $11.8 trillion before the baby boomers \never retire. So that is the difference between the parties.\n\n  In terms of economic performance, I say to my colleague, he says that \nthe productivity numbers are a result of the Tax Code. I don't think \nso. I think the productivity numbers are the result of the hard work of \nthe American people, the ingenuity of the American people, not as a \nresult of the Tax Code. The productivity numbers were going up \ndramatically when we had the previous Tax Code. So the notion that the \nTax Code is the reason for the productivity gains is just imaginary.\n  If we want to talk about economic performance, in the Clinton \nadministration we got twice as much increase in real average hourly \nearnings. We got 50 percent more increase in real disposable personal \nincome. And we got 10 times as much job creation. That is with the \nprevious Tax Code.\n  So it is not the Tax Code that is producing those results. It is the \nhard work and ingenuity of the American people.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield. I say to my colleague, would \nthis be an appropriate time to go to Senator Wyden's amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand Senator Grassley wishes to \nrespond to Senator Wyden. That may be the appropriate time. Let Senator \nWyden make his presentation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate that. What Senator Snowe and I want to do is \nnot spend any taxpayers' money; we want to save some taxpayers' money. \nI appreciate that. I was here about 45 minutes ago thinking that was \nthe point where we would be in the queue. When Chairman Grassley gets \nhere, we would appreciate the chance to discuss our bipartisan \namendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, this would be the \nappropriate time for him to make his presentation, and we can go \nforward with the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3004\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, with the consent of both sides, I call up \namendment No. 3004, the Snowe-Wyden amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden], for Ms. Snowe, for \n     herself and Mr. Wyden, proposes an amendment numbered 3004.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that any savings associated with legislation that \n   authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to use the \n  collective purchasing power of 40,000,000 Medicare beneficiaries to \n  negotiate the best possible prices for prescription drugs provided \n through part D of title XVIII of the Social Security Act in fallback \nplans, by private drug plans (if asked) and in other circumstances, but \n not permitting a uniform formulary or price setting, is reserved for \n       deficit reduction or to improve the Medicare drug benefit)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. RESERVE FUND FOR THE NEGOTIATION OF THE BEST \n                   POSSIBLE PRICE FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THROUGH \n                   MEDICARE PART D.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the aggregates, allocations, functional totals, \n     and other appropriate levels and limits in this resolution \n     upon enactment of legislation that allows the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services to use the collective purchasing \n     power of 40,000,000 Medicare beneficiaries to negotiate the \n     best possible prices for prescription drugs provided through \n     part D of title XVIII of the Social Security Act in fallback \n     plans and, if asked, by private drug plans, and in other \n     circumstances, but not permitting price setting or a uniform \n     formulary, by the amount of savings in that legislation, to \n     ensure that those savings are reserved for deficit reduction \n     or to improve the Medicare part D drug benefit.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, we all have seen the frustrations and the \nheartache that senior citizens have experienced over these last few \nmonths as the prescription drug legislation has gone into effect. \nCertainly, some folks are being helped, and we are glad to see it. But \nin order to really make a prescription drug benefit work, we have to \ncontain the costs of medicine. That is\n\n[[Page S2166]]\n\nwhat Senator Snowe and I are trying to do. We are trying to do it by \nusing marketplace forces, not Government but marketplace forces to hold \ndown the cost of medicine.\n  A majority of the Senate is now on record as favoring this proposal. \nA majority of the Senate voted for it last fall before all the \nheadaches and the frustrations that seniors have experienced. So in my \nview, the case is a lot stronger today than it even was last fall when \na majority of the Senate voted for it.\n  I think that is the reason the American Association of Retired \nPersons has written to the Senate saying they are in support of the \nbipartisan Snowe-Wyden legislation. They have something they call their \nRx Watchdog group. It is an effort by AARP--a very laudable effort--to \nmonitor the cost of medicine. They report that the cost of medicine is \ngoing up twice the rate of inflation.\n  Of course, we know older people use more medicines than the rest of \nthe population. It would be one thing if people were trying to go about \ndoing this in an arbitrary kind of fashion, using a one-size-fits-all \nGovernment approach or price controls. That is not what the bipartisan \nSnowe-Wyden legislation does.\n  We want to be very clear, as we offer this legislation, that at line \n13 and line 14 of this amendment, there is a statutory prohibition on \nprice controls as an effort to hold down the cost of medicine.\n  Let me repeat that to the Senate. The bipartisan Snowe-Wyden \nlegislation at line 13 and line 14 includes a bipartisan statutory ban \non price setting as an effort to control the cost of medicine. This is \nabout using marketplace forces to hold down the cost of these drugs \nthat are clobbering our older people.\n  I don't see how anyone can oppose this amendment and, in fact, \nSecretary Tommy Thompson, the former Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, said in his last press conference that he just wished he had \nthis authority. He wished he had the kind of authority that is in this \namendment. It doesn't mean it is going to be used all the time, but it \nmeans it is a tool, an opportunity like we have every single day in the \nprivate sector of our economy to hold down the cost of medicine.\n  The way Medicare is going to go out and buy these prescription drugs \nreminds me of somebody going to COSTCO and buying one role of toilet \npaper at a time. Nobody would go shopping that way. Everybody who is in \na position to do so exercises their marketplace clout, the opportunity \nto be a savvy shopper, the opportunity to say I am going to purchase a \nlot of something. I want to get my money's worth.\n  I just hope the Senate this time, when we have seen all the \nfrustrations older people are having, uses this chance to do something \nabout it.\n  We know lots of lobbyists are against this amendment. Last week we \nhad a discussion on lobbying reform. I can tell colleagues in the \nSenate that probably the biggest trophy on a lobbyist's wall is to \ndefeat the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden amendment, but that doesn't make it \nright. What we need to do is what is right for older people and at a \ntime when millions of seniors are walking on an economic tightrope, \nbalancing their food costs against their fuel costs, and their fuel \ncosts against their medical bills, this is a chance to use marketplace \nforces to hold down the cost of medicine.\n  For older people, there are no costs going up like prescription \ndrugs. Some are saying: We can get these cost savings without the \nSnowe-Wyden amendment. A lot of those people are the same ones who said \nthat the rollout of the prescription drug program would go perfectly. \nWe say that certainly has not been the case.\n  Now there is a chance to go home at this break and say you actually \nmoved to do something important that older people are talking about at \ntheir kitchen table every single day, and that is the cost of medicine.\n  I don't know of any special interest group in this country that got \nthe kind of sweetheart arrangement in this legislation that the \npharmaceutical sector has. There is no other group in this country, no \nother group that got a specific carve-out so we couldn't use \nmarketplace forces to hold down the cost of medicine. It is really \nstaggering that one group was singled out to be immune from the forces \nof the marketplace.\n  Secretary Thompson thought it made no sense. It certainly makes no \nsense right now when older people are being clobbered by the cost of \nmedicine and finding it hard to secure the benefits of this program. In \nfact, my sense is one of the reasons a lot of older people have been \nreluctant to sign up is they can't see any cost savings in the program.\n  Here is a chance to generate some real cost savings. That is why AARP \nindicated its support for the amendment. That is why Secretary Thompson \nsaid he wished he had the authority. That is why every timber company, \nsteel company, and auto company in the country uses its marketplace \nclout to hold down the cost of medicine. Fifty-one Senators voted for \nit last fall before we saw all the older people have the problems they \nhave had over the last couple of months.\n  I hope colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, will support this \namendment. Senator Snowe and I have worked on this now for 3 years. We \nsaid we were going to work on it at the time the original legislation \nwas voted on. AARP, like Senator Snowe, like myself, like Chairman \nGrassley, for whom I have enormous respect--we are all in support of \nthe original legislation. I still have the welts on my back to show for \nmy support for the legislation. But as AARP says, don't miss the \nopportunity to improve on this legislation which we can do by using \nmarketplace forces.\n  I urge colleagues, particularly in light of some of what has been \nwritten, to take a look at line 13 and line 14 of the amendment which \nspecifically prohibits the use of price controls under this amendment \nas a tool to hold down the cost of medicine.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, here we are again. Today's discussion, \nas the famous words go, is deja vu all over again.\n  First of all, we heard the words ``sweetheart deal'' for drug \ncompanies. If drug companies had their way, they would want no \nformularies, which is what the Wyden amendment would require. These \ndrug companies would want all drugs covered regardless of cost. So \ndon't tell me this is a sweetheart deal. If we didn't have formularies \nlike we would have if the Wyden amendment is adopted, then all drugs \nwould be covered regardless of cost. Then they would not have to \ncompete. But this legislation requires competition building upon the \npractices that we have used for the Federal employee health plan for 40 \nyears. We patterned this legislation after that because that is what \nsaves money.\n  I am beginning to lose count of the number of times that this issue \nhas come before us. So I have to keep repeating--but it doesn't seem to \nsink in--that the Medicare Modernization Act does not prohibit \nnegotiations with drug companies. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. But hearing the last speech, one couldn't come to that \nconclusion. In fact, the law requires Medicare plans to negotiate with \ndrugmakers for better prices. These negotiations are at the heart of \nthe Medicare drug program.\n  It is an absurd claim that the Government will not be negotiating \nwith drugmakers comes from the noninterference clause in the Medicare \nlaw. The noninterference clause does not prohibit Medicare from \nnegotiating with drugmakers. What it does is it prohibits the Center \nfor Medicare Services from interfering with these negotiations.\n  To be clear, the noninterference clause is at the heart of the bill's \nstructure for delivering prescription drug coverage. This clause \nensures those savings will result from market competition rather than \nthrough Government price fixing. The average beneficiary premium is \n$25. That is $12 less than the $37 that was estimated less than 12 \nmonths ago, going back to July of last year. That clearly demonstrates \nthat the law's structure is accomplishing that objective and then some; \notherwise, we would have $37-a-month premiums or more instead of the \naverage $25 premiums that we have.\n\n  This year's cost to the Government then is $8 billion less than what \nwe thought it would be last July. The 10-\n\n[[Page S2167]]\n\nyear cost has dropped by $180 billion, as we tried to estimate ahead \nwhat programs might cost 10 years into the future.\n  The Center for Medicare Services and the Consumers Union have \nreported that beneficiaries are getting substantial savings under this \ndrug benefit. These plain and simple facts ought to take the wind out \nof the sails of the argument that private companies can't deliver an \naffordable benefit for our beneficiaries and even for the taxpayers. \nThese plans can deliver, and they are delivering. That is competition, \nnot something that they set out to do. That is the market forces \nbringing down prices.\n  Some might say: Well, if the plans can do that, imagine what the big \nbureaucracy of the Federal Government can do. To those folks, I urge a \nword of caution. First, the Government doesn't have such a great track \nrecord when it comes to price negotiation. When we considered the \nMedicare Modernization Act, the Center for Medicare Services' actuary \nreported that drugs in Part B:\n\n       Were reimbursed at rates that, in many instances, were \n     substantially greater than the prevailing price levels.\n\n  Even The Washington Post editorial of February 17, 2004, said:\n\n       Governments are notoriously bad at setting prices, and the \n     U.S. Government is notoriously bad at setting prices in the \n     medical realm.\n\n  My second point is beneficiaries don't have one-size-fits-all \nprescription drug needs. They need choices. Forty-four million \ndifferent Americans have 44 million different solutions--or you can't \nhave one plan fits all, I guess is what I should say. The companies \noffering the drug benefit must offer coverage for a wide array of brand \nand generic drugs. The companies also are offering plans with lower or \neven no deductible. Many are offering additional coverage so that there \nis no doughnut hole.\n  The bottom line is the approach taken in the Medicare Modernization \nAct has resulted in affordable choices for beneficiaries while saving \nthe taxpayers money.\n  When we crafted this act, the Congressional Budget Office concluded \nthat the market-based approach would result in better prescription drug \ncost management for Medicare than any other approach that was being \nconsidered at that time by the Congress. Here is what the Congressional \nBudget Office said about eliminating the noninterference clause in a \nletter last year:\n\n       The Secretary would not be able to negotiate prices that \n     further reduce Federal spending to a significant degree.\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office went on to say:\n\n       CBO estimates that substantial savings will be obtained by \n     the private plans.\n\n  That estimate is now a reality.\n  We also had an analysis from the chief actuary for the Medicare \nprogram.\n  The chief actuary for the Medicare program, who is required by law to \nprovide independent actuarial analysis on issues facing Medicare, \nconcluded that he does not:\n\n     believe that the current Administration or future ones would \n     be willing and able to impose price concessions that \n     significantly exceed those that can be achieved in a \n     competitive market.\n\n  In fact, more astonishingly, the chief actuary pointed out that if \nMedicare establishes drug price levels it will reduce competition not \nincrease it.\n  The report stated that the\n\n     establishment of drug price levels for Medicare by the \n     Federal government would eliminate the largest factor that \n     prescription drug plans could otherwise use to compete \n     against each other.\n\n  So let's be clear, direct Government negotiation is not the answer. \nThe Government does not negotiate drug prices. The Government sets \nprices and it does not do a very good job at it.\n  The law's entire approach is to get beneficiaries the best deal \nthrough vigorous market competition, not price controls.\n  The new Medicare drug benefit creates consumer choices among \ncompeting, at-risk private plans.\n  It is abundantly clear that Medicare plans have leveraged the buying \npower of millions of beneficiaries to lower drug prices.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose efforts to change the law and oppose \nefforts to get the Government involved in setting drug prices.\n  It is a prescription for higher costs and fewer choices for \nbeneficiaries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and then 3 minutes to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the \namendment that has been offered. I was thinking that people listening \nto this debate must surely think this is a foreign language: \nnoninterference clauses and doughnut holes, and so on and so forth. \nThis is very simple. Let me try and do it in English, if I can.\n  When Congress passed the prescription drug benefit to provide \nbenefits to senior citizens, a little clause was put in there. My \ncolleague calls it a sweetheart deal. It is even sweeter than that. A \nclause was put in that says: By the way, the Federal Government cannot \nnegotiate with the drug companies for lower prices. Cannot do it. The \nDefense Department does it. The VA does it. The evidence is that those \nnegotiations produce about 50 percent of the savings that is reducing \nthe drug prices by 50 percent, but the Medicare prescription drug plan \ncannot have that happen. The Government cannot negotiate for lower \nprices.\n  My colleague describes this as a noninterference clause. About the \ntime you think you get a handle on something here and have an \naggressive debate, they change the titles and change the subject. This \nis not about noninterference. There is no noninterference involved. The \nquestion is, Should the Federal Government be able to negotiate for \nlower prescription drug prices in this plan, as we do in the VA and as \nwe do in the Defense Department? The answer is yes.\n  My colleague talks about 10-year savings, 10 years out. Look, \neconomists who can't remember their home phone numbers are telling us \nwhat they think is going to happen in 10 years. I know what is going to \nhappen. We are going to break the back of this Government financially \nif we don't negotiate lower prices. This is similar to hooking a hose \nup to the tank and sucking the tank dry. Let the pharmaceutical \ncompanies decide to tell us what they are going to charge us and, by \nthe way, we can't negotiate better prices as we do in the VA system for \nveterans. That doesn't make any sense to me.\n  The toughest job in the Senate is to come to the floor and justify or \ndefend a proposal that we can't negotiate for lower prices. The second \ntoughest job is for those who vote against this amendment to go home \nand explain to their constituents how they defied common sense.\n  It makes common sense for us to say: Let's get the best price we can \nfrom these pharmaceutical companies. How do you do that? You do that by \nthe power of the purse, having the Federal Government negotiate for \nlower prices. We have done it in the VA, we have done it in the Defense \nDepartment. We saved 50 percent of the cost by doing it. My colleague \nis dead right. Yes, this is a sweetheart deal. This is not about \nnoninterference; it is about whether we can negotiate with the \npharmaceutical industry for lower prices. The answer ought to be, of \ncourse, we ought to do that. We ought to do it aggressively in order to \nsave the taxpayers money; otherwise, we are going to break the bank. I \nthought fiscal conservatism was about trying to save the taxpayers \nmoney.\n  This amendment will do more to save the taxpayers money in the next \n10 years than almost anything else we can do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, Senator Snowe will close this afternoon \nfor our bipartisan amendment, but I want to highlight a couple of \npoints. There is a reason that AARP strongly supports the Snowe-Wyden \namendment. There is a reason that Secretary Thompson, before he left \nthe Health and Human Services Department, said he wanted this \nauthority, and that is this is just plain common sense.\n  Everybody else in the marketplace who is in a position to use their \nclout does it but not Medicare.\n  I want to set the record straight on a couple of comments that were \nmade by my friend, the chairman of the Finance\n\n[[Page S2168]]\n\nCommittee. Again, at lines 13 and 14 of the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden \namendment, in addition to the prohibition against price controls, there \nis a prohibition against a uniform formulary. So we are using all of \nthe same forces in the marketplace of the private sector under this \namendment that go on all across the land today. There are no price \ncontrols. There is no uniform formulary. For colleagues who want to see \nthe language, it is at line 13 and line 14 of the Snowe-Wyden \namendment.\n  Let us have some practical, smart shopping with respect to this \nprogram, where the costs are going into the stratosphere. I don't know \nof anybody in the United States who would shop the way Medicare is \nshopping today for prescription drugs. It would be one thing if it was \nworking.\n  AARP supports this amendment because the cost of medicine is rising \ntwice the rate of inflation. So if you want to say to the seniors when \nyou go home next week that you took some practical steps to control the \ncosts of medicine, you will support the Snowe-Wyden amendment. If you \nthink everything is working fine right now--and we don't--then I guess \nyou oppose us. But I hope colleagues will, as they did last November, a \nmajority of them, support us because now they can make a difference. \nThey can make a difference for older people. They can make a difference \nfor taxpayers. I hope my colleagues, when Senator Snowe wraps up for \nour side this afternoon, will support this bipartisan amendment because \nit is just plain shopping smart at a crucial time when older people \nneed that approach to hold down the cost of health care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the Snowe-Wyden amendment purports to \ncreate a reserve fund within the budget that could be used to allow the \nFederal Government to improve its negotiating position with respect to \nlowering the price of prescription drugs. I will vote in favor of this \namendment because much more needs to be done to insure that Americans \nwill not be forced to give up their medications because of rising \nprices.\n  However, I know that a number of veterans in West Virginia are \nconcerned about what a Governmentwide prescription drug negotiation \nprogram would mean to the prices of medicines dispensed through \nhospitals in the Department of Veterans Affairs. There are concerns \nthat veterans would lose access to the medications they need at \nadvantageous prices.\n  It is important for West Virginians to understand that the Snowe-\nWyden amendment does not have the force of law, and, even if it should \nbe adopted today, the amendment would have no impact on the VA's \nability to negotiate favorable drug prices for our veterans. Additional \nlegislation would have to be passed by Congress and signed into law \nbefore any changes to the VA's prescription drug negotiating power \ncould be made. I will continue to keep the concerns of West Virginia's \nveterans in mind should the Senate take up a debate on legislation that \nrelates to the price of prescription drugs.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, today I rise to speak on the \namendment offered by Senator Snowe to S. Con. Res. 83. This amendment \naddresses the question of whether the Federal Government should play a \nrole in negotiating the prices of Medicare prescription drug plans. In \nthe past, I have supported similar measures that would allow the \nFederal Government to negotiate prescription drug plan prices, based on \nthe idea that there was a need to contain rising prescription drug \ncosts and that negotiation would have the effect of driving down costs.\n  However, we are now seeing dramatically lower costs than we had \nanticipated. Specifically, CMS recently announced that the average \npremium of a Medicare prescription drug plan is $25; this is thirty \ntwo-percent reduction from the premium estimates of 1 year ago. Also, \nCMS has reported almost doubling of discounts and rebates of drugs \nunder the Medicare prescription drug program from original projections. \nThese effects are a result of the fact that under the Medicare \nprescription drug program, similar to the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program, numerous plans are in competition to offer consumers \nthe lowest possible prices.\n  In view of this, today, I am voting not to support this amendment, \nand instead, am lending my support to offering America's seniors the \nlowest and most affordable prices on their prescription drugs. We now \nhave evidence that the lowest prices are offered through what makes \nthis nation's economy one of the most robust in the world--healthy \ncompetition.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I yield off of our time 2 minutes to the \nSenator from Iowa to respond.\n  Before I do that, however, I understand that there is an order in \nplace that the next amendment will be the Conrad amendment, followed by \nthe Byrd amendment. We would like to ask unanimous consent to reverse \nthat order, so that following the Snowe-Wyden amendment, we would move \nto the Byrd amendment next, rather than the Conrad amendment. So I ask \nunanimous consent for that change in the order of the amendment \nprocess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, two speakers ago, the Senate heard the \nSenator from North Dakota say that the drug bill says that the \nSecretary cannot negotiate. It doesn't say that anywhere in the law. It \ndoesn't say it anyplace. They made that up. I don't know what sort of \npolitical points they want to make, but keeping the speeches to what \nthe law says, and not what somebody thinks it says, seems to be very \nimportant to intellectually honest debate.\n  To the Senator from Oregon, drug companies want cash-paying customers \nwith no coverage because those people, as we all know, pay the highest \nprices. The drug companies don't have to negotiate with anyone when \nseniors don't have any drug coverage, such as they didn't have before \nthis law went into effect. Part D provides that drug coverage, and now \nthe drug companies have to compete to offer lower prices and to get \nplans to put their drugs on their preferred drug list. It is very \nnecessary. They would like to have the environment that you want: No \nformulary. Then they have everything the way they want it. That is how \nnegotiations work, to drive down prices, to get your plan approved, and \nthat is how competition works to reduce prices, and that is what we see \nafter 2\\1/2\\ months of the operation of this legislation. Don't give \nthe drug companies what they want: no formulary.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, at this point, the Byrd amendment is in \norder; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I want to thank Senator Byrd for \ngraciously coming to the floor as we sought to accommodate other \nSenators so they could make quorums in other committees. It was very \ngracious of him to come on short notice so that this time would not be \nlost.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3086\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague for his \nkind remarks. At this time, I offer an amendment cosponsored by myself \nand Senators Lautenberg, Clinton, Dorgan, Lieberman, Kerry, Biden, \nDurbin, Menendez, and Jeffords.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n     Kerry, Mr. Biden, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Menendez, and Mr. Jeffords, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3086.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To preserve a national intercity passenger rail system by \n providing adequate funding of $1.45 billion for Amtrak in Fiscal Year \n 2007 and to fully offset this additional funding by closing corporate \n                             tax loopholes)\n\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $550,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 1, increase the amount by $550,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by $550,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, increase the amount by $550,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 21, increase the amount by $550,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 22, increase the amount by $550,000,000.\n       On page 53, line 1, increase the amount by $550,000,000.\n       On page 53, line 2, increase the amount by $550,000,000.\n\n[[Page S2169]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, this amendment adds $550 million to the \nfiscal year 2007 budget for Amtrak. All aboard for Amtrak. Amtrak.\n  The Bush administration's budget for the coming year assumes that \nAmtrak will be handed a funding cut of almost $400 million--a whopping \ncut of more than 30 percent. As in past years, there is absolutely no \ninherent logic underlying this budget request. Every observer who has \ntestified before the Congress regarding Amtrak's financial needs has \nconcluded that dramatic cuts--dramatic cuts--of this kind would result \nin Amtrak being thrown into bankruptcy, endangering rail service in \nevery region of the Nation, including the Northeast corridor.\n  Amtrak is not just a high-speed train service for the residents of \nBoston, MA, New York City, and Washington, DC. Amtrak is also a network \nthat links cities such as Portland, ME, and Wells, ME, with that \nNortheast corridor. It also links communities such as Prince, in \nRaleigh County, WV, with cities such as Cincinnati, OH. It connects \nWhite Fish, MT, with St. Cloud, MN. It connects rural America with the \ncentral transportation and economic networks of our country.\n  This amendment would restore Amtrak's funding to the level of $1.45 \nbillion. This funding level stands some $150 million higher than the \ncurrent funding level. However, it also is $150 million below the level \nthat has been requested by Amtrak's board of directors. I should point \nout that every member of Amtrak's board of directors was appointed by \nPresident George Bush and this slate of Bush appointees is telling us \nthey need $1.6 billion to invest adequately in the railroad, guarantee \nquality service, and restore this increasingly aging infrastructure of \nthe Amtrak system.\n  This amendment would provide $1.45 billion. That is the precise \nfunding level that 97 Senators across the political spectrum, \nRepublican and Democrat alike, voted for when we passed the \nTransportation-Treasury Appropriations bill less than 5 months ago. I \nhope today, with the passage of this amendment, we can make the same \naffirmative bipartisan statement to our States and communities that \ntheir Amtrak service will be secure for yet another year.\n  Amtrak recently reported that it had achieved a record year for \nridership for the third year in a row. The number of citizens using the \nAmtrak network grew to 24.5 million last year. Amtrak is growing in \npopularity in all regions of the country. For example, on Amtrak's \nEmpire Builder--which serves Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North \nDakota, Montana, Idaho, and Washington--ridership has grown by more \nthan 14 percent over the last year. The Downeaster service in Maine \ngrew by 10 percent, while the Heartland Flier service between Oklahoma \nCity and Ft. Worth, TX, grew by a healthy 23 percent.\n  For those of my colleagues who like to complain that Amtrak is a \nbloated, excessively costly railroad, I point out that just as Amtrak \nhas achieved record ridership in each of the last 3 years, so has it \nreduced its employment levels over each of these years. Between 2001 \nand 2005, Amtrak has reduced its workforce by over 22 percent.\n  If the Senate adopts this amendment this afternoon, we can make an \naffirmative statement to these millions of Amtrak riders across the \nentire country that we will not allow them to be left standing at the \nplatform next year because of the White House's budgetary shenanigans.\n  I understand the junior Senator from Pennsylvania is expected to \noffer an amendment concerning Amtrak. The amendment by the Senator from \nPennsylvania would do nothing to help Amtrak or the millions of riders \nwho rely on Amtrak. The amendment purports to help Amtrak but it does \nno such thing. The amendment does not increase the allocation to the \nAppropriations Committee. Instead, the amendment pretends to pay for \nincreased Amtrak funding by cutting something called function 920 \nallowances. When it comes to the real work of passing appropriations \nbills, the Senate has to cut real programs. We cannot cut something \ncalled ``allowances.'' This amendment is a magic asterisk. It is not \nfiscal discipline.\n  My amendment is paid for by eliminating loopholes in the Tax Code, \nloophole closures that have been voted on by a majority in this body on \nseveral occasions. In reality, what the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania would be asking the Senate to do is pass an amendment that \nwill force cuts in critical programs. What programs would the Senator \nhave us cut? Funds for the troops? Funds for medical care for our \nveterans? Funds for educating our children? Would the Senator have the \nSenate cut border or port security? Would he have the Senate cut grants \nfor Low Income Home Energy Assistance?\n  The budget resolution that is before the Senate provides \ndiscretionary funding that is so limited for domestic programs that \ncuts in such critical programs are just not likely, they are \ninevitable. The amendment by the Senator from Pennsylvania would \nprecipitate even deeper cuts.\n  I urge Senators to vote for this amendment, the Byrd amendment, \ncosponsored by myself and the other Senators listed. I send the list to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I yield the time we have in opposition on this amendment \nto the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I don't think I am going to use more time than has been \nallotted on this amendment, but just in case, I hope the manager would \ngive me a minute or two off the bill.\n  Madam President, I wish to speak through the Chair to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia. I am going to speak not specifically against your \namendment, but you have identified closing corporate tax loopholes as \none way of raising revenue to offset yours. I am going to take \nadvantage of my time against your amendment to speak because Members on \nyour side of the aisle have used this approach in the past, and I want \nto say how there are some problems doing that.\n  Virtually all Democratic Members had a common theme in their \namendments--raising taxes for more spending. The purported offset for \neach of these amendments--several yesterday and more today--would close \ntax loopholes to pay for whatever popular spending program is proposed. \nThe Senate tax relief reconciliation bill that is now in conference \nbetween the House and Senate--and that is a reconciliation bill left \nover from last year's budget resolution, some of the unfinished \nbusiness of last year that we have to get worked out this spring--this \nconference's bills already include $20 to $30 billion of loophole \nclosers. Ironically, many of the proponents of these amendments that \nhave been offered on the other side of the aisle, using tax loophole \nclosers, were among the small minority of Members who opposed the tax \nrelief reconciliation bill that contained offsets. In some cases, the \nproponents have acknowledged that the Finance Committee, which I chair, \nhas already used these loophole closers. The Finance Committee will be \nresponsible, then, if these amendments are adopted, for creating new \nloophole closers.\n\n  That is not a problem. I don't consider that a problem because I am \nlooking to close abusive uses of the Tax Code. My Finance Committee \nstaff has proven itself quite effective in the past in identifying \noffsets. Just in the period of time since 2001, our committee has \nraised around $200 billion in new revenues by shutting down tax \nshelters, by closing inversions, and other abusive tax schemes.\n  In the year 2004 alone, the Finance Committee fully offset a $137 \nbillion tax bill at no expense to the American taxpayers. This was what \nwas known at that time as the FSC-ETI repeal bill. So I think the \nFinance Committee, since 2001--or using the year 2004 alone--has a \npretty good handle on what is possible in the ``raisers'' category. So, \nimplied, do the Democrats who are proposing closing tax loopholes know \nit is not necessarily an easy job, a job we have been working on, a job \nwe have been successful at, but the more of this you do, the less there \nis to take care of what they are trying to bring us to do, closing tax \nloopholes?\n  I might imply that maybe they are taking the easy way out because of \nusing the term ``loophole closers.'' That may not be such an easy way \nout for those of us who have to do it.\n\n[[Page S2170]]\n\n  This brings me then to the amendments that have been proposed. The \nsponsors say they have offset the costs of the amendments by closing \ntax loopholes. I wish to know what loopholes they have in mind. If we \nuse the inventory of Senate-acceptable offsets, we can raise about $11 \nbillion over 5 years. But that $11 billion, even if we accomplish it, \nis a far cry from the cumulative demands of the amendments that have \nalready been offered from the other side and probably will be offered \nyet today and tomorrow. We are probably going to have to find more \nrevenue raisers just to cover the items that Members say they support \nin the tax relief agenda that is out there that everybody wants me to \nget passed.\n  The Finance Committee staff hopes to use the full $30 billion that is \nalready in conference in the Senate tax relief reconciliation bill. \nSome have referred to the recent ``tax gap'' report of the Joint \nCommittee. But this is also going to be a heavy lift. When Members try \nto use some unidentified loophole closers--and these have all been \nunidentified--to pay for their amendments, what they are saying is that \nwe should use something out of the $30 billion that has been set by the \nFinance Committee staff that we are considering in conference committee \nright now. So, in fact, the proponents' amendment is going to displace \nsomething covered by the resolution. That point has to be made crystal \nclear, because this is the crux of the problem. If you use a loophole \ncloser that is already called for in the tax relief package that is in \nconference, it means that something in the tax cut package will have to \nbe taken out.\n  What do my colleagues, who are using loophole closers, suggest that \nwe take out that most of them think ought to be law because they voted \nfor it in the first place? The tax relief reconciliation bill covers a \nnumber of items that Members on the other side do support. For example, \nit covers, through the year 2010, provisions that they support such as \ntuition deduction, such as low-income savers credit, small business \nexpensing. These are sunsetted. They have to be reenacted to keep \nexisting tax policy. You have to have offsets for them.\n  Also covered are 1-year provisions that they say they support, such \nas business extenders like research and development. Several States \nhave sales taxes that will not be deductible anymore if we don't pass \nthis bill. The alternative minimum tax hold harmless----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Could I have 1 more minute?\n  Mr. CRAPO. I yield the Senator 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. There is the alternative minimum tax hold harmless, so \nthat 22 million more Americans do not get hit by the alternative \nminimum income tax. Middle-income people who were never intended to pay \nit will if we don't get this bill out of conference with these offsets \nin it. Everybody on the other side of the aisle doesn't want an \nalternative minimum tax to hit middle-income people, so they are going \nto take those revenue raisers, those tax loophole closers that we are \nusing for this to use for something such as Amtrak, now before us, as \nan example.\n  There are other provisions.\n  The reconciliation number covers these items. Yet this amendment \nwould tear away the revenue offsets needed to pay for these items.\n  You can't say you are for these items and not provide room for the \ntax cut that is in the reconciliation bill in conference. You can't use \nthe offsets for something else without providing for those items. You \ncan't have it both ways, in other words.\n  What is the loophole closer you would use, I ask them. There are none \nof them identified. Will it be taken from the $30 billion \nreconciliation already accounted for in that bill or is there a new \nissue we haven't seen? If you have a secret revenue loophole closer out \nthere, I want to know about it. A loophole closer actually has to raise \nmoney. Members need to know that some of the leftover items from last \nyear may not raise any money in the current year when they want to \nspend it. You can't rely on raisers that were done in the past.\n  We also need to remember that many of these leftover offsets were \nrejected by the House.\n  It is not enough to call for ``more loophole closers.'' The \namendment's sponsor needs to tell us where the money is coming from; \notherwise the call for offsets is just a call for ``funny money,'' in a \nsense.\n  Members need to know that the till is empty. A fictitious offset will \nnot suffice. We have a lot of heavy lifting to do under this resolution \nas written. If you want to add more weight to the problem, you need to \ntell us where the money is going to come from.\n  I ask you to vote against these amendments because they are not \nidentifying loophole closers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I rise to talk about the Amtrak issue. \nThis is a very important issue to me, to my State, to Philadelphia, and \nthe 30th Street station. It is the second busiest train station \nnationally, with over 3.7 million boarding a year. Amtrak and the \nhealth of Amtrak is important. In addition, we have about 3,000 \nemployees based in Pennsylvania who are employed by Amtrak. It not only \nmakes a difference for us from the standpoint of our communities in \nsoutheastern Pennsylvania but the employment picture as well.\n  The continued health of Amtrak is important. That is why over the \nyears you have supported efforts on the floor of the Senate to increase \nfunding for Amtrak. I voted for appropriations bills as well as budget \nproposals.\n  I rise in opposition to the Byrd amendment. The chairman of the \nFinance Committee articulated it well--that in essence what Senator \nByrd wants to do is increase taxes to pay for this amendment. I cannot \nsupport hurting the economy of this country by supporting something \nthat is important from an appropriations standpoint. I think we need to \nset priorities in appropriations. We have done that in the past.\n  Amtrak has fared very well here in the Senate, and we have had \nsupport in the House to be able to get funding for this program. In \nfact, over the years we have increased funding. Last year the Senate \nversion had $1.45 billion, which is obviously more than the $900 \nmillion in the current budget proposal. I will be offering an amendment \nto increase that funding from the $900 million which is in the bill \nright now to the $1.45 billion level and adding $550 million. I will do \nso through the section 920 account. I anticipate my colleague from \nNorth Dakota coming up and saying again that there is no money in the \n920 account. He is correct; there is not money there, but there will be \na very strong message sent by passing this amendment, if it is \nsuccessful, to the appropriators of the importance of this program.\n  Again, I think we have seen that without raising the cap or without \nraising taxes, the Senate has been able to come up with a robust number \nfor Amtrak which I will support within the context of a responsible \nbudget. We have done it year after year, and we will continue to do \nthat.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3015\n\n  I call up my amendment No. 3015.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum], for himself \n     and Mr. Specter, proposes an amendment numbered 3015.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide an additional $550,000,000 for Amtrak for fiscal \n                               year 2007)\n\n       On page 16, line 21, strike ``$78,268,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$78,818,000,000''.\n       On page 16, line 22, strike ``$75,774,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$76,324,000,000''.\n       On page 27, line 23, strike ``-$500,000,000'' and insert \n     ``-$1,050,000,000''.\n       On page 27, line 24, strike ``-$500,000,000'' and insert \n     ``-$1,050,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, Senator Specter is an original \ncosponsor of this amendment. Obviously there is no greater supporter of \nAmtrak out there than Senator Specter. We hope this amendment will be \npassed and the Byrd amendment will be defeated. But understand that the \ncommitment of\n\n[[Page S2171]]\n\nSenator Specter and my commitment is that we will work through the \nappropriations process to make sure Amtrak is adequately funded in the \nappropriations process.\n  I think I have said all I need to say on the Amtrak issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Vitter and Senator Talent as \ncosponsors to my amendment No. 3050, which is increasing funding for \nthe CDBG Program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, the Senator from Pennsylvania correctly \nanticipated my concern about his amendment, not the additional funding \nfor Amtrak. I completely agree with the Senator from Pennsylvania, and \nI agree with the Senator from West Virginia on the desirability of \nproviding that additional $550 million.\n  There are two very different ways to do it. One is the approach of \nSenator Byrd, which is to close additional tax loopholes. I commend the \nFinance Committee. They have done an exceptionally good job over the \nlast several years of working to shut down some of these very abusive \ntax loopholes. I salute the chairman of the Finance Committee for his \ninterest in doing that. I salute his very professional staff for the \nwork in that regard. We all know there is more to be done. I have \noffered just two that would easily cover this expenditure--in fact, \ncover it many times over.\n  One is what is going on in the Cayman Islands with this incredible \nscam of companies saying they are doing business there when they are \nnot. They are doing business there, or claiming they are doing \nbusiness, in order to escape income taxes in this country. Why are they \nin the Cayman Islands? Because the Cayman Islands is a well-known tax \nhaven. There are 12,700 companies headquartered in a five-story little \noffice building in the Cayman Islands. That is a scam. It ought to be \nshut down. It would save tens of billions of dollars if it were. That \nis what Senator Byrd says should be done to finance this additional \nmoney for Amtrak.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania says take money out of function 920. \nThe problem with that is there is no money in function 920. I refer my \ncolleagues to page 29 of the concurrent resolution on the budget. If \nyou go to page 29, what you see going down to function 920--it is \ncalled allowance--there is no money there. In fact, it is $500 million \nunder water before we ever started. We have had a whole series of \namendments offered on the other side today to take money out of that \naccount to pay for things. There is no money.\n  If we want to talk about ``funny money'' financing, as the chairman \nof the Finance Committee did, that is it. That is it--taking money from \nan account that has no money. That is the whole problem with this \nbudget. This whole budget takes money we don't have. The result is we \nkeep running up the debt.\n  I am told that Senator Lautenberg is on his way to the Chamber to \naddress this issue. I inquire how much time is left on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 4 minutes; the proponents \nhave 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Byrd-\nLautenberg amendment to provide additional funding for Amtrak, and I do \nso to protect the 25 million people who ride Amtrak each year, as well \nas the one hundred thousand New Jersey commuters who depend on Amtrak's \ninfrastructure every day.\n  The current level of funding in this budget for Amtrak does not \nrecognize the tremendous benefits generated by intercity rail in this \ncountry. Not the billions of dollars generated in commerce, nor the \nthousands of businesses along the Northeast Corridor whose employees \nare dependent on Amtrak, nor the national security value of having an \nadditional mode of transportation, nor the benefits to our environment \nby taking cars off the road.\n  Every year, we hear complaints that Amtrak has already received too \nmuch money from the Federal Government, but the fact is that we have \nspent less money on Amtrak in the last 35 years than we will on \nhighways in this year alone. And highways don't pay for themselves, \neven with the gas tax. Neither does mass transit, either in this \ncountry or anywhere else in the world. But we subsidize them because \nthey improve the quality of our lives. And that is what transportation \nis about. It is not just getting from one place to another. It is about \ncreating jobs, revitalizing neighborhoods, stimulating commerce, \nredeveloping underutilized land, and making us more secure.\n  We have never provided the kind of commitment to Amtrak that we have \nfor other modes of transportation, and this amendment will be an \nimportant step to getting Amtrak off the starvation budgets that it has \nsubsisted on for far too long. A vote for the Byrd-Lautenberg amendment \nis a vote for a strong Amtrak, and a stable national network of \nintercity rail, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Another issue that I would like to bring up regarding the Amtrak \nbudget is the misconception that New Jersey and other States along the \nNortheast Corridor are not paying their fair share. I believe that \nmisconception may have led to the insertion of a provision in the \nfiscal year 2006 transportation appropriations bill that directed the \nDepartment of Transportation to assess additional fees to commuter \nrailroads on the Northeast Corridor.\n  New Jersey currently pays over $100 million a year to Amtrak, and has \ninvested roughly $1.8 billion in the Northeast Corridor since 1991. New \nJersey Transit also maintains and operates the stations along the \ncorridor in New Jersey, all at no cost to Amtrak. It pays no operating \nsubsidy because the Northeast Corridor turns an operating profit. But \nthis new provision in the appropriations bill could cost New Jersey \ntens of millions of additional dollars, a cost which would eventually \nbe borne by New Jersey commuters.\n  As we continue this debate throughout the year, I hope that my \ncolleagues will recognize the investment that New Jersey already makes \nfor intercity passenger rail, and I look forward to working with them \nto come to a resolution that ensures equitability for all States.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, we have votes scheduled to start at 1 \no'clock. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, maybe the Senator from Idaho wishes to \ntake some of the remaining time, and perhaps we would have a chance to \nhear Senator Lautenberg before we vote.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I wish to take a couple of moments to do \na little housekeeping business and then we can be set up for the vote \nwhile we wait on Senator Lautenberg.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent on behalf of Senator Gregg, Senator \nConrad, and Senator Byrd to withdraw the Byrd amendment No. 3062, \nreserving the right of the Senator from West Virginia or his designee \nto offer an amendment in relation to amendment No. 3062 prior to final \naction on this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, secondly, I ask unanimous consent that at \n3 o'clock today the Senate proceed to the votes in relation to the \nfollowing amendments: Senator Stabenow, amendment No. 3056; Senator \nMcConnell, No. 3061; Senator Menendez, No. 3054; Senator Chambliss, No. \n3018; Senator Grassley, No. 3073; Senator Nelson, No. 3009; the Snowe-\nWyden amendment, No. 3004; the Byrd amendment, No. 3086; and Senator \nSantorum, No. 3015.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I have \nslightly different numbers on two of the amendments. Maybe we could get \nthat straightened out. I have Chambliss No. 3018.\n  Mr. CRAPO. That is the number I have.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Grassley is 3073?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Perhaps I heard that incorrectly.\n  There is no objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, the Senator from New Jersey is here.\n  How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes 15 seconds.\n\n[[Page S2172]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield that time to the very able Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I rise to talk about an amendment \nSenator Byrd and I are offering to adequately fund Amtrak. I understand \nthere is an alternative that has been offered by the Senator from \nPennsylvania which, very frankly, I think amounts to an empty gesture. \nIt is an amendment that looks as though it has funding for the \ncontinuation of Amtrak's operations but in fact it doesn't because it \ndoesn't have a source of funding that has any reliability to it.\n  The bottom line is if we want to fund Amtrak, if we want to keep it \ngoing, a vote has to be made for the Byrd-Lautenberg amendment.\n  President Bush proposed to initially bankrupt Amtrak in last year's \nbudget. The American people and the Democrats and Republicans in \nCongress stood up and said no. So this year, instead of trying to kill \nAmtrak outright, President Bush wants to put it on a starvation diet.\n  This is no time for us to be looking at trying to kill Amtrak because \nAmtrak in many cases is our only alternative to the crowded skies, to \nthe crowded highways, to be able to move people in the event of \nemergencies, and as a way to get to work and take care of people's \nneeds. Amtrak and transit in general offers one of the few options.\n  When we look back at what happened on 9/11, the only transit \ntransportation facility that was available on that terrible day was \nAmtrak. We never thought it could happen, but we shut down aviation \ncompletely. Here we are, and some of our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle think that eliminating Amtrak might be a good idea.\n  What was proposed by our colleague from Pennsylvania, the junior \nSenator, was that we find a funding source somewhere in magic land. The \nmoney is not there. It is something called 920, which is to hide behind \nthe facts and not tell the truth. But when I look at what is happening \nin the State of Pennsylvania in terms of Amtrak, I frankly cannot \nfigure out what the mission is here. Pennsylvania has over 4.9 million \nriders a year on Amtrak.\n  It is not just Philadelphia and New York; it is not just Philadelphia \nand Washington; it is places such as Harrisburg and other communities \nwithin the State of Pennsylvania that require service. Instead, what \nthey are getting here today is a sleight of hand, saying, Well, we want \nto put more money in Amtrak, more money than has been proposed in the \nbudget by some $500 million. The fact is there is no money there. There \nis a colloquialism that has developed in America which says ``show me \nthe money.'' There is no ``show'' and there is no ``dough.'' That is \nwhere we are.\n  Our amendment accounts for the funding necessary by taking it from \ncorporate loopholes and tax shelters.\n  I hope people here will understand how valuable Amtrak is to our \ncountry, how necessary it is, and vote for the Byrd-Lautenberg \namendment and not the alternative that has been proposed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3063\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). There is now 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided on the Murray amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Carper from \nDelaware as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senate is about to vote on the Murray \namendment which is the only amendment before this Senate that will \nrestore actual dollars to the $1 billion cut to the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant Program. We will see another amendment that is \npaid for by a 920 account that is now $10.5 billion in the hole--not \nreal money.\n  When our Committee on Appropriations gets that next fall, all of the \nSenators will be asking: Why are we cutting CDBG? We did not put real \nmoney in to restore that cut, unless we pass the Murray amendment that \nis paid for by closing tax loopholes.\n  Real dollars are the difference between this and next fall when our \nSenators are asking us about CDBG money and why it is being cut. We \nwill relate it directly back to this vote on this amendment.\n  Let everyone know where the real vote is. If no one believes me, read \nthe Wall Street Journal article, ``Republican Budget Plan Advances as \nChallenges By Democrats Fail,'' outlining that Republicans in tighter \nreelection races are offering amendments that are not paid for.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 15, 2006]\n\n    Republican Budget Plan Advances as Challenges by Democrats Fail\n\n                           (By David Rogers)\n\n       Washington--A Republican budget plan advanced in the \n     Senate, after Democrats narrowly failed to lift proposed \n     spending caps and impose tighter antideficit rules that would \n     make it harder to extend expiring tax cuts.\n       Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg (R., N.H.) \n     predicted passage of the resolution this week. But a \n     succession of 50-50 roll-call votes underscored the fragile \n     support for the plan, which projects higher deficits than the \n     White House's budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.\n       Adding to the tension is that senators must temporarily set \n     aside the resolution today to address a companion bill that \n     would raise the nation's debt ceiling by $781 billion. The \n     new $8.965 trillion ceiling represents an estimated 50% \n     increase since Mr. Bush took office, and Sen. Kent Conrad \n     (D., N.D.) complained that the nation's debt is rising like a \n     ``scalded cat.''\n       Meanwhile, top House Republicans reached agreement last \n     evening on a set of lobbying and ethics-rules changes in \n     response to recent scandals. Elements include a moratorium on \n     privately funded trips for the remainder of this Congress, a \n     ban on lobbyists accompanying lawmakers on corporate \n     aircraft, and improved audits of disclosure reports filed by \n     lobbyists.\n       ``I think we have a good package here,'' said House Rules \n     Committee Chairman David Dreier (R., Cal.). Majority Leader \n     John Boehner (R., Ohio) hopes to begin moving major pieces--\n     such as the travel moratorium--through the House early next \n     month.\n       In the budget debate, Republicans admit they are more \n     cautious this election year in trying to use the budget \n     process to effect change in spending or tax policy. Mr. Gregg \n     has largely abandoned any attempt to use his power to order \n     Senate committees to come up with savings to slow the growth \n     of government benefits like Medicare. And the five-year \n     savings from such programs in his resolution is a fraction of \n     the $39 billion deficit-reduction bill signed by the \n     president last month.\n       This leaves the proposed $872.5 billion cap on \n     discretionary appropriations as a last symbol of fiscal \n     discipline, and Republicans have clung to the provisions for \n     fear of opening the door to unchecked spending.\n       Mr. Gregg would transfer more money to health and education \n     programs to win support from moderate Republicans. But \n     domestic cuts would be required, and by the chairman's \n     account, his adjustments are largely ``illusory.''\n       Republicans in tight re-election races are offering \n     amendments endorsing more spending for causes such as \n     veterans health care and education for the disabled, but \n     these are for show since no money has been added above the \n     cap. For example, $3 billion was restored for defense by Sen. \n     James Talent (R., Mo.) who said the ``highly skilled people'' \n     in today's military result in higher personnel costs.\n       ``There's no such thing as a grunt anymore in America's \n     military.'' Mr. Talent said. The most serious challenge came \n     from Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) who proposed to raise \n     the cap by $6.3 billion to make room for education \n     priorities. But he failed 50-50 for lack of support from Sen. \n     Arlen Specter (R., Pa.), who is pursuing a less-direct \n     challenge to his leadership.\n       Mr. Specter is proposing that lawmakers get around the \n     $872.5 billion ceiling by allowing an extra $7 billion in \n     ``advanced appropriations,'' a category of spending often \n     used to fund education programs ahead of a school year. Mr. \n     Conrad appeared cool to this approach, but if Mr. Specter \n     could win over supporters of Mr. Kennedy's amendment, he \n     could prevail in a roll-call vote today.\n     * * * crucial to the nation's competitiveness. They are also \n     vital to U.S. defense industries, with many of the most-\n     advanced components and electronics made at newer facilities.\n       Economists point to growing import competition and an \n     exodus of U.S. production work to low-cost countries as \n     reasons for the birthrate slump. One indication is the \n     ballooning U.S. trade deficit, which hit another record in \n     January.\n       La-Z-Boy Inc., Monroe, Mich., a maker of recliners and \n     other furniture, felt the imports' bite in 2001, when \n     inexpensive wooden furniture from China began pouring into \n     the U.S. market. In response, the company closed 20 U.S. \n     factories and outsourced most of its own wood-furniture \n     production to China.\n       To be sure, some manufacturers are adding bricks and \n     mortar. Last year, computer maker Dell Inc. of Round Rock, \n     Texas, opened a $100 million assembly plant in North \n     Carolina, while Owens-Illinois Inc. of\n\n[[Page S2173]]\n\n     Toledo, Ohio, poured $120 million into a Colorado factory \n     that now churns out one billion beer bottles a year.\n       But most of this growth is concentrated in a relatively \n     narrow array of sectors, such as food, rail equipment and \n     building materials, according to Commerce Department data. \n     The cement industry, for instance, is planning to add 18 new \n     plants at a total cost of $3.6 billion over the next four \n     years.\n       One measure of new factory construction--investment in \n     industrial structures--rose last year to $18.7 billion, up \n     more than 15% from 2004. ``But this spending is still just a \n     shadow of what it used to be,'' says Tom Runiewicz, an \n     industrial economist at Global Insight, a Lexington, Mass., \n     economic consulting firm. In 1998, this type of investment \n     was about $43.7 billion, he said. It has become far more \n     common for companies to pour money into upgrading existing \n     plants to make them more productive. This helps explain how, \n     although U.S. industrial production has recovered, the urge \n     to build big new factories remains relatively weak, he says. \n     ``Our existing plants are just far more efficient.''\n       USG Corp., for instance, is rebuilding one plant in \n     Virginia and putting up a new one in Pennsylvania. The \n     Chicago maker of wallboard says the new plants will use \n     machinery that allows them to make wallboard far faster. \n     ``What we make is big, heavy, and relatively inexpensive,'' \n     says Robert Williams, a USG spokesman, ``so usually, you make \n     it close to where you want to sell it.'' Indeed, USG has 40 \n     plants scattered around the U.S. and has no plans to reduce \n     its manufacturing footprint.\n       One factor that gets lost is the size of individual plants. \n     Mr. Meckstroth believes many of the operations that are dying \n     off are smaller companies that have had trouble adapting to \n     the rise of import competition and other competitive forces. \n     ``But the bigger companies are surviving, because they have \n     the size and scale,'' he says. ``They can afford to put in \n     the new lines or move operations overseas themselves if \n     necessary.''\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this is a classic liberal amendment that \nincreases the size of Government, increases taxes on the American \npeople. A much more appropriate way to do this, if we believe CDBG is \nimportant, is vote for the Santorum amendment which makes that a \npriority but does so within the caps. So it has to compete with other \nprograms that we as a Congress can declare as a priority by using the \nSantorum amendment.\n  To follow the Murray proposal is to increase spending by $1.3 billion \nand increase taxes by $1.3 billion; grow the Government, grow the \ntaxpayer. For the American people, that is not the right way to do \nthis.\n  I yield back my remaining time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, the amendment that was just offered by \nSenator Murray was defeated. I hope my colleagues will support this \namendment which does not raise the cap but, in fact, expresses a strong \nsentiment, a strong bipartisan sentiment that the CDBG Program should \nbe funded more robustly. It is at $1.3 billion. It is offset by the 920 \naccount. But it does express a very important sentiment that this is a \nhigh-priority program and that the appropriators should allocate more \nresources than the President did in his budget recommendation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is unfortunate the Senate just \ndefeated the amendment that would actually add real money to CDBG and \nallow our communities across the Nation to invest in the critical \ninfrastructure to bring hope and opportunity back.\n  The amendment we are now going to vote on is a sham, and I refuse to \nbe part of a continuing sham that says to all of us that we are going \nto have CDBG money. Our recipients deserve a lot more. This amendment \nis for show, as I quote from the Wall Street Journal of today: `` . . . \nfor show since no money has been added above the cap''--leaving us, \nnext October, November, in the appropriations bill to either fund CDBG \nor cut transit and Amtrak, which I know is important to many Senators, \nand many other critical housing programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to say no and to put a stop to this continuing \nsham of amendments that do nothing for our communities that deserve a \nlot better.\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

The next amendment is the Stabenow amendment \nNo. 3056. There is 2 minutes of debate equally divided on the \namendment.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in \nbeginning to fix the issue of connecting our radios, radio \ninteroperability. Last December, the 9/11 Commission gave us failing \ngrades in this area, as well as other areas. Back in November of 2003, \nthe White House Office of Management and Budget said there were \ninsufficient funds to do what needs to be done in terms of \ncommunications interoperability. They said it would take at least $16 \nbillion to do this right.\n  My amendment would provide $5 billion to jump-start what is happening \nnow. Our esteemed chairman of the Budget Committee has spoken about the \nfact that there is $1 billion or $2 billion available now, but that \nsimply is not enough. That is not enough to do it as quickly as we need \nto do this.\n  Right now, homeland security grants also in this budget are being \ncut. We are seeing fewer police officers on the streets. We have not \ndone what we need to do regarding radios and communications, and this \nsimply is not good enough.\n  My amendment says we can do better, and it will provide a jump-start \nto do so.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to express my appreciation to the \nSenate for accepting the Kohl-Snowe- Stabenow-DeWine-Lieberman \namendment fully funding the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, MEP, \nfor fiscal year 2007 at $106 million. I am a longtime supporter of the \nMEP program and believe manufacturing is crucial to the U.S. economy. \nAmerican manufacturers are a cornerstone of the American economy and \nembody the best in American values. A healthy manufacturing sector is \nkey to better jobs, rising productivity, and higher standards of living \nin the United States.\n  Small and medium-sized manufacturers face unprecedented challenges in \ntoday's global economy. If it isn't China pirating our technologies and \npromising a low-wage workforce, it is soaring heath care and energy \ncosts that cut into profits. Manufacturers today are seeking ways to \nlevel the playing field.\n  One way to do that is through the MEP program. MEP offers resources \nsuch as organized workshops and consulting projects to manufacturers; \nthese allow the manufacturers to streamline operations, integrate new \ntechnologies, shorten production times and lower costs. In Wisconsin, \nthree of our largest corporations--John Deere, Harley-Davidson, and \nOshkosh Truck--are working with Wisconsin MEP centers to develop \ndomestic supply chains. I am proud to say that, thanks to MEP, these \ncompanies found it more profitable to work with small and medium sized \nWisconsin firms than to look overseas for cheap labor.\n  You would be hard pressed to find another program that has produced \nthe results that MEP has. In fiscal year 2004, MEP clients reported \n43,624 new or retained workers, sales of $4.532 billion, cost savings \nof $721 million, and plant and equipment investments of $941 million.\n  The Senate, in accepting this amendment, clearly recognizes the \nimportance of manufacturing and the role it plays in our everyday \nlives. Unfortunately, the same can not be said for the current \nadministration. The President's fiscal year 2007 budget request for MEP \nwas $46.3 million, a 56 percent decrease from the $106 million \nappropriated for fiscal year 2006. Once again, it will be up to my \ncolleagues and I in Congress to see to it that MEP is fully funded for \nfiscal year 2007. In an effort to invest in the future of \nmanufacturing, I worked with Senator Smith and Senator DeWine to \nintroduce the Manufacturing Technology Competitiveness Act of 2005 \nwhich would fund manufacturing related programs including MEP and the \nAdvanced Technology Program--for 3 years.\n  Manufacturing is an integral part of a web of inter-industry \nrelationships that create a stronger economy. Manufacturing sells goods \nto other sectors in the economy and, in turn, buys products and \nservices from them. Manufacturing spurs demand for everything from raw \nmaterials to intermediate components to software to financial, legal, \nhealth, accounting, transportation, and other services in the course of \ndoing business.\n  The future of manufacturing in the United States will be largely \ndetermined by how well small and medium-sized manufacturers cope with \nthe changes in today's global economy. To be successful, manufacturers \nneed state-of-the- art technologies to craft products more efficiently, \na skilled workforce to operate those technologies, and a commitment \nfrom the government to provide the resources to allow manufacturers to \nremain competitive.\n  At a time when economic recovery, supply chain reliability for \nconsumer and defense goods, and global competitiveness are national \npriorities, I believe MEP continues to be a wise investment. I want to \nthank the chairman and ranking member of the Budget Committee for \naccepting this amendment and recognizing the importance of the MEP \nprogram.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Stabenow amendment would pencil in $5 \nbillion for interoperable radio equipment into the budget resolution \nbut provides no money for the first responders. But when the junior \nSenator from Michigan has been given opportunity to vote for real money \nfor police and firefighters, she has repeatedly voted no. Not only has \nshe voted no, she actively worked to kill funding for the first \nresponders.\n  The Senate budget reconciliation bill last year included $1 billion \nin hard dollars for grants to States and local governments for new \ninteroperable radio equipment. Michigan would have received a portion \nof that money for its police and firefighters, but the Senator\n\n[[Page S2175]]\n\nfrom Michigan voted no. The conference report on the budget \nreconciliation measure dedicated $1 billion for spectrum auction \nproceeds for interoperable equipment for first responders. Again, the \nSenator from Michigan voted no.\n  Fortunately, she lost that vote. The bill with $1 billion was signed \ninto law, and money is now being made available for important grants.\n  When the Defense appropriations conference report was considered last \nDecember, I added another $1 billion for interoperable communications \nequipment. That was long after Hurricane Katrina had revealed to all of \nus the importance of communications equipment in a disaster. The \nmeasure included another $1 billion for grants to high-risk cities, \nsuch as Detroit. The Senator from Michigan helped filibuster that bill, \nand then she supported efforts to strip money out of the measure and \nled the charge against those funds and was successful in deleting the \nmoney. You can't have it both ways. I oppose the Stabenow amendment.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays and also \nsimply indicate it is unfortunate to hear that kind of personal \ninaccurate attack.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask you notify me at 30 seconds, so \nI can turn the microphone over to Senator McConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, since 9/11, Congress and the \nadministration have done so much to secure our homeland, but the area \nthat we still must work on is port security. We have vulnerabilities \nbecause we don't have enough coverage overseas with customs and border \nagents. They need to be able to inspect the containers that will come \nto America. Our officers working with the host governments need to \ncertify the contents of these containers at the point of origin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. This will reduce our reliance on the foreign \ngovernments' information that we may or may not be able to verify.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have had a lot of talk about the \nsecurity of our ports over the last few weeks, a lot of talk about \nwhere the containers originate, what boats are to get here, and who \nmanages the ports but very little talk about who unloads the cargo. \nWhat this amendment would also do is provide for background checks on \npeople working in our ports who are unloading the cargo. It makes no \nsense to ignore the personnel and the quality of personnel in our ports \nin the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time? The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a minute in \nopposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I am pleased my Republican colleagues have joined my \ncall to strengthen security at our ports by offering this amendment to \nincrease port security funding by $978 million. Last week our \ncolleagues voted down in the Budget Committee, on party lines, my \namendment to increase port security funding by $965 million. So I am \nglad our colleagues are about to vote for port security funding right \nafter they voted against it last week.\n  We know our ports are one of the weakest links in our Nation's \nhomeland security system, and it is crucial that this Nation act to \nmake them more secure before a terrorist attack, not after.\n  I applaud the increased funding for the Coast Guard in this \namendment. I would like this body to continue to work on how we \nallocate the money this amendment provides, so we can increase the \nnumber of containers that are actually scanned or inspected before they \nenter the country. I hope we will have the opportunity to do so in \nconference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.

Mr. President, will the Chair advise us as to how much \ntime that vote took?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. We are going to be here a long time if we keep doing 10-\nminute votes for 16 minutes. I have spoken with Senator Conrad. It is \nmy sense that we should start cutting these votes off. We have a whole \nseries of votes. The next one will take 10 minutes. We are going to \nstart to enforce that timeframe.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, perhaps I can help put this in \nperspective. We have 110 amendments pending, with more amendments \ncoming in every hour. We have just been called and asked to draft six \nmore amendments in the last hour.\n  I hope people understand where this is headed. If we are going to \nhave 16-minute votes and we are going to vote on another 110 \namendments, we are going to be here until noon on Saturday. That is \nwhere this is all headed.\n  If we don't start getting cooperation from Members here to not offer \namendments which they could offer somewhere else, and if we don't get \nsome cooperation from Members on having votes that really last 10 \nminutes, I assure you we are going to be here all day Friday--first of \nall, late tomorrow night, we are going to be here all day Friday, we \nare going to be here late Friday night, and we are going to be here at \nnoon on Saturday. Colleagues can choose. It is out of our control. We \ndon't control this. Colleagues can decide whether we are going to have \nsome reasonable outcome here or whether we will be here until Saturday \nnoon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3054\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes equally divided prior to \nthe vote on the Menendez amendment.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nKohl, Biden, Sarbanes, and Mikulski as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate just voted \nto concur with me that we need to spend about $1 billion on port \nsecurity. The difference between this amendment which we just passed \nand the amendment we are about to vote on is that this is real money \nthat we paid for, and we direct the money in a more comprehensive way \nto fund security operations at our ports.\n  This amendment puts us on the road to 100 percent scanning of \ncontainers entering into this country by increasing the number of \ninspectors abroad and funding the latest technology in our own ports.\n  I strongly believe we need to strengthen security. This will put us \non the road to increasing scanning, inspections, funding for port \nsecurity grants, and creating real security here at home.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Menendez amendment \nthat increases funding for port security by $965 million. The amendment \nis fully offset by closing $965 million in corporate tax loopholes and \nwould reduce the debt by an additional $965 million.\n  What the recent Dubai Ports World deal certainly has revealed is the \nimportance of port security and our apparent vulnerability. Each year, \n10 million cargo containers enter our ports, and we inspect roughly 6 \npercent of them. That means only about 600,000 are seen by our security \nofficials, while the other 9.4 million are being handled exclusively by \nthe shippers, port operators, and others. When we consider the fact \nthat just one of the six ports whose operations would have taken over \nby DP World is equipped with a working radiation-detection system, we \ncan begin to appreciate how crucial it is to address this issue.\n  In 2003, Admiral Collins of the U.S. Coast Guard testified that it \nwill cost $7 billion over the next 10 years to fully secure our ports. \nWe have not even come close to funding port security at that pace. \nThough $7 billion may seem a daunting figure, suffering a catastrophic \nterrorist attack at one of our major ports would cost exponentially \nmore. A recent war game conducted by Federal security agencies imagined \nall 360 major ports shut down for 9 days--which would not be an \ninconceivable step to take following a major terrorist attack upon a \nU.S. port. Such a shutdown would cost our country $58 billion and that \ndoesn't even consider the direct physical costs of the attack itself. \nCompared to this grim scenario, investing $7 billion now to secure our \nports is wise.\n  The Menendez amendment moves us closer towards achieving the goal of \n100-percent scanning of all cargo containers which pass through our \nports. With $600 million dedicated to the port security grant program \nadministered by the Department of Homeland Security, $100 million for \nnew inspectors and security personnel, $100 million for research and \ndevelopment to create better scanning technology, $105 million for \nbetter radiation detection equipment, $10 million for deploying better \nscanning technology abroad, and $50 million to assist developing \ncountries with cargo scanning, we will significantly improve port \nsecurity.\n  We can prevent a terrorist attack on our ports, but it will take \nFederal resources and determination to do so. We all hope we are not \nleft in the wake of a terrorist attack that could have been prevented \nhad we only made the necessary investments to better fund port \nsecurity. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support the Menendez \namendment which will reinvigorate and finance our commitment to secure \nour ports.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senators \nMenendez and Lautenberg's amendment to increase funding for port \nsecurity. As the cochairman of the Commerce Committee and a Senator \nrepresenting an island State, I place a particularly high priority on \nport security, and I know first hand that it is not receiving the \nresources that are necessary. Budgets are a reflection of priorities, \nand our budget must place far greater emphasis on this critical \ncomponent of our national and economic security.\n  I feel compelled to remind this body that, since 2002, it has been \ngiven a litany of opportunities to bolster port security resources, and \nit has routinely rejected them.\n  As we consider this year's budget, I would like to recall the \ndiscussion we had around this time in 2003. During the budget debate, \nthis body unanimously supported an amendment to provide $2 billion to \nport security. Yet 3 weeks later, when the Senate considered the \nsupplemental appropriations legislation to address funding for the war \nin Iraq and homeland security, the Senate rejected the amendment that \nwould have provided immediately the actual money for port security \nfunding.\n\n[[Page S2177]]\n\nIt was a lesson in cynicism that I have not forgotten.\n  Given the recent attention to the Nation's lingering, significant \nport security inadequacies, it is my hope that the Senate will have the \nwisdom to choose a different course this time around.\n  If there is one silver lining to the Dubai Ports World debacle, it is \nthat the country is now paying close attention to port and cargo \nsecurity. The heartland is learning what the coasts have known for many \nyears: our national economy and physical security depend on strong port \nsecurity. They are now familiar with the statistic that 95 percent of \nthe Nation's cargo comes through the ports, and that very little of \nthat cargo is inspected. The American public now knows that more needs \nto be done.\n  Maritime commerce is essential to the American economy. Many of our \nNation's manufacturers and retailers depend on on-time delivery, and \nany disruption to the flow of commerce could have disastrous \nconsequences for American businesses and the economy as a whole.\n  Despite this fact, the administration still fails to make port \nsecurity a top priority. It has consistently submitted inadequate \nfunding requests and has routinely missed critical security deadlines \nthat were required by law. In fact, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, DHS, only recently submitted its National Maritime \nTransportation Security Plan. The report was due in April 2005.\n  Given the administration's poor record on port security and its poor \njudgment on the Dubai Ports World deal, I am left wondering what it \nwill take for this administration to take port security seriously.\n  It was Congress that put a halt to the Dubai Ports World takeover, \nand it will have to be Congress that provides the port security funding \nthat the administration's budget lacks. The amendment put forward by \nSenators Menendez and Lautenberg calls for a funding level that is a \nfar better reflection of port security's importance to the country. \nWhile it will not solve all of the current inadequacies, it will bring \nus far closer to what will be required.\n  Several other Members will be introducing amendments that enhance \nresources for transportation security, and while I would prefer \nspecific offsets, I applaud their focus on port security and strongly \nsupport them. Our committee has held numerous oversight hearings in the \narea of transportation security, and we recognize that much more needs \nto be done. The latest Department of Homeland Security inspector \ngeneral's report indicated that the DHS has made considerable \nimprovements in the administration of the port security grant program. \nIt is beginning to deliver the funding the way Congress intended, \nconsistent with the Maritime Transportation Security Act, MTSA. Now, we \nmust dedicate more substantial resources to this effort.\n  While increased funding is a critical step, we must not lose sight of \nthe long-term security improvements that will be necessary for port \nsecurity. In November, the Senate Commerce Committee unanimously \napproved the Transportation Security Improvement Act, S. 1052, which \naddresses a litany of security shortcomings across all modes of \ntransportation. Specifically, title V of our bill tackles port and \ncargo security inadequacies. It improves the examination of cargo \nbefore it reaches our shores, ensures the resumption of commerce in the \nevent of an attack, and takes greater advantage of coordinated, \ninteragency port security efforts.\n  Of course, I would like to see passage of our full bill, but at a \nminimum, I urge the Senate to take up title V of our bill and pass it \nas soon as possible. Our approach has broad bipartisan support, and it \nwill improve security while maintaining the jurisdiction and \ntransportation expertise of the Commerce Committee. The time is right \nto pass these needed security improvements, and I am hopeful that the \nSenate will take up our measure as soon as possible.\n  In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to support this important and \ntimely amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I hope our colleagues will not vote \nfor the amendment.\n  The Senate just voted overwhelmingly to put almost $1 billion into \nport security. That is the right thing to do, but the right way to pay \nfor it is out of the 920 account. To make this a priority, let us do it \nright. The Menendez amendment would increase taxes to pay for port \nsecurity. We do not need to do that. What we should do is the right \nthing--provide more inspectors and make sure our ports are secure, and \ndo it the right way with real money that is already there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The question is on agreeing to \nthe amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, this amendment is what Senators \nhave been hearing from their senior citizens. They want to extend the \ndeadline. My amendment would put it in law that the deadline is \nextended. Why be for a program instead of being for the people? They \nare confused. They need more time. They are bewildered and, in some \ncases, knowing that that 1 percent-a-month penalty is hanging over \ntheir heads, they are frightened. They are also frightened if they \nchoose the wrong program, then find out they can't get the prescription \ndrugs they need for their quality of life. I urge Members to vote for \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Nelson amendment is the wrong idea at the wrong \ntime. The amendment doesn't even provide the resources for enrolling \npeople afterwards. We did in the amendment just adopted. How are we \ngoing to get people to enroll if the administration doesn't have the \nresources to do it? It is too early to make a decision, when we don't \nhave final enrollment numbers yet. Right now enrollment is going very \nwell. A quarter of a million people sign up every week. Many who are \ncalling for delay in the enrollment deadline didn't support the \nlegislation 2 or 3 years ago. They have admitted that. They have been \nencouraging citizens not to enroll. Extending the deadline until the \nend of the year is a cynical attempt to tell seniors not to enroll this \nyear. The other side says May 15 is an arbitrary deadline. Americans \nlive with deadlines every day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3009.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.

The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I simply note that the way this is working, \nthese are 10-minute votes. We have been reasonably generous by letting \nthem go to 12 minutes, but we are not letting them go past 12 minutes. \nI believe I speak for Senator Conrad. We are going to insist on getting \nthese votes done. We are on to the next amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3004\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will now consider the Snowe-Wyden \namendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the amendment which Senator Wyden and I are \noffering will address the high cost\n\n[[Page S2179]]\n\nof our Medicare prescription drug benefit. It does this not by price \nsetting or mandating a drug formulary, but by providing our drug plans \nwith the resource of the HHS Secretary. Since Medicare is paying 75 \npercent of a beneficiary's drug costs from $250 up to $2,250 in \nspending, and the cost of this benefit over the next ten years is \nestimated to exceed $700 billion, it is simply common sense that the \nSecretary should be able to assist when the plans need help.\n  Our amendment states two circumstances in which the Secretary must \nparticipate in drug price negotiation. If the Secretary needs to \nprovide a drug plan due to lack of competition, he must negotiate \ncompetitive prices for his own ``fallback'' plan. And just as \nreasonable, if a drug plan requests his assistance in negotiations, \nthen he should be responsive to that need.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has told us that when a drug lacks \ncompetition, a manufacturer may not negotiate in good faith. So when a \nplan calls for help in this circumstance, the Secretary shouldn't be \nforced to be unresponsive. As CBO has described, the savings could be \nsubstantial. For example, if 29 million beneficiaries enroll in Part D, \nand 1 in 4 used a single source ``blockbuster'' drug such as a lipid-\nlowering drug costing $250 per month, the annual cost for that single \nproduct would exceed $21 billion. If the Secretary could help plans \nraise the discount on such a drug by just 10 percent, the annual \nsavings would amount to $2.18 billion. This illustrates how in this \nspecial situation, the role of the Secretary could be vital.\n  Let me be clear--this amendment does not allow price-setting. The \nlanguage is clear: ``the Secretary may not require a particular \nformulary or institute a price structure for the reimbursement of Part \nD drugs.''\n  The AMA, the AARP, and many other are advocating for this authority, \nbecause they want to protect our seniors access to drugs as much as we \ndo. I urge my colleagues to join us in assuring we keep our promise to \nour seniors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, one of the things on this issue that is \nso misleading is the impression that this legislation does not allow \nMedicare to negotiate. The opposite is true.\n  This legislation requires negotiation. That is what the plans are \ndoing all the time to drive down the price of drugs--what it does to \ndrive down the price of the premium way below what we thought it would \nbe. Again, everything is backward when they talk about this. In the \nreal world, there are choices. Wherever you want to go for any consumer \nproducts, those stores negotiate prices to get good prices. It is just \na way to get the job done. Statistics that have come in on this show \nthat competition is driving down the price of drugs--the 25 leading \ndrugs--by 35 percent on average this ought to show that this process is \nworking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Schumer be added as a cosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, once again the White House has proposed a \nlevel of funding for Amtrak that will result in bankruptcy for the \ncompany, endangering rail service in every region of the Nation.\n  Two amendments have been offered to increase Amtrak's funding to a \nlevel of $1.45 billion. My amendment, which is fully paid for, would \nprovide the additional funds necessary for the Appropriations Committee \nto approve $1.45 billion for Amtrak.\n  The amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania \npretends to pay for the increase by cutting something called function \n920 allowances. It assumes deeper cuts for education, for low-income \nhome energy assistance, for border and port security, and for our \ntroops.\n  I urge Members to show support--real support--for Amtrak by voting \nfor my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who seeks time? The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I must rise in opposition to this amendment \nas it would exceed the caps and would end up raising taxes. We are \ngoing to have an amendment that follows this amendment which makes a \ncommitment to Amtrak, which does it under the caps, therefore, sets the \npriorities correctly, and that is the proper way to do this.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment does what the Byrd \namendment does, except it doesn't raises taxes. It offsets the money \nfrom the 920 account. I would encourage Members to let their voices be \nheard in support of Amtrak funding to make sure that the Appropriations \nCommittee understands that this is a continuing priority for the United \nStates, and I ask for a ``yea'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who rises in opposition?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are talking about a proposal that \nhas no funding for it. You reach into the 920 barrel and there is \nnothing there, you can't come up with any money. But in the process, \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania did acknowledge that the President's \nbudget is way off line because now we are talking about $1.5 billion; \nwhereas, otherwise, it is $500 million less. So while this bill is \nimperfect we do want to see Amtrak supported, and I hope that we will \nbe able to resolve it in the appropriations process to get it to where \nit needs to be. But this amendment is not going to do it. It is half a \nloaf and, at this point, we have little choice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, that \nwas the last rollcall vote for today. We will begin voting tomorrow \nmorning, most probably on the two avian flu amendments which we were \ndiscussing during the vote, at approximately 10:30.\n  The managers are here, and we will continue to discuss it in terms of \nthe timing and the exact schedule for tomorrow.\n  There are no more rollcall votes tonight, and we will begin voting \naround 10:30 tomorrow.\n  The more formal vote-arama, which unfortunately has become \ninstitutionalized, would be tomorrow afternoon. We will have more \nannouncements about that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I hope colleagues understand that for this \nbudget cycle we have lost time to a number of extraneous events which \ncould not be helped. But it means we have less time than we have had in \nprevious years.\n  I hope my colleagues understand that we have put the debt limit \ndiscussion in the middle of this.\n  We have had a number of other events, such as the joint session.\n  As a result, we have less time for amendments.\n  I beg the indulgence of colleagues in understanding that now the only \nway we can finish is if we have very tight time agreements tomorrow, \nand if we exercise discipline among ourselves in terms of the number of \namendments that we offer. That is the only conceivable way we can \nfinish by tomorrow night.\n  I urge colleagues to think very carefully about amendments which they \nmight want to offer.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, would the Senator agree with me that it \nis very fitting that the debt limit discussion should be inserted right \nin the middle of discussion of the budget resolution since this budget \nresolution will add very substantially to the deficit and drive the \ndebt up even further, requiring this vote that is going to come to \nraise the debt ceiling? What is the amount by which the debt ceiling \nwill be raised?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The debt limit request will be to raise the debt by \nnearly $800 billion--$781 billion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It underscores the deeper hole that these budgets are \ndriving us to over the last 5 years, does it not?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator makes a very good point. It is an indication \nthat we keep adding debt on top of debt. Of course, this budget will \nadd $3 trillion to the debt--more than $3 trillion over the next 5 \nyears.\n  I think it is further confirmation that we are off track in terms of \nthe fiscal policy of this country, and not a little off track--way off \ntrack.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Senators be added as cosponsors to amendment No. 3018: \nSenators Grassley, DeWine, Burns, Coburn, and Vitter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment was offered on behalf of the \nSenator from Nevada and the Senator from New York, Senator Clinton.\n  One of the most heated debates of recent years has been on the issue \nof abortion. People on both sides of the issue feel very strongly. They \nhave argued, they have demonstrated, and they have protested with \nemotion and passion.\n  The approval last week of a South Dakota law banning virtually all \nabortions has only intensified the already strong feelings on both \nsides of this issue.\n  The issue is not going to go away very soon. And I doubt that one \nside will be able to suddenly convince the other to drop its deeply \nheld beliefs.\n  But there is a need--and an opportunity--for us to find common \nground.\n  Today, I am joining with Senator Clinton to propose an amendment that \noffers not only common ground but common sense.\n  Whether you are pro-life or pro-choice, Democrat or Republican, our \namendment advances two key goals which we should all share:\n  No. 1, reducing the number of unintended pregnancies and the \nresulting abortions,\n  No. 2, helping women have healthy pregnancies and healthy children.\n  Our amendment will make sure that there is money available in the \nbudget to enact policy to support these important goals.\n  I repeat--reducing the number of unintended pregnancies and resulting \nabortions and helping women have healthy pregnancies and healthy \nchildren.\n  Specifically, our amendment would allow us to increase funding for \nthe National Family Planning Program, title X. It would pass the Equity \nin Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act so that we may \nend insurance discrimination against women.\n  I might add that the distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, has \nworked on this for many years.\n  Our amendment would improve awareness and understanding of emergency \ncontraception, and our amendment would improve teen pregnancy \nprevention programs.\n  This amendment would also restore cuts and provide funding for \ncrucial programs that support pregnant women and their children.\n  The United States has among the highest rates of unintended \npregnancies of all industrialized nations. Half of all pregnancies in \nthe United States are unintended.\n  And about half of those pregnancies end in abortions.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. Most of these unintended \npregnancies--and the resulting abortions--can be prevented.\n  One of the most important steps we can take to prevent unintended \npregnancies is ensuring that American women have access to affordable, \neffective contraception.\n  Our amendment helps make family planning service more accessible to \nlow-income women. It improves awareness and understanding of emergency \ncontraception, a poorly understood yet highly effective form of \ncontraception. It promotes teen pregnancy prevention programs, and it \nwould end insurance discrimination against women.\n  These are just some of the simple but necessary steps we can and \nshould take to prevent unintended pregnancies and reduce abortions.\n  It is difficult for me to understand why many of the same people who \nsupport an outright ban on abortion also oppose making contraception \nmore accessible--particularly for low-income women who are more likely \nto have unplanned pregnancies. For example, a recent analysis by the \nnon-partisan Guttmacher Institute revealed that South Dakota is one of \nthe most difficult states for low income women to obtain \ncontraceptives.\n  Reducing the number of unintended pregnancies--and the resulting \nabortions--should be a goal we can all share.\n  In addition to supporting programs that will reduce the number of \nunintended pregnancies, our amendment will restore cuts and provide \nmuch needed funds for programs that provide critical support for \npregnant women and their children.\n  Our amendment says that while we should do everything we can do to \nprevent unintended pregnancies in the first place, we should also fund \nprograms that support women who choose to carry their pregnancies to \nterm and raise healthy children.\n  This includes funding for programs that: provide health care for \npregnant women and their children, reduce infant mortality, provide \nchild care assistance for low-income families, and provide nutritional \nassistance for pregnant women and children.\n  Our amendment gives Americans on both sides of the abortion debate \nthe opportunity to join in the common goals of preventing unintended \npregnancies, reducing abortions and supporting pregnant women and their \nchildren.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree to this amendment. It is important. \nIt is important for America, and it is important for the women in \nAmerica.\n  I want to make sure that the Senator from New York has ample time. \nHow much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my statement be \non leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader, the \nSenator from Nevada, for his leadership on this issue. We have come \ntogether to present this Prevention First amendment because we believe \ndeeply that we can do better than we are doing in our country when it \ncomes to preventing unintended pregnancy and helping to support mothers \nand children.\n  The United States has one of the highest rates of unintended \npregnancies in the industrialized world. Half of all pregnancies in our \ncountry are unintended. Nearly half of those end in abortion. In order \nto decrease the number of unintended pregnancies, and to decrease the \nnumber of abortions, we must make contraception\n\n[[Page S2182]]\n\nmore accessible and more affordable. The Prevention First amendment \nensures that we dedicate adequate funding for these programs, while at \nthe same time the amendment provides for dedicating funding to mothers \nand children so children will be as healthy as possible.\n  This amendment sends a clear message: Women who need access to \ncontraception to prevent unintended pregnancies will have that help. At \nthe same time, women who are pregnant and want to have a healthy child \nwill also have the support they need. Our amendment provides $100 \nmillion to programs that reduce unintended pregnancy and $247 million \nto programs that support and protect women and babies.\n  The $100 million prevention program does four basic things. First, it \nincreases the funds for title X, the Nation's only program solely \ndedicated to family planning. Title X provides high quality preventive \nhealth care and contraception to low-income individuals who may \notherwise lack access to supplement care. Every year, title X services \nprevent approximately 1 million unintended pregnancies. But despite its \nproven success, this administration has continuously cut its funding.\n  Second, this amendment ends the current practice where some insurance \ncompanies refuse to provide coverage for contraception even though they \ncover other prescription drugs. Lack of coverage for contraception \nresults in women of reproductive age paying 68 percent more in out-of-\npocket costs for health care services than men of the same age. Our \namendment remedies this disparity by requiring private health care \nplans that cover prescription drugs to also cover FDA-approved \nprescription contraceptions and related medical services. In our own \nState of New York, contraceptive equity is already the law and it \nshould provide a real role model for the Nation. If insurance companies \ncan cover drugs such as Viagra, they can certainly cover prescription \ncontraception.\n  Third, this amendment improves public awareness of emergency \ncontraception. Emergency contraception, also known as Plan B, is one of \nthe most misunderstood drugs around. Some have tried to deliberately \nmislead its purpose. Emergency contraception prevents pregnancy. It \ndoes not interrupt or end a pregnancy. The most recent research \nestimates that emergency contraception could have prevented 51,000 \nabortions per year. Further, a study from the Journal of the American \nMedical Association confirms that easier access to emergency \ncontraception does not increase sexual risk taking or greater \ntransmission of sexually transmitted diseases.\n  Fourth, our amendment provides funding for programs dedicated to \ndecreasing the teen pregnancy rate. To date, 34 percent of young women \nbecome pregnant at least once before they reach the age of 20. That \nresults in 820,000 teen pregnancies a year. Eight in 10, or 80 percent, \nof those pregnancies are unintended.\n  This amendment funds proven programs that will help reduce the rate \nof teen pregnancy by improving decisionmaking, improving access to \neducation and information.\n  In addition to strengthening pregnancy prevention programs, our \namendment also increases support for low-income mothers trying to raise \nhealthy children. Our message in this amendment to the women of this \ncountry is clear: We will support you in your effort to prevent \nunintended pregnancy and we will support you in your decision to have a \nchild.\n  Our amendment provides funding for programs such as the childcare and \ndevelopment block grant that help families afford safe quality day \ncare; programs such as the maternal and child health block grant that \nensure women have healthy pregnancies. Healthy Start and WIC Programs \nfocus on providing nutrition for pregnant women and their infants.\n  I hope we could unite behind a common goal of preventing unintended \npregnancies, reducing abortions, and supporting women and children's \nhealth. We hope our colleagues and the White House will work with us to \nput prevention first. A vote in support of this amendment is a vote to \nsupport healthy families.\n  I urge our colleagues to pass the Clinton-Reid amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in a debate earlier today, the senior \nSenator from North Dakota responded to my challenge to point out a new \ncorporate loophole closer that is not included in the tax relief \nreconciliation conference.\n  The ranking Democratic member of the Budget Committee discussed a \nproposal developed by the Finance Committee Democratic staff that would \nrepeal ``deferral'' for controlled foreign corporations doing business \nin tax haven countries.\n  I share the senior Senator from North Dakota's concerns about the \nability of large corporations to manipulate the Tax Code to shift large \namounts of profits offshore. But this provision isn't the right way to \naddress those concerns. It is both overbroad and inadequate.\n  It is overbroad because it would harm the competitiveness of U.S. \nmultinationals by repealing deferral for holding company structures \nthat allow them to efficiently allocate active foreign-generated \nresources among their foreign operations without incurring U.S. tax on \nentirely foreign transactions.\n  It is inadequate because it applies only to subsidiaries in black-\nlisted countries. Companies that use tax havens for abusive purposes \ncould easily avoid this rule by locating in a low-tax country that is \nnot on the list, like Ireland, where we have read press reports that \ncompanies are shifting huge profits. Treasury would have authority to \nadd countries to the list, but does anyone think Ireland, with whom we \nhave a tax treaty, would be added to a black list?\n  The way to deal with those cases is through effective transfer \npricing policy and enforcement, not by curtailing deferral.\n  This proposal was included in the Democratic alternative to the \nFinance Committee bipartisan tax relief plan. When we considered the \nHouse tax relief reconciliation bill, the Democratic alternative was \ndefeated.\n  Even if the tax haven proposal were viable in the Senate, it would \nyield only a fraction of the revenue needed to offset the cumulative \neffect of the many Democratic amendments to increase spending.\n  The effect of using such proposals, which aren't viable in the \nSenate, even if successful, would be to drive down the tax relief \nnumber.\n  The result of a lower net tax relief number is that we would lack the \nnecessary tax relief in the budget to accommodate tax relief proposals \nsupported on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, yesterday I offered an amendment to the \nbudget resolution with the Senator from Maine and the Senator from New \nJersey that would have increased funding for several education and \ntraining programs and raised the maximum Pell grant to $4,500. \nRegrettably, by a vote of 50-to-50, the amendment was not adopted. More \nthan 100 educational organizations supported the Kennedy-Collins-\nMenendez amendment, and yesterday, I submitted to the Record several of \nthe support letters we received from these organizations.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record additional \nletters from the American Association of Community Colleges, the \nNational Council for Community and Education Partnerships, the National \nAssociation for College Admission Counseling, the National Association \nof State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium, and the \nNational Education Association.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 2006.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: As a follow-up to our letter this \n     morning urging support for the critical Specter-Harkin \n     amendment to the budget resolution, we would also like to \n     encourage your support for the Kennedy-Collins-Menendez \n     amendment, which would add $6.3 billion targeted to higher \n     education programs.\n       Improving access to postsecondary education is essential to \n     ensuring a well-educated workforce that is competitive for \n     the 21st century. Unfortunately, too many lower-income \n     families are finding higher education out of reach as costs \n     become prohibitive.\n\n[[Page S2183]]\n\n       The Kennedy-Collins-Menendez amendment will help open the \n     doors of opportunity for students, workers, and families, \n     including by securing resources for an increase in the \n     maximum Pell Grant award and restoration of programs slated \n     for elimination in the proposed budget such as Career and \n     Technical Education, TRIO, and GEAR-UP.\n       The Specter-Harkin amendment will provide the foundation \n     for restoring education funds cut in the past two years. The \n     Kennedy-Collins-Menendez amendment builds on this foundation \n     by targeting additional resources to expand postsecondary \n     opportunities. We urge your support for both of these \n     important amendments.\n           Sincerely,\n     Diane Shust,\n       Director of Government Relations.\n     Randall Moody,\n       Manager of Federal Policy and Politics.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    National Council for Community\n\n\n                                   and Education Partnerships,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2006.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Robert Menendez,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy and Menendez: On behalf of the \n     National Council for Community and Education Partnerships \n     (NCCEP), a national nonprofit organization dedicated to \n     increasing higher education opportunities for low-income \n     students, our corporate and foundation partners, and the \n     millions of students and families we serve, I write to \n     enthusiastically support the Menendez-Kennedy Amendment.\n       One principal program we work with is the Gaining Early \n     Awareness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP), which is \n     currently providing 1.5 million low-income students in 47 \n     states. GEAR UP helps provide students with the tools \n     necessary to set high academic aspirations, capitalize on \n     higher education options, and become better academically \n     prepared for the rigors of higher education.\n       While we are sympathetic to the fiscal challenges that \n     accompany the upcoming FY 2007 appropriations cycle, our \n     long-term economic vitality as a nation will depend on our \n     ability to produce an increasing number of college graduates \n     to remain competitive in business, science, technology and \n     other fields that demand a high quality education. In the \n     global marketplace, it is clear that if left unabated, the \n     educational disparities between high-income and low-income \n     families will have negative consequences that will resonate \n     throughout the American economy for decades to come.\n       These challenges can be overcome if we continue to focus on \n     increasing higher education opportunities for underserved \n     students. One study suggests that if we can raise minority \n     student participation in higher education to equal that of \n     non-minority students, over $300 billion would be added in \n     gross national product and tax revenues alone. The continued \n     federal investment in GEAR UP can and will go a long way to \n     ensuring the fiscal and social health of our nation, our \n     communities, and our families.\n       While the recent focus on strengthening America's \n     competitiveness is welcome in the national dialogue, our \n     colleagues and constituents believe very strongly that \n     funding new initiatives at the expense of proven programs \n     such as GEAR UP, is at best counterproductive, and at worst, \n     a broken commitment to low-income students and families \n     nationwide.\n       Through the creation of GEAR UP partnerships between \n     families, community-based organizations, businesses, schools, \n     and institutions of higher education, we are able to have a \n     far greater impact than working in isolation. By working \n     together towards common goals, we are ensuring that students \n     stay in school, raise their academic and career aspirations, \n     succeed in challenging courses, and receive quality \n     counseling as they prepare for higher education. Researchers \n     at the Pennsylvania State University as well as the national \n     program evaluation (administered by the U.S. Department of \n     Education) have concluded that GEAR UP students are making \n     significant academic gains in reading and math, two critical \n     components for college success. In addition, GEAR UP students \n     and families report that their academic ambitions and \n     awareness of higher education options have improved \n     significantly as a result of the program. All of this comes \n     at a small investment of less than $300 per student annually. \n     Simply stated, GEAR UP is a cost-effective solution to \n     raising the academic skills and aspirations of an entire \n     generation of students that may otherwise be left behind.\n       The Menendez-Kennedy Amendment recognizes that as a nation \n     we have made a compact with our students that should not be \n     broken. We promised students and families that if they set \n     high educational goals, worked hard, and persevered through a \n     challenging course of study, that our nation would provide \n     them with the basic resources necessary to assist them along \n     the pathway to a college degree. With the proposed cuts to \n     GEAR UP and other critical programs that empower students and \n     families to succeed, we will break this promise, risk turning \n     our back on our students, and place the dream of a college \n     degree out of the reach of low-income and working families.\n       Speaking for the students and families we serve, I thank \n     you for the extraordinary leadership you have demonstrated \n     through the Menendez-Kennedy Amendment. If I can be of any \n     assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Hector Garza,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          National Association for\n\n\n                                 College Admission Counseling,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 14, 2006.\n     Senator,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of more than 20,000 high school \n     counselors and college admission officers that are members of \n     the National Association for College Admission Counseling and \n     its state/regional affiliates, I write to urge your support \n     for two amendments that will save college access programs \n     targeted for elimination in the fiscal 2007 budget proposal \n     as drafted by the Senate Budget Committee and proposed by the \n     Administration.\n       Specifically we ask you to support the Harkin-Specter \n     amendment, which would restore cuts to education programs by \n     increasing funding for functions 500, 550, and 600 by $7 \n     billion.\n       In addition, we ask you to support the Kennedy-Collins-\n     Menendez amendment, which would increase the Pell grant \n     maximum award to $4,500. The Pell grant has been far outpaced \n     by inflation, diminishing the purchasing power of Pell and \n     leaving hundreds of thousands of students without sufficient \n     financial resources to attend college.\n       We believe that the United States needs an investment in \n     education and college access now. Your support of these two \n     amendments is crucial to the education of our nation's youth.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Joyce Smith,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 14, 2006.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     Member, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the National Association \n     of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium, \n     we support the $6.3 billion amendment being offered by \n     Senators Kennedy, Menendez and Collins to restore funding to \n     student aid programs, career technical education, and job \n     training programs, as well as to increase the Pell Grant to \n     $4,500.\n       Specifically, NASDCTEc strongly supports the restoration of \n     funding for the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical \n     Education Act. The Perkins funds are essential in providing \n     Americans the opportunity to gain the academic and technical \n     skills necessary to succeed in the workplace and \n     postsecondary education. This funding will ensure that we \n     have a highly skilled and educated workforce, ready to meet \n     the demands of an everchanging global economy.\n       A cut or elimination to the Perkins program would force \n     schools, training programs, and community colleges to \n     eliminate critical programs that are working well in \n     communities throughout the country. Supporting the Kennedy/\n     Menendez/Collins amendment will make certain that students \n     are provided with rigorous and relevant academics as well as \n     ensure the efforts to build a skilled and competitive \n     American workforce are achieved.\n       Thank you for your time, and I hope that you will consider \n     supporting this amendment. We believe this amendment will \n     help open doors of opportunity for students, workers and \n     families. If NASDCTEc can be of any assistance to you during \n     the appropriations debate, please do not hesitate to contact \n     Nichole Jackson, Director of Government Relations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Kimberly A.

Robert Menendez,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Menendez and Kennedy: On behalf of the \n     American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) and the \n     1,158 community colleges it represents, I would like to \n     express our strong support for your student aid and job \n     training amendment to the FY 2007 Budget Resolution. This \n     amendment increases the federal investment in programs that \n     enable millions of Americans to pursue postsecondary \n     education and training.\n       As a strong proponent of federal student aid, AACC supports \n     a $450 increase in the maximum Pell Grant. The centerpiece of \n     federal student aid, the Pell Grant program is essential to \n     providing access to higher education for low-income students. \n     The program currently serves more than five million students \n     annually, the vast majority of whom come from families with \n     incomes below $20,000 per year. Pell Grants enable \n     approximately two million community college students to \n     enroll each year by helping with tuition, books and \n     equipment, and living expenses. However, the power of the \n     Pell Grant\n\n[[Page S2184]]\n\n     is declining, since the maximum award has remained frozen \n     while student expenses have risen. A $450 increase in the \n     maximum Pell Grant would provide significant help to needy \n     college students.\n       An increased federal investment in programs such as TRIO \n     and GEAR UP that help prepare low-income, first-generation \n     students for college is critical. Without additional \n     resources thousands of middle school and high school students \n     from disadvantaged backgrounds may never realize their \n     postsecondary dreams. And with America's increasingly diverse \n     population, this could have serious consequences for our \n     economic future.\n       We also applaud your continued support for vocational \n     education programs under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and \n     Technical Education Act. The Perkins Basic State Grant is \n     essential for community college innovation in occupational \n     education curricula. Funds support a wide range of \n     activities, including integrating vocational and academic \n     instruction; helping students meet challenging academic and \n     vocational standards; training first responders; developing \n     cutting edge curricula; and strengthening links between \n     institutions and businesses.\n       Thank you for offering this critical amendment. We look \n     forward to working with you as the FY 2007 budget process \n     continues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  George R. Boggs,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of amendment No. \n3048 proposed by Senators Specter and Harkin to restore funding for the \nLabor, Health and Human Services and Education appropriations bill to \nfiscal year 2005 levels.\n  This amendment would restore funding to many important programs, \nincluding one that is quite important to Arkansas as well as our \nNation--the Geriatric Health Professions program. Title VII funding for \ngeriatrics training is the only Federal program that specifically \ndevelops academic geriatricians at a time when more are needed. The \nfiscal year 2006 Labor-HHS bill eliminated several programs, including \nthis program.\n  Geriatric health professions programs support geriatric education \ncenters, faculty fellowships, and Academic Career Awards. The academic \ncareer award programs support the career development of geriatricians \nin junior faculty positions who are committed to teaching geriatrics in \nmedical schools across the country. Geriatric Training programs train \nhealth professionals who plan to teach geriatric medicine, geriatric \ndentistry, or geriatric behavioral or mental health. Geriatric \nEducation Centers train health professionals, faculty, students, and \npractitioners in diagnosis, treatment, disease prevention, disability, \nand other health problems of the aged.\n  In 2005, Geriatric Education Centers alone reported delivery of low-\ncost professional geriatric training interventions to over 50,000 \nhealth care providers who collectively reported over 8.6 million \npatient encounters and enhanced quality of care provided to older \nadults.\n  Since 2000, the Arkansas Geriatric Education Center has trained and \neducated 10,340 health professionals, most of whom practice in rural \nareas, and has awarded over 54,000 hours of continuing education. The \ncenter had been funded through a grant from the Bureau of Health \nProfessions, Health Resources and Services Administration.\n  Yet at the end of 2005 all funding for title VII geriatric health \nprofessions programs was eliminated from the 2006 Federal budget. The \nelimination of this program runs counter to recommendations from the \n1,200 delegates to the 2005 White House Conference on Aging where \nenhancing the geriatric workforce ranked as 2 of the top 10 list of \nrecommendations. Furthermore, it ignores the well documented shortage \nof geriatricians and specialized care needs of the older portion of the \nbaby boomer population. Congress must renew its commitment to geriatric \nhealth professions training if the nation is to avert a crisis in \naccess to geriatric care for older Americans.\n  The elimination of title VII funding for geriatric health professions \ntraining programs is a grave threat to the health of geriatric \nmedicine. As the number of new physicians going into geriatrics \ndeclines and those already in the field approach retirement age, \nincentives rather than cuts are needed in programs that enhance the \ntraining of health professionals in geriatrics. Eliminating these funds \nwill result in decreased access for the growing number of older \npatients in our country in need of the specialized care provided by \ngeriatric healthcare professionals.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment which would \nrestore funding to the geriatric health professions program, among \nother programs critical to the health of our Nation.\n\n\n                            Vote Explanation\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, during consideration of the Menendez \namendment, No. 3054, I was unavoidably detained in a meeting off the \nSenate floor and missed the vote. As a cosponsor of the amendment to \nprovide funding for port security, I would have voted ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask consent at 1:30 p.m. on Thursday, March 16, 2006, \nall time under the act expire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n           INCREASING THE STATUTORY LIMIT ON THE PUBLIC DEBT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Committee on \nFinance be discharged from further consideration of H.J. Res. 47, the \ndebt limit extension; provided further that the Senate immediately \nproceed to its consideration with 1 hour of general debate under the \ncontrol of the chairman or his designee; 2 hours of general debate \nunder the control of the ranking member or his designee; and the only \namendment in order be the following: Baucus, study on foreign \ninvestment, 20 minutes equally divided.\n  I further ask consent that following the use or yielding back of time \non the bill and amendment, the resolution be set aside; provided \nfurther on Thursday, prior to the first votes on the budget, the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relation to the Baucus amendment, and following \nthe disposition of the amendment, the joint resolution be read the \nthird time and the Senate proceed to the vote on passage of the joint \nresolution, with no intervening action or debate.\n  I also ask all time consumed during this bill count against the time \nlimit under the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee is discharged from further consideration of H.J. Res. \n47, which the clerk will now report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 47) increasing the statutory \n     limit on the public debt.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent the Senate resume consideration of \nthe budget resolution at 9 a.m. tomorrow; provided further that the \ntime from 9:30 to 10:30 be equally divided between the chairman and the \nranking member; I further ask at 10:30 a.m. the Senate proceed to the \nvotes in relationship to the following items: the Baucus amendment to \nthe debt limit, the passage of the debt limit, the Conrad avian flu \namendment, the Burr avian flu amendment.\n  I further ask consent that following these votes the Senate resume \ndebate on the budget resolution until 1:30, with the time equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. The understanding here is that working with Senator \nConrad, we are going to line up a series of amendments which will be \nbrought forward. We hope the Members will work with us. The time will \nbe limited on these amendments for debate, but we will certainly try to \naccommodate the membership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it is important for colleagues to know \nwhat we are doing. We are going to go to vote-arama starting at 1:30 \ntomorrow afternoon. Prior to that time, we are going to have some time \nfor additional amendments until the votes at 10:30. As the chairman has \nindicated, at 10:30 we will have votes on the debt limit. We will then \nhave votes on the avian flu amendments that were put off from this \nevening. After those votes are concluded, we will go back to amendments \nuntil 1:30.\n  Now, what does that mean? That means we have very restricted time \ntomorrow morning. We have very restricted time after the votes \ntomorrow, until 1:30 for additional amendments. The only way people are \ngoing to get time is if they take very short time agreements. That is \nthe only alternative we have.\n  Again, I explain to my colleagues, I apologize, but the fact is, our \ntime for\n\n[[Page S2185]]\n\nbudget discussion has been dramatically reduced this year because of \nextraneous events. It is just a fact. The debt limit was put into this, \nthe joint session, these series of meetings that are important \nbipartisan meetings at the White House. The chairman would agree that \nwe have had probably the most difficult time managing this budget \nbecause there is so much less time available this year.\n  I ask for colleagues to understand if they want time they are going \nto have to take very short time agreements tomorrow; otherwise, they \nwill be in a vote-arama.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for the great cooperation so many have \nshown throughout the day.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we are now on the subject of raising the debt limit of \nour country by $781 billion. This is after we have already had, during \nthis administration, repeated increases in the debt limit over and over \nand over again--during the first 5 years of this administration, \nraising the debt limit $3 trillion.\n  I have used this slide to make the point that I believe the debt is \nthe threat. So much of the writing and so much of the commentary is \nabout the deficit. But the deficit is going up much more slowly--even \nthough it is at record levels--than the debt.\n  This year, they estimate the deficit will be $371 billion, but the \ndebt will increase by $654 billion. When are we going to get serious \nabout what is happening to our country? We are plunging deeper and \ndeeper into debt, and increasingly, it is financed by foreigners.\n  I have to say, I have never been more concerned about the future \nfiscal strength of our Nation than I am today because we just seem to \nbe in total denial. We seem to be so disconnected from reality. We keep \non spending. We keep on cutting taxes. We keep running up the debt.\n  When the President came into office, here is what he told us. He \nsaid:\n\n       My budget pays down a record amount of national debt.\n\n  He said:\n\n       We will pay off $2 trillion of debt over the next decade. \n     That will be the largest debt reduction of any country, ever.\n\n  Then he went on to say something that I believe:\n\n       Future generations shouldn't be forced to pay back money \n     that we have borrowed. We owe this kind of responsibility to \n     our children and [our] grandchildren.\n\n  That is what the President said. He was going to have maximum paydown \nof the debt.\n  Well, that is not what happened. The President was wrong. Not only \nhas there not been any paydown of debt, the debt has skyrocketed, as \nthis chart shows.\n  The debt, at the end of the first year of this President's first \nterm, was $5.8 trillion. The debt, at the end of this year, is going to \nbe $8.6 trillion--$8.6 trillion--at the end of this fiscal year. If we \nadopt the budget that is before us, we will pile on another more than \n$3 trillion of debt over the next 5 years, winding up with a debt of \n$11.8 trillion.\n  Now, here is what has happened already during this administration.\n  From 1998 to 2001, we added no debt. In fact, we were paying down \ndebt. Those were the ending years of the Clinton administration's time.\n  In 2002, under the President's policies, we added $450 billion to the \ndebt limit. In 2003, we added $984 billion to the debt limit. In 2004, \nwe added $800 billion to the debt limit. In 2006, now they are out here \nwanting to add another almost $800 billion to the debt limit.\n  These are not just numbers on a page. These are not just bars on a \ngraph. These are not just charts. These are debts of our country that \nhave to be paid back.\n  What is perhaps most stunning is the degree to which this debt is \nbeing increasingly financed by foreigners--foreign central banks, \nforeign investors.\n  I use this chart to make the point. It shows the pictures of 42 \nPresidents. These 42 Presidents took 224 years to run up $1 trillion of \nexternal debt--U.S. debt held by foreigners. This President has more \nthan doubled that amount--much more than doubled that amount--in just 5 \nyears.\n  The result of all this is we now owe Japan $668 billion. We owe China \n$260 billion. We owe the United Kingdom over $240 billion. We owe the \nCaribbean banking centers almost $100 billion. These numbers change \nfrom time to time because of money flows. South Korea, we owe over $60 \nbillion.\n  So what. What does it matter that foreigners now hold almost half of \nU.S. debt? What difference does it make if we owe Japan $670 or $680 \nbillion? So what.\n  Well, the ``so what'' is, when you owe somebody money, you have a \ndifferent relationship to them than when they owe you money. We have \ngone from being the biggest creditor nation in the world--more \ncountries owing us more money than any other country in the world--to \nnow being the biggest debtor nation. We owe more money than any other \ncountry in the world, and by a big amount.\n  I just had representatives of the American automobile industry come \nto see me. They said: We have to get tough on Japan because they are \nmanipulating their currency for advantage in selling their automobiles.\n  I said: Do you have any idea how much money we owe the Japanese?\n  They said: No. We have no idea.\n  I said: Well, we owe them over $660 billion.\n  How are we going to get tough with somebody we owe $660 billion?\n  Earlier I had a group of business leaders come to me and tell me: We \nhave to get tough with China because they are manipulating their \ncurrency for advantage in international markets. I asked them: How much \ndo you think we owe the Chinese? They did not know. I told them we owe \nthem over $250 billion.\n  How are we going to get tough with China when we owe them all this \nmoney? What would we do if all of a sudden they did not show up to buy \nour debt because now every time we have an auction, most of it is going \nto foreign entities. That is how we are floating this boat. We are \nmortgaging the future. That is what we are doing. Does that make \nAmerica stronger or does that make America weaker?\n  A number of weeks ago, the President had a small group of us over--\nSenators--to talk about energy. He reminded us that in his State of the \nUnion Address he said America is addicted to oil. And he turned to me \nand said: That's pretty good for a guy from oil country to say that, \ndon't you think?\n  And I said: Yes, I do, Mr. President. But I tell you, not only are we \naddicted to oil, we are also addicted to foreign capital. We are \naddicted to borrowing from countries all over the world.\n  This creates a vulnerability for our Nation because if these folks \ndecide they are not going to keep lending us money, what would we have \nto do to attract the capital to finance these massive deficits, this \nmassive debt? We would have to raise interest rates. That is what we \nwould have to do, and perhaps precipitously. Then all these mortgages \nthat are out here that are interest-only mortgages, all these mortgages \nthat are adjustable rate mortgages, all these car loans, all these \nstudent loans, all these business loans, all these corporate \nfinancings--all of it--would go up, and go up sharply.\n  That is the great risk that is being run. It is a danger to our \ncountry. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board has said this is an \nunsustainable course. The Comptroller General of the United States has \ntold us it is an unsustainable course. The head of the Congressional \nBudget Office has told us it is an unsustainable course. But we keep \nright on keeping on. There is no change. And sometimes you wonder: Does \nanybody care? Does anybody have the faintest notion of where this all \nheads?\n  Before us is a budget for the next 5 years, put before us by the \nPresident of the United States, and now passed by the Budget Committee \nin the Senate. Those who brought the budget before us say it is going \nto reduce the deficit. They show these red bars on this chart, and they \nsay those red bars are getting smaller, the deficit is going down. Boy,\n\n[[Page S2186]]\n\nhow I wish that were true. How I wish that were true. But it is not \ntrue.\n  This is what is really happening. They have left out things. They \nhave left out war costs past 2007. They have understated the war cost \nin 2007 in addition to that. But the chairman, to his great credit, has \nadded far beyond what the White House suggested in terms of war costs \nfor 2007. He has made at least a serious effort to cover the war costs \nin 2007. There is no money past 2007.\n\n  There is no money past this year to fix the alternative minimum tax. \nOver the next 10 years, it costs a trillion dollars to fix. There is no \nmoney here past 2006. You put that back in, and then you put back into \nthe calculation the money they are taking from the Social Security \ntrust fund. Every year, they take from Social Security to pay other \nbills. It all has to be paid back. None of it is in the deficit \ncalculation, but it all gets added to the debt.\n  When you add it all back, what you find is that when they say the \ndeficit is going to go up $359 billion for fiscal year 2007, starting \nOctober 1, the debt is going up $680 billion; and the next year, the \ndebt will go up $656 billion; and the next year, $635 billion; and the \nnext year, $622 billion. And in 2011, it is going to go up $662 \nbillion. And they are telling us everything is getting better? It is \nnot getting better. It is getting a whole lot worse. That is the truth.\n  They have come tonight and asked us to raise the debt limit of this \ncountry another $781 billion. Over the next 5 years, they want to run \nup the debt by another $3.5 trillion. So at the end of that period, we \nhave $11.8 trillion in debt. That is before the baby boomers retire. \nPeople may not know the exact numbers, but the American people have a \nlot of common sense. You can kind of reality test. We can't pay our \nbills now. We are nowhere close to paying our bills. And we are \nborrowing money from countries all over the world. We are borrowing \nmoney from the Caribbean banking centers. Anybody listening to me doing \ntheir banking down in the Caribbean? We owe them almost $100 billion.\n  I know we use so many numbers when we talk about a budget. A lot of \npeople tune it out and say: I can't follow all the numbers. Just follow \none number: The debt of our country has doubled. The debt of our \ncountry has doubled in this 10-year period. The first 5 years of the \nBush administration and the next 5 where they are proposing the \nbudgets, they are going to have doubled the debt of our country before \nthe baby boomers retire. And almost half of this debt has been financed \nby foreigners. When we have a bond auction now, much more than half of \nit is being bought by foreigners. We are digging a hole that is so \ndeep, it will take years to get out.\n  We just had this Dubai Ports deal. Everybody gets upset about the \nUnited Arab Emirates buying the terminals in six of our major ports. I \nthought it was unwise. But that is the logical conclusion to this \nfiscal policy and this trade policy. Because while we are running up \nthe debt on the budget side by $600 billion a year and running trade \ndeficits of more than $700 billion a year and we are financing it by \nborrowing from abroad, guess what. Foreigners are up to their gills in \ndollars. They are loaded to the gills with dollars. And what are they \ngoing to do with them? They are going to buy American assets.\n  Look at what has already happened to our ports. The vast majority are \nowned by foreign interests now. You might as well just put up a big \nfor-sale sign on America and say: Come and get it, because we have not \nbeen able to restrain our spending and our appetite for debt and our \nunwillingness to tax ourselves to pay our bills. So what is the result? \nThe result is runaway debt, increasingly financed by foreigners, and at \nthe same time these trade deficits, which have the exact same effect, \nputting more and more dollars in the hands of more and more foreign \nentities. They have to do something with them. They can sit on them. \nThey can hold them in their banks. They can invest them in U.S. stocks \nand bonds, which they are increasingly doing. And they can also just \nbuy hard assets here.\n  We wonder about the Dubai Ports deal. Get ready. There are going to \nbe a whole lot more deals like that coming because the world is awash \nin dollars, and we are buying much more than we are selling to \nforeigners. At the same time in our own budget, we are spending much \nmore than we are taking in. As a result, we have to borrow, borrow, \nborrow.\n  The Comptroller General of the United States is the man who is given \nthe responsibility to advise the Congress on the fiscal condition of \nthe country. Here is what he said before the Senate Budget Committee:\n\n       Continuing on this unsustainable fiscal path will gradually \n     erode, if not suddenly damage, our economy, our standard of \n     living, and ultimately our national security.\n\n  It is that simple. It is that important.\n  Tonight we are going to make another fateful decision. Unfortunately, \nthere is no alternative. We are going to have to pass this increase in \nthe debt limit because the money has to be paid back. We have already \nborrowed it. We have already spent it. It is gone. Now the only \nquestion is, Are we going to pay the bill? There is no option. There is \nno alternative. If the United States failed to pay its debt, the value \nof our currency would plummet, interest rates would skyrocket, and our \neconomy would tank. That is the hard fact.\n  This should be a wake-up call for every Member of the Senate, every \nMember of Congress, and a wake-up call for the President of the United \nStates. The question is, Are we staying on this course to keep running \nup the debt, debt on top of debt, increasingly financed by foreigners, \nor are we going to change course? I hope with every fiber in my being \nthat we change course because if we fail to do so, we will weaken the \ncountry immeasurably. We will threaten not only our economic security \nbut our national security.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator require?\n  Ms. STABENOW. No more than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished ranking member \nfrom North Dakota, who does such an outstanding job every single day, \nspeaking about the real values and priorities of the American people. I \ncommend him for his leadership.\n  I rise today to express grave concern about this historic increase \nthat is before us in America's national debt. Today, we owe \n$8,270,260,017,805.93, and counting, on the national debt. That is a \nlong string of debt that isn't going to go away--over $8.2 trillion. In \nfact, it continues to grow. Just last month, we paid $21 billion in \ninterest alone. Earlier today, I offered an amendment for $5 billion to \nmake sure that the radios in this country are connected, interoperable, \nso they can communicate in case of a terrorist attack or a national \ndisaster or other emergency. This was turned down by the body as being \ntoo much.\n  Yet we spent $21 billion last month in interest alone on the national \ndebt. The legislation before us allows this administration to continue \nto rack up another $800 billion on the Nation's credit card. That means \nwe are allowing the debt to exceed $8.9 trillion. That is unbelievable. \nThat is trillion with a capital ``T.''\n  Tragically, 5 years ago, we were sitting on top of the largest \nsurplus in the Nation's history. The year I came into the Senate as a \nmember of the Budget Committee, we were debating what to do with the \nlargest surplus in the Nation's history, $5.6 trillion. At that time, \nthe Senator from North Dakota suggested--and I supported it--a strategy \nthat would divide that surplus into thirds: one-third for strategic tax \ncuts in order to grow the economy; one-third for investment in our \npeople, education, health care, science, research, law enforcement, \nthose kinds of things; and one-third to go to paying down the liability \nwe know is coming with Social Security. We would not be debating that \ngap in Social Security funding\n\n[[Page S2187]]\n\non down the road if we had in fact used that strategy. But that is not \nwhat happened.\n  Instead, all of that was put into a supply-side tax cut geared only \nto the wealthiest Americans, and leaving everybody else to pick up the \ntab. Deficits have spiraled out of control since that time.\n  The budget we are debating only makes the national debt worse. It \nincreases another $4 trillion in debt over the next 10 years. That is \nthe budget resolution that is in front of us. That doesn't reflect our \nvalues. As Americans, we want our children and grandchildren to do \nbetter than we did. It is not about leaving them debt; it is about \ncreating opportunity and about leaving them good jobs, and health care, \nand air they can breathe, and water they can drink, and a strong \nnational security so they are safe.\n  Unfortunately, because of our soaring national debt, our children and \ngrandchildren are going to have to pay our bills. I find that simply \noutrageous. In essence, we are going to max out on the Nation's credit \ncard and then send the monthly bill to our children.\n  As most people know, this is a tough time for the people of Michigan. \nAnybody who has read the newspaper lately knows that companies such as \nDelphi and General Motors and Ford are struggling. Due to problems such \nas unfair trade practices, we are literally losing our manufacturing \nbase in this country, coupled with the fact that we need to \nfundamentally change the way we fund health care in order to get health \ncare costs off the back of business so they can be more competitive in \na global economy.\n  Manufacturing has been the key to building a solid middle class and \ncreating a way of life that is extraordinary for Americans. If we lose \nour manufacturing industries, such as automobiles, we are going to lose \nour middle class in this country and lose our way of life.\n  You might wonder what do unfair trade practices have to do with the \nincreasing national debt. The answer is: A lot. That is because many \nforeign countries own our national debt. That means we have to borrow \nfrom other countries to pay our bills. And we are borrowing more and \nmore from foreign countries in recent years.\n  Unfortunately, many of those countries that own our debt also refuse \nto follow the international trade rules. They cheat. They want to be a \npart of the international community, but they don't follow the rules. \nIn fact, China and Japan own approximately half of all of our foreign \ndebt. At the same time, they continue to take our patents and to \nmanipulate their currencies so their products cost less, in violation \nof international law.\n\n  This hurts our manufacturing sector because it makes it easier for \nthem to sell their products in America and tougher for American \nbusinesses to export our products to their countries.\n  For example, a $20,000 car imported from Japan has an unfair subsidy \nof as much as $7,000 over a U.S. automobile. At the same time, U.S. \nexports to China face a $7,000 tax. This cost advantage directly \nsubsidized over 1.7 million cars and trucks exported to the U.S. last \nyear, as well as every component imported by Japanese manufacturers for \nuse in their U.S. assembly plants.\n  China has been pegging its currency and is responsible for producing \na $12 billion market of counterfeit auto parts, which has cost us the \nequivalent of 200,000 jobs in America--many in Michigan.\n  We should be getting tough with China and Japan on these trade \nviolations that are costing Americans their jobs and threatening our \nmiddle-class way of life in this country. They are illegal. We should \ninsist that they stop. But our Government is weak-kneed because we have \nborrowed so much money from them. There is a connection between the \nbudget deficit and our trade deficit, both of which are out of control.\n  When I look at what families in Michigan are having to go through, \nmen and women who have worked hard all their lives and have paid into a \npension, and they may not have it now, and their cost of health care is \ngoing up, or maybe they won't have it anymore and they may be losing \ntheir jobs, and their dreams for sending their kids to college are \ngoing away, the American dream that says you can buy a house and have a \ngood home and dream big dreams, and maybe in Michigan you can buy a \ncottage up north and a snowmobile, and you make sure you can live a \ngood life and care for your families--those dreams are going away for \ntoo many people. Part of the reason is because of unfair trade \npractices. We don't have a level playing field. We do not make sure \nother countries are following the rules. They are cheating and they are \ngetting away with it.\n  When we look at what is happening, we see that China and Japan own \nhalf of our foreign debt. They are the same people who are not \nfollowing the rules and are costing us jobs. There is a direct \nconnection between what is happening here in terms of raising this debt \nlimit and what is happening in my home State of Michigan in terms of \njobs, and the fight we have right now to keep our way of life. There is \na better way than what is before us now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan, who is \nsuch an exceptionally valuable member of the Budget Committee. She has \nbeen one of the strongest voices on the question of what are the \npriorities of the budget. Also she is a very strong voice for fiscal \nresponsibility, recognizing that if we want to spend money, we have to \npay for it. The Senator from Michigan has been a great leader on the \nSenate Budget Committee. I thank her so much for her contribution \nduring the year, and again on the debate on the budget resolution this \nyear.\n  While we are waiting for the chairman of the Finance Committee, who \nis being called off the floor momentarily, I want to remind colleagues \nof the circumstance we face tomorrow. If there are staffs listening or \nMembers listening, we are still getting requests as though we had a lot \nof time left. We simply do not.\n  Tomorrow we are going to start at 9. We are going to be handling \namendments that are in the queue until 10:30. At 10:30, we will start \nvoting on amendments and we will vote on the debt matter and amendments \nto the debt resolution. When those have been dispensed with, we will \nthen go back to the consideration of amendments until 1:30.\n  At 1:30, all time has been deemed to have been used up in the budget \nresolution debate. We will start a series of votes every 10 minutes. \nRight now, with the number of amendments pending, we now have 65 votes \npending on this side alone. We know we can do 3 amendments an hour. If \neverybody sticks to their amendments, that is 22 hours of straight \nvoting. That is just the amendments on our side. The other side has \nanother 15 amendments. That is 80, so that is 27 hours of voting.\n\n  That is the situation we face. It is in the hands of the Members. Are \npeople going to show restraint or are people going to insist on every \namendment to be offered and voted on? I hope very much that we can \nconvince colleagues to take very short time agreements tomorrow. I will \nnot agree to any time agreement over 10 minutes tomorrow, period. Let \nme make that very clear. I hope we can get time agreements as short as \n5 minutes before we get into vote-arama. When we get into vote-arama, \nunderstand that there will be 1 minute on a side.\n  So, again, I hope colleagues understand the circumstance we face. We \nhave lost a tremendous amount of time to extraneous events--a joint \nsession, meetings at the White House, and the debt limit debate put in \nthe middle of this discussion. So that is the reality we face.\n  Last year, Lula Davis has just informed me, we started voting at 1:17 \nin the afternoon, and we voted until roughly 10 o'clock at night. Some \nof those votes were held every 5 minutes, and we handled over 20 \namendments during that period. I think one can see if we have to try to \ndo 80 amendments, we are going to be here a very long time.\n  With that, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Is the Senator from Oklahoma seeking recognition?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I don't want to be offensive in any way. I \nlistened to two talks about where we are,\n\n[[Page S2188]]\n\nand I agree with where we are financially. But there are some facts \nthat are left out of the story. There is no question that spending has \nincreased. There is no question the debt is going up. But who is \nresponsible for it? We can talk about it. First, we had a recession, \nand then 9/11 came, and there were rosy projections we all knew for \ncertain weren't right. But to turn around and blame our debt on the \nPresident of the United States is not only in error, it is not \nfactually correct, and it also tends to shun the responsibility we have \nas a body.\n  The President cannot sign any bill we don't pass. This President \nbecame President in early 2001, at which time the Republicans weren't \nin control of the Senate. There was a divided--in 2002, that is, and \nthere was a divided control. But during all that period of time, the \nbills that went to the President were voted on by Congress; both the \nHouse and the Senate passed bills. I also note that those people who \nhave been so earnestly talking about our debt limit, which I plan on \nattacking aggressively--there is some credibility there with the talk.\n  This last year they voted for over $700 billion in new spending. So \nif, in fact, you want to control the spending and you don't want the \ndebt limit to go up, you can't continue to vote for unlimited spending \nincreases.\n  There is no question that we have increased revenues that are not \nwhat they probably could be if we ran the Government much more \nefficiently, but the very fact that we would have people who claim they \nare appalled at the debt limit and then every time we cast a vote for \nan increase of spending that is not paid for or not offset in another \nway adds directly to that debt limit.\n  The responsibility lies in the Congress for the spending. It is not \nthe executive branch. As a matter of fact, we have sent multiple bills, \nand if you look at the votes on the multiple bills that have come \nthrough this body, they are not just a majority vote, they are a \nsupermajority and many times unanimous. So to claim and lay that on the \nexecutive branch when, in fact, it is our responsibility belies the \ntruth.\n  The facts that the Senator from North Dakota outlined are very \naccurate in terms of where we are. Here is one of the most important \nfacts. The increase in debt per Americans since 2001 is over $8,000. \nThe increase in the annual earnings per American workers since 2001 is \nless than $4,000. We are about to become the first generation of \nAmericans to leave the next generation worse off. But as long as we are \nfinger pointing and saying it is somebody else's problem, we are not \ngoing to solve the problem.\n  We had an opportunity this past year in which we slowed down the \ngrowth of Medicaid by $4.8 billion a year and over a 5-year period. \nThat total cumulative cost is $38.8 billion. That is the savings for 5 \nyears. But the earmarks alone that this body passed last year were $64 \nbillion.\n  I am highly concerned about the debt limit, and it is doubtful that I \nwill be voting to extend the debt limit, but I certainly am not going \nto stand here and let people claim that it is the executive branch's \nresponsibility. It is not. It is ours, and we failed. We have failed \nour grandchildren, we have failed our children, we have failed the \npeople who are paying taxes today in this country. We would rather get \nreelected by doling out earmarks and pork than solve the real long-term \nproblems of our country, and we can see that very easily when we look \nat earmarks related to the size of the Federal Government.\n  There is a cause-and-effect relationship. As a matter of fact, \ntomorrow morning we are having a hearing on earmarks in the Federal \nFinancial Management Subcommittee, the oversight Committee on Homeland \nSecurity. What you see is that in 1994, there were 4,000 earmarks and \nabout $4 billion. Last year, there were 15,877 earmarks, and the total \nspending by the Federal Government was over $2.6 trillion. There is a \ncorrelation. It is that we don't want to do the hard work of making the \nhard decisions.\n  So when we have $64 billion in earmarks in 1 year and we can't get \nthe hard savings of $4.8 billion in just slowing the growth of Medicaid \nfrom 8 percent to 7.9 percent, and we barely pass that, what we have is \na refusal to do our duty.\n  The points the Senator from North Dakota made in terms of his \nfinancial analysis were all accurate. You can't dispute it. He points \nout very accurately the double standard on accounting gimmicks that the \nCongress is using.\n  It is my hope that tomorrow we will be able to discuss this more. I \nknow the chairman of the Finance Committee would like to have the \nfloor, and at this time I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the issue of the increase in the debt \nlimit has come before the Senate as an agreement between the two \nleaders, and as the committee of jurisdiction, as chairman of the \nFinance Committee, I speak in support of House Joint Resolution 47, a \nbill that increases the Federal debt limit. I support this increase \nbecause it is necessary to preserve the full faith and credit of the \nGovernment. Without an increase in the debt limit, our Government will \nface a choice that we should not make and we would not want to make: a \nchoice between breaking the law by exceeding the statutory debt limit \nor breaking faith with the public by defaulting on our debt. I hope \neveryone would agree that neither choice is acceptable.\n  To understand why we are here today seeking to increase the debt \nlimit, it is necessary to explain a few points about the Federal debt.\n  Under current law, there is a statutory limit on the amount of debt \nthat can be issued by the Federal Government. This limit, which now \nstands at $8.184 trillion, applies to virtually all the debt issued by \nthe Government. There is only one debt limit, but there are, in fact, \ntwo types of debt within that figure: debt held by the public--meaning \nyou and I as private citizens buying Government bonds, owning Treasury \nbills--and then, of course, on the other hand, the debt held by various \nGovernment trust funds. An example would be the surplus that is \ninvested in the Social Security surplus payroll that is not being paid \nout for benefits, being invested in Government debt with that debt owed \nto the trust fund with the interest accumulating to the trust fund.\n\n  The amount of Federal debt held by the public is determined by the \nGovernment's annual cash flow. When total spending exceeds total taxes, \nthe Government has a budget deficit. To finance this deficit, the \nGovernment borrows from the public by selling debt, such as Treasury \nbills, Treasury notes, and Treasury bonds. We will hear a lot of \ncriticism that President Bush's tax cuts are responsible for our rising \npublic debt, but the facts show otherwise.\n  When President Bush took office in 2001, the Federal debt limit was \n$5.95 trillion, almost $6 trillion. The debt limit was increased to \n$6.4 trillion in 2002, $7.3 trillion in 2003, and now the present $8.1 \ntrillion in 2005.\n  Assuming we increase the debt limit today, it will be $8.965 \ntrillion. Thus, the Federal debt limit will have increased by $3.015 \ntrillion since President Bush took office in 2001.\n  However, the tax cuts that have been enacted since 2001 total roughly \n$900 billion through the end of the most recent fiscal year. That \nincludes interest costs as well. Thus, the President's tax cuts account \nfor about 30 percent of the increase in the Federal debt. The rest of \nthis increase in the public debt is due to the recession, the war in \nIraq, and the increased spending on homeland security, also related to \nthe war on terror.\n  In addition to the debt held by the public, the Federal debt limit \nalso applies, as I said before, to the debt held by various Government \ntrust funds, such as Social Security and Medicare. Whenever a trust \nfund program collects more than it spends, the surplus is invested in \nspecial issue Treasury securities. These special securities count \ntoward the debt limit. However, it is important to understand that the \namount of debt held by the trust funds does not reflect the \nGovernment's unfunded obligations.\n  For example, the Treasury Department reports that the total amount of \nFederal debt held by all the trust fund programs is about $3.5 \ntrillion. However, the Social Security and Medicare trustees report \nthat the unfunded obligation of Social Security and Medicare is more \nthan $81 trillion.\n\n[[Page S2189]]\n\n  Given these facts, it should be obvious to everyone that the Federal \ndebt provides a misleading and inaccurate picture of the Government's \nfuture liabilities. Efforts to use the statutory debt limit to control \nGovernment debt and deficits cannot succeed because it ignores the \nlong-term budget problems.\n  Indeed, even former Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan has suggested \nthe debt limit has outlived its usefulness and should be replaced with \na more accurate and useful alternative. I would welcome the opportunity \nto work with my colleagues to develop such an alternative. It may never \nhappen, but it ought to happen. This is not quite a very intellectual \nway to decide what the Government is doing in a fiscal way because, \nquite obviously, every day Congress is appropriating money and every \nday we are spending money and every day if that exceeds the taxes that \nare coming in and we get to the debt limit, the debt is going to \nincrease or is going to shut down the Government.\n  As a Republican, that was part of our strategy during the Clinton \nadministration. But let me tell you, it didn't work. It didn't work \nbecause it wasn't good policy, and it ended up not being very good \npolitics. I hope we do not have an extended debate and a lot of breast \nbeating about the issue of increasing the national debt because, quite \nfrankly, if we spend and we spend up to that limit, we are not going to \nshut down the Government, if we learned the lesson, as I hope I learned \nthe lesson, and we move on. It ought to be very pro forma.\n  There will be a lot of debate about it, a lot of political points \ntrying to be made, but the point is we have to keep the business of \nGovernment going. I would relish the opportunities to have those days \nwhen we paid down $550 billion on the national debt during the fiscal \nyears of, I think, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000, I believe it was. It was \nabout $558 billion I believe that we paid down on the national debt. I \nam glad we did. But now we have the war on terror, we had 3,000 \nAmericans killed in New York City because of terrorist attacks, and we \nare fighting a war to make sure terrorism doesn't happen again, at \nleast on the soil in the United States of America.\n  The No. 1 obligation of our Government under the Constitution is for \nthe national defense. Protecting our people from further terrorist \nattacks is very basic to it. We voted, in a bipartisan way, to send men \nand women to the battlefield in Afghanistan and Iraq, and if we do \nthat, we have an obligation to appropriate the money to give them the \ntools to do the job when they put their life on the line for our \nfreedom and our liberty and to make sure that 3,000 Americans don't get \nkilled again. These all create situations wherein we have annual debt \nor annual deficits, and you increase the national debt on a cumulative \nbasis when you do that. So there will probably be almost 50 votes, \nmaybe, against this resolution when we vote on it tomorrow. I would ask \nthe people who vote against it, do you want to shut down Government? Or \nif you don't want to shut down Government, you don't want to increase \nthe national debt, why did you vote for the money we spent that brings \nus to the point of a necessity of increasing the national debt? We \nshould pass this resolution for the sound operation of our Government. \nShutting down Government, we found out, ended up costing the taxpayers \nmore than if Government had operated.\n\n  There are a lot of conservatives listening who see a conservative \nlike Chuck Grassley saying that, and they say: Grassley, what planet \ndid you come from? If we shut down Government, you ought to save money. \nBut we didn't end up saving money. So you learn from history, or you \nare destined to repeat it. That is why this ought to pass unanimously. \nIt won't, but it ought to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana and \ncommend him for his hard work on matters financial in the Senate and in \nour country. Fiscal responsibility is the watchword for the Senator \nfrom Montana, and I am grateful for his leadership. At the same time, I \nsay to the distinguished Senator from Iowa, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, he is someone who also works very hard to make us a \nresponsible nation, and I respect him. Although we differ on things, \nthe fact is that I listen carefully to what the Senator from Iowa has \nto say. He has a position of great responsibility, the chairman of one \nof the most important committees in the Senate, and carries that \nresponsibility honorably; again, if I may say, at times wrongfully, but \nit is in the eyes of the beholder. But I know the Senator from Iowa \nunderstands that if there is any criticism of his views, it is not \npersonal and has nothing to do with his credibility or his honor.\n  I listened very carefully to what the Senator from Iowa talked about. \nHe talked about shutting down Government and he talked about providing \nsecurity for our people, protecting them, making sure their lives \ncontinue in safety. But I don't get it. I have to tell you this: I \ndon't get it. Because when issues came up such as when we needed more \nmoney for port security, we said no. When it came up that we needed \nmore money for the Department of Homeland Security, we said: Well, we \nwill give you some but not all you need. When it came to providing some \ndevelopmental funds for technology that would help us examine \ncontainers coming into our ports, we were unwilling to do it.\n  So now what we hear is the lament that says: How can we shut down our \nGovernment? Well, we can avoid shutting it down by not extending tax \ncuts to the wealthiest among us, people who make millions and don't \nneed any help. I meet these people, and they say: Yes, we don't need \nit, but what the heck, if it is there, we are going to take it.\n  But when you think about the outcome of this profligate spending we \nare seeing here and our deficit going through the roof--I heard one of \nour good friends from the other side talk about reducing our annual \ndeficits. Well, they could be reduced a trifling amount, but if you \nlook at the debt, that debt increases, that clock is ticking.\n  We have here an example of a credit card, and our credit card is \nrunning kind of over the limit. Right now, we are carrying an $8.2 \ntrillion credit debt. That means if you borrow on credit, you have to \npay it off. President Bush and his colleagues, the Republican Congress, \nare encouraging burdening our children and our grandchildren under a \nmountain of debt.\n  A lot of what we do around here is hidden in complicated budget \nrhetoric, but to put matters simply, this debt extension bill will \nincrease President Bush's credit limit, the one he has established, by \n$781 billion. It will encourage this Republican Congress--they are the \nmajority--to charge another $781 billion on our Nation's credit card.\n  Most Americans with credit cards know that you have to play by the \ncredit card company's rules. People understand when they run up big \nbills they will be responsible to eventually pay up. Few people run up \na giant credit card bill and then leave it for their children to pay. \nBut that is what the Bush administration is doing, running up credit, \nand their kids will have to pay the bill.\n\n  Since President Bush took office, he has already increased the total \nFederal debt by 46 percent. He has added $2.5 trillion to the debt \nfuture generations will have to pay. So I say enough is enough. The \nPresident and the majority in the Congress have been far too reckless \nfor far too long with our Nation's credit card. We see who the managers \nare of the legislation we considering here: the Republican majority. \nAnd they want to extend his credit limit. I say no way.\n  In my view, it is time to limit the credit. It is what most parents \nwould do. What would you do as a parent if you had a kid, a child who \nwas running up bills on your credit card, just running them up, higher \nand higher and higher, and you know you can't pay them off? So what \nwould you do? Pat him on the head and say: Go spend more? No, you \nwouldn't do that at all. What you would do is cut up his credit card. \nAnd this is what we are going to do: cut up his credit card right here \nand now.\n  America can do better, leave a better legacy for our grandchildren \nand their children. Our consciences scream out\n\n[[Page S2190]]\n\njust as a family would at home: We are buried in debt; why do you want \nto add more to it? The response would be: Mom and dad, why do you do \nthis to us? We have college debt from our years at the university. We \nhave less reliability, less reliance on pension funds. They are not \nguaranteed anymore. We have less expectation that we can hold our jobs \nbased on foreign competition, jobs that used to be done here in \nWashington, DC, and in my home State of New Jersey and States across \nthis country, jobs that were held, and they were good-paying jobs. Now \nthey come with an accent from India. There is nothing wrong with the \naccent, but there is something wrong with the place. Why should we be \ntransferring decent jobs Americans can do and do well to India? Why? \nBecause we pay maybe a tenth of what it costs us here. If someone makes \n$500 a week here, and in India they make 50 bucks, they will be feeling \npretty good. So the result is that we are lowering living standards for \nAmericans across this country, and these jobs will not be replaced.\n  I know something about balancing budgets. I ran a big company, a very \nlarge company; it now has 40,000 employees. We started with nothing. We \nworked hard. But we always balanced our budget. We had 42 years in a \nrow with growth on the profit at 10 percent every year over the \nprevious year, the longest record of any company in American history. \nThat is the company I ran; it is called ADP, Automatic Data Processing. \nI was the founder.\n  Here in the Senate, I was the senior Democrat on the Budget \nCommittee. We produced during those years the first balanced budget in \n30 years. We did such a good job that when President Bush, President \nGeorge W. Bush, took the oath of office, he was presented with the \nrosiest financial picture of any President ever in the history of our \ncountry. We had budget surpluses as far as the eye could see. In 2000, \nwe had a budget surplus--surplus--and that is in the year 2000, 5 years \nago, going on 6 years ago, we had a budget surplus of $236 billion. In \n2001, when President Bush came into office, he had a surplus of $128 \nbillion. We were ready to pay off our national debt by the end of his \nterm. We were in the middle of the longest economic expansion in the \nhistory of our country. But the Republicans plunged blindly and \nrecklessly into massive tax breaks, not for the middle class or poor, \nlower level income among us, but the wealthy, the special interests--\ntax breaks that will cost $3.4 trillion if they are extended over the \nnext decade. A third of that amount, more than $1 trillion, will go to \nthe wealthiest of the wealthy, the top 1 percent.\n  This is what the Bush tax cuts will mean. If you make $1 million a \nyear, you get an average tax cut of $136,000. That helps everybody out \nevery year, I guess, if you need that. But if you make less than \n$20,000 a year, you get 19 bucks--$19 if you make $20,000 a year. Is \nthat helping the people who are struggling with two jobs often, trying \nto balance their family obligations with their need to earn an income, \nhaving a babysitter intercede while dad comes home from work and mom \ndoesn't yet go to hers? That is what is happening to a lot of people \nmaking $20,000 a year with two children in this society of ours--a $19 \ntax break. Don't spend it all in one place.\n  And to what end? The only thing President Bush and the Republican \nmajority have accomplished is a doubling of our Nation's debt. If we \ncontinue on this path, our national debt will be $12 trillion by 2011.\n  Tomorrow we are going to vote on whether President Bush should be \nable to charge up another $781 billion on our credit card, the \ncitizens' credit card, the national credit card. That is $781 billion \nmore of debt. I hear from people I talk to who work for a living with \nkids in college, they are worried about their personal debt they have \nto have to get along, so we want to make their job twice as tough by \nadding more of the national debt on their shoulders. Would a bank keep \nextending the line of credit for a customer who didn't have a plan to \npay his bills? Of course not. That is why I say to my colleagues that \nwe should say to the American people: We really do stand for fiscal \nresponsibility, and we really do want to reduce our deficit, and we \nreally do want to cut back on that debt so we can look our children and \ngrandchildren squarely in the face and say: We didn't add to your woes, \nwe added to your opportunities.\n  So I urge my colleagues to tell the people the truth out there. Don't \ncover it up with arcane language. Let us put a stop to this reckless \ncredit binge. Let's make President Bush's credit card useless and put \nour country back on the road to fiscal responsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, about 16 months ago, we debated an $800 \nbillion increase in the debt limit. At the time, this was the Bush \nadministration's third request to increase the debt limit for a grand \ntotal of $2.2 trillion. During this debate, I discussed how in less \nthan four-years, a 20-year $5.6 trillion budget surplus was turned into \na $2.4 trillion deficit. I thought at the time the fiscal outlook could \nnot get much worse and the budget situation would have to improve.\n  Unfortunately, I was wrong. Since the last debate on increasing the \ndebt ceiling, the administration has not submitted budgets that would \nput us on a path towards deficit reduction. As part of last year's \nbudget resolution, Congress passed legislation that would reduce \nspending by almost $40 billion. Many of these cuts will impact those \nthat have the least. Now Congress is in the process of wrapping up a \n$70 billion tax bill. When you combine the spending and the tax bill, \nthe numbers do not add up to put us on a path towards deficit \nreduction. The combined total increases the deficit and increases the \ndebt.\n  The Bush administration's budget for fiscal year 2007 includes more \nof the same and the fiscal situation even gets worse. The \nadministration estimates that the deficit for 2006 will be $423 \nbillion, the largest in history. The projected surplus of $5.6 trillion \nthat this administration inherited will now turn into a $3.3 trillion \ndeficit, a reversal of $8.9 trillion.\n  The repeated pattern of deficits and irresponsible budgets \nnecessitate another increase in the debt limit. Today we have before us \nan increase of $781 billion, which will bring the total to $3 trillion \nunder this administration's watch. If the President's budget is \nadopted, the debt is expected to reach $8.6 trillion at the end of this \nyear. Under this budget, with alternative minimum tax reform and \nongoing war costs added in, the debt will explode to $12 trillion by \n2011.\n  We cannot continue on this unsustainable path. Yesterday, Senator \nConrad offered an amendment to the budget resolution to restore the \noriginal pay-as-you-go-rule that led us on a path to a balanced budget, \nprojected surpluses, and expectations of paying down the debt. These \npay-go rules simply require new mandatory spending and new tax cuts to \nbe offset. The current pay-go rule has a glaring loophole. Tax and \nspending increases that are provided in the budget resolution are \nexempted. This rule does not promote fiscal responsibility. A prime \nexample of this is the tax and spending reconciliation instructions \nincluded in last year's budget resolution. These bills will increase \nthe deficit by $30 billion.\n  Repeatedly, efforts to restore pay-go have been defeated and these \nefforts were defeated once again yesterday. In the context of today's \ndebate, I do not know how anyone could oppose an amendment to restore \nthese rules. Without strong pay-go rules, we will be back here in a \nyear debating another increase in the debt limit.\n  We have a fundamental obligation to restore fiscal responsibility \nrather than merely voting to raise the debt limit as if there was an \nendless credit card at the expense of the American people. Americans \nstruggle every day to balance their own budgets. Across this country, I \nhave heard how families struggle to keep up with the rising costs of \nhealth care, tuition, and gasoline. Median household income has \ndeclined by $1,669 or 3.6 percent after inflation. Americans are \nsitting around their kitchen tables trying to figure out how to pay \ntheir bills. They do not have a magic credit card with no limit. \nCongress should play by the same rules.\n  We need to be responsible and think about future generations. We made \ntough choices during the 1990s in order to dig ourselves out of a hole, \nand now we are back in an even deeper hole. We need to face the \nconsequences. The interest payments on the debt alone are\n\n[[Page S2191]]\n\nstaggering and depriving of us choices that we need to make for the \nlong term investment of our country. This debt will affect our children \nand grandchildren. Each individual's share of the public debt is over \n$16,000 and a family of four's share is a staggering $64,533.\n  The interest on the debt for this year alone is over $220 billion and \naccording to the administration's budget it will grow to $322 billion \nin 2011. Just think of how this money could be put to better use. It \ncould be used to help uninsured Americans with the rising cost of \nhealth care. We cannot afford expensive interest payments and ever-\nincreasing debt with the retirement of the baby boomers on the horizon.\n  Not only is the amount of debt a problem, I am also concerned about \nthe amount of debt that is foreign held, almost $2.2 trillion. Japan \nholds the most, $685 billion. China holds $258 billion. Even the \nCaribbean banking centers hold $111 billion. Over 51 percent of the \npublic debt is held by foreign investors.\n  Sixty percent of the foreign debt is held by official foreign \ninvestors. It is dangerous for our Government and our standard of \nliving to be dependent on foreign capital. If foreign investors decided \nto stop financing our borrowing habits, it could have a spiraling \nimpact on our economy. If those investors began to withdraw their \ncapital, our financial markets would plummet and interest rates would \nclimb. This would filter down to American families. Homes, education, \nand cars would become more expensive.\n  Debt is more than a financial liability it--weakens our security, our \ndiplomacy, and our trade policy. The negligence of our borrow and spend \npolicies leaves us vulnerable to the priorities of foreign creditors. \nHow do you go to a country that holds so much of your debt while your \neconomy is closely linked to theirs and make an argument about nuclear \nproliferation, human rights, democratization, or other issues that are \nof importance and great consequence to our country?\n  We need to make economic opportunity and fiscal responsibility a \ncommon goal. We need to live by rules that give the debt limit meaning. \nI will not support a borrow and spend economic policy that has no \nlimits. There are better alternatives.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am deeply troubled by the pending \nlegislation, which would raise the Federal debt limit by $781 billion. \nThe fact that we are considering this legislation illustrates how \ndeeply the policies of this administration have plunged us into \ndeficits and debt. This President has supported, and continues to \nsupport, tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, which are not paid for \nand which will continue to run up deficits and debt as far as the eye \ncan see. I am very concerned that if the President continues to pursue \nthis reckless fiscal policy, our Nation's long-term economic strength \nwill be seriously compromised.\n  Despite the fact that the President signed into law legislation \nincreasing the debt limit less than a year and a half ago, the Treasury \nDepartment has now informed us that it will need to borrow even more to \nkeep the Government functioning. The legislation we are considering \ntoday would allow Federal debt to grow to $8.965 trillion, truly a \nstaggering sum.\n  When President Bush took office, he promised that his fiscal policies \nwould include ``maximum possible debt retirement.'' At that time, the \nCongressional Budget Office was projecting that our net debt to the \npublic would decline to $36 billion by 2008, when this President leaves \noffice. Now, instead of achieving ``maximum possible debt retirement,'' \nthe President is asking for historically high debt increases. In fact, \nthe CBO is now projecting that publicly held debt will rise to nearly \n$5.5 trillion in 2008--almost 40 percent of our GDP. Gross Federal \ndebt, which includes our commitments to Social Security and Medicare, \nwill be $9.6 trillion by the time this President leaves office.\n  You do not need a very long memory to recall that a few short years \nago, under President Clinton, we made some very hard choices on taxes \nand spending--restraining spending and raising some taxes, primarily on \nupper-income people--and we were able to turn around the Nation's \nfiscal status and begin to pay down our debt.\n  When President Bush took office in 2001, the statutory debt limit \nstood at $5.95 trillion and had not been raised since 1997. The \nadministration is now asking for the fourth increase in the debt limit \nsince this President took office. The limit was raised by $450 billion \nin 2002, by $984 billion in 2003, and by $800 billion in 2004. Now the \nPresident is asking for an increase of $781 billion--for a total \nincrease of more than $3 trillion since 2001.\n  These figures demonstrate how seriously our economic situation has \ndeteriorated under this administration. Let me just emphasize that \npoint with one further example. When the President took office, he \ninherited a 10-year surplus estimated at $5.6 trillion. Now, when you \nfactor in some of the costs we know are coming, such as the continuing \ncosts of the war in Iraq and the cost of reforming the alternative \nminimum tax, plus the cost of some of the President's proposals, such \nas making his tax cuts permanent and continuing his defense buildup, \nthe projections are for a $3.5 trillion deficit over the next 10 years, \na reversal of $9.1 trillion. That is a seismic shift in our position.\n  Much of this shift is a direct result of the reckless fiscal policies \npursued by the President during his first term and his singular focus \non providing tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, even at a time of \nwar. And the President is seeking to increase our debt burden by \npermanently extending many of these tax cuts, utterly ignoring the fact \nthat these massive tax cuts for the rich have led to budget deficits so \nlarge that they could jeopardize our future economic strength.\n  In part, my concern for our economic future stems from a change in \ninternational economic position of the United States. Two decades ago, \nthe United States was a creditor nation internationally, by about 10 \npercent of our GDP. Now, because of the deterioration of our position \nover those intervening two decades, we are a debtor nation, to the tune \nof almost 25 percent of our GDP. At the end of fiscal year 2001, 31 \npercent of the outstanding Federal Government debt was held by foreign \nlenders. Over the succeeding 4 years, borrowing from abroad accounted \nfor more than 80 percent of the increase in our Government debt.\n  The international financial position of the United States reminds me \nof Tennessee Williams's Blanche DuBois in ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' \nwho said: ``I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.'' That \nis what has happened to the United States in the international economic \nscene. We have deteriorated into a debtor status so that we are now \ndependent upon the kindness of strangers. That is not where the world's \nleading power should find itself.\n  This dramatic change in our economic situation comes at a time when \nthe United States is facing a demographic tidal wave as the baby boom \ngeneration approaches retirement. When President Bush first took \noffice, that retirement was almost a decade away. But time has run out. \nThe first of the baby boomers will begin to retire in 2008, on this \nPresident's watch. Unfortunately, rather than prepare for the \nobligations we know are coming, this President has squandered every \nopportunity to save for the future.\n  Moreover, his policy of deficit-financed tax cuts makes us less able \nto make needed investments today. Every increase in the Government's \ndebt means we are siphoning off resources that could be used for other \npurposes simply to pay the interest on that debt. Net interest payments \non our debt are expected to consume more than $1 trillion over the next \n5 years. Instead of making investments in education, in health care, in \ntransportation, we are paying billions of dollars in interest costs \nthat would not have existed in the absence of the reckless fiscal \npolicy of this administration.\n  Not only do these policies jeopardize our current and future economic \nstrength, they place a tremendous burden on our children and \ngrandchildren who will have to pay off this debt. By cutting taxes for \nthe wealthiest, the President is really raising taxes on everyone, \nincluding our children and grandchildren, by leaving them with the \nresponsibility for paying off this enormous debt.\n  It is unfortunate that this administration has demonstrated such a \nsingle-minded focus on cutting taxes, regardless of the very serious \nchange in\n\n[[Page S2192]]\n\nour economic situation and our country's current and future needs. The \nfact that the President is calling for permanent tax cuts at the same \ntime the Congress is being asked to add almost $800 billion to the \nFederal debt ceiling is beyond reckless--it places in jeopardy our \nfuture economic strength and the economic security of all Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I consume.\n  Thomas Jefferson once wrote:\n\n       It is incumbent on every generation to pay its own debt as \n     it goes.\n\n  That is what today's debate is about. Will this generation pay its \nown debt as it goes or will this generation choose to shift the burden \nof paying for our consumption to our children and our grandchildren? \nWill this generation take responsibility for its own appetites or will \nthis generation rob from the mouths of our children and our \ngrandchildren?\n  This question defines the very line between responsibility and \nirresponsibility.\n  Today we debate legislation to memorialize the shifting of that \nburden to our children. Today we debate raising the Government's \nborrowing by $781 billion. That is more than three-quarters of a \ntrillion dollars for 1 year. This follows on the heels of an increase \nof $800 billion in November of 2004, less than 1\\1/2\\ years ago. That \nfollowed an increase of $984 billion in May of 2003, less than 1\\1/2\\ \nyears before that. That followed an increase of $450 billion in June of \n2002, less than a year before that.\n  This is the fourth time we have had to raise the debt ceiling in the \n5 years of this administration. In contrast, prior to that the \nGovernment did not need to raise the debt ceiling for about 5 years. \nMoreover, as this chart shows, the cumulative increase during the 5 \nyears of this administration has been a mammoth $3 trillion. That is \nthe definition of irresponsibility.\n  Look at this chart. In 2002 the debt limit increase is $450 billion; \n2003, $984 billion; 2004, $800 billion; 2006, $781 billion. That totals \nover $3 trillion; that is a $3 trillion increase in just over the last \n5 years.\n  Look back at our history. What about American history prior to 5 \nyears ago? The debt of the United States did not hit $3 trillion until \n1990, a full 200 years after this country was founded. Now we have \naccumulated $3 trillion in new debt in just 5 years. That is the \ndefinition of irresponsibility.\n  This debt increase will be the fourth largest debt increase in the \nhistory of our country. This chart shows the size of debt increases. As \nyou can see from this chart, the record for a debt ceiling increase was \n$984 billion. That was in 2003. We can see it on the chart. The second \nhighest record was $915 billion. That occurred in November of 1990. \nThat is this big spike. The third largest increase was in 2004 when we \nraised the debt ceiling by $800 billion. That is not far from today's \nrequest, which is to increase it by $781 billion.\n  During the time this administration has been in office--let's look at \nit from a little different perspective--the debt has gone up by about \n$10,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. Consider that. \nDuring the time this administration has been in office, the national \ndebt has gone up by $10,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. \nFor a family of four, that is an increase of $40,000 over the last 4 \nyears. That is more than most Americans pay for a car.\n  It is bad enough we have accumulated so much new debt during the 5 \nyears of this administration, but there is a big difference between the \ndebt increase during this period and the debt before. Before, most of \nthe debt purchased from the U.S. Treasury was purchased by U.S. \ncitizens and institutions.\n  Let me repeat that. Up to 4 years ago, most debt was purchased by \nAmericans and American institutions. At least the interest we paid on \nthat debt, therefore, was paid to Americans. The wealth stayed in our \ncountry. That was up until about 4 years ago.\n  It has changed. That is no longer the case. During the 1-year \nperiod--get this. You will be stunned by this next fact. During the 1-\nyear period between December 2004 and December 2005, foreigners \npurchased 96 percent of the new debt held by the public. Almost all of \nthe debt purchased in that 1-year period, December 2004 to December \n2005, was purchased by foreigners, almost all of it; 96 percent of it \nin 1 year, the last year.\n  Foreign citizens, foreign banks, foreign central banks, and other \nforeign institutions bought this debt. Not Americans, foreigners. The \namount of public debt held by foreigners has doubled during the time \nthat this administration has been in office; that is, just last year \nalmost all of it. But when you add it with the prior years, now it has \ndoubled since this administration has been in office. The interest on \nthat debt is being siphoned out of our country. The foreigners buy the \ndebt and the interest on that debt. Where does it go? The interest goes \nto those who own the debt--not Americans, people overseas.\n  What is the consequence of that? That makes us less wealthy and it \nmeans the standard of living of our children and grandchildren will be \nlower than it ought to be. That is the definition of irresponsibility.\n\n  The problem is not confined to our future standard of living. The \nproblem is also today. Some of the foreign holdings of debt are in the \nhands of foreign central banks. Japan holds two-thirds of a trillion \ndollars of U.S. debt. China holds over a quarter of a trillion dollars \nof U.S. debt. Undoubtedly, the governments of these two countries hold \na substantial portion of that debt. These large holdings of Treasury \ndebts by foreign central banks are a risk to our homeland security and \nour economic security.\n  Does anybody ask why is that? Suppose the President of the United \nStates thinks another country is jeopardizing American security. \nSuppose--it could happen--the President would like to tell that country \nthat America would take action against it if it did not eliminate the \nthreat to America. But if that country's central bank held a large \namount of our Treasury debt, that country could threaten to sell it \nquickly. That sale would drive up U.S. interest rates and cause the \ndollar to fall. That could cause a recession in America. I am not \nsaying a foreign central bank would do that off the top, but it would \nhint it might. It doesn't have to sell it all off, just a little bit. \nBut that clearly shifts the power over to that central bank from the \nUnited States. As a result, the President might have to back down \nbecause of threats or insinuations, and so America would therefore be \nat a greater risk.\n  In the same vein, suppose the United States is involved in a trade \ndispute with a foreign country. It happens. If that foreign country's \ncentral bank held a lot of our debt, that country could threaten to \nsell that debt and force America to back down from its position on a \ntrade dispute. America could be weaker in trade as a result. You could, \nobviously, apply that to almost any situation--not just trade or \nsecurity but a whole host of areas where the United States has an \ninterest with certain countries overseas.\n  At a recent Council on Foreign Relations event, Stephen Roach of \nMorgan Stanley put the risk in concrete terms. He said:\n\n       For a country that is more dependent on foreign capital \n     than any country has ever been in the history of the world--\n     for us to try to dictate the terms on which that capital is \n     provided telling Dubai, for example, you know, ``You can't \n     buy our port facilities but keep on buying our Treasurys;'' \n     and you keep telling China basically the same thing, I really \n     worry about the potentially dangerous path our elected \n     leaders are taking us down.\n\n  The bottom line is simple. These massive increases in debt harm \nAmerica. They are the very definition of irresponsibility.\n  How did we get to this point? The Federal budget deficits drive up \nour debt, and these deficits have been huge during this administration. \nWhen this administration took office we were running large budget \nsurpluses. Do you remember those days, not too many years ago? A $5.6 \ntrillion surplus over the next 10 years was the projection back before \nthe year 2000.\n  In fiscal year 2000, the last year of the previous administration, we \nran a surplus of $236 billion just for that 1 year. We ran a surplus of \n$86 billion even without counting Social Security. By fiscal year 2001, \nthe surplus, counting Social Security, had dropped to\n\n[[Page S2193]]\n\n$128 billion, down from $236 billion in the prior year.\n  Then the tide of red ink began to flow. In fiscal year 2002 the \nGovernment ran a deficit of $158 billion. The following year, fiscal \n2003, the Government ran a budget deficit of $375 billion. That was an \nall-time record just as recently as 2003. Think what happened a few \nyears since. That record lasted just 1 year. The next fiscal year, \n2004, the Government set a new record by running a deficit of $413 \nbillion. The following year, fiscal year 2005, the Government ran a \ndeficit of $319 billion. That was not a record, but it was still larger \nthan the deficits run in any year before this administration took \noffice.\n  In the current year, the deficit will go up again. The administration \npredicts the deficit will rise to $423 billion. This will represent yet \nanother all-time record.\n  The fiscal policy of this administration has been the most \nirresponsible in the Nation's history. This fiscal policy has generated \nhuge budget deficits, and in turn these deficits have contributed to \nmassive increases in Federal debt. We clearly need to change course.\n  Let us, therefore, return to the advice that Thomas Jefferson gave \nus. I repeat:\n\n       It is incumbent on every generation to pay its own debt as \n     it goes.\n\n  Let us return to a fiscal policy that could be defined as \nresponsible.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3131\n\n  Mr. President, I am now going to speak a little bit on an amendment I \nam offering on which we will vote, I suppose, tomorrow. I send that \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3131.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: To require a study of debt held by foreigners)\n\n       At the end of the joint resolution, insert the following:\n       ``Sec. _ STUDY.--(a) The Secretary of the Treasury, in \n     consultation with the Board of Governors of the Federal \n     Reserve System and other appropriate agencies of the United \n     States Government, shall conduct a study to examine the \n     economic effects of the holding of United States' publicly-\n     held debt by foreign governments, foreign central banks, \n     other foreign institutions, and foreign individuals.\n       (b) The Secretary shall transmit that study to the Congress \n     within 180 days of the date of enactment of this legislation.\n       (c) The study shall provide an analysis of:\n       ``(1) for each year from 1980 to the present, the amount \n     and term of foreign-owned debt held by the public, broken \n     down by foreign governments, foreign central banks, other \n     foreign institutions, and foreign individuals, and expressed \n     in nominal terms and as a percentage of the total amount of \n     publicly-held debt in each year;\n       ``(2) the economic effects that the increased foreign \n     ownership of United States' publicly-held debt has on\n       ``(A) long-term interest rates in the United States,\n       ``(B) global average interest rates,\n       ``(C) the value of the United States dollar,\n       ``(D) United States capital market liquidity,\n       ``(E) the cost of private capital in the United States,\n       ``(F) the generation of employment in the United States \n     through foreign affiliates, and\n       ``(G) the growth in real gross domestic product of the \n     United States;\n       ``(3) (A) for each year from 1980 to the present, the \n     effect of foreign debt on the United States income account,\n       ``(B) the predicted effect over the next 20 years, and\n       ``(C) the effect of the deteriorating income account on the \n     overall United States current account deficit;``(4) the \n     ability of the Department of the Treasury to track purchases \n     of publicly held debt in secondary and tertiary markets, or, \n     if this ability does not exist, the implications of that \n     inability for fiscal policy, monetary policy, and the \n     predictability of capital markets;\n       ``(5) the effect that foreign ownership of United States' \n     publicly-held debt has or could have on United States trade \n     policy:\n       ``(6) whether the level of United States debt owned by \n     China may adversely affect the ability of the United States \n     to negotiate with China regarding currency manipulation by \n     China;\n       ``(7) the effect of the increase of foreign holdings of \n     United States debt held by the public on national security; \n     and\n       ``(8) the implicit tax burden that results from foreign \n     ownership of United States debt held by the public, defined \n     as the per capita amount that a United States Federal income \n     taxpayer would pay in annual Federal income taxes to fully \n     service such foreign debt during each of fiscal years 2006 \n     through 2010.''\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment is quite simple. It directs \nthe Treasury Department to study and report on the increase of foreign \nholdings of U.S. debt and what the consequences of that debt are for \nAmerica. We all know that debts can add up. We all know that paying \njust the minimum payment on a credit card balance leads to years of \npayments and a much larger total of payments in the end. Most American \nfamilies know that.\n  As a result, we urge and sometimes require credit card companies and \ncar companies to disclose to customers how long they will be paying \nthose minimum payments. We require them to say how much the full \nbalance will be when the consumer has paid off the loan. It is pretty \nbasic stuff.\n  This amendment is a lot like that. This amendment asks the Treasury \nDepartment to spell out the implications of our debt to foreigners. \nThis amendment asks the Treasury to investigate what the full cost will \nbe in higher interest rates, in the value of a dollar, in lower \neconomic growth, in lessened power to negotiate trade agreements, and \nin diminished national security. We should let taxpayers know--that is \nour employers, the people we work for--how big the payment really is. \nThis amendment will help get the answers.\n  The Treasury is authorized to issue debt totaling a little more than \n$8 trillion. Last year's budget resolution generated an increase of \n$781 billion more, and that has led to the joint resolution before us \ntoday. This will be the fourth largest debt limit increase in our \nNation's history.\n  So the question needs to be asked: Who is loaning us this money? Some \nof it is internal, like borrowing from Social Security. Much of it is \nborrowed from American citizens and businesses. Now there is also an \nespecially worrisome trend, a trend worrisome not only to me and my \nconstituents in the State of Montana but also taxpayers across the \ncountry. That is the amount of U.S. Treasury bonds held by foreigners.\n  Five years ago, foreigners held about $1.1 trillion. Today that \nnumber has doubled to $2.2 trillion. Japan holds about two-thirds of a \ntrillion dollars; China holds a quarter of a trillion dollars. So the \nquestions that inevitably follow are, first, how long can we continue \nto borrow more money? Second, what are the implications to our foreign \npolicy as foreigners increase their holdings of U.S. debt? And, third, \nwhat share of America's taxes are being used just to pay interest on \ndebt?\n  These are some of the issues we should debate today. These are some \nof the issues addressed in my amendment.\n  Every business has limits on the amount it can borrow. Banks say to \nbusinesses: Sorry, this is your loan limit. Financial institutions \nlimit the amount that any individual or family may borrow. Every credit \ncard has a maximum balance.\n  As a business or a family increases its debt, lending institutions \nbegin to monitor the situation. Creditors even increase the interest \nrate charged on the debt.\n  At some point, America will face this economic reality. We cannot \ncontinue to accelerate our borrowing and ignore the consequences of \nincreasing foreign held debt.\n  As one conservative economist put it last year in the National \nReview: ``Growing nervousness in the bond market may be signaling an \nend to the free lunch Americans have enjoyed for the last 3 years, in \nwhich time foreigners have essentially financed our budget deficit.''\n  Indeed, we cannot count on that free lunch forever.\n  So I am offering a simple amendment. It directs the Treasury \nDepartment to coordinate with appropriate Government agencies to study \nand report on the increase of foreign holdings of U.S. debt. The \namendment asks Treasury to study any associated national security \nimplications. The amendment also asks the Treasury Department to assess \nhow this increase in foreign investment of our federal debt affects our \ntrade policy.\n\n[[Page S2194]]\n\n  Do we want to put ourselves in the potentially precarious position of \nengaging in diplomacy with our Nation's creditors? What happens if \nthose foreign central banks and foreign investors suddenly started \nselling their holdings of U.S. securities? Interest rates could rise \ndramatically. A recession could result.\n  I bet that American manufacturers would like to know the answer to \nsome of these questions. Next month, the Treasury Department is \nexpected to rule on whether China is deliberately manipulating its \ncurrency in an effort to gain an unfair trade advantage. American \nbusinesses are awaiting this decision. But they would also like to know \nhow any action on that decision might be affected by the level of our \nforeign debt.\n  Five years ago, foreigners held about $1.1 trillion in U.S. debt. \nToday that number has doubled to $2.2 trillion.\n  Last year, Federal debt held by the public increased by $297 billion. \nAnd the amount of public Federal debt held by foreign investors \nincreased by $286 billion.\n  I have said it before and I will say it again: It is a riveting \nstatistic. Foreign investors financed 96 percent of our Federal debt \nlast year. Almost all of it last year was financed by foreigners--not \nby Americans but by foreigners.\n  We need to understand this change. This study will provide important \ninformation on this topic.\n  The answers to these questions will help us to evaluate foreign \npurchases of American assets. The data thus far is quite startling. \nAccording to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research \nService, in 1995, net foreign investment in America was about 1.2 \npercent of our economic output. In 2005, net foreign investment was \nroughly 6 percent of GDP. That's an increase of 400 percent in just 10 \nyears.\n  And we have just learned that our current account deficit for 2005 \nwas the largest ever: $805 billion. As a percent of the economy, it was \nalso a record, at 6.4 percent.\n  That type of increase reflects the attractiveness of our national \neconomy to foreign investors. But I think that we need to better \nunderstand what this means for our economy and our national security.\n  Both sides of the Capitol, and many of our constituents, have spent a \ngreat deal of time over the last few weeks debating the effect of \npurchases or control of critical American infrastructure assets by \nforeign entities. It is time that we get all the facts out on the \ntable. And this study will surely aid in this effort.\n  And this amendment asks Treasury to evaluate how the increase of \nforeign-held debt affects taxpayers. Last year, Americans paid about \n$85 billion in interest payments on this foreign debt alone. This year, \nin 2006, that amount will likely increase to about $100 billion. And it \nwill increase again in 2007.\n  That is again the amount in interest payments on foreign debt alone, \n$85 billion last year. This year, in 2006, that amount will likely \nincrease to $100 billion. And it will increase again next year in 2007.\n  Since we collect about $2.5 billion a day from income taxes, this \nyear taxpayers will be working and paying taxes for almost 2 months \njust to pay off those interest payments on foreign debt. Think of that. \nLet me say that again.\n  Since we collect about $2.5 billion a day from income taxes, this \nyear taxpayers will be working and paying taxes for almost 2 months \njust to pay off those interest payments on foreign debt. That is not \npaying off the principal. That is just paying the interest. Americans \nwill pay 2 months of taxes to service the debt we owe to foreigners.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment. We \nsimply ask for more information, more disclosure, and more transparency \nrelating to our federal debt. As guardians of the Federal budget, we \nshould not be afraid to confront the facts and deal with them \naccordingly.\n  Consumers should know the full cost of buying that car when they sign \non the dotted line. Well, today, on behalf of the American taxpayer, \nthe Senate is being asked to sign on the dotted line for the borrowing \nthat the Government has done. The American people deserve full \ndisclosure of the consequences.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, nearly 50 years ago I, like the rest of \nthe world, was mesmerized by a small metal sphere, no bigger than a \nbasketball, no heavier than I or most of us.\n  Hurtling through space at the speed of sound--I don't think it was \nfaster than that, it goes about 18,000 miles an hour--this steel ball \nwas Sputnik, the world's first satellite to circle the earth--in 98 \nminutes flat. It was a technological feat of the Soviet Union. Nikita \nKrushchev, the Soviet leader, had been intent on proving the Soviet \nUnion's scientific superiority. He proved it that day in October 1957.\n  News of Sputnik caught Americans off guard. We had been convinced of \nour own superiority, but here was undeniable evidence that others were \nleading the way. And of all people, it was the Soviet Union.\n  Now we could only follow. We had been lulled into a slumber by past \nsuccesses and had awoken to a harsh reality.\n  Other shocking Soviet achievements followed. In 1959, Luna 2 became \nthe first space probe to hit the moon. In 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri \nGagarin became the first person to orbit the Earth.\n  But it was Sputnik that ultimately galvanized our great Nation. We \ncame together to rediscover ourselves as a nation of thinkers, \ninventors, and dreamers. The shock of Sputnik caused us to not lower \nour expectations, but to raise them. Sputnik caused us to not ask less \nof ourselves but to demand more.\n  Four years after Sputnik, President Kennedy summoned the spirit of \nAmerica to banish the ghost of Sputnik. Content to follow no longer, he \nset the highest goal imaginable. He declared:\n\n       We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in \n     this decade and do the other things, not because they are \n     easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve \n     to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, \n     because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, \n     one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to \n     Win . . .\n\n  Eight years later, American astronauts Neil Armstrong, Edwin ``Buzz'' \nAldrin and Michael Collins landed on the Moon. Armstrong became the \nfirst man to walk on the Moon.\n  America never looked back. To this day, America is peerless in space \ntechnology.\n  Today, America faces a challenge no less daunting than the Soviet-\nAmerican space race. We face no rival state. We face no organized \nmilitary menace.\n  Instead, we face a world more integrated, more interdependent, and \nmore intensely competitive than ever in our history. We face an economy \nwith fewer second chances. Smaller margins for error.\n  In this new world, it is our challenge to succeed, and to leave our \nchildren and grandchildren an economy that is better than the one we \ninherited from our parents; an economy not laden with debt but bursting \nwith opportunity; an economy whose workers are increasingly productive, \nand whose finances are prudent; an economy that plants the seeds of \ninnovation and education today, knowing that generations far in the \nfuture will harvest their bounty.\n  Our challenge is to create an economy in which universal health care \ncoverage is its greatest asset, not its heaviest burden.\n  The records it sets will not be for trade and budget deficits, or \ninterest paid to foreign lenders, but for prosperity, productivity and \nprogress.\n  Its workers and companies will look to foreign shores with hope and \nambition, not fear and trepidation.\n  It is an economy where the strong are just and the wealthy are \ngenerous. It is an economy where the weak are secure and the struggling \nare given a hand.\n  This challenge is far greater than that which America faced in 1957. \nTo prevail, we must demand more creativity. We must summon more \nambition. We must harness more resources.\n  Yet we do not have a Sputnik moment that captivates us and calls us \nto\n\n[[Page S2195]]\n\naction. No single moment crystallizes the urgency of action and the \nimperative of success. Today, we are still in August 1957--still \ncomplacent, still sure of our superiority.\n  What will be our ``Sputnik moment?''\n  Will our Sputnik moment come when our trade deficits break \nunimaginable records, and our foreign debt exceeds that of any modern \nindustrial economy?\n  No, that moment has already passed.\n  Will our Sputnik moment come after we neglect our basic research \nprograms for three decades, while our competitors pour funds into \nresearch and development and lure our labs to their shores?\n  No, that moment has already passed.\n  Will our Sputnik moment come when 45 million Americans have no health \ninsurance, while those who are so lucky must pay more to receive less?\n  No, that moment too has come to pass.\n  Perhaps our Sputnik moment will come when China becomes the world's \nlargest economy. That may be just 10 or 20 years away.\n  Perhaps our Sputnik moment will come when our foreign debt reaches \nsuch levels that each year, 2 percent of our Nation's income will go to \npaying interest on these loans. That may be fewer than 5 years away.\n  Let us not wait for our generation's Sputnik. Let us awaken from our \ncomplacency before we are shaken from it.\n  We must not act out of fear. But we must not fear to act.\n  Most of all, we must act as a nation for the good of the entire \nNation. As President Kennedy said of his vision 40 years ago: ``In a \nvery real sense, it will not be one man going to the moon . . . it will \nbe an entire nation. For all of us must work to put him there . . .''\n  We must all work to improve our Nation's competitiveness, and I am \nworking to do my part at every opportunity.\n  This week, I will introduce a number of amendments to the budget \nresolution that strengthen our economy at its very foundation and steel \nits every pillar.\n  These amendments will strengthen our ability to educate our children, \nso that they may enter the workforce filled with confidence and \ninnovative ideas.\n  These amendments will foster innovative energy research that will \nmake our children's world cleaner, safer, and more secure.\n  These amendments will restore our commitment to basic research and \ndevelopment, a commitment that has served us well in the past and will \nserve us well in the future.\n  These amendments will embrace technology to expand our access to \nquality healthcare, while making it more affordable, efficient, and \naccurate.\n  These amendments will help grow our nation's pool of savings, which \ncan foster investment. Investment that makes our economy more \nproductive and innovative.\n  Taken together, I hope that these amendments will create an economy \nthat moves our Nation forward, and makes sure that no one is left \nbehind.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting them. I think they \nare very important. I think they are critical and, frankly, I think if \nwe don't pass these and similar amendments, we are passing on to our \nchildren and grandchildren an immense disservice.\n  I thank the Chair for listening.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I cannot help but make a few comments on \nthe speech we just heard, noting the fact that over $500 billion in new \nspending was offered, of which over half was voted for by the ranking \nmember on the Committee on Finance last year--new spending unpaid for--\nand has the audacity to talk about the President getting us into this \nfix.\n  I mentioned earlier, this Senate and the House, the Congress, got us \ninto this fix. The bills start in the House, they come to the Senate, \nand the irresponsible spending that has gone on has been a compilation \nof many factors. But most of it rests upon the Members of the Senate \nwho refuse to make the hard choices in terms of spending.\n  I also note during last year's appropriations cycle, I offered \namendments that were called sunshine amendments to make sure we knew \nwhat was in the bills we were voting on. I also note that the ranking \nmember voted against those both times they were offered.\n  It is disingenuous to claim lack of responsibility. It is all of our \nresponsibility. The Nation does not want to hear Congress pointing \nfingers. They want a solution to the problem. That solution comes \nthrough by restraining the discretionary accounts, rather than offering \nanother $200 billion or $300 billion this year of new spending that is \nunpaid for. It also comes through working the hard issues of changing \nthe entitlement programs of Medicare, Medicaid, and reforming Social \nSecurity, like the President of this body has led on in the past.\n  The record should be clear that actions speak much louder than words. \nThe actions of the ranking member of the Committee on Finance do not \nmatch up to the words that were just spoken. The responsibility lies on \nall. All are guilty of not doing what is in the best long-term \ninterests of this country. That is what has to change.\n  We can play the political games. We can point fingers. But the fact \nis, I take responsibility for that, and every other Member of that \nSenate who has been here since 2001 should, September 11, 2001, when \nthe economy failed, went through the tank. Since then we have been \ntrying to build back this economy.\n  Quite frankly, the economy is in the greatest shape it has ever been \nin, in terms of growth, productivity, jobs. What we do need to address \nand will address in the future is changing health care overall so \npeople can have access to affordable health care.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on March 15, West Virginia State University \nwill dedicate its new research institute in honor of the commissioner \nof the West Virginia Department of Agriculture, the legendary Mr. Gus \nR. Douglass. This is a wonderful and fitting tribute to a great West \nVirginian and outstanding public servant.\n  Commissioner Douglass has served now 10 terms in his position, the \nlongest reigning agriculture commissioner in the history of West \nVirginia, and, indeed, in the entire Nation. During his tenure, he has \nalways demonstrated a sincere commitment to the farmers and to the \npeople of West Virginia. His long and admirable record includes his \nsupport of programs designed to maintain family farms and new farming \ntechnologies and efforts to preserve a way of life that has become all \ntoo uncommon in our country. His work on behalf of our State's farmers \nhas helped to improve the lives of all West Virginians.\n  In his remarkable career, Commissioner Douglas has brought national \nrecognition to West Virginia. He has served as the national president \nof Future Farmers of America, the first president of the national FFA \nAlumni Association, the president of the National Association of State \nDepartments of Agriculture, and chairman of the Southern Regional \nCommittee for Food and Agriculture, as well as numerous other \npositions.\n  Meanwhile, Gus and his lovely wife, Anna Lee, have maintained their \nown family farm at Grimm's Landing in Mason County, WV. Along with \ntheir four children, and their families, they have done their part to \ncontinue the tradition upon which this great Nation was founded.\n  The Gus R. Douglass Institute at West Virginia State University will \nbe a lasting legacy to the outstanding and unwavering commitment of \nCommissioner Douglass to public service. I thank West Virginia State \nUniversity for bestowing this honor upon him.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter which I wrote to\n\n[[Page S2196]]\n\nCommissioner Douglass congratulating him on this well deserved \nrecognition be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             United States Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 2006.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, today the first female chief executive from \nAfrica addressed a joint session of Congress. In order to commemorate \nthis historic event, I rise to recognize Women's History Month. March \nis a time to celebrate the women who have played a pivotal role in \nAmerica's history. Women have always played a crucial role in building \nthe great history of this country, and the women of my home State, \nNevada, are no different.\n  One who comes to mind is Sarah Winnemucca, an influential native \nwoman whom we honored last year by making her the second of Nevada's \nstatues in Congress. Born to a Paiute chief's family around 1844, Sarah \nwas unusually driven to bridge the gulf between Native Americans and \nCaucasian settlers. Dedicated to helping her people, Sarah used her \ntalents as an English translator, public speaker, negotiator, and \neducator.\n  Women's History Month is a wonderful opportunity to reflect on the \naccomplishments and contributions of famous women like Sarah, but there \nare many untold stories of women just like her whose names we don't \nknow and whose lives have made America a place of strength, freedom, \nand hope. Their stories are echoed in the contributions that women \nacross the country make every day, whether at home, in the community, \nin the workplace, or on the battlefield. More than just to paying them \ntribute, I am committed to honoring them by fighting for a more just, \nprosperous, and worthy nation.\n  For the women colleagues, business leaders, and entrepreneurs who \nmake our economy run, America can do better to ensure fair pay and \nexpand economic opportunity. They give their best, but even in 2006, \nwomen who work full time year round still earn only 76 cents for every \n$1 their male counterparts earn. I pledge that we will continue \nfighting to end this unfair pay gap, to increase the minimum wage, and \nto create more opportunities for all our families.\n  Finally, I salute the more than 200,000 women who are serving in \nactive duty in the military, helping to defend and protect our Nation. \nI pledge to them that Democrats will continue fighting to provide our \ntroops and their families, Active Duty and Reserve, with all the \nresources they need to protect our freedom. And when they return home, \nwe will ensure that all veterans have access to the health care they \nneed and never have to choose between retirement and a disability \ncheck.\n  At the end of the day, these brave women are protecting America, \nincluding community, integrity, freedom, and justice, for everyone. \nThese principles represent not just the foundation of our great Nation \nbut also the same values that bind us as Americans. This month, let us \nrecognize the women all across this country--the mothers, the \ndaughters, the coworkers, and the soldiers--who make these cherished \nideals an intrinsic and enduring part of the American dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/15/senate-section/article/S2196-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2196-S2199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          SIMPLIFICATION THROUGH ADDITIONAL REPORTING TAX ACT\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced legislation, entitled \nthe Simplification Through Additional Reporting Tax, START, Act of \n2006, that will require brokerage houses and mutual fund companies to \ntrack and report cost basis information to their customers and the IRS. \nThe legislation is cosponsored by Senators Obama, Carper, Kerry, and \nLevin and is based upon a recommendation made by the National Taxpayer \nAdvocate, the organization created as part of the 1998 IRS \nRestructuring and Reform Act whose explicit purpose is to make \nrecommendations to Congress to simplify the tax code.\n  Over 130 million Americans are now struggling with the difficult job \nof filling out their taxes and 32 million taxpayers will likely have to \nreport a capital gain or loss. For taxpayers all across the country \nthat are angry and frustrated with the tax code, the START Act will \nhopefully provide some measure of relief and, at the same time, help \nclose what is called the ``Tax Gap.''\n  The Federal Government now fails to collect close to $350 billion in \ntaxes that are legally owed. This is called the tax gap, an amount that \nexceeds last year's $318 billion deficit, or this year's projected \ndeficit of $336 billion. The National Taxpayer Advocate has observed \nthat if we eliminated the tax gap, we could cut taxes for every \nAmerican by $2,000. This would only be true, of course, if we ran a \nsurplus. Because we are running a deficit, and will likely be doing so \nfor the foreseeable future, the tax gap is really a $2,000 tax increase \non our children and grandchildren, with interest building every year. \nThis is a moral failure that needs to be addressed.\n  Unfortunately, while there has been a lot of discussion about this \nissue in the halls of Congress and within the administration, there has \nbeen little action. In the last two years, there have been six \ncongressional hearings on this issue. The Internal Revenue Service \nCommissioner Mark Everson has said that this issue is a top priority \nand that over a period of time the government could collect between $50 \nand $100 billion of the tax gap ``without changing the dynamic between \nthe IRS and the [American] people.'' However, in their latest budget, \nthe Bush Administration has introduced proposals that only attempt to \nclose $259 million of the tax gap in fiscal year 2007, or approximately \none-tenth of 1 percent of the tax gap as measured in 2001. This is a \nfailure of leadership. More can be done.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today does not eliminate the \ntax gap, but it does address a significant part of the problem. \nSpecifically, the START Act of 2006 addresses the portion of the tax \ngap related to capital gains. This part of the tax gap results from the \nunderreporting of capital income, and can include income related to the \nsale of stocks, bonds, real estate, and a myriad of other investments. \nAccording to the IRS, the revenue loss from the underreporting of \ncapital income is $11 billion annually. It is important to understand \nthat this figure is based on 2001 data. Since 2001, the amount of \nrevenue collected through capital gains taxes has increased by $190 \nbillion, from $349 billion in 2001 to $539 billion in 2005. If one \nmakes the reasonable assumption that the misreporting percentage has \nstayed stable during this period, the $11 billion problem in 2001 is \nnow a whopping $17 billion problem in 2005. Over 10 years, assuming no \ngrowth in capital gains realizations, this potentially represents $170 \nbillion in revenue that the Federal Government is failing to collect.\n  The START Act is intended to accomplish three goals: first, reduce \nthe deficit by closing a portion of the tax gap; second, simplify the \ntax-filing process for the millions of Americans who pay capital gains \ntaxes; and, third, make the tax code fairer.\n\n[[Page S2197]]\n\n  The first goal of this legislation is to reduce the deficit. We not \nonly have a moral responsibility to our children and grandchildren to \nbegin seriously addressing our growing deficit and debt, we also need \nto do so to protect our vital trade and national security interests. \nThe total public debt now stands at $8.2 trillion, or $27,728 for each \nman, woman, and child living in America. This week, the Senate will \nlikely vote again to raise the public debt limit, this time to $9 \ntrillion. By 2011, the debt will have reached $11.8 trillion. In the \nlast three years alone, we will have increased the debt limit by $3 \ntrillion, a 40-percent increase from when President Bush took office in \nJanuary 2001.\n  While we are mortgaging our country, it is important to ask to whom \ndo we owe all of this money. Increasingly, the answer is foreigners, \nand this development represents an economic and security threat to our \ncountry. In December 2005, an estimated $2.2 trillion of the publicly \nheld debt was owned by foreign creditors, such as the Chinese and \nJapanese. It took 42 Presidents 224 years to run up a trillion dollars \nof debt held by foreigners. This President has more than doubled that \namount in just five years. This has weakened our country. Why? Because \nwhen the value of the U.S. dollar plunges at the mere suggestion by a \nJapanese or Chinese central banker that they will sell their holdings \nin U.S. dollars, it signals that we no longer control our economic \ndestiny. This level of dependency affects our ability to bargain from a \nposition of strength on national security issues with foreign \ncountries. It is worth remembering that there has never been a country \nthat is militarily strong, but financially weak, yet that is the path \nthat we are on today.\n  Vice President Dick Cheney famously said that ``deficits don't \nmatter.'' Well, they do, as almost all economists will tell you. And \nthe reason they matter is that when we borrow, we prevent both the \nprivate sector and the public sector from being able to invest in our \ncountry's and our children's future. Our children are now part of a \nglobal economy, and are competing against children in Japan, India, and \nChina for the jobs of the future. If we fail to invest in their future \nbecause instead we are paying off our debts, we will become the first \ngeneration to leave a country that is worse off than the one that we \ninherited.\n  While the START Act of 2006 will not balance the budget, it does \nrepresent a step in the right direction. The impact of START has not \nyet been scored by the Joint Tax Committee, so the impact on the \ndeficit is not known. Nevertheless, the capital gains tax gap is now \n$17 billion per year. My proposal might not close the entire gap, but I \nexpect that it will make a very meaningful down payment on the problem.\n  The second goal of my legislation is to simplify the tax-filing \nprocess and help American taxpayers spend less time filling out their \ntaxes. It is no secret that the Tax Code is overly complex. It now has \nover 17,000 pages and contains almost four times as many words as the \nBible. The IRS now prints over 1,000 publications. Americans now spend \n5.8 billion hours and $194 billion every year to complete their tax \nforms. According to the National Taxpayers Union, the number of \ntaxpayers using paid professionals has soared by approximately 60 \npercent since 1980 and by nearly 30 percent since 1990. Reflective of \nthis complexity is the fact that one of the leading tax preparation \nfirms, H+R Block, was in the news recently because it could not \naccurately do its own corporate tax return.\n  One of the most complex areas of the tax code is Schedule D, the form \nthat taxpayers must fill out when they report their capital gains and \nlosses. For the average taxpayer, simply filling out this one schedule \nadds 7 hours to the tax return filing process almost a full work day. \nAnd, for taxpayers using return preparers to complete this form, it can \nadd significantly to their costs.\n\n  Computing a capital gain or loss would seem, on its face, easy \nenough. You need to know the original purchase price and the final \nsales amount. Taking the difference between the two should determine \nthe amount of gain or loss. Taxpayers do have the final piece of the \npuzzle--the sale price, as brokerage houses and mutual funds now report \nthis information, called ``gross proceeds,'' to their customers and the \nIRS on Form 1099B. But what taxpayers are not told, and what is \nextremely difficult to calculate, is what is called the ``adjusted cost \nbasis'' in their investment. This is a technical term for the original \nprice of the investment, plus any necessary adjustments.\n  Taxpayers face enormous challenges in trying to determine the \nadjusted basis of the securities they have held for many years. The \nfirst challenge is simply a matter of recordkeeping. Brokers usually \nsend an investor a certificate of ownership stating the original \npurchase price of the asset. But stocks or bonds or mutual funds can be \nheld for long periods of time, and many taxpayers lose this information \nand thus are left without any record of what they paid for the \ninvestment. The second challenge is a more serious one and stems from \nthe fact that a taxpayer's capital gain or loss is not always simply \nthe difference between the purchase price and sale price. Taxpayers \nmust often adjust the tax basis they have in their investments due to \ncertain events that take place during their ownership of the security. \nFor example, if a company's stock splits, the tax basis in that stock \nmust be cut in half; alternatively, if there is a reverse stock split, \nthe tax basis in that stock must be doubled. Consider, too, that if you \nreinvest capital gains or dividends in the same investment, you \nlikewise have to adjust your basis. Determining the adjusted basis can \nbe a very complex undertaking and, under current law, sole \nresponsibility for this calculation falls on the taxpayer.\n  The START Act would eliminate both of these challenges. By requiring \nbrokerage houses and mutual funds to track and report taxpayer's \nadjusted basis information, countless hours or days of frustration \nwould be eliminated for the 32 million taxpayers who pay capital gains \ntaxes. More importantly, these taxpayers would have confidence that the \namount that they are paying in capital gains taxes is the correct \namount. Information returns of this sort will provide taxpayer's with \naccurate information about their investments that they simply can plug \ninto their tax returns. No more trips into the attic to rifle through \nold boxes. No more having to sit down and try to calculate the impact \nof ten stock splits and reorganizations on your shares of IBM or AT+T \nstock.\n  In addition to reducing the deficit and making the tax-filing process \nsimpler, the START Act will also make the tax code fairer. Presently, \nthe tax code discriminates against middle-class Americans who earn the \noverwhelming majority of their income in the form of wages. The reason \nis that middle-class Americans cannot underpay their taxes because \ntheir employers submit wage information reports, called W-2 forms, to \nthe IRS. If a factory worker in Indiana wants to underpay his taxes, \nthe IRS will know about it since his employer sent the amount that he \nearned in wages to the IRS.\n  By contrast, taxpayers that rely on capital gains for their income, \nhowever, are accountable to only themselves. Under current law, the IRS \nlacks the ability to monitor the accuracy of taxpayer's calculations \nsince initial purchases are not reported to the IRS. This provides \ndishonest taxpayers with an opportunity to inflate the tax basis they \nhave in their investments, thereby underpaying their capital gains \ntaxes. Taxpayers that have capital gains income are thus on the honor \nsystem to report accurately. While that may work for the Boy Scouts, it \ndoesn't work when it comes to paying taxes. Now many capital gains \ntaxpayers are honest, but some are not. And if the dishonest ones want \nto do some Enron accounting, there is virtually no way that the IRS can \ndetect it.\n  The START Act addresses this inequity between wage and capital income \nearners by putting them on a level playing field. By requiring that \nadjusted cost basis information be reported to the IRS, every taxpayer \nthat has a capital gain will be treated in the exact same way that \nevery wage earner is treated. If we want everyone to play by the rules, \nthen everyone should be held to the same level of accountability. \nMoreover, if we want Americans to believe that their tax system is \nfair, then we need to make sure that they believe that the person next \ndoor is actually paying their fair share in\n\n[[Page S2198]]\n\ntaxes. Third party information returns that allow the IRS to determine \nif someone is paying their taxes accurately are critical to ensure \ntaxpayers comply with the law and that everyone is paying their fair \nshare in taxes. The IRS uses this type of information return for wages, \ndividends, and interest income, and in these areas, the amount of non-\ncompliance is negligible. Why should we not hold capital gains income \nto the same standard?\n  To accomplish the three goals that I have discussed, my bill requires \nbrokerage houses and mutual funds to track and report their customer's \nadjusted basis and provide this information to their customers and the \nIRS. The reporting requirement would only apply prospectively to \nsecurities acquired after the effective date. This would prevent \ncompanies from having to undertake costly and time-consuming efforts to \ndetermine basis information for assets that could be decades old.\n  The START Act applies to stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. For other \ntypes of securities, the bill grants authority to the Treasury \nSecretary to determine if the reporting requirement should apply more \nbroadly. Financial instruments, such as derivatives, swaps, and options \nare not covered in the bill, but the Treasury Secretary may decide to \ninclude or exclude them when implementing the legislation.\n  The START Act candidly acknowledges that there will be cases where it \nwill be difficult or impossible for companies to provide accurate basis \ninformation. In these cases, such as gifts, bequests, and specialized \ncases where unique basis adjustment rules come into play like wash sale \nrules, the legislation grants the Treasury Secretary the authority to \nrequire brokerage houses and mutual funds to provide other information \nthat will allow the IRS to understand why basis information is not \nbeing provided. For example, in the case of a gift where the adjusted \nbasis is unknown, a brokerage house could in lieu of supplying the \nadjusted basis figure, simply denote instead a ``G'' on the information \nreturn issued to the taxpayer and the IRS.\n  The START Act also provides authority to the Treasury Secretary to \nissue regulations that will facilitate the transfer of cost basis \ninformation when investors move assets from one brokerage house, or \nmutual fund, to another. A significant amount of basis information is \ncurrently lost when individuals move their financial accounts from firm \nto firm and the original purchase price information is not transferred \nto the new broker.\n  Finally, the START Act requires companies to begin tracking adjusted \nbasis information during the 2008 tax year and taxpayers will receive \ntheir first reports by January 31, 2009. This will give companies close \nto 2 years, more than ample time, to put the processes and systems in \nplace to comply with this new regulation. Moreover, it will give \nimpacted companies close to 3 years before they have to issue their \nfirst information report.\n  Any proposal that imposes a new reporting requirement will have its \ncritics and I am sure this proposal will attract its fair share of \nattention from some in the securities industry that don't like this \nidea. I would simply ask these potential critics read the bill before \nthey pass judgment on the idea. I have tried to take a balanced \napproach and have sought input from a wide-range of experts and \naffected parties. Specifically, I have tried to balance the need to \nimprove tax compliance with the goal of not placing an undue burden on \nindustry. Specifically, by making the legislation prospective and \nproviding three years of lead time before the industry must issue their \nfirst information report, I believe this legislation will present \nminimal burdens for industry.\n\n  In drafting this legislation, I have shared this legislation widely \nwith industry, government officials, academics, and other tax \nprofessionals in order to craft the best bill possible. I have received \ninput from the Securities Industry Association of America, the \nInvestment Company Institute, the American Institute of Certified \nPublic Accountants, and the National Association of Enrolled Agents. I \nhave also reached out to small brokerage firms and mutual funds in \nIndiana to hear their perspective. In addition, the Government \nAccountability Office, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Joint Tax \nCommittee have been consulted for their expertise on this legislation. \nDuring these consultations, I have not heard any explicit criticism of \nthe proposal, but have received many helpful suggestions on ways to \nmake this legislation both balanced and fair to companies and \ntaxpayers. However, I do expect that there could be some philosophical \nand technical issues that are raised with the bill, so I want to take a \nmoment to highlight those and respond to them immediately.\n  First, this proposal does not raise capital gains tax rates. For \nthose that are legally paying the right amount in capital gains taxes, \nthey won't pay one penny more in taxes. This proposal only ensures that \npeople pay what they legally owe. And, moreover, what is happening \ntoday is that our failure to collect the taxes that are legally owed is \neffectively imposing a tax increase on our children and grandchildren \nwho will have to pick up the tab for our fiscal failure to merely \nenforce the laws on the books. For this reason, I would argue that if \nmy bill is enacted it would represent a tax cut for our children and \ngrandchildren who will pay higher taxes if this problem is not \naddressed.\n  Some may look at this proposal and dismiss it as antibusiness and \njust another government regulation. I am sure there were some that had \nsimilar concerns when it was first proposed that all U.S. employers \nshould report wages to the IRS. Now, however, we know that this \nreporting requirement is a cornerstone of ensuring tax compliance. \nMoreover, the reporting requirement does not elicit any protests from \nemployers because they realize that without it, the U.S Treasury would \nlose billions in legally owed taxes. As I have said before, the honor \nsystem may work for the Boy Scouts, but it is not a great way to \ncollect taxes. Finally, no business would be able to succeed if every \nyear it failed to collect $17 billion per year in sales. In fact, any \nresponsible company would move heaven and earth to address such a \nproblem. U.S. taxpayers deserve the same level of accountability.\n  Some brokerage houses or mutual funds may argue that companies cannot \nprovide this information because, in some cases, the correct \ninformation doesn't exist. This argument does not square with the fact \nthat there are plenty of examples of companies that already provide \ncost basis information to their clients. If Fidelity or Ameritrade or \nE*Trade can provide cost basis information to all of their clients, it \nclearly suggests that the information can be provided.\n  Some may argue that this proposal will be costly to implement, even \nif it is a prospective proposal, because they don't have the systems in \nplace to track and report cost basis. I would invite them to go talk to \ncompanies that have already decided to offer basis-tracking for their \nclients, and ask them how much it cost to offer this service. I would \nalso ask them to talk to the software vendors and companies that \nprovide basis tracking services to brokerage house and mutual funds. \nWhat they will tell you is that the cost is reasonable. According to a \nleading company that provides basis tracking services to brokerage \nfirms and mutual fund companies, it typically charges on an annual \nbasis approximately $1 per account. For a company with 10,000 accounts, \nthat is a yearly charge of $10,000, a small figure when you look at the \nrevenues of a brokerage firm of this size.\n  Some may point out that there are some types of transactions or \nsecurities where a brokerage firm or mutual fund cannot reasonably be \nexpected to provide accurate cost basis information. My bill candidly \nacknowledges this fact. In these cases, brokerage houses and mutual \nfunds will simply be required to provide ``other information'' that \nwill allow their customers and the IRS to understand why adjusted cost \nbasis information could not be provided. This is already standard \npractice for many companies that provide cost basis information to \ntheir customers.\n  In conclusion, this should be an issue that honorable members from \nboth sides of the aisle can agree needs to be addressed. Democrats and \nRepublicans will fight endlessly about what tax rates should be, but I \nbelieve all Members should agree on the principle that\n\n[[Page S2199]]\n\nall taxpayers should pay what you owe. We should also all agree that we \nneed to reduce our deficit, simplify the tax-filing process, and \npromote a fair and equitable tax system. The START Act of 2006 is \nintended to make progress on all of these goals. I hope it can start a \ncivil conversation about ways to improve our tax system. I look forward \nto working with all interested parties to craft a workable proposal \nthat provides some needed relief to our overburdened taxpayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/15/senate-section/article/S2199-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I recognize the 185th anniversary of \nGreek independence, which will be celebrated on Saturday, March 25.\n  As the Greek philosopher Plato said ``The beginning is the most \nimportant part of the work.'' After centuries of unsuccessful uprisings \nand failure of the Ottoman Empire to assimilate and convert the Greeks, \nthe War of Independence began on this day, March 25 in 1821. This was \nthe beginning of the end of 400 years of occupation and oppression by \nthe Ottoman Turks. During the dark years of the Ottoman occupation, \nthousands were killed and tortured for participating in religious \nactivities or teaching their children culture, history, and language. \nThe steadfast resolve displayed by the Greeks helped secure their \nindependence and recognition as a sovereign power nearly 11 years later \nwith the signing of the Treaty of Constantinople.\n  This struggle for Greek independence was recognized the world over \nand was supported abroad by prominent world figures including Lord \nByron of England, and Daniel Webster and Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe of the \nUnited States.\n  As we fight today's Long War on Terror, the Greeks stand by our side. \nA highlight of the Greek military's continuing contributions to the \nInternational Coalition was the deployment of the 229th Mobile Field \nSurgical Hospital deployed to Afghanistan. At full operational status \nwithin 3 days, medical experts and officials believe the 229th is one \nof the best medical facilities that has ever operated in Afghanistan.\n  A Greek proverb says, ``Success isn't how far you got, but the \ndistance you traveled from where you started.'' Still alive and well in \nour own society today are the principles and ideas of ancient Greece. \nWhen we commemorate the heroism exhibited by the Greeks, we cannot help \nbut to think of our Founding Fathers. Then and now, Greece and the \nUnited States share an absolute commitment to democracy, justice, and \nfreedom. In history the Greeks have inspired, and in the present they \nhave enlivened our great Nation. It gives me great pleasure and pride \nto cosponsor the Senate Resolution 399 designating March 25, 2006, as \nGreek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and \nAmerican Democracy. I send all Greek-Americans in Rhode Island and \naround the country my best wishes as they celebrate their ancestral \nhomeland's independence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/15/senate-section/article/S2199-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2199-S2200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SUNSHINE WEEK 2006\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we take stock during the second annual \nSunshine Week, we confront the disturbing reality that the foundations \nof our open government are under direct assault from the first White \nHouse in modern times that is openly hostile to the public's right to \nknow.\n  The right to know is a cornerstone of our democracy. Without it, \ncitizens are kept in the dark about key policy decisions that directly \naffect their lives. Without open government, citizens cannot make \ninformed choices at the ballot box. Without access to public documents \nand a vibrant free press, officials can make decisions in the shadows, \noften in collusion with special interests, escaping accountability for \ntheir actions. And once eroded, these rights are hard to win back.\n  The right to know is nourished by openness and vigorous congressional \noversight of Federal agencies, but both are sorely lacking, and \ngovernment effectiveness and accountability have been among the \ncasualties. The disastrous failure to prepare for and respond to \nHurricane Katrina is only the most recent example, but a glaring one. \nDespite misleading assertions in the storm's horrific aftermath, we now \nknow that the White House was warned in advance that the levees could \nfail in a hurricane. We have belatedly seen videotapes in which \nPresident Bush was cautioned by FEMA officials of this great danger.\n  The Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, empowers the American people to \npry information from their Government that agencies would prefer to \nkeep locked away. Americans learned more about Abu Ghraib and \nconditions at Guantanamo from FOIA requests than from oversight by \nCongress.\n  As we celebrate FOIA's fourth decade as law, we also watch its \nerosion as a target of attacks such as when the administration pushed \nan overly broad FOIA waiver for the Department of Homeland Security's \ncharter the single biggest rollback of FOIA in its 40-year history.\n  It has been nearly a decade since Congress has approved major reforms \nto the Freedom of Information Act. Last year during Sunshine Week, \nSenator Cornyn and I introduced bipartisan legislation, S.394, to \ncurtail the assault on FOIA. The Open Government Act contains more than \na dozen substantive provisions, designed to strengthen FOIA and close \nloopholes, to help FOIA requestors obtain timely responses to their \nrequests, to ensure that agencies have strong incentives to act on FOIA \nrequests, and to provide FOIA officials with all of the tools they need \nto make sure that our government remains open and accessible.\n  A second bill that I introduced with Senator Cornyn last year, the \nFaster FOIA Act, S.589, would specifically address the issue of agency \ndelay in processing FOIA requests. We propose to establish a commission \nto review the persistent issue of delay and to make recommendations for \nreducing impediments to the efficient processing of requests. This bill \nwas reported by the Judiciary Committee and awaits floor action.\n  Our free press and the consciences of whistleblowers also serve the \npublic's right to know. We would not know of the domestic spying \nprogram conducted in secret by the National Security Agency, with the \nfull approval of the White House, unless the press had revealed it last \nDecember. The Department of Justice is stonewalling Congress's efforts \nto obtain facts on this program while threatening to prosecute \nreporters who disclosed the illegal program to the public.\n  The Bush administration has kept vital facts secret by silencing \nscientists and experts. We saw it with the gagging of NASA scientist \nJames Hansen, whose conclusions about the dangers of greenhouse gas \nemissions and global warming differed with administration policy. This \nadministration also secretly let lobbyists from polluting industries \nwrite rules on mercury emissions, overriding the advice of the EPA's \nscientists and even drawing a harsh rebuke from EPA's inspector \ngeneral. This tacit war on science--trumping scientific evidence with \nideology--has also victimized women's access to the Plan B pill and cut \ninternational family planning funds which help the poorest of the poor, \neven though the evidence is clear that these funds reduce the numbers \nof abortions.\n  This kind of secrecy produces bad policies, as we saw when the Bush \nadministration tried to hide the true cost of its Medicare prescription \ndrug plan from Congress and the American people. While they were \ntwisting congressional arms for votes on the program, political leaders \nat Medicare told Congress the price tag was $400 billion. Medicare's \nown accountants projected the cost to be $500 billion to $600 billion, \nbut one of those career staff, Richard Foster, was threatened with \nbeing fired if he told Congress the truth.\n  We saw it again when the political leadership of the Justice \nDepartment overruled career lawyers who found that Congressman Tom \nDeLay's Texas redistricting plan illegally diluted Black and Hispanic \nvoting power. Career attorneys also found that a Georgia voter-\nidentification law would discriminate against Black voters. The \nDepartment's political leaders dismissed these findings and quietly \napproved both plans. We only learned of these politically motivated \ndecisions later when the press obtained documents and made them public.\n  In a situation that borders on the absurd, the intelligence agencies \nhave\n\n[[Page S2200]]\n\nbeen quietly reclassifying documents that were open for years. This \nprogram began in 1999 but has exploded under this administration, which \nhas reclassified more than 55,000 pages. Even the Archivist of the \nUnited States said he knew ``precious little'' of the program until it \nwas revealed by the press.\n  The examples go on and on. The Bush administration has displayed a \nnear-total disdain for the free press and the public's right to know.\n  Sunshine Week invites an inventory check on tools like the Freedom of \nInformation Act that make real the public's right to know. Attacks on \nthese tools only erode that right. A free, open, and accountable \ndemocracy is what our forefathers fought and died for, and it is the \nduty of each new generation to protect this vital heritage and \ninheritance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/15/senate-section/article/S2200-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          EXPRESSION OF SYMPATHY FOR KALOKO RESERVOIR VICTIMS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of \nRobert Maxcy of Waldoboro, ME, who passed away this weekend at the age \nof 76. Bob served 56 years in the Waldoboro Fire Department, including \nthe last 42 years as its chief, and I would like to recognize his \nlifelong devotion to public safety.\n  Chief Bob Maxcy was born on November 17, 1929, in Thomaston, ME, the \nson of the late Earl and Ruth Maxcy. At age 14 he began his service as \na firefighter at the Thomaston Junior Fire Department. This was the \nbeginning of his outstanding career in service to both Maine and the \nNation.\n  Upon his graduation from Thomaston High School, Chief Maxcy served \nhonorably with the U.S. Air Force from 1947 to 1950. During his \nservice, Chief Maxcy attained the rank of gunnery sergeant.\n  When he returned to Maine in 1950, Chief Maxcy became a firefighter \nwith the Waldoboro Fire Department. In that same year, he married his \nloving and devoted wife, Muriel. By 1964, Chief Maxcy had established \nhimself as a leader in the department and was appointed chief of the \nWaldoboro Fire Department, a position in which he served for 42 years.\n  Beyond his dedication to his department, Chief Maxcy also was a \nleader in the community and the State, as evidenced through his \nparticipation in the Waldoboro Firemen's Association, Knox County \nFiremen's Association, Maine State Federation of Firefighters, and the \nLincoln County Fire Chiefs.\n  Chief Maxcy was truly an honorable Maine man.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to increase \nburial benefits for veterans: and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Veterans Burial \nBenefits Improvement Act.\n  We must honor our U.S. soldiers who died in the name of their \ncountry. These service men and women are America's true heroes and on \nthis day we pay tribute to their courage and sacrifice. Some have given \ntheir lives for our country. All have given their time and dedication \nto ensure our country remains the land of the free and the home of the \nbrave. We owe a special debt of gratitude to each and every one of \nthem.\n  Our Nation has a sacred commitment to honor the promises made to \nsoldiers when they signed up to serve our country. As a member of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, I fight hard each year to make sure \npromises made to our service men and women are promises kept. These \npromises include access to quality, affordable health care and a proper \nburial for our veterans.\n  I am deeply concerned that burial benefits for the families of our \nwounded or disabled veterans have not kept up with inflation and rising \nfuneral costs. We are losing over 1,000 World War II veterans each day, \nbut Congress has failed to increase veterans' burial benefits to keep \nup with rising costs and inflation. While these benefits were never \nintended to cover the full costs of burial, they now pay for only a \nfraction of what they covered in 1973, when the Federal Government \nfirst started paying burial benefits for our veterans.\n  I want to thank my colleagues on the Veterans Affairs Committee for \nworking with me in the 107th Congress. Together, we were able to \nincrease modestly the service-connected benefit from $1,500 to $2,000, \nand the plot allowance from $150 to $300. While I believe these \nincreases are a step in the right direction, they are not a substitute \nfor the amounts included in my bill.\n  That is why I am again introducing the Veterans Burial Benefits \nImprovement Act. This bill will increase burial benefits to cover the \nsame percentage of funeral costs as they did in 1973. It will also \nprovide for these benefits to be increased annually to keep up with \ninflation.\n  In 1973, the service-connected benefit paid for 72 percent of \nveterans' funeral costs. Today, this benefit covers just 39 percent of \nfuneral costs. My bill will increase the service-connected benefit from \n$2,000 to $3,713, bringing it back up to the original 72 percent level.\n  In 1973, the non-service connected benefit paid for 22 percent of \nfuneral costs. It has not been increased since 1978, and today it \ncovers just 6 percent of funeral costs. My bill will increase the non-\nservice connected benefit from $300 to $1,135, bringing it back up to \nthe original 22 percent level.\n  In 1973, the plot allowance paid for 13 percent of veterans' funeral \ncosts. Yet it now covers just 3 percent of funeral costs. My bill will \nincrease the plot allowance from $300 to $670, bringing it back up to \nthe original 13 percent level.\n\n  Finally, the Veterans Burial Benefits Improvement Act will also \nensure that these burial benefits are adjusted for inflation annually, \nso veterans will not have to fight this fight again.\n  This legislation is just one way to honor our Nation's service men \nand women. I want to thank the millions of veterans, Marylanders, and \npeople across the Nation for their patriotism, devotion, and commitment \nto honoring the true meaning of Memorial Day. U.S. soldiers from every \ngeneration have shared in the duty of defending America and protecting \nour freedom. For these sacrifices, America is eternally grateful.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2415\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United Stares Code, to expand the \nscope of programs of education for which accelerated payments of \neducational assistance under the Montgomery GI Bill may be used, and \nfor\n\n[[Page S2205]]\n\nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Veterans' \nEmployment and Training Act of 2006. I am joined in this effort by \nSenator Pryor. This important legislation will provide expanded \nbenefits for our brave men and women returning from service in the \nGlobal War on Terror, while also providing needed workers to growing \nsectors of our economy.\n  Under the Montgomery G.I. Bill, the Veterans' Administration \ncurrently provides accelerated benefits to assist our service men and \nwomen in transitioning to the civilian job market. Through this \nprogram, the VA makes short-term, high-cost training programs more \nattractive to veterans by paying benefits in a lump sum, and by \ncovering up to 60 percent of the cost of some educational programs. \nHowever, this program is now only available to men and women who seek \ntraining in high-tech programs.\n  In order to provide this benefit to more of our brave men and women \nin the armed forces, the Veterans' Employment and Training Act will \nexpand eligibility for accelerated benefits to include industry sectors \nidentified by the Department of Labor as likely to add large numbers of \nnew jobs or require new job training skills in the coming years. These \nsectors include construction, hospitality, financial services, energy, \nhomeland security, health care, and transportation.\n  A number of these sectors face critical shortages of employees now or \nin the near future and are anxious to attract veterans to their \nprofessions. The trucking industry, for example, needs an additional \n20,000 drivers today and expects to face a driver shortage of 110,000 \ndrivers by 2014. The modest change that I am proposing today will help \nto provide needed workers to these and other industries.\n  But more importantly, we must remember the great sacrifices made by \nthose in the Armed Forces. For many of these brave individuals, the \ntransition from military service to civilian life is not an easy one. \nIt is particularly difficult for veterans between the ages of 20 and \n24, who currently have an unemployment rate of over 15 percent--nearly \ndouble the rate of non-veterans in the same age group. This is simply \nunacceptable!\n  We have an obligation to make sure that these individuals are not \nforgotten when they return from service. One step we can take now is to \nensure that those who serve have access to every educational \nopportunity possible. By expanding eligibility for accelerated G.I. \nBill benefits, we will give many of these veterans a new opportunity to \nget training and find work in some of the fastest growing sectors of \nour economy.\n  I urge the Senate to act soon to pass this legislation. We owe it to \nthe men and women of the Armed Forces to act quickly to provide them \nwith this expanded benefit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2416\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to preserve local radio broadcast emergency and other \nservices and to require the Federal Communications Commission to \nconduct a rulemaking for that purpose; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I stand before my colleagues today to \nannounce the introduction of a bill that will preserve an important \nresource needed during times of an emergency--free, local, over-the-air \nradio broadcasting. The Local Emergency Radio Service Preservation Act \nensures that terrestrial radio service does not suffer from the entry \nof subscription-based satellite services into local markets.\n  The most reliable form of communication today is radio. Oftentimes \nduring natural disasters and other emergencies, many forms of \ncommunications become unavailable to the public. Wireless systems can \nbe overloaded with calls. Satellite television service is interrupted \nby extreme weather conditions. Internet service connections are \nfrequently disconnected. In contrast, over-the-air radio is an \nubiquitous form of mass media that is available to nearly every car and \nhousehold in the nation. The system cannot be overloaded and operates \nwell under extreme weather conditions. Radio has been meeting the \ndemands of local communities for nearly a century and is equipped to \ncontinue its service well into the next century.\n  In 1997 satellite digital audio radio service, SDARS, was licensed by \nthe Federal Communications Commission, FCC, to provide a national radio \nprogramming service. Today satellite\n\n[[Page S2206]]\n\nradio companies provide their service to consumers on a subscription \nbasis. The cost of the radio equipment needed to receive the service is \nreasonable for the enthusiast, but too costly for low income \nhouseholds. For many families, satellite radio is not an option. \nInstead, these people must rely on traditional over-the-air radio for \nweather, traffic, news and local information.\n  Should satellite companies begin to enter into local markets, going \nagainst the original spirit of the license agreement, local radio \nstations would suffer revenue loss. Advertising dollars are the radio \nbroadcast industry's sole source of revenue. The technology exists for \nsatellite companies to deliver local content, including local \nadvertisements. Satellite industry players have publically stated that \nlocal advertising dollars could quickly become a new revenue source. \nThis threat to free radio is a threat to the public interest.\n  The Local Emergency Radio Service Preservation Act eases the threat \nto radio broadcasting. First the bill prohibits the use of satellite \nterrestrial repeaters to insert local content into specific local \nmarkets. Second, this legislation clarifies that future technologies \ncannot be used to distribute local satellite programming. Lastly, the \nact requires the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, to conduct a \nrulemaking on the distribution of region-specific content on a \nnationwide basis.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 2419. A bill to ensure the proper remembrance of Vietnam veterans \nand the Vietnam War by providing a deadline for the designation of a \nvisitor center for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to introduce a bill, \nwhich seeks to honor Congress' commitment to our Vietnam Veterans. \nJoining me in sponsoring this legislation is Senator Hagel, a Vietnam \nveteran himself.\n  On November 5, 2003 this body passed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial \nVisitor Center Act by unanimous consent.\n  That bill authorized the construction of a center to educate the \nnearly 4 million visitors annually to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.\n  This center will be an important resource for current and future \ngenerations, enabling them to have a better understanding of the \nVietnam War and to pay tribute to the brave Americans who answered the \ncall to duty.\n  Unfortunately, the Visitor Center project has stalled due to \nbureaucratic delays.\n  This bill would create a 30-day deadline following its enactment for \nthe approval of the Visitor Center.\n  We owe it to the Vietnam Veterans, and to the Wall's future visitors \nto follow through with this project. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLEN:\n  S. 2424. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease the contribution limits for health savings accounts, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the growing \nsuccess of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and legislation I have \nintroduced to expand Health Savings Accounts.\n  In a positive action, Congress created Health Savings Accounts as \npart of the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA). Health Savings Accounts \nare an alternative to traditional health insurance--a savings product \nthat offers a different and attractive way for consumers to pay for \ntheir health care. HSAs enable an individual to pay for current health \nexpenses and save for future qualified medical and retiree health \nexpenses on a tax-free basis.\n  An individual must have coverage under an HSA qualified health plan \nto open and contribute to an HSA. HSA qualified health plan premiums \ngenerally costs less than traditional health care coverage. Therefore, \nan individual can put the money he or she saves on insurance into a \npersonal Health Savings Account.\n  I've always described myself as a common sense Jeffersonian \nconservative, which means I trust free people and free enterprise more \nthan a meddlesome, burdensome government and that's why I'm such a \nstrong advocate for Health Savings Accounts. Individuals own and \ncontrol the money in their HSAs. Unlike a Flexible Spending Account, \nfunds remain in the account from year to year, just like an IRA. There \nare no ``use it or lose it'' rules for HSAs. HSAs can become, over \ntime, a strong, affordable health insurance product providing a savings \n``nest egg'' for health care expenses.\n  In addition, HSAs allow individuals to make decisions on how to spend \ntheir money without relying on a third party. More specifically, the \nindividual makes decisions about how much. money he or she wants to put \ninto the account, whether to save for future medical expenses, or pay \nexpenses that health insurance plans may not cover.\n  The individual also decides what types of investments to make with \nthe money in the account that will allow the account appreciate and \ngrow in value. I want to make clear right here that the individual does \nnot have to invest their money if he or she doesn't want to. This is \nonly an option. The bottom line is that Health Savings Accounts give \npeople the freedom to make the health care choices that best fit their \nneeds and that best represent Mr. Jefferson's ideals and my own.\n  Now, there are critics of health savings accounts. However, there is \nconvincing evidence that HSAs have proven effective in controlling \nhealth care costs and providing an affordable option for Americans \nwithout health Insurance coverage.\n  Critics who claim that rich people gain most from the tax breaks of \nHSAs should look at the facts. Of the 3 million Americans who have \nenrolled in HSA plans, 32 percent were previously uninsured, and the \nuninsured are not typically wealthy. Critics suggest HSAs will drive up \nthe cost of premiums. However, a recently released study from the \nDeloitte Center for Health Solutions showed HSA qualified plans had a \n2.8 percent annual premium increase, compared to 8 percent for all \nother plans. This low rate of increase is another reason HSA qualified \nplans are affordable to those with lower incomes.\n  Another common criticism of HSAs is that the tax break benefits are \n``too generous.'' But the President's proposal offering both a tax \ndeduction and tax credit for money used to fund HSAs is no more \ngenerous than current tax benefits for employer-sponsored health \ncoverage. However, our laws and proposal only level the playing field.\n  Proponents of HSAs do not pretend that HSAs are going to ``fix'' the \nentire health care system, although they may go a long way toward doing \nso with more individual responsibility and opportunity. HSAs are an \nadditional option--one that is affordable and chips away at part of the \nproblem: the millions of uninsured Americans. Individuals need health \ninsurance, especially for costly medical services, not only tax \ndeductions for out-of-pocket spending. It is the combination of two \nproducts--the HSA and HSA-qualified health insurance plan--that has \nallowed over one million previously uninsured Americans to afford real \nhealth coverage.\n  I am very pleased to see the positive results of Health Savings \nAccounts. But we cannot let this momentum slow down. We must do more to \npromote HSAs and give individuals more control over their health care \nneeds--and that is why I am here today. I am introducing legislation \nthat would increase the maximum amount individuals can contribute to \ntheir HSA.\n  Under current law, an individual's contributions are limited to the \nlesser of the amount of the deductible or $2700 for self-only coverage, \n($5450 for family coverage), for 2006. Under this proposal, a person \ncould contribute--without paying income or payroll taxes on the \ncontribution--up to the plan's out-of-pocket maximum, which is higher \nthan the deductible. So for an individual, the maximum out-of-pocket \nfor 2006 cannot exceed $5250 or $10500 for a family. It is important to \nnote though, that each HSA qualified health plan sets their own limit \non out of pocket expenses, therefore, for an individual their out-of-\npocket expenses may be lower than maximum $5250 but more than the \ncurrent limit of $2700. Nevertheless, this legislation allows \nindividuals to save more money for their current and future health care \nneeds and I am proud to be introducing it.\n  Moreover, this proposal will remove the tax bias against consumer-\ndirected\n\n[[Page S2207]]\n\nhealth plans. Today, the tax code subsidizes health care purchased \nthrough insurance but generally does not subsidize health care paid \nout-of-pocket. This encourages excessive reliance on insurance for even \npredictable, non-catastrophic care, which in turn reduces consumer \nsensitivity to the cost of health care. My proposal would help improve \nthe efficiency and slow the growth of our nation's health care \nspending.\n  Studies estimate that the average retiree will require hundreds of \nthousands of dollars of savings for out-of-pocket old-age health costs. \nHSAs provide strong tax incentives to encourage such savings. On a side \nnote, I have introduced legislation, the Long-Term Care Act that \ncompliments this HSA proposal. Under the Long-Term Care Act, we would \nallow individuals to use their 401(k) savings to pay for long-term care \ninsurance. Both proposals provide commonsense approaches that will \nencourage individuals to plan for their future health care needs and \nreduce individuals' reliance on programs such as Medicaid.\n  HSAs have proven to be an effective health cost containment tool. \nWhile there is a cost to the federal government associated with the tax \nbenefit portion of HSA plans, we must weigh that cost against the cost \nof doing nothing and allowing cost shifting to those with insurance. \nOur health care system needs to switch to a preventive care system, \nwhich will keep future health care costs down rather than our current \ncostly reactionary system. If we continue down our current path and \nmake no significant changes to our health care system, the unfunded \nliability of entitlement spending will reach $26 trillion by the year \n2030, consuming the entire federal budget. We're at a crucial point, \nand I believe my legislation, and HSAs in general, offer a step in the \nright direction for personal responsibility in fostering affordable \nhealth care and savings.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 2425. A bill to apply amendments to the Immigration and \nNationality Act related to providing medical services in underserved \nareas, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CONRAD Mr. President: Today, I am introducing a bill to \npermanently reauthorize the Conrad 30 visa waiver program to provide \nmedical care to underserved rural America.\n  One of the top concerns of North Dakota community leaders and \nhospital officials is the challenge of recruiting and keeping capable, \nquality doctors. In response, I created this visa waiver program in \n1994 to recruit highly qualified foreign physicians to medically \nunderserved areas.\n  This program was meant to help many areas across the country, \nespecially rural communities that have a difficult time recruiting \ndoctors, get access to primary health care. It has proven to be one of \nour Nation's top tools to recruit and keep doctors in our rural \ncommunities.\n  The Conrad 30 program allows a State agency to grant visa waivers to \nforeign medical graduates who are in the United States for their \nresidencies on foreign exchange J-1 visas. To qualify for the waiver, \nthe physician undergoes numerous background and security checks, and \nmust agree to serve a medically underserved community for three years. \nIn exchange, the physician's requirement to return to his home country \nfor a period of time before applying for a work visa is waived so that \nwe can utilize them in underserved areas.\n  Since the program was implemented in 1994, North Dakota has received \na total of 90 Conrad State 30 J-l visa waiver doctors in communities \nall over the State.\n  Nearly every rural hospital in the State--and many of clinics--have \nbenefited from the program. For examp1e, Oakes, (population 1,979) has \nhad 6 doctors, Bottineau, (population 2,336), has had 4, and Tioga, \n(popu1ation 1,125), has had 3.\n  As you can see, many rural counties rely on the physicians they \nreceive through the Conrad State 30 program to provide healthcare in \ntheir communities. This bipartisan program is critical to ensuring our \nrural health care needs are met for years to come.\n  States have come to rely on the program. It has proven to be \nsuccessful in bringing physicians to underserved areas without \ndisplacing American physicians, because the foreign physicians are \nfilling a large and obvious void.\n  It has been just over 14 months since the last reauthorization \npassed, and we're already working on another reauthorization. Clearly, \ntwo years has proven to be far too short. Since 1994, the Conrad 30 \nprogram has been reauthorized a number of times. The current \nauthorization expires on June 1, 2006. I urge my colleagues to pass \nthis bill making the program permanent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/15/senate-section/article/S2207-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 402--DESIGNATING THE FIRST DAY OF APRIL, 2006, AS \n                  ``NATIONAL ASBESTOS AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Mr. REID submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   RESTRUCTURING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Social Security is the foundation of retirement income \n     for most Americans;\n       (2) preserving and strengthening the long term viability of \n     Social Security is a vital national priority and is essential \n     for the retirement security of today's working Americans, \n     current and future retirees, and their families;\n\n[[Page S2212]]\n\n       (3) Social Security faces significant fiscal and \n     demographic pressures;\n       (4) the nonpartisan Office of the Chief Actuary at the \n     Social Security Administration reports that--\n       (A) the number of workers paying taxes to support each \n     Social Security beneficiary has dropped from 16.5 in 1950 to \n     3.3 in 2005;\n       (B) within a generation there will be only 2 workers to \n     support each retiree, which will substantially increase the \n     financial burden on American workers;\n       (C) without structural reform, the Social Security system, \n     beginning in 2017, will pay out more in benefits than it will \n     collect in taxes;\n       (D) without structural reform, the Social Security trust \n     fund will be exhausted in 2041, and Social Security tax \n     revenue in 2041 will only cover 74 percent of promised \n     benefits, and will decrease to 68 percent by 2079;\n       (E) without structural reform, future Congresses may have \n     to raise payroll taxes nearly 50 percent over the next 75 \n     years to pay full benefits on time, resulting in payroll tax \n     rates of as much as 17.5 percent by 2041 and 19.1 percent by \n     2079;\n       (F) without structural reform, Social Security's total cash \n     shortfall over the next 75 years is estimated to be more than \n     $25,000,000,000,000 in constant 2005 dollars or \n     $5,700,000,000,000 measured in present value terms; and\n       (G) absent structural reforms, spending on Social Security \n     will increase from 4.3 percent of gross domestic product in \n     2005 to 6.4 percent in 2079; and\n       (5) the Congressional Budget Office, the Government \n     Accountability Office, the Congressional Research Service, \n     the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and the \n     President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security have all \n     warned that failure to enact fiscally responsible Social \n     Security reform quickly will result in 1 or more of the \n     following:\n       (A) Higher tax rates.\n       (B) Lower Social Security benefit levels.\n       (C) Increased Federal debt or less spending on other \n     federal programs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the President, the Congress, and the American people \n     including seniors, workers, women, minorities, and disabled \n     persons should work together at the earliest opportunity to \n     enact legislation to achieve a solvent and permanently \n     sustainable Social Security system;\n       (2) Social Security reform--\n       (A) must protect current and near retirees from any changes \n     to Social Security benefits;\n       (B) must reduce the pressure on future taxpayers and on \n     other budgetary priorities;\n       (C) must provide benefit levels that adequately reflect \n     individual contributions to the Social Security system; and\n       (D) must preserve and strengthen the safety net for \n     vulnerable populations including the disabled and survivors; \n     and\n       (3) the Senate should honor section 13301 of the Budget \n     Enforcement Act of 1990.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3085.

Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mrs. Murray) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by him to the concurrent resolution \nS. Con. Res. 83, setting forth the congressional budget for the United \nStates Government for fiscal year 2007 and including the appropriate \nbudgetary levels for fiscal years 2006 and 2008 through 2011; which was \nordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE CRIME VICTIMS FUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:--\n       (1) The Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (``VOCA'') was enacted \n     to provide Federal financial support for services to victims \n     of all types of crime, primarily through grants to state \n     crime victim compensation and victim assistance programs.\n       (2) VOCA created the Crime Victims Fund (``the Fund'') as a \n     separate account into which are deposited monies collected \n     from persons convicted of Federal criminal offenses, \n     including criminal fines, forfeitures and special \n     assessments. There are no general taxpayer generated revenues \n     deposited into the Fund.\n       (3) Each fiscal year, the Fund is used to support--\n       (A) formula grants to States for financial assistance to \n     upwards of 4,400 programs providing direct victim assistance \n     services to nearly 4,000,000 victims of all types of crimes \n     annually, with priority for programs serving victims of \n     domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse, and \n     previously underserved victims of violent crime;\n       (B) formula grants to States to supplement State crime \n     victim compensation programs, which reimburse more than \n     150,000 violent crime victims annually for out-of-pocket \n     expenses, including medical expenses, mental health \n     counseling, lost wages, loss of support and funeral costs;\n       (C) the Antiterrorism Emergency Reserve, to assist victims \n     of domestic and international terrorism;\n       (D) discretionary grants by the Office for Victims of Crime \n     to provide training and technical assistance and services to \n     victims of Federal crimes;\n       (E) Children's Justice Act grants to States to improve the \n     investigation and prosecution of child abuse cases;\n       (F) victim witness coordinators in United States Attorney's \n     Offices; and\n       (G) victim assistance specialists in Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation field offices.\n       (4) In the 108th Congress, a strong bipartisan, bicameral \n     majority in Congress affirmed its support for the Crime \n     Victims Fund and increased its commitment to crime victims in \n     the Justice for All Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-405), which \n     establishes Federal crime victims rights and authorized 2 new \n     VOCA-funded victim programs.\n       (5) Before fiscal year 2000, all amounts deposited into the \n     Crime Victims Fund in each fiscal year were made available \n     for authorized programs in the subsequent fiscal year.\n       (6) Beginning in fiscal year 2000, Congress responded to \n     large fluctuations of deposits into the Fund by delaying \n     obligations from the Fund above certain amounts, as follows:\n       (A) For fiscal year 2000, $500,000,000.\n       (B) For fiscal year 2001, $537,500,000.\n       (C) For fiscal year 2002, $550,000,000.\n       (D) For fiscal year 2003, $600,000,000.\n       (E) For fiscal year 2004, $625,000,000.\n       (F) For fiscal year 2005, $625,000,000.\n       (G) For fiscal year 2006, $625,000,000.\n       (7) In the conference report on an omnibus spending bill \n     for fiscal year 2000 (Public Law 106-113), Congress explained \n     that the reason for delaying annual Fund obligations was ``to \n     protect against wide fluctuations in receipts into the Fund, \n     and to ensure that a stable level of funding will remain \n     available for these programs in future years''.\n       (8) VOCA mandates that ``. . . all sums deposited in the \n     Fund in any fiscal year that are not made available for \n     obligation by Congress in the subsequent fiscal year shall \n     remain in the Fund for obligation in future fiscal years, \n     without fiscal year limitation''.\n       (9) The Crime Victims Fund is a trust fund established \n     without tax payer dollars to assist crime victims and should \n     continue to be respected.\n       (10) For fiscal year 2006, the President proposed to \n     ``rescind'' $1,267,000,000 from amounts in the Fund. Congress \n     rejected this proposal in the Science, State, Justice, \n     Commerce, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2006 \n     (Public Law 109-108) and reaffirmed that amounts deposited or \n     available in the Fund in any fiscal year in excess of \n     $625,000,000 shall remain in the Fund and not be available \n     for obligation until the following fiscal year.\n       (11) For fiscal year 2007, the President is recommending \n     ``rescission'' of $1,255,000,000 from amounts in the Fund.\n       (12) The rescission proposed by the President would result \n     in no funds being available to support crime victim services \n     at the start of fiscal year 2008. Further, such rescission \n     would make the Fund vulnerable to fluctuations in receipts \n     into the Fund, and would not ensure that a stable level of \n     funding will remain available for vital programs in future \n     years.\n       (13) Retention of all amounts deposited into the Fund for \n     the immediate and future use of crime victim services as \n     authorized by VOCA is supported by many major criminal \n     justice organizations, including--\n       (A) American Bar Association, Criminal Justice Section;\n       (B) National District Attorneys Association;\n       (C) National Sheriff's Association;\n       (D) 56 Attorneys General;\n       (E) National Organization for Victim Assistance;\n       (F) National Network to End Domestic Violence;\n       (G) Mothers Against Drunk Driving;\n       (H) National Children's Alliance;\n       (I) National Alliance to End Sexual Violence;\n       (J) National Coalition Against Domestic Violence;\n       (K) National Center for Victims of Crime;\n       (L) National Association of VOCA Assistance Administrators;\n       (M) National Association of Crime Victim Compensation \n     Boards;\n       (N) United States Conference of Catholic Bishops;\n       (O) National Grange;\n       (P) the Justice Project;\n       (Q) Victims' Assistance Legal Organization, Inc;\n\n[[Page S2215]]\n\n       (R) Justice Solutions, NPO;\n       (S) Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape; and\n       (T) National Organization for Parents of Murdered Children.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the funding levels in this resolution assume that all \n     amounts that have been and will be deposited into the Crime \n     Victims Fund, including amounts deposited in fiscal year 2007 \n     and thereafter, shall remain in the Fund for use as \n     authorized under the Victims of Crime Act of 1984.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3097.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE UNITED NATIONS HUMAN \n                   RIGHTS COUNCIL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the United Nations Secretary General stated in March \n     2005, ``the Commission on Human Rights suffers from declining \n     credibility and professionalism, and is in major need of \n     reform'' and that a fundamental problem is that, ``States \n     have sought membership . . . not to strengthen human rights \n     but to protect themselves against criticism or to criticize \n     others'';\n       (2) the United States and other countries called for the \n     abolition of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights \n     and its replacement with a new Human Rights Council;\n       (3) current Members of the United Nations Commission on \n     Human Rights, the primary human rights body of the United \n     Nations, include some of the worst violators of human rights \n     in the world, such as China, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, \n     Venezuela, and Zimbabwe;\n       (4) there are no criteria regarding the human rights record \n     of a country for membership on the new United Nations Human \n     Rights Council and even those countries that are found \n     complicit in massive and sustained human rights abuses would \n     be able to serve;\n       (5) even countries under sanctions by the United Nations \n     Security Council for human rights violations or terrorism are \n     not categorically excluded from membership on the United \n     Nations Human Rights Council;\n       (6) the Government of the United States, which had been a \n     member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights every \n     term since 1947, with 1 exception, has played a leadership \n     role in efforts to promote human rights throughout the \n     history of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights;\n       (7) the Government of the United States would be ineligible \n     for membership on the Human Rights Council every 6 years;\n       (8) the Government of the United States formally opposed \n     the creation of the United Nations Human Rights Council in a \n     General Assembly session on March 15, 2006; and\n       (9) the Government of the United States would be required \n     to cover 22 percent of the costs of the Human Rights Council.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n\n[[Page S2220]]\n\n       (1) the Government of the United States should decline to \n     participate on the United Nations Human Rights Council until \n     the Secretary of State certifies to the Congress that the \n     United Nations has passed a resolution affirming that \n     countries found complicit in sustained human rights abuses \n     are ineligible for membership in the United Nations Human \n     Rights Council; and\n       (2) the Government of the United States should not provide \n     any funds for the United Nations Human Rights Council until \n     the Secretary of State certifies to the Congress that the \n     United Nations has passed a resolution affirming that \n     countries found complicit in sustained human rights abuses \n     are ineligible for membership in the United Nations Human \n     Rights Council.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3120.

TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT \n                   LEGISLATIVE ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN TO INSTITUTE \n                   EQUITY UNDER THE MEDICARE PROGRAM FOR PERSONS \n                   WITH MENTAL ILLNESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Almost 36,300,000 Americans were over age 65 in 2004, \n     with the population projected to almost double to 71,500,000 \n     by 2030.\n       (2) It is estimated that 20 percent of, or over 7 million, \n     adults age 65 and older suffer from a mental illness and that \n     because of population growth and an increased incidence by \n     2030 this number will grow to 15.7 million.\n       (3) 5,248 older Americans died by suicide in 2003.\n       (4) In 2002, older Americans comprised 12.3 percent of the \n     population, yet represented 17.5 percent of completed \n     suicides.\n       (5) Caucasian men over age 85 are at greatest risk, with a \n     suicide rate almost 5 times higher than the national average.\n       (6) It is reported that among older adults, for every \n     completed suicide, 4 attempts are made.\n       (7) Research shows that 20 percent of older Americans who \n     die by suicide visited their physician within the previous 24 \n     hours of their suicide, 41 percent within the previous week \n     of their suicide, and 75 percent within the previous month of \n     their suicide.\n       (8) The Medicare program discriminates against persons with \n     mental illness by imposing a 50 percent copayment on \n     outpatient mental health services compared to a 20 percent \n     copayment for outpatient physical health services.\n       (9) Correcting this inequity in the Medicare program was \n     one of the top ten White House Conference on Aging \n     resolutions.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals in this resolution assume that \n     Congress should act to provide mental health copayment equity \n     to America's seniors under the Medicare program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3121.
