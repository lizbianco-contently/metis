Mr. President, employer-sponsored pension plans have been a \ncritical part of employment security for America's workers. Over 40 \nmillion Americans rely on these pension plans that promise a monthly \nretirement benefit for life. Increasingly, the retirement security \noffered by pension plans is at risk, and more and more employers opt \nout of offering pension plans because of increased costs and growing \nadministrative difficulties. Further complicating the situation is the \nfact that the agency that insures workers' pensions, the Pension \nBenefit Guaranty Corporation, faces huge deficits as a result of the \ntermination of\n\n[[Page S1512]]\n\npension plans throughout the country. These pension plans were \nmaintained by companies in the troubled steel and airline industries.\n  For all these reasons and more, we know that Congress must act on \npension reform legislation so employees can continue to count on the \nretirement security provided by employer-sponsored pension plans. That \nis why Senate Democrats strongly supported pension reform legislation \nand were eager to go to conference on this bill. We recognize this is \nan important bill and strongly believe the Senate and House must get to \nwork immediately to hammer out the compromises necessary to produce a \nfinal bill.\n  Senators agree. I think, from our perspective, we are united, \nDemocrats and Republicans. Senate Democrats believe we can and should \nname conferees right now, this morning, and send the bill to the House \nso they can name their conferees. Nevertheless, some recent press \nreports on the status of the pension reform bill have suggested that \nDemocrats are preventing this bill from moving to conference.\n  I wish to take a few minutes and correct this record. We strongly \nsupport the improvements this legislation will bring to our private \npension system. We support improvements this legislation will bring, \nimprovements to our private pension system. We want to improve pension \nfunding so employees will know their employer's pension promise will be \nfulfilled. Democrats believe it is important to provide certainty to \nemployers who are trying to plan their pension costs. Democrats believe \nit is important to clarify the rules governing cash balance pension \nplans so older workers are protected. Democrats believe it is important \nwe act quickly to provide relief to those airlines that want to \nmaintain their pension plans but need some time to recover from the \ndownturn following the attacks of 9/11. Democrats believe it is \nimperative that we shore up the finances of the PBGC.\n  In other words, Democrats want this bill to go to conference today, \nand we can do that if the majority will agree to a reasonable number of \nconferees. Throughout this process, Senate Democrats have worked \nclosely with Republicans to move pension reform legislation in an \nexpedited manner. The pension reform bill was reported by the Finance \nCommittee by voice vote on July 26 of last year. The HELP Committee \nreported the bill on September 28 by a vote of 18 to 2. After \nconsideration, the two committee bills had to be reconciled into one \nproposal. Senators Enzi, Grassley, Kennedy, and Baucus worked long and \nhard on a bipartisan basis to produce that legislation. At each step \nduring this process, Democrats worked with the Republicans to produce a \nbipartisan bill.\n  When it came time to consider the bill on the Senate floor, Democrats \nagain worked to move this legislation forward. Senate Democrats worked \nwith the majority leader to reach agreement on a limited number of \namendments. Democrats also worked to limit debate so the bill could \nmove forward. Democrats did not have to forego their rights to offer \namendments to the pension bill, but we did. Democrats didn't have to \nforego their rights to debate issues raised by this legislation, but we \ndid. There are any number of steps that can be taken to slow down the \nprogress of legislation if a Member of the Senate is so inclined. \nDemocrats have not chosen to take any of these steps and are not \nchoosing to take any of these steps now.\n  We are eager to go to conference on this legislation and we are not \ncontesting the Republicans' desire to have a two-vote advantage in the \nconference. The majority leader set the margin at 7 to 5. We believe \nfairness is 8 to 6. All we are asking is that each committee which is a \nparty to this legislation be adequately represented. We believe that \nappointing 14 conferees in a ratio of 8 to 6 gives the Senate the best \nopportunity to bring back a bill from the conference that will garner \nstrong support by the Senate.\n  The majority leader has said he will go 9 to 6. That is not fair, to \nhave a three-vote advantage. I urge the majority to consider its \nopposition to our very reasonable request so we can get to work on this \nlegislation. Together we can improve our Nation's pension system and \nmake America better.\n  Mr. President, simply it is this: Are we going to go to conference on \nthis bill? We want to go. Arbitrarily, the majority leader said it will \nbe a 7-to-5 ratio. We wanted 8 to 6. We will go to conference right \nnow. It doesn't seem fair. We are not holding up the conference. We are \nnot holding up the conference as indicated by the fact that we are \nwilling to go from 7 to 5 to 8 to 6.\n  The distinguished Senator from Tennessee comes back with the \nsuggestion that, well, we will go 9 to 6. That isn't fair. We want to \ngo to conference, but we want at least to have a semblance of fairness. \nWe are willing to go with the two-vote margin but not three votes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1512-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about the \nwar on terror, progress in Iraq, and the PATRIOT Act. In spite of the \nnegative press you see on the nightly news, Iraq is progressing toward \nthe goal of being independent, free, and democratic. It has been nearly \n3 years since our brave men and women in the military and our other \nagencies freed a people from the grip of a tyrannical and murderous \ndictator and began to work to establish a democratic society in the \nheart of the Middle East. In doing so, they are also making the world \nand all of us much safer.\n\n  Since then, the people of Iraq have set up a constitutional \ngovernment and braved death by voting in free elections.\n  Surely more remains to be done, but let there be no doubt, progress \nis being made. But challenges remain. We recognize that and we must.\n  The recent bombing of a mosque in Samarra has highlighted the \nchallenges Iraq continues to face. Who did it?\n  Following the attack, a prominent Iraqi Shiite cleric, al-Sistani, \nrecognizing the hallmarks of al-Qaida, called, for the first time, for \nstreet demonstrations against the bombing, and thousands of his angry \nsupporters protested, shouting slogans against al-Qaida and its \nsupporters, accusing them of fueling hatred and violence, which is \nsurely what they did.\n  News of the attack only underscores why we are in Iraq and what is at \nstake. When our delegation met with Sunni, Shiite, and Kurd leaders \nlast month in Baghdad, those leaders recognized, as our able Ambassador \nemphasized, the dangers of sectarian violence. They committed to work \ntogether, knowing that they have to bring about a national unity \ngovernment.\n  Recent news reports suggest that with the intervention of enlightened \nleaders such as al-Sistani, people are beginning to work together \nagain. But the disturbing news of the bombing of the mosque and \nresulting reactions and killings simply seems to embolden all the hand-\nwringing naysayers who have incessantly talked of civil war in Iraq and \nAmerican withdrawal. A greater lesson, however, lies within this tragic \ndevelopment.\n  Simply put, what is the alternative?\n  Is America to retreat from Iraq and simply seek to be left alone and \nleave the world's problems to others to fix?\n  In the age of bin Laden, al-Zarqawi, and al-Sistani, that is a course \nAmerica and the world cannot afford to take. We should have learned our \nlesson on 9/11.\n  As the Wall Street Journal recently pointed out, the fact is that \nunder the Bush administration's policy, four democratic governments \nhave come to power in the Middle East--Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, and \nPalestine. Yes these democracies will face serious challenges along the \nway, from insurgents to bloody ethnic feuding.\n\n[[Page S1513]]\n\n  These are very serious challenges, and we are witnessing these \nchallenges right now.\n  Let us be blunt. There is always the possibility that a murderous \ndictator can come to power in a democracy. That is how Hitler got in, \nin Germany. No one said this approach is perfect. It isn't, especially \nwhen Hamas wins in Palestine. But democracy isn't supposed to be \nperfect or easy or smooth. It was not such as we set up our Government.\n  But what is the alternative to promoting democracy, no matter how \ngreat the challenges become? I submit there is no viable alternative. \nIt is democracy, and only democracy, that will offer these countries \nthe possibility of greater civic freedoms, greater economic freedoms, \nand the hope for a politically moderate future.\n  It is only because of American leadership, our brave soldiers, our \nbrave civilians, and the hopeful leadership, the enlightened leadership \nof people such as Hamid Karzai, Jalal Talabani, and Saad Hariri that \nthese countries and their people stand a chance of a better life and \nthe world stands a chance to be a safer place. Along with it, America \nstands a chance of having important friends in a part of the world that \nin the past has been no friend to America.\n  Some of my colleagues have said we need to get out of Iraq. I agree--\nas soon as we train the Iraqi military and the police to ensure \nsecurity but not until that is done.\n  But even when Iraq is stabilized, we will continue to see the threat \nof violence from the Islamofascists such as al-Qaida, Ansar al-Islam, \nJamia Islamia.\n  As President Bush warned, this is going to be a decade-long war. \nThus, our battles will go on overseas to deny foreign safe havens to \nmurderous terrorist groups.\n  At home, the threat is still grim. And with recent disclosures, \nregrettably, of our most sensitive intelligence, according to CIA \nDirector Porter Goss, we have experienced very severe damage to our \ncapabilities.\n  It is even more important now that we provide our domestic law \nenforcement agencies the tools they need. That is why it is imperative \nwe pass the PATRIOT Act as soon as possible. It is past time that we do \nso. 9/11 was not so long ago that we should have forgotten what it felt \nlike that day.\n  You know and I know what it was like. We all need to remember. The \nresults of hamstringing our domestic intelligence abilities are not so \ndistant. The reasons we passed the PATRIOT Act have not gone away.\n  I am glad that an overwhelming number of Senators will join together \nto provide our terror fighters with the tools they need. For those for \nwhom this was a hard decision, I applaud your courage. However, our \nactions pale in comparison to the courage exercised by those of us who \nprotect us every day. It is to them we give these tools, to them we \nentrust our safety, to them we owe our freedoms, to them we owe our \nlives.\n  Why would we not give them the tools they need to hold terror at bay? \nWhy should we slow their hunt for terror suspects here at home? Why \nwould we take from them the tools that have aided in the capture of \nover 400 terrorist suspects?\n  Renewing the PATRIOT Act will do this and more. It strikes a balance \nbetween national security and personal liberties. In the words of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, it is a better bill now than \nit was before.\n  Negotiators have addressed many concerns. A balance has been struck \non national security letters. Nondisclosure requirements prevent \nterrorists from learning the progress of investigations and \ninvestigative techniques. New language allows recipients of NSL letters \nto overturn the nondisclosure requirements, if a judge finds there is \nno reason to believe that disclosures may endanger the national \nsecurity of the United States, interfere with criminal, \ncounterterrorism or counterintelligence investigation, interfere with \ndiplomatic relations or endanger the life or physical safety of any \nperson.\n  Could we allow anything else?\n  Language was added clarifying that libraries, where functioning in \ntheir traditional roles, are not subject to national security letters. \nThe agreement removes the requirement that a person inform the FBI of \nthe identity of any attorney to whom disclosure was made or will be \nmade to obtain legal advice or assistance.\n\n  For those of us who care about port security--quite a few people have \nbeen talking about it--this legislation includes the Reducing Crime and \nTerrorism at America's Seaports Act of 2005.\n  Those who join me in supporting this measure will make it a Federal \ncrime to use fraud or false pretenses to enter America's ports; \nestablish a new, general Federal crime to interfere forcibly with \ninspections of vessels by Federal law enforcement or resist arrest or \nprovide law enforcement officers with false information; add \n``passenger vessels'' to the forms of mass transit protected against \nterrorist attacks under Federal law; make it a Federal crime to place \nany substance or device in the navigable waters of the United States \nwith the intent to damage a vessel or its cargo or to interfere with \nmaritime commerce; and make it a Federal crime to transport explosives, \nbiological, chemical, radioactive weapons or nuclear material aboard a \nvessel in the United States, in waters subject to U.S. jurisdiction on \nthe high seas or aboard a vessel of the United States.\n  In addition, I care very deeply about fighting the drug scourge \nsweeping rural America, especially in the Midwest. Folks in my State \nknow all too well that methamphetamine is perhaps the most deadly, \nfiercely addictive, and rapidly spreading drug the United States has \nknown. It is cheap, potent, and available everywhere.\n  During the past decade, while law enforcement officers continue to \nbust record numbers of clandestine labs, methamphetamine use in some \ncommunities has increased by as much as 300 percent.\n  The PATRIOT Act reauthorization includes the most comprehensive \nantimeth package ever introduced in the Congress by my colleagues \nSenator Jim Talent of Missouri and Senator Dianne Feinstein of \nCalifornia. This Combat Meth Act will make certain legitimate consumers \nhave access to the medicine they need while cutting off the meth cooks \nfrom the large amounts of ingredients they need to cook meth.\n  For all of these reasons, we must reauthorize the PATRIOT Act now. \nOur terror fighters cannot wait, our ports cannot wait, and our \ncommunities suffering from the scourge of meth cannot wait.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1513-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1513-S1514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MILITARY RECRUITERS\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a very important \nissue--access for our military recruiters on our high school campuses.\n  Later today, I will introduce a resolution in support of our military \nrecruiters.\n  I rise and stand here today in a country free from tyranny, free from \ndictatorship, and free from oppression. I stand here today protected by \nthe rights that are guaranteed to me by the Constitution of the United \nStates. I am free to stand here because I am protected by the men and \nwomen of our nation's Armed Forces. It is because of our Nation's \nmilitary that I enjoy the freedoms that are laid out in our country's \nConstitution.\n  These freedoms are enjoyed by every citizen of this great country.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act contains a provision that provides \nmilitary recruiters and college and university recruiters with access \nto some student information. The intent behind this provision was to \nensure that military recruiters were put on a level playing field with \nrecruiters from our Nation's colleges and universities. At the time \nthis language was included in NCLB military recruiters across the \ncountry were being denied access to student information that college \nand university recruiters were given full access to.\n  The text contained in No Child Left Behind is very simple. It states \nthat ``each local educational agency receiving assistance under this \nAct shall provide, on a request made by military recruiters or an \ninstitution of higher education, access to secondary school students' \nnames, addresses, and telephone listings.''\n  Recently, there have been numerous news reports on this topic. The \ndebate\n\n[[Page S1514]]\n\nhas swirled around a provision also in NCLB that allows a student or \nparent to request that contact information not be released to \nrecruiters. School districts are required to inform parents and \nstudents that they have the option to make this request.\n  In some areas the debate on this provision has gone much further. The \ncity of San Francisco recently voted in favor of Measure I, a symbolic \nmeasure that opposes, but does not forbid, military recruiting on \npublic high school or college campuses. The city cannot forbid military \nrecruiting at public high schools as doing so would put the schools at \nrisk of losing all federal funding. I cannot fathom why the city passed \nthis Measure. Students in San Francisco should have access to the same \ninformation that all other students have, and should be allowed to hear \nwhat the military has to offer them.\n  I understand the concerns surrounding privacy of personal information \nin today's society. However, I find it appalling that people have taken \nthis provision and used it to rally against our troops, against our \nmilitary system, and against our President.\n  We are here today because we are secured by the presence of our \nmilitary that protects our freedoms. My question is why are we so \nfrightened by the very instrument that helps keep us free?\n  Service in our armed forces is 100 percent voluntary and has been \nsince the end of the Vietnam War. In order to maintain a voluntary \nforce, the services must offer incentives to allow them to compete with \nthe private sector for young, bright students about to graduate from \nhigh school. Recruiters search for the best and the brightest in our \nNation's high schools to keep our forces strong and able to fight the \nforces that are against our way of life.\n  In the last 30 years, millions of young Americans have been given \ntechnical skills, received money for college tuition and preferred \nloans for first-time home purchases by choosing to serve in our \nmilitary. Not only are these young soldiers given skills that can lead \nthem to future employment, they are also given unique leadership \ntraining. Our military trains leaders not just for war, but for success \nin life.\n  Yet, it is perplexing to me that many parents today seem to look at \nmilitary service as being akin to joining a radical cult or a violent \ngang. Military recruiters are going to our Nation's high schools to \ninform high school students of the opportunities that are available in \nour Armed Forces. Military recruiters are on campuses to provide \ninformation to students that is often not available in the mainstream \nmedia or in many high school counseling offices. Military recruiters \nare on high school campuses to dispel the many myths that surround \nservice opportunities in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines and \nCoast Guard.\n  Some parents are concerned about reports of recruiter abuse. In fact, \nfollowing televised reports of recruiter abuse, the U.S. Army stopped \nrecruiting activities for one day to review procedures that its 7,500 \nrecruiters use.\n  In one case the network reported a recruiter suggesting how a \nvolunteer might cheat to pass a drug test, and in another, a sergeant \nthreatened a prospect with arrest if he didn't report to a recruiting \nstation. Two cases out of 7,500 Army recruiters operating out of some \n1,700 recruiting stations nationwide prompted the Army to stand down, \nto refocus recruiters on their mission, reinforcing the Army's core \nvalues, and ensure its procedures were carried out consistently at all \nrecruiting stations. It sounds like a pretty responsible reaction to \nme. It sounds like an institution concerned about doing things the \nright way.\n\n  We must not forget the brave young men and women who do sign up for a \ntour of duty with the military. They swear to uphold and to protect the \nConstitution. We must not forget they take that duty seriously. They \nprotect each and every one of us from outside threats, not just threats \nof violence but also threats to our constitutionally protected freedoms \nof speech and religion.\n  In his book ``The Greatest Generation,'' Tom Brokaw recounts a \ngeneration of Americans who sacrificed all they had to preserve our \nfreedoms. Young men even went so far as to lie about their age so they \ncould enjoy the honor of fighting for our country in World War II. \nTheir country needed them, and they responded with uncommon valor and \ncourage. The crucible of war formed who we are as a country today. \nToday, our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines stand on the \nshoulders of those warriors. We celebrate their accomplishments in \nmovies and books. We regale them with the honors they earned and \ndeserve. I wonder what sort of message we are sending to today's youth \nif we honor the soldiers of yesterday but shun the soldiers of today.\n  My fear is that freedom is becoming almost too free, too entitled to \nmore and more Americans. As long as we are free to switch cell phone \nservice or download music from any Web site, we believe our freedoms \nare intact. But freedom is about so much more than that. Freedom is \nhaving the ability to speak our mind and stand for what we believe. \nFreedom means having the right to publicly disagree with the decisions \nof elected leaders. Freedom is a right, but it comes with a \nresponsibility.\n  As a parent, I have the direct responsibility to teach my children \nabout the honor in serving our fellow man, our community, and in \nserving our country. As parents, from the time our children are born, \nwe worry about their health, the friends they keep, the decisions they \nmake, and the grades they bring home from school. We worry about drugs, \nletting them drive, and about preparing them for a life after mom and \ndad. But when we shield young adults from the things that scare us as \nparents, we belittle our children. It is our responsibility to share \nthe world with our children, in many cases, the good with the bad. It \nis our responsibility to instill in them a sense of pride in our \ncountry and in the freedom we enjoy.\n  We cannot shield our children from information about military service \nbecause in doing so, we underestimate our children's capacity to judge \nfor themselves what their future should be. It is vital that our young \nadults in high school have access not only to future employment and \neducational opportunities but also to the opportunities provided in the \nU.S. military. And most importantly, it is absolutely necessary that \nour Nation's military have the opportunity to recruit the best and the \nbrightest our Nation has to offer. If we continue to discriminate \nagainst our military recruiters, we risk undermining the well-being of \nour military. We risk fracturing the base on which our Army, our Navy, \nour Air Force and our Marines is built. It is vital that recruiters \nhave access to our Nation's young adults to continue the traditions of \nour Armed Forces.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I share with the Senate that \nthere have been a couple of occurrences in Florida over the course of \nthis recess that might be worth noting.\n  The first is, seniors were assured by the Food and Drug \nAdministration 2 years ago that our senior citizens would not be \nharassed by the confiscation of their prescription drugs when they \norder those prescriptions by the Internet or by mail from Canada for a \nlimited supply. The Food and Drug Administration assured me that the \noverall intent of the law was to stop the massive purchases of drugs \nout of State in which they would go on the black market, but that for \nsenior citizens\n\n[[Page S1515]]\n\nseeking a 90-day supply, since the prescriptions are so much cheaper \nordering them through Canada, there was not going to be the harassment \nof the confiscations.\n  That has dramatically changed. Over the course of the last week and a \nhalf, I have received over 100 complaints of senior citizens from all \nover Florida having their prescriptions, when ordered by mail or \nInternet from Canada, confiscated. This is serious business. This could \nbe a matter of life and death for senior citizens who cannot afford to \npay the retail price and are depending on that medicine in order to \nhelp them with whatever their ailments are--in some cases, life-\nthreatening situations. Fortunately, we have not had any one of those \nreported to me, but the harassment has started.\n  I certainly hope there is no connection between this spike in the \nnumber of instances with Customs taking senior citizens' prescriptions. \nI hope there is no connection between that and trying to force senior \ncitizens into the Medicare prescription drug benefit, the Medicare Part \nD. Naturally, seniors are quite resistant to the new plan.\n  We have talked in the Senate over and over, and I have offered \namendments, all of which have had a majority vote, but under the \nparliamentary procedure of having to waive the Budget Act, I had to get \n60 votes. I have gotten over 50 but not the 60 votes needed in order to \ndelay the implementation of the prescription drug benefit, the deadline \nfor signing up, which is May 15.\n  Naturally, seniors are resistant because they do not understand it. \nThey are confused and in some cases bewildered. They have 40 to 50 \nplans to pick from. They are confused and they are frightened because \nif they do not pick a plan by the May deadline, they will be penalized \n1 percent a month or 12 percent a year, or if they pick the wrong plan, \nthey are stuck with that plan for a year and they have the fear that \nsuddenly the need to change their prescription by their doctor may \noccur and the formulary they pick may not cover the new prescription.\n  This resistance is a fact. I hope we do not see any of this \nharassment connected with trying to force seniors into the prescription \ndrug bill.\n  I call on the Department of Homeland Security, Customs, to stop \nharassing our senior citizens by confiscating their prescriptions for \npurchase of a short supply, which is bought at so much of a reduced \ncost.\n  That is not the total answer, just getting the drugs from Canada. \nThat is bandaiding the problem. The problem is having a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit offered to senior citizens where Medicare can \nuse its huge buying power of bulk purchases in order to bring down the \nprice of the drugs, as the Veterans' Administration has been doing for \nthe last two decades. But until we can get to that point, until we can \nchange the law, until we can get the votes to change the law, in the \nmeantime, some of our senior citizens who have trouble making financial \nends meet have to buy their drugs through Canada at a much reduced \nprice.\n  I bring this to the attention of the Senate. I bring it to the \nattention of Customs, as I have through correspondence. It is time to \nstop harassing our senior citizens.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman).

Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 \np.m. will be equally divided.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the USA PATRIOT Act. \nAs you know, the Senate has recently agreed to another temporary \nextension of this act. We have twice since December been in a position \nof having to offer, instead of permanent reauthorization, a temporary \nfix. Yet at a time when so many in this body are continuing to talk \nabout security, this one piece of legislation, in my humble opinion, \nhas been more important in terms of protecting the security of the \nUnited States than anything else we have done since September 11.\n  This critical law, which, of course, provides law enforcement \nagencies with the vital tools necessary to fight and win the war on \nterror, should not be allowed to expire. I, frankly, am at a loss to \nexplain why we are spending so much time trying to get to final closure \non this legislation when the merits of the legislation seem to be so \nobvious--primarily by providing tools to law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies of this country, tools that are already in broad \nuse in other aspects of law enforcement investigations.\n  Unfortunately, it seems to me that there has been a certain amount of \nhysteria whipped up over this to cause people to have unreasonable fear \nand concern about civil liberties, when, in fact, the balance between \nsecurity and civil liberties has been struck in an entirely appropriate \nway in this legislation.\n  We must make it a top priority of the Senate to reauthorize this \nlegislation as soon as possible, as it would be unconscionable to \ncompromise the safety of the American people and undermine the progress \nwe have made since 9/11 and delay critical investigations.\n  An agreement reached in December between the House and Senate \nconferees preserved the provisions of this act which have made America \nsafer since 9/11 while increasing congressional and judicial oversight, \nwhich should alleviate the concerns of those who believe the law \nenforcement tools somehow endanger civil liberties. And even recently, \nthe White House and leaders of the House and Senate have made \nadditional concessions in an attempt to reach a final agreement to \nreauthorize the PATRIOT Act.\n  Unfortunately, it seems that there are a few who are continuing in \ntheir effort to stop reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act, insisting on \nimposing their will on a bipartisan majority of the Senate, the House, \nand the President of the United States. The handful of diehards who \ncontinue to oppose this legislation are simply unwilling to accept the \ncompromise that has been agreed to by both Houses of Congress, despite \nefforts from all quarters to try to accommodate reasonable concerns. \nMost reasonable people would agree\n\n[[Page S1516]]\n\nthat it is a practical impossibility for each legislator to get every \nsingle thing they want out of any particular piece of legislation, but \nthat doesn't mean the American people should be left with nothing and \nbe stripped bare of the protections the PATRIOT Act has been so \neffective at delivering.\n  The art of compromise is, at times, a bitter pill, particularly when \nmatters of such profound consequence as our national security and \nwaging the war on terror hang in the balance. I personally supported \nleaving sections 215, 213, and other provisions of the PATRIOT Act \nalone. I also wanted to add administrative subpoenas to the PATRIOT Act \nand to add judicial review for national security letters.\n  I also feel very strongly about ensuring that the 9/11 Commission's \nrecommendations with regard to risk-based funding for homeland security \ngrant moneys are implemented and personally pushed for such a provision \nduring these negotiations. Senator Specter made it clear to me that he \nwould try to seek consensus but that my demands would not be met in all \nregards.\n  While I did not get everything I wanted and while I believe what I \nwanted was in the best interests of my country, I support this bill. I \nam simply unwilling to return the American people to the pre-9/11 law \nenforcement tools which so poorly served our national interests at that \ntime. And while this legislation is not perfect in every regard, it \nrepresents what I believe are the best efforts of the Congress to \narrive at an acceptable compromise.\n  The national security has been well served by the PATRIOT Act since \nits original passage in a way that is both consistent with our national \nvalues and the protection of civil liberties. The war on terror must be \nwaged in a manner consistent with American values and American \nprinciples.\n  The hysteria over this legislation is simply hard for me to \nunderstand. The fact that people in too many instances have not focused \non the hard-fought attempts to balance our security and civil liberty \nconcerns is, I believe, a disservice to the American people. This \ndebate does not concern a typical policy disagreement about taxes or \nother issues; in fact, the stakes are much higher.\n  The PATRIOT Act was enacted in 2001 by an overwhelming bipartisan \nmargin--98 to 1 in the Senate and 357 to 66 in the House. At that time, \nSenators on both sides of the aisle agreed that this legislation struck \na wise and careful balance between national security and civil \nliberties.\n  The law, to date, has had a successful track record. In addition to \nhelping prevent any terrorist attacks in this country since 9/11 and \nplaying such a critical role in dismantling several terrorist cells \nwithin the United States, the Department of Justice inspector general \nhas consistently found no systemic abuses of any of the act's \nprovisions.\n  I support these recent concessions that have made this bill what it \nis today--and one in particular. Before these changes, a recipient of a \n215 order seemingly could challenge the nondisclosure obligation at any \ntime. The new revisions make clear that a recipient cannot challenge \nthis requirement for 1 year, and it ensures that the conclusive \npresumption applies to these orders as well--something that was not \nclear before reaching this compromise agreement.\n  The remaining changes seemed to me to be quite sensible; that is, \nrecipients of a 215 order or a national security letter do not have to \ntell the FBI that they have or will consult an attorney or that a \nlibrary is not an electronic or wire communications provider unless, of \ncourse, they happen to be such a provider.\n  Prior to the PATRIOT Act, we know there were barriers that seriously \nhindered information sharing among law enforcement agencies and \nintelligence agencies, and those barriers imperiled our Nation. This \nwas described by Patrick Fitzgerald in his testimony before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. I quote:\n\n       I was on a prosecution team in New York that began a \n     criminal investigation of Osama bin Laden in early 1996. The \n     team--prosecutors and FBI agents assigned to the criminal \n     case--had access to a number of sources. We could talk to \n     citizens. We could talk to local police officers. We could \n     talk to foreign police officers. Even foreign intelligence \n     personnel. We could talk to foreign citizens. And we did all \n     of those things as often as we could. We could even talk to \n     al-Qaida members--and we did. We actually called several \n     members and associates of al-Qaida to testify before a grand \n     jury in New York. And we even debriefed al-Qaida members \n     overseas who agreed to become cooperating witnesses. But \n     there was one group of people we were not permitted to talk \n     to. Who? The FBI agents across the street from us in lower \n     Manhattan assigned to a parallel intelligence investigation \n     of Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. We could not learn what \n     information they had gathered. That was the wall.\n\n  I am confident I am not the only one who is astounded at that \nstatement. Consider our progress in the war on terror since the PATRIOT \nAct's enactment: Information sharing between intelligence and law \nenforcement personnel has been critical in dismantling terrorist \noperations, including the Portland Seven in Oregon, as well as a \nterrorist cell in Lackawanna, NY.\n  It has helped prosecute several people involved in an al-Qaida drugs-\nfor-weapons scheme in San Diego, two of whom have already pleaded \nguilty.\n  Furthermore, nine associates of an al-Qaida-associated Northern \nVirginia violent extremist group were convicted and sentenced to prison \nterms ranging from 4 years to life.\n  Two Yemeni citizens have been charged and convicted for conspiring to \nprovide material support to al-Qaida and Hamas.\n  An individual has been convicted of perjury and illegally acting as \nan agent of the former Government of Iraq by a jury in January of 2004.\n  And the executive director of the Illinois-based Benevolence \nInternational Foundation, who has had a longstanding relationship with \nOsama bin Laden, pleaded guilty to racketeering and furthermore \nadmitted that he diverted thousands of dollars from his charity \norganization to support Islamic militant groups in Bosnia and Chechnya.\n  These tools simply must remain available to those on the front lines \nwho continue to wage the war on terror. The very safety of our Nation \ndepends on it.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues--and perhaps some of them \nhave seen this op-ed piece--a piece written by Debra Burlingame, the \nsister of Charles F. ``Chic'' Burlingame III, the pilot of American \nAirlines flight 77 which crashed into the Pentagon on September 11, \n2001. This op-ed was originally published in the Wall Street Journal, \nand I believe it articulates precisely why this legislation must be \nreauthorized without delay.\n  I will read an excerpt, and I ask unanimous consent that the complete \nop-ed be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, Ms. Burlingame writes:\n\n       A mere four-and-a-half years after victims were forced to \n     choose between being burned alive and jumping from 90 \n     stories, it is frankly shocking that there is anyone in \n     Washington who would politicize the Patriot Act. It is an \n     insult to those who died to tell the American people that the \n     organization posing the greatest threat to their liberty is \n     not al Qaeda but the FBI. Hearing any member of Congress \n     actually crow about ``killing'' or ``playing chicken'' with \n     this critical legislation is as disturbing today as it would \n     have been when Ground Zero was still smoldering. Today we \n     know in far greater detail what not having it cost us.\n\n  She continues:\n\n       The Senate will soon convene hearings on renewal of the \n     Patriot Act--\n\n  And indeed we had those hearings--\n\n     and the NSA terrorist surveillance program. A minority of \n     Senators want to gamble with American lives and ``fix'' \n     national security laws which they can't show are broken. They \n     seek to eliminate or weaken anti-terrorism measures which \n     take into account that the Cold War in its slow-moving, \n     analog world of landlines and stationary targets is gone. The \n     threat we face today is a completely new paradigm of global \n     terrorist networks operating in a high-velocity digital age \n     using the Web and fiber-optic technology. After four-and-a-\n     half years without another terrorist attack, these senators \n     think we're safe enough to cave in to the same civil \n     liberties lobby that supported that deadly FISA wall in the \n     first place. What if they, like those lawyers and judges, are \n     simply wrong?\n       Why should we allow enemies to annihilate us simply because \n     we lack the clarity or resolve to strike a reasonable balance \n     between\n\n[[Page S1517]]\n\n     a healthy skepticism of government power and the need to take \n     proactive measures to protect ourselves from such threats? \n     The mantra of civil-liberties hard-liners is to ``question \n     authority''--even when it is coming to our rescue--then blame \n     that same authority when, hamstrung by civil liberties laws, \n     it fails to save us. . . .More Americans should not die \n     because the peace-at-any-cost fringe and antigovernment \n     paranoids still fighting the ghost of Nixon hate George Bush \n     more than they fear al Qaeda. Ask the American people what \n     they want. They will say that they want the commander in \n     chief to use all reasonable means to catch the people who are \n     trying to rain terror on our cities. Those who cite the \n     soaring principle of individual liberty do not appear to \n     appreciate that our enemies are not seeking to destroy \n     individuals, but rather whole populations.\n\n  She concludes:\n\n       The public has listened to years of stinging revelations \n     detailing how the government tied its own hands in stopping \n     the devastating attacks of September 11. It is an \n     irresponsible violation of the public trust for members of \n     Congress to weaken the Patriot Act or jeopardize the NSA \n     terrorist surveillance program because of the same illusory \n     theories that cost us so dearly before, or worse, for rank \n     partisan advantage. If they do, and our country sustains yet \n     another catastrophic attack that these antiterrorism tools \n     could have prevented, the phrase ``connect the dots'' will \n     resonate again--but this time it will refer to the trail of \n     innocent American blood which leads directly to the Senate \n     floor.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to heed the words of Ms. Burlingame. And today I \njoin my voice with hers and the millions of Americans who are calling \nfor us to do our duty and to do our utmost to protect this country and \nthe American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From opinionjournal.com, Jan. 30, 2006]\n\n                         Our Right to Security\n\n                         (By Debra Burlingame)\n\n       One of the most excruciating images of the September 11 \n     attacks is the sight of a man who was trapped in one of the \n     World Trade Center towers. Stripped of his suit jacket and \n     tie and hanging on to what appears to be his office curtains, \n     he is seen trying to lower himself outside a window to the \n     floor immediately below. Frantically kicking his legs in an \n     effort to find a purchase, he loses his grip, and falls.\n       That horrific scene and thousands more were the images that \n     awakened a sleeping nation on that long, brutal morning. \n     Instead of overwhelming fear or paralyzing self-doubt, the \n     attacks were met with defiance, unity and a sense of moral \n     purpose. Following the heroic example of ordinary citizens \n     who put their fellow human beings and the public good ahead \n     of themselves, the country's leaders cast aside politics and \n     personal ambition and enacted the USA Patriot Act just 45 \n     days later.\n       A mere four-and-a-half years after victims were forced to \n     choose between being burned alive and jumping from 90 \n     stories, it is frankly shocking that there is anyone in \n     Washington who would politicize the Patriot Act.

Today we \n     know in far greater detail what not having it cost us.\n       Critics contend that the Patriot Act was rushed into law in \n     a moment of panic. The truth is, the policies and guidelines \n     it corrected had a long, troubled history and everybody who \n     had to deal with them knew it. The ``wall'' was a tortuous \n     set of rules promulgated by Justice Department lawyers in \n     1995 and imagined into law by the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act (FISA) court. Conceived as an added \n     protection for civil liberties provisions already built into \n     the statute, it was the wall and its real-world ramifications \n     that hardened the failure-to-share culture between agencies, \n     allowing early information about 9/11 hijackers Khalid al-\n     Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi to fall through the cracks. More \n     perversely, even after the significance of these terrorists \n     and their presence in the country was known by the FBI's \n     intelligence division, the wall prevented it from talking to \n     its own criminal division in order to hunt them down.\n       Furthermore, it was the impenetrable FISA guidelines and \n     fear of provoking the FISA court's wrath if they were \n     transgressed that discouraged risk-averse FBI supervisors \n     from applying for a FISA search warrant in the Zacarias \n     Moussaoui case. The search, finally conducted on the \n     afternoon of 9/11, produced names and phone numbers of people \n     in the thick of the 9/11 plot, so many fertile clues that \n     investigators believe that at least one airplane, if not all \n     four, could have been saved.\n       In 2002, FISA's appellate level Court of Review examined \n     the entire statutory scheme for issuing warrants in national \n     security investigations and declared the ``wall'' a \n     nonsensical piece of legal overkill, based neither on express \n     statutory language nor reasonable interpretation of the FISA \n     statute. The lower court's attempt to micromanage the \n     execution of national security warrants was deemed an \n     assertion of authority which neither Congress or the \n     Constitution granted it. In other words, those lawyers and \n     judges who created, implemented and so assiduously enforced \n     the FISA guidelines were wrong and the American people paid \n     dearly for it.\n       Despite this history, some members of Congress contend that \n     this process-heavy court is agile enough to rule on quickly \n     needed National Security Agency (NSA) electronic surveillance \n     warrants. This is a dubious claim. Getting a FISA warrant \n     requires a multistep review involving several lawyers at \n     different offices within the Department of Justice. It can \n     take days, weeks, even months if there is a legal dispute \n     between the principals. ``Emergency'' 72-hour intercepts \n     require sign-offs by NSA lawyers and preapproval by the \n     attorney general before surveillance can be initiated. \n     Clearly, this is not conducive to what Gen. Michael Hayden, \n     principal deputy director of national intelligence, calls \n     ``hot pursuit'' of al Qaeda conversations.\n       The Senate will soon convene hearings on renewal of the \n     Patriot Act and the NSA terrorist surveillance program. A \n     minority of senators want to gamble with American lives and \n     ``fix'' national security laws, which they can't show are \n     broken. They seek to eliminate or weaken anti-terrorism \n     measures which take into account that the Cold War and its \n     slow-moving, analog world of landlines and stationary targets \n     is gone. The threat we face today is a completely new \n     paradigm of global terrorist networks operating in a high-\n     velocity digital age using the Web and fiber-optic \n     technology. After four-and-a-half years without another \n     terrorist attack, these senators think we're safe enough to \n     cave in to the same civil liberties lobby that supported that \n     deadly FISA wall in the first place. What if they, like those \n     lawyers and judges, are simply wrong?\n       Meanwhile, the media, mouthing phrases like ``Article II \n     authority,'' ``separation of powers'' and ``right to \n     privacy,'' are presenting the issues as if politics have \n     nothing to do with what is driving the subject matter and its \n     coverage. They want us to forget four years of relentless \n     ``connect-the-dots'' reporting about the missed chances that \n     ``could have prevented 9/11.'' They have discounted the \n     relevance of references to the two 9/11 hijackers who lived \n     in San Diego. But not too long ago, the media itself reported \n     that phone records revealed that five or six of the hijackers \n     made extensive calls overseas.\n       NBC News aired an ``exclusive'' story in 2004 that \n     dramatically recounted how al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar, the San \n     Diego terrorists who would later hijack American Airlines \n     flight 77 and fly it into the Pentagon, received more than a \n     dozen calls from an al Qaeda ``switchboard'' inside Yemen \n     where al-Mihdhar's brother-in-law lived. The house received \n     calls from Osama Bin Laden and relayed them to operatives \n     around the world.\n       Senior correspondent Lisa Myers told the shocking story of \n     how, ``The NSA had the actual phone number in the United \n     States that the switchboard was calling, but didn't deploy \n     that equipment, fearing it would be accused of domestic \n     spying.'' Back then, the NBC script didn't describe it as \n     ``spying on Americans.'' Instead, it was called one of the \n     ``missed opportunities that could have saved 3,000 lives.''\n       Another example of opportunistic coverage concerns the \n     Patriot Act's ``library provision.'' News reports have given \n     plenty of ink and airtime to the ACLU's unsupported claims \n     that the government has abused this important records \n     provision. But how many Americans know that several of the \n     hijackers repeatedly accessed computers at public libraries \n     in New Jersey and Florida, using personal Internet accounts \n     to carry out the conspiracy? Al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi logged \n     on four times at a college library in New Jersey where they \n     purchased airline tickets for AA 77 and later confirmed their \n     reservations on Aug. 30. In light of this, it is ridiculous \n     to suggest that the Justice Department has the time, \n     resources or interest in ``investigating the reading habits \n     of law abiding citizens.''\n       We now have the ability to put remote control cameras on \n     the surface of Mars. Why should we allow enemies to \n     annihilate us simply because we lack the clarity or resolve \n     to strike a reasonable balance between a healthy skepticism \n     of government power and the need to take proactive measures \n     to protect ourselves from such threats? The mantra of civil-\n     liberties hard-liners is to ``question authority''--even when \n     it is coming to our rescue--then blame that same authority \n     when, hamstrung by civil liberties laws, it fails to save us. \n     The old laws that would prevent FBI agents from stopping the \n     next al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi were built on the bedrock of a \n     35-year history of dark, defeating mistrust. More Americans \n     should not die because the peace-at-any-cost fringe and \n     antigovernment paranoids still fighting the ghost of Nixon \n     hate George Bush more than they fear al Qaeda. Ask the \n     American people what they want. They will say that they want \n     the commander in chief to use all reasonable means to catch \n     the people who are trying to rain terror on our cities. Those \n     who cite the soaring principle of individual liberty do not \n     appear to appreciate that our enemies are not seeking to \n     destroy individuals, but whole populations.\n       Three weeks before 9/11, an FBI agent with the bin Laden \n     case squad in New York learned that al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi \n     were in this country. He pleaded with the national security \n     gatekeepers in Washington to launch a nationwide manhunt and \n     was summarily told to stand down. When the FISA\n\n[[Page S1518]]\n\n     Court of Review tore down the wall in 2002, it included in \n     its ruling the agent's Aug. 29, 2001, email to FBI \n     headquarters: ``Whatever has happened to this--someday \n     someone will die--and wall or not--the public will not \n     understand why we were not more effective and throwing every \n     resource we had at certain problems. Let's hope the National \n     Security Law Unit will stand behind their decisions then, \n     especially since the biggest threat to us now, [bin Laden], \n     is getting the most `protection.' ''\n       The public has listened to years of stinging revelations \n     detailing how the government tied its own hands in stopping \n     the devastating attacks of September 11. It is an \n     irresponsible violation of the public trust for members of \n     Congress to weaken the Patriot Act or jeopardize the NSA \n     terrorist surveillance program because of the same illusory \n     theories that cost us so dearly before, or worse, for rank \n     partisan advantage. If they do, and our country sustains yet \n     another catastrophic attack that these antiterrorism tools \n     could have prevented, the phrase ``connect the dots'' will \n     resonate again--but this time it will refer to the trail of \n     innocent American blood which leads directly to the Senate \n     floor.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, later today we will have a cloture vote \non S. 2271. We should not end debate on this bill, and we should not \npass this bill. Doing so will only help implement the deeply flawed \ndeal that was struck with the White House to reauthorize the PATRIOT \nAct without enacting the core civil liberties protections for which so \nmany of us have fought. So I urge my colleagues to vote no on cloture.\n  Everybody in this body wants to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act. Many of \nthe expiring provisions are entirely noncontroversial. But we also need \nto fix the provisions that went too far, that do not contain the checks \nand balances necessary to protect our rights and freedoms. This \nreauthorization process is our chance to get it right, and moving \nforward with this bill takes us one step closer to wasting that chance.\n  Back in December, 46 Senators voted against cloture on the PATRIOT \nAct conference report. I think it is clear by now that the deal makes \nonly minor changes to that conference report, which remains as flawed \ntoday as it was 2 months ago. The Senator from Pennsylvania, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee and the primary proponent of the \nconference report in this body, was quoted as saying that the changes \nthat the White House agreed to were ``cosmetic.'' And then he said, \naccording to the AP:\n\n       But sometimes cosmetics will make a beauty out of a beast \n     and provide enough cover for Senators to change their vote.\n\n  Since this deal was announced, editorial pages of newspapers also \nhave pointed out how minimal these changes are and have urged Senators \nnot to change their votes. Let me read a few examples.\n  The editorial board of the Roanoke Times in Virginia had this to say \non February 11:\n\n       A compromise that is expected to clear the way for the \n     law's reauthorization is a victory of fear over strength. The \n     ``compromise'' the White House and congressional leaders \n     reached this week on reauthorization of the USA PATRIOT Act \n     is a compromise of the basic freedoms that define this \n     Nation. The Bush administration has made a few minor \n     concessions, enough to give the handful of defiant Senate \n     Republicans and some of their Democratic allies cover to \n     extend the broad antiterrorism bill and claim they have done \n     what they could to protect the civil liberties of innocent \n     Americans. They have not.\n\n  That same day from the New York Times we heard this:\n\n       The PATRIOT Act has been one of the few issues on which \n     Congress has shown backbone lately. Last year, it refused to \n     renew expiring parts of the act until greater civil liberties \n     protections were added. But key members of the Senate have \n     now caved, agreeing to renew these provisions in exchange for \n     only minimal improvements. At a time when the public is \n     growing increasingly concerned about the lawlessness of the \n     Bush administration's domestic spying, the Senate should \n     insist that any reauthorization agreement do more to protect \n     Americans against improper secret searches.\n\n  From my own home State, this is from the Wisconsin State Journal on \nFebruary 18:\n\n       In recent weeks, Senators have worked with the White House \n     to produce a compromise. However, the compromise remains far \n     short of what is required to protect Americans' civil \n     liberties. Regrettably, the Senate has backed down from its \n     earlier stand and is poised to pass the inadequate bill.\n\n  These editorial boards and millions of Americans across the country \nrecognize what everybody in this body already knows: that this deal \nmakes only minor--yes, cosmetic--changes to the conference report that \nwas blocked in December. The deal is woefully inadequate, and let me \nexplain why.\n  I start by reminding my colleagues of the context for this deal. Back \nin November and December, when so many of us were fighting for \nimprovements to the conference report, we made very clear what we were \nasking for. We laid out five issues that needed to be addressed to get \nour support, and I am going to read quickly excerpts from a letter we \nsent explaining our concerns because I think it will help demonstrate \nwhy this deal is so bad and so inadequate. Here are the problems we \nidentified and the changes we asked for several months ago.\n  On section 215, we said:\n\n       The draft conference report would allow the Government to \n     obtain sensitive personal information on a mere showing of \n     relevance. This would allow Government fishing expeditions. \n     As business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have \n     argued, the Government should be required to convince a judge \n     that the records they are seeking have some connection to a \n     suspected terrorist or spy.\n\n  Next, we discussed gag orders, both for section 215 orders and \nnational security letters:\n\n       The draft conference report does not permit the recipient \n     of a section 215 order to challenge its automatic, permanent \n     gag order. Courts have held that similar restrictions violate \n     the First Amendment. The recipient of a section 215 order is \n     entitled to meaningful judicial review of the gag order.\n       The draft conference report does not provide meaningful \n     judicial review of an NSL's gag order. It requires the court \n     to accept as conclusive the Government's assertion that a gag \n     order should not be lifted, unless the court determines the \n     Government is acting in bad faith. The recipients of NSLs are \n     entitled to meaningful judicial review of a gag order.\n\n  We then moved on to national security letters more generally. The \ndraft conference report does not sunset the NSL authority. In light of \nrecent revelations about possible abuses of NSLs, the NSL provision \nshould sunset in no more than 4 years when the Congress will have an \nopportunity to review the use of this power.\n  Finally, we addressed sneak-and-peek search warrants. The draft \nconference report requires the Government to notify the target of a \nsneak-and-peek search no earlier than 30 days after the search rather \nthan within 7 days as the Senate bill provides and as pre-PATRIOT Act \njudicial decisions required. The conference report should include a \npresumption that notice will be provided within a significantly shorter \nperiod in order to protect fourth amendment rights. The availability of \nadditional 90-day extensions means that a shorter initial timeframe \nshould not be a hardship on the Government.\n  Again, these quotes are from a letter we sent late last year. Now, \nyou might ask, in this newly announced deal on the PATRIOT Act, have \nany of these five problems been solved?\n  The answer is no, not a single one. Only one of these issues has even \nbeen partially addressed by this deal, but it has not been fixed.\n  This deal only makes a few small changes. First, it would permit \njudicial review of section 215 gag orders, but under conditions that \nwould make it very difficult for anyone to obtain meaningful judicial \nreview. Under the deal, judicial review can only take place after a \nyear has passed, and it can only be successful if the recipient of the \nsection 215 order proves that the Government has acted in bad faith. As \nmany have argued in the context of the national security letters, now \nthat is a virtually impossible standard to meet. We need meaningful \njudicial review of these gag orders, not just the illusion of it.\n  Second, the deal would specifically allow the Government to serve \nnational security letters on libraries if the library comes within the \ncurrent requirements of the NSL statute. This is a provision that \nappears to just restate current law. Even the American\n\n[[Page S1519]]\n\nLibrary Association has called it nothing other than a fig leaf.\n  Third, the deal would clarify that people who receive a national \nsecurity letter or a section 215 order would not have to tell the FBI \nif they consult with an attorney. Now, this last change is a positive \nstep, but it is only one relatively minor change. So that is what we \nare left with: one relatively minor improvement. That is nowhere near \nenough.\n  Ordinarily, when we debate a flawed bill such as this one, we at \nleast have the chance to improve it on the Senate floor by offering \namendments, and I have been trying to do just that to make sure we \ndon't miss the opportunity to address the core problem with the PATRIOT \nAct that so many of us have been fighting to fix. Before the recess, I \nfiled four amendments to S. 2271, but I was prevented from calling them \nup because the majority leader used the procedural tactic of filling \nthe amendment tree in order to prevent Senators from offering and \ngetting votes on amendments. Using procedural maneuvers like this to \nprevent the Senate from debating and voting on amendments is an insult \nto the institution, and it is an insult to every one of my colleagues. \nWe are being told that we have no choice but to accept the deal that a \nfew Members cut with the White House, without being allowed to even try \nto change a single word.\n  We do have a choice--to oppose cloture on this bill and insist that \nany deal include meaningful civil liberties protections. I don't know \nif the majority leader fears that my amendments would actually pass or \nif he just wants to protect Senators from having to explain why they \noppose basic protections for law-abiding Americans, but that should not \nbe how the Senate does its business. Offering, debating, and voting on \namendments is what the Senate is supposed to be all about. That is how \nwe are supposed to craft legislation. Trying to ram this deal through \nwithout a real amending process is a cynical maneuver that we should \nall reject, regardless of how we may feel about the merits of the bill.\n  If my colleagues want to vote against my amendments, that is their \nright. But no one has the right to turn this body into a rubberstamp.\n  Let's take a step back and consider the process that got us here \ntoday. As we know, conference reports are not amendable. They come to \nthis body as a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. Those are the rules, \nand we all understand them and play by them. In December, we understood \nthat. In December, we just said no. We said no to the PATRIOT Act \nconference report.\n  Now we have a new bill, the product of a side deal with the White \nHouse, that is essentially an amendment to the conference report. It is \neven drafted that way. Each section of the bill amends the underlying \nlaw, as amended by the conference report. That is right. The bill we \nare considering today amends a law that hasn't even been passed by the \nSenate, much less signed into law. As I understand it, this bill, \nshould both Houses of Congress pass it, will have to sit on the \nPresident's desk unsigned until the President signs the conference \nreport bill into law.\n\n  The proponents of this deal want to effectively amend the conference \nreport which couldn't pass the Senate in December, even though \nconference reports are unamendable, and they want to do it by \ncircumventing the regular legislative process with a bill that no one \nis being allowed to amend, even though the bill did not go through \ncommittee, let alone a conference. How is that fair? Why should a \nhandful of members of this body be able to amend an unamendable \nconference report with a deal struck by the White House, and then \nprevent the Senate from working its will on that deal?\n  How can one group of Senators amend the conference report but prevent \nother Senators from trying to do the same thing? How is that possible?\n  The answer is that it is not possible unless the Senate lets it \nhappen. And the vote we will have later today is the vote where we will \nfind out if the Senate will let it happen.\n  I hope even colleagues who may support the deal will oppose such a \nsham process. It makes no sense to agree to end debate without a \nguarantee that we will be allowed to actually try to improve the bill, \nand it is a discourtesy to all Senators, not just me, to try to ram \nthrough controversial legislation without the chance to improve it.\n  My amendments are limited and reasonable. I spoke about them at \nlength before the recess, but let me just take a few minutes to explain \nagain what they would do.\n  First, amendment No. 2892 would implement the standard for obtaining \nsection 215 orders that was in the Senate bill that the Judiciary \nCommittee approved by a vote of 18 to 0, and that was agreed to in the \nSenate without objection. This is obviously a very reasonable amendment \nthat every Senator in one way or another has basically supported.\n  It took hard work, but the Judiciary Committee came up with language \non section 215 that protects innocent Americans, while also allowing \nthe Government to do what it needs to do to investigate and prevent \nterrorism. The Senate standard would require the Government to convince \na judge that a person has some connection to terrorism or espionage \nbefore obtaining their sensitive records.\n  The Senate standard is the following: One, that the records pertain \nto a terrorist or spy; two, that the records pertain to an individual \nin contact with or known to a suspected terrorist or spy; or--and I \nemphasize ``or''--three, that the records are relevant to the \nactivities of a suspected terrorist or spy. That is the standard my \namendment would impose.\n  This would not limit the types of records that the Government could \nobtain, and it does not go as far to protect law-abiding Americans as I \nmight prefer, but it would make sure the Government cannot go on \nfishing expeditions into the records of innocent people.\n  The conference report did away with this delicate compromise, \nreplacing the three-prong test with a simple and quite broad relevance \nstandard which could arguably justify the collection of all kinds of \ninformation about perfectly law-abiding Americans.\n  Of all the concerns that have been raised about the PATRIOT Act since \nit was passed in 2001, section 215 is the one that has received the \nmost public attention, and rightly so. A reauthorization bill that \ndoesn't fix this provision, in my view, has no credibility.\n  My second amendment is amendment No. 2893, which would ensure the \nrecipients of business records orders under section 215 of the PATRIOT \nAct and also recipients of national security letters can get meaningful \njudicial review of the gag orders they are subject to.\n  Under the conference report, as modified by the Sununu bill, \nrecipients of these documents would theoretically have the ability to \nchallenge the gag orders in court, but the standard for getting the gag \norders overturned would be virtually impossible to meet. In order to \nprevail in challenging the NSL or section 215 gag order, the recipient \nwould have to prove that any certification by the Government that \ndisclosure would harm national security or impair diplomatic relations \nwas made in bad faith. There would be what many have called a \nconclusive presumption that the gag order stands, unless the recipient \ncan prove that the Government acted in bad faith. Again, I simply don't \nthink that anyone could reasonably call this meaningful judicial \nreview.\n  My amendment would eliminate the bad faith showing currently required \nfor overturning both section 215 and NSL gag orders. And it would no \nlonger require recipients of section 215 orders to wait a year before \nthey can challenge the accompanying gag orders, which is actually a new \nrequirement in the Sununu bill.\n  My third amendment, amendment No. 2891, would add to the conference \nreport one additional 4-year sunset provision. It would sunset the \nnational security letter authorities that were expanded by the PATRIOT \nAct. It would simply add that sunset to the already existing 4-year \nsunsets that are in the conference report with respect to section 206, \nsection 215, and the so-called lone wolf provision.\n  National security letters, or NSLs, are finally starting to get the \nattention they deserve. This authority was expanded by sections 358 and \n505 of the PATRIOT Act. The issue of NSLs has flown under the radar for \nyears, even though many of us have been trying to bring more public \nattention to it.\n\n[[Page S1520]]\n\n  National security letters are issued by the FBI to businesses to \nobtain certain kinds of records without any--any--sort of court \napproval whatsoever. NSLs can be used to obtain three types of business \nrecords: subscriber and transactional information related to Internet \nand phone usage; credit reports; and financial records, a category that \nhas been expanded to include records from all kinds of everyday \nbusinesses such as jewelers, car dealers, travel agents, and even \ncasinos. This is a very broad power. I can think of no reason Congress \nwould not want to place a sunset on these authorities to ensure we have \nthe opportunity to take a close look at them.\n  Finally, my fourth amendment, amendment No. 2894, concerns so-called \nsneak-and-peek searches, whereby the Government can secretly search \npeople's houses in everyday criminal investigations and not provide \nnotice of the search until afterward. The key issue here is how long \nthe Government should be allowed to wait, at least in most cases, \nbefore it notifies individuals that their homes have been searched. The \nSenate bill said 7 days, 7 days should be the presumption, with the \nability to get extensions if necessary, but the conference report does \naway with that and instead allows a delay of 30 days in most cases.\n\n  My amendment would restore the key component in the Senate compromise \nby requiring that subjects of sneak-and-peek searches be notified of \nthe search within 7 days unless a judge grants an extension of that \ntime because there is good reason to still keep the search secret.\n  It makes no other change in the conference report other than changing \n30 days to 7 days.\n  Those are my amendments. They are eminently reasonable. They are \nconsistent with provisions that we approved in the Senate last year or \nthey were central to the concerns raised by so many Senators late last \nyear. So these are obviously not extreme ideas, and the Senate should \nbe allowed to vote on these four amendments. All of us have as much \nright as the Senators who struck a deal with the White House to try to \namend the conference report.\n  I am happy to report that the Senator from Pennsylvania, the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, thinks these are reasonable amendments, \ntoo. In fact, he thinks they are so reasonable that late yesterday he \nannounced that he is going to combine them into a single bill and \nintroduce it today and try to move it through the Judiciary Committee. \nThat is right. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the chief \nproponent in this body of the PATRIOT Act reauthorization conference \nreport and of the White House deal the Senate is being asked to ratify, \nhas taken the four amendments I just described and, with a few minor \ntweaks, he has introduced them as a bill.\n  I must say, I guess I am flattered and, of course, I will support \nthat bill, but there is an alternative to the lengthy and uncertain \nlegislative process that awaits the chairman's new bill, and that is to \nsimply allow the Senate to vote on my amendments this week. The \nchairman could offer them with me. We could make a pretty powerful team \non this issue, maybe. We have the perfect and logical vehicle for these \namendments to the PATRIOT Act before us right now. All we need to do is \nadd the chairman's reasonable proposals to this bill and send it to the \nHouse, where it would almost certainly pass if the leadership would \nsimply allow it to be voted on.\n  These provisions, most of which come right out of the bill that \npassed the Senate without objection last July, could become law in a \nmatter of weeks rather than a year or more from now, if ever.\n  My amendments and Senator Specter's bill are simply what the \nbipartisan group asked for back in December when we blocked the PATRIOT \nAct reauthorization conference report. Our requests were reasonable \nthen, and they are reasonable now. The only reason we are considering a \npackage that doesn't include them is that the White House played \nhardball, and the decision was made by some to capitulate.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the flawed deal we are being asked to ratify, \nand I oppose the sham process that the Senate is facing here. We still \nhave not fixed some of the most significant problems of the PATRIOT \nAct, and if we allow the conference report to go through, the \nchairman's sincere hopes notwithstanding, I fear that we will lose that \nchance for at least another 4 years. So I must oppose cloture on this \nbill, which will allow the deal to go forward.\n  Before I yield the floor, let me ask one more time for unanimous \nconsent to set the pending amendments aside so that I may call up \namendment No. 2892, the amendment to modify the standard for section \n215 orders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as Senator from New Hampshire, \nI object.\n  Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, that objection says it all. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on cloture, not only because this deal is flawed \nbut also because of the tactics being used to prevent votes on \nreasonable, relevant amendments--reasonable, relevant amendments that \nwould improve the flawed bill we are debating.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about the bill \nbefore us, a bill that I introduced and the details of which I helped \nwork out over a period of 5 or 6 weeks following the delay of the \nconference report to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act at the end of last \nyear.\n  I recognize that this legislation, like almost any piece of \nlegislation that is dealt with in Congress and in the Senate, in \nparticular, represents a compromise. If you pursue every piece of \nlegislation insisting that you get everything you asked for in that \nbill, in all likelihood you will never get anything you are seeking, \nand you certainly would not be able to count on the long-term support \nof others in this institution who might have requests or initiatives \nwith which you might not agree. A compromise is always necessary.\n  But I think in this case the legislation represents a substantial \nstep forward in terms of better safeguarding our civil liberties from \nwhere we were with the current law and, equally important, allows us to \nlock in, to get enacted into law a number of other improvements that \nmany of us worked very hard on in a bipartisan way.\n  I understand that Senator Feingold doesn't support the legislation. \nThat is certainly his right, his prerogative. But I think he \nshortchanges the nature of these improvements.\n  I want to touch on the three elements of this bill so that all \nSenators and the public understand how these three provisions take us \nforward. Maybe the agreement represented in this bill does not move us \nas far forward as he or I or others in the Senate might like, but its \nmoves us forward nonetheless.\n  First, in this bill, we create an explicit review of the gag order \nthat accompanies a 215 subpoena. He has criticized the fact that there \nis a 12-month waiting period for taking that gag order before a judge.\n  In our legislation, the SAFE Act, we had a 3-month waiting period. We \nasked for a 3-month waiting period, and we ended up with a 12-month \nwaiting period. That is the nature of compromise, but we did get an \nexplicit judicial review of the gag order. I think the principle that \nany gag order be given an opportunity for review before a judge is not \nonly a step forward but a victory on principle, which is extremely \nimportant in this legislation, and I think it will guide us in the \nfuture when we might deal with similar questions.\n  Second, we struck a provision in the delayed conference report that \nrequires the recipient of a national security letter to disclose the \nname of their attorney to the FBI. That is a provision that doesn't \noccur anywhere else in the law. It is a provision that I think could \nhave discouraged people from seeking legal advice. And in the case of a \nnational security letter--a subpoena issued without the approval of a \njudge--we are not talking about a few\n\n[[Page S1521]]\n\ndozen subpoenas or a few dozen individuals or businesses affected; we \nare talking about tens of thousands. Striking that requirement \nregarding the recipient of an NSL notifying the FBI the name of their \nattorney, I think, again, is a very important step forward not only in \nencouraging people to seek legal advice but also a very important \nprinciple to set down in this bill.\n  A third improvement which was not even considered in the remarks of \nSenator Feingold is clarification that a library engaged in the \ntraditional role of lending books, providing books to patrons in \ndigital format, or providing access to the Internet, is not subject to \na national security letter. This is an important clarification of \ncongressional intent, an important clarification of the existing law \nwhich, unfortunately, is not clear on this point.\n  It is not clear because the underlying law uses definitions that were \nwritten 20 years ago before the age of the Internet. I hope the \nJudiciary Committee will take up a full review and evaluation of the \ndefinitions and the standards regarding technology and the underlying \nlaw that is referenced here. In lieu of that, the least we can do is \nprovide clarification as to how and when this law applies to \ninstitutions such as libraries. We have done so in a positive and \nmeaningful way.\n  There are two areas Senator Feingold mentioned where we had not made \nprogress. I am more than willing to recognize we did not get everything \nasked for, even as we significantly improved the conference report. One \nis the standard of conclusive presumption which is a standard he does \nnot support. I do not support imposing this standard of inclusive \npresumption for overturning the 215 and NSL gag orders, but the fact \nremains, as was pointed out by Chairman Specter during our original \ndebate at the end of last year, that this is a standard that was in the \nSenate bill that was passed unanimously last summer. It is quite \nchallenging tactically to try to negotiate out a provision that all \nSenators supported and voted for in the original Senate bill.\n  The second issue is the most problematic, the one where I would like \nto have made more progress. That is in changing the standard for \ngetting a 215 subpoena from one of mere relevance to terrorism \ninvestigation, as is the current law and the standard in the conference \nreport, to having a clear connection to a suspected or known terrorist \nor foreign power. We did not succeed in getting an improvement to the \nstandard itself. However, through the course of negotiations, because \nof the work done by me and Senator Feingold and others, we were able to \nget other requirements and criteria to be met by the government before \na 215 subpoena can be issued which I will speak to in a moment.\n  These three provisions, again, are significant steps forward from the \ndelayed conference report. They are a step forward in the very areas \nthat were raised as concerns at the end of the session. In \nconversations with Senator Feingold and Senator Craig and others after \nwe defeated cloture on the conference report in December, we came back \nto the four priorities about which most of our discussions with the \nadministration took place. We made progress on two of those priorities \nand added the provision clarifying the applicability of national \nsecurity letters to libraries. That is a real success, indeed.\n  It is unfortunate in this debate on the underlying bill has included \nlanguage such as ``capitulation'' and ``caving.'' But it certainly does \nnot bother me. I am very comfortable with the process we used to get \nthese improvements. I am certainly very comfortable with the stand I \ntook, the priorities I raised, and the end result as far as this \nreauthorization process goes. The conference report is a significant \nimprovement over current law and the bill before us today is a \nsignificant improvement to the conference report. However, it is unfair \nto those Members who might not have had the opportunity to work \ndirectly on these issues in Judiciary or directly in our working group \nbut feel this is a good, appropriate improvement and a good compromise, \nto suggest that they are only changing their vote for political \nreasons. There were many individuals--Democrats and Republicans--who \nwere never willing to take a stand on this issue, even though they may \nhave agreed with Senator Feingold, me, or others, about our concerns. \nThey may have wished the issue would go away. There were some Members \nwho claimed to support us but, frankly, when given the opportunity to \nweigh in with the administration or to help move the process forward, \nthey chose not to.\n  It is unfair to criticize those who worked with us--Democrats and \nRepublicans--to push this issue forward, to make these improvements, to \nsuddenly bring their motivation into question when they decide to \nsupport a compromise. I do not think that serves the institution of the \nSenate well, especially as we had before the recess a 93-to-6 vote to \nmove forward. We have leadership on both sides of the aisle supporting \nthis package. I think the ultimate vote on final passage of my bill and \nthe delayed conference report will yield a very strong bipartisan \nagreement also.\n  We can take issue with the level of progress that was made, we can \ntake issue with the underlying substance of the original PATRIOT Act, \nthe conference report, or these additional improvements, but everyone I \nhave dealt with in this process has worked in a very direct, \nstraightforward way. There has been a desire to find common ground, and \nin finding that common ground, to come to a consensus that allowed this \nconference report to move forward.\n  In addition to the three improvements I described, we had previously \ngained improvements in a number of other areas in the conference \nreport. I talked about the 215 standard and the fact we were not \nsuccessful in changing the standard as it exists in current law. We \nwere successful, though, in getting into the conference report the \nrequirement that a statement of facts is provided, a statement of \narticulable facts supporting the 215 subpoena request. We now have \nminimization requirements in the conference report that require the \nJustice Department to eliminate extraneous information, information \ncollected on innocent Americans, and to report to Congress exactly how \nthat is done. We were successful in adding clarity to the roving \nwiretap provision so it is less likely to be abused or misused. We were \nable to improve the sneak-and-peek search warrant.\n  Senator Feingold indicated we supported a 7-day notification period. \nIn the bill we have a 30-day notification period. The original PATRIOT \nAct contains no specific requirement on notice other than that notice \nmust be given to the subject of a search ``in a reasonable amount of \ntime,'' which I think everyone would recognize leaves things to the \nwhim of a prosecutor or a judge unnecessarily.\n  We have 4-year sunsets for the most controversial provisions of this \nbill, including the 215 subpoena power, the roving wiretaps, and the \nlone wolf provisions.\n  Through the work of Senator Leahy, in particular, we were able to get \na criminal penalty for inadvertent disclosure of national security \nletters dropped from the conference report. All of these represent \nsignificant changes from the original act, significant changes included \nin the conference report. And in addition to the three changes in this \nunderlying legislation, we have a better product and one that will \nreceive strong bipartisan support.\n  I look forward to passage of the bill. I was pleased to work with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle in getting this done. In doing \nso, in forcing us to take more time and forcing the administration to \nadd additional protections for civil liberties to the legislation and \nputting together a bipartisan group willing to demand these things, we \nsent an important message, a message that we have a group willing to \nwork in Congress to achieve these improvements and a message to the \nadministration that when we are dealing with these issues, they need to \nbe engaged and active and working toward consensus from the very \nbeginning of the process.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in a few minutes the Senate is going to \nvote on whether one small group of Senators, with the blessing of the \nmajority leader, can effectively amend a conference report while other \nSenators are precluded from offering amendments by a procedural tactic. \nI urge my colleagues, regardless of their views on the White House deal \nor PATRIOT Act reauthorization, to vote against cloture. Senators \nshould not be precluded from offering amendments to important pieces of \nlegislation.\n  In December, 46 Senators voted against cloture on the PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization conference report. The deal we are asked to bless today \nmakes only minor or, in the words of the Senator from Pennsylvania, \n``cosmetic'' changes to that conference report. But regardless of \nwhether you agree with me that the deal does not address the key civil \nliberties issues identified as problems with the conference report in \nDecember, there is no question this is a deal the vast majority of the \nSenate had no role in. A few Senators worked out a few changes with the \nWhite House, and we are now being asked to take it or leave it. That is \nnot how the Senate is supposed to work.\n  I have filed four reasonable amendments. They reflect provisions that \nwere included in the bill the Senate passed in July without objection \nor that were central to the concerns raised by so many Senators late \nlast year. They are so reasonable the Senator from Pennsylvania plans \nto introduce a bill incorporating them and has pledged to pursue it \nafter the conference report becomes law. There is no reason we should \nput off addressing these important concerns that long when we could be \ndebating and voting on them this week.\n  I am also willing to have time agreements limiting debate on my \namendments as long as they get votes. But, again, the majority leader \nhas simply said no. He has filled the amendment tree, effectively \nblocking me or any other Senator from trying to improve this bill \nduring debate. The majority leader has told us the conference report \nwill be amended by this deal cut with the White House by a few \nSenators, and there is nothing the rest of us can do about it.\n  But, of course, there is something we can do about it. We can reject \nthis parliamentary game. These kinds of strong-arm tactics are not \nright. They are an abuse of the process. They are beneath the Senate, \nand I hope my colleagues will send a strong message that it will not be \ntolerated on this bill or any other bill. So I urge my colleagues to \nvote no on cloture and to allow the Senate to consider amendments to \nimprove the PATRIOT Act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Enzi, Lindsey Graham, Jeff Sessions, Saxby \n           Chambliss, John Cornyn, John Thune.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to explain why I will oppose cloture \non the PATRIOT Act Amendments Act. In brief, I will vote against \ncloture to register my objection to the procedural maneuver under which \nSenators have been blocked from offering any amendments to this bill.\n  While I will vote against cloture, I nonetheless support the \nunderlying bill offered by the Senator from New Hampshire, which \nimproves the PATRIOT Act. The Sununu bill puts in place more checks on \nthe expanded authorities granted to the Government by the PATRIOT Act, \nwithout interfering with the Government's ability to protect Americans \nfrom terrorism.\n  I support the PATRIOT Act. I voted for it in 2001, and I voted for a \nreauthorization bill that passed the Senate unanimously last summer. In \nDecember, however, I voted against cloture on a conference report to \nreauthorize the PATRIOT Act. I opposed that bill because it returned \nfrom the House-Senate conference without adequate checks to protect the \nprivacy of innocent Americans.\n  In my view Congress should give the executive branch the tools it \nneeds to fight terrorism, combined with strong oversight to protect \nagainst Government overreaching and abuse of these tools.\n  Senator Sununu has negotiated several needed improvements with the \nWhite House. His bill would allow for judicial review of the gag order \nimposed by the PATRIOT Act when the Government seeks business records. \nIt would also restrict Federal access to library records, and it would \neliminate the requirement that recipients of a national security letter \ntell the FBI the identity of any lawyer they consult.\n  The Sununu bill is a step in the right direction, and therefore I \nwill support it.\n  Of course even a good bill can be improved. That is why we have an \namendment process in the Senate. The junior Senator from Wisconsin has \ntried to offer a small number of relevant\n\n[[Page S1523]]\n\namendments that I believe would make this bill even better. I am \ndisappointed that he has been denied that opportunity by a procedural \nmaneuver known as ``filling the amendment tree.''\n  This is a very bad practice. It runs against the basic nature of the \nSenate. The hallmark of the Senate is free speech and open debate. Rule \nXXII establishes a process for cutting off debate and amendments, but \nrule XXII should rarely be invoked before any amendments have been \noffered. There is no reason to truncate Senate debate on this important \nbill in this unusual fashion.\n  I will vote against cloture to register my objection to this flawed \nprocess.\n  I expect that cloture will be invoked and that the Sununu bill will \npass. I also expect that the PATRIOT Act reauthorization will pass, now \nthat it has been improved. But the passage of these measures should not \nbe the end of our work. The Senate should continue the effort to \nstrengthen civil liberties in the war on terror.\n  I welcome the bill of Senator Specter which includes many of the \nimprovements Senator Feingold seeks. I look forward to working with him \nto have his legislation enacted into law as soon as possible.\n  In this and other areas, we should give the Government the tools it \nneeds to protect our national security, while placing sensible checks \non the arbitrary exercise of executive power.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on S. \n2271, the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of \n2006, shall be brought to a close?

Mr. President, today Pat Leahy, senior Senator from \nVermont, reached a Senate milestone, to say the least. A few minutes \nago he cast his 12,000th vote. He has voted in the Senate 12,000 times. \nThis is quite an accomplishment. He joins a very elite club, led by the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, who has \nvoted more than 17,000 times; Senator Kennedy, more than 14,000 times; \nSenator Inouye, more than 14,000 times; Senator Stevens, more than \n14,000 times; Senators Biden and Domenici, just over 12,000 times.\n  Pat Leahy came to the Senate in 1974, the youngest Senator in Vermont \nhistory and the only Democrat ever elected to the U.S. Senate in the \nentire history of the State of Vermont--the only one, the first and \nonly. He has been in the Senate 32 years. In each of those votes, \nSenator Leahy voted to make Vermont a better and stronger place.\n  Senator Leahy has a lot of things in mind when he comes to cast a \nvote, but No. 1 on the list is Vermont. That is one of the principal \nreasons Vermont is a great place to live, work, and raise a family.\n  I have worked very closely with Pat Leahy. He is a Senator's Senator. \nHe is able to be as partisan as any Senator we have, but he is also a \nperson who can be as bipartisan as any Senator who has ever served in \nthe Senate. The first example of that is his work with his colleague, \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.\n  I like Pat Leahy for lots of reasons. His legislative skills, of \ncourse, are one of the reasons. But, to me, everything pales when I \nthink of his wife Marcelle. She is a wonderful human being. Pat Leahy \nis who he is because of the wife he has chosen. They have been married \nmore than 40 years. She is a registered nurse. Marcelle Leahy is as \nkind and gentle as anyone would expect a nurse to be. I care about her \na great deal.\n  Pat and Marcelle are very proud of their three children and certainly \nvery proud of their grandchildren. All of us who have been in talking \ndistance of Pat Leahy have heard about his grandchildren. He is not \nbashful about bragging on his grandchildren. His newest grandchild was \nborn earlier this month--in fact, about 27, 28 days ago.\n  I don't think Vermont could ask for anyone better than Pat Leahy. I \nhave been very impressed with his work. On the Judiciary Committee, he \nhas been an advocate for fairness. He has worked with us on judges. It \nhas been difficult and tiresome at times, but he has always done what I \nbelieve to be an outstanding job and a fair job.\n  For farmers, his work on issues relating to dairy has been historic. \nHe has saved hundreds of family farms just in Vermont, and thousands \nand thousands around the country in his work on agriculture. His \nenvironmental credentials are unsurpassed by anyone.\n  Some would question his musical taste, but as far as I am concerned, \nthat is also great. Emmylou Harris, to whom he introduced me, is my \nfavorite. I think I met her personally because of a birthday party Pat \nLeahy had. Then, of course, I am happy to say that Pat Leahy and I are \nDeadheads.\n  He is a wonderful man and a great Senator. I congratulate him on \nreaching this milestone and look forward to watching him cast thousands \nof votes in the years ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I join in paying tribute to the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy. Our friendship \nprecedes the service of both of us in the Senate. I first met Senator \nLeahy at the National District Attorneys Convention in Philadelphia in \n1970. Senator Leahy was the district attorney of Burlington, VT, and I \nwas the district attorney of Philadelphia. That friendship was renewed \nwhen I was elected to the Senate in 1980. Senator Leahy had already \nbeen here for 6 years. We have worked together for 25 years plus on \nJudiciary and Appropriations and on the Subcommittee on Labor, Health, \nHuman Services and Education. It has been a very close working \nrelationship, and never as close as it has been for the past 14 months \nas we have worked together on the Judiciary Committee with some very \nsignificant accomplishments for the Senate and for the American people.\n  Last year, when I had a problem or two, besides working with Senator \nLeahy on the administration of the Judiciary Committee I had a period \nwhere I was bald. On our frequent visits together, the only way we \ncould be distinguished was by the color of our ties. I usually wore red \nand he customarily wore green, so people knew who was who.\n  Earlier today I received this picture of Senator Leahy with his new \ngrandson. The grandson is a few weeks old, but I am pleased to report \nto C-SPAN viewers, if there are any, that the grandson has more hair \nthan Senator Leahy.\n\n[[Page S1524]]\n\n  Pat Leahy is a great Senator and he is a great friend. It is a great \nachievement to cast 12,000 votes. I have been here for a good many of \nthem, and he has even been right some of the time. I am delighted to \njoin in praising my good friend Senator Pat Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, when you reflect back to that many votes, \nthat many thousands of votes, very quickly you could go back and look \nat various issues Pat Leahy has been involved with. I think that is \nimportant to do. It reflects a great legacy for our country, what he \nhas stood for, the values and principles.\n  I wish to add to the accolades what I have found, and that is, as I \nhave gone around the world over the last several years in humanitarian \ncauses, part of which is done as official CODELs as a Senator but even \nmore than that as a volunteer physician, going on the ground into \ncommunities, into villages all over the world, what is interesting to \nme--people don't care about the majority leader, they don't care about \nthe typical names you hear from the Senate floor, but Pat Leahy's name \ncomes up again and again from the underserved, from the people who have \nsuffered the tragedy of landmine injuries. It is remarkable. It is \nsomething we don't talk about on the floor a lot. But to have real \npeople thousands of miles away coming forward with his name reflects \nthe great legacy he leaves, that he continues to leave, and I am sure \nthere will be another 12,000 votes as we come forward.\n  I do want to express both to him and to Marcelle, a nurse, who \ngreatly influenced his life and for whom he has so much love that he \nexpresses so directly to so many of us in casual conversations or the \nsorts of occasions that people don't see--that is the Pat Leahy I want \nto recognize today--congratulations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it has been my distinct pleasure to be \neither the ranking member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee or the \nchairman with my good friend Pat Leahy. Part of what Senate etiquette \ntells us is we are supposed to refer to each other as ``my good \nfriend,'' but in the case of Pat Leahy, it is not only Senate etiquette \nbut it is the case that he has become a good friend.\n  Twelve thousand votes is quite an accomplishment, but beyond that, I \nhave enjoyed the spirit of bipartisanship with which we have pursued \neach Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for each of the last 14 \nyears, whether he was chairman or I was chairman. We tried to develop \nthe expenditures of the Federal Government in a way that made sense for \nAmerica and also had an impact on the rest of the world.\n  The majority leader has mentioned the landmine crusade Senator Leahy \nhas led for a long time. He is indeed known around the world for that. \nIt has been an extraordinary crusade. He deserves enormous credit for \nleading it and is widely known around the world for that.\n  I thank him for his extraordinary service over the last 14 years in \nwhich I have been associated with him. It has been a pleasure to work \nwith him every year. I, too, wish him 12,000 more votes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is hard to put in words what I feel as I \nlisten to my good friends, Harry Reid and Arlen Specter, Bill Frist and \nMitch McConnell, saying such nice things. They are friends. We work \ntogether. Harry--I should say, following Senate protocol, the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada, Senator Reid--was kind enough to \nfirst and foremost mention my wife Marcelle. There is no conceivable \nway I could have accomplished any of this without Marcelle. She has \nbeen my guiding light for well over 40 years. Nothing I have done could \nI have accomplished without her.\n  Senator Specter was kind enough to hold up the picture of the latest \nmember of our clan, Patrick Lucas Jackson. I think of that because I \ncame here holding the actual pictures in my mind of my three children, \nKevin, Alicia, and Mark, and their spouses, Carolyn, Lawrence, and \nKristine, but also the pictures of four wonderful grandchildren: Roan, \nFrancesca, Sophia, and now Patrick. To have them mentioned I realize \nthere is another generation, and I hope their children will be proud of \nwhat their father does, but I especially hope the grandchildren, who \nwill be the hope of our future, will feel the same way.\n  Bill Frist, the distinguished Republican leader, and Senator Mitch \nMcConnell, the distinguished deputy Republican leader, were kind to \nspeak of the landmine issue and things we worked out together--both of \nthem being Senators who have done so much in that same area.\n\n  Sometimes we deal in issues people look at as just local issues or \nissues that affect only a few. What we have done in this case--Senator \nMcConnell, who was so good to move to name the war victims fund the \nLeahy War Victims Fund--is something I will never forget; Senator \nFrist, who voluntarily goes into parts of Africa and elsewhere to use \nhis medical skills. We talk of these kinds of things--the landmine \nissue; things Senator McConnell and I have done to bring medicine to \nparts of the world that never see it; efforts to eradicate polio, \nchildhood diseases, to bring to people the ability to actually feed \nthemselves. The people we help don't contribute to campaigns. When \nSenator McConnell and I pass a bill here on the floor, they don't know \nwho we are. They do not know whether it is Republicans or Democrats. \nNone of them know that. We will never meet most of them, but we like to \nthink--I like to think--we have made their lives better.\n  We speak of what we bring to this body. We all come from different \nbackgrounds. It is not just our political background; it is how we are \nraised, it is what our faith is. And if we believe in the best of what \nwe learned when we were being raised or the best of what it is we \nbelieve in, then we have to help these people who will never be helped \notherwise, and I have been proud to do that. I like to think what was \ninstilled in me by my parents, Howard and Alba Leahy or in Marcelle by \nher parents, Phil and Cecile Pomerleau, brought about some of this, or \njust the upbringing in the special little State of Vermont.\n  I will close with this. I didn't expect to say anything, but I was \nkind of overwhelmed by what was said by a dear friend like Arlen \nSpecter, whom I have known since we were both prosecutors, a job that \nsome days we think was the best job we ever had. It made me reflect on \nwhat a great honor it is for all of us, Republicans and Democrats and \nIndependents, to serve in this body. Only 100 of us get a chance to do \nit at any one time, and someday we will be replaced by others. What an \nhonor it is to be here and what a responsibility it is.\n  I have seen the Senate go through many changes, but I have also seen \nthe personal relationships the press doesn't see, the public doesn't \nsee, the personal relationships we have built across the aisle and with \neach other. When we do, the country is better, the Senate is better, \nand people's lives are better.\n  I must say that I was awed and humbled the first day I walked on the \nfloor as a 34-year-old to be sworn in, where 30 minutes before I was \nthe State's attorney sitting in a county in Vermont and 30 minutes \nlater was then the junior Senator from Vermont. I still feel that same \nawe every time I walk on this floor. The day I stop feeling that awe, I \nwill stop walking here.\n  With that, I have said more than Vermonters usually do. I yield the \nfloor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about the \nPATRIOT Act. I support the reauthorization of this law. It is vital we \nreauthorize it and make it permanent. Finally, we will be able to move \nthis reauthorization forward with a series of votes this week. It has \nbeen lingering out there too long, especially since the House passed it \nover 2 months ago.\n  The Senate needs to be taken seriously in the domestic fight against \nterrorism. Two months is too long to wait. I fear our delays have sent \nthe wrong message to our antiterrorism investigators and prosecutors as \nwell as those who would do us harm.\n\n[[Page S1525]]\n\n  In this body I hear a lot of critics of the President and his efforts \nto fight terrorism. Those critics always have problems but rarely do \nthey have any solutions other than to do nothing. Doing nothing led us \nto 9/11, and we would be foolish to go back.\n  The PATRIOT Act was one of the first things we did after September 11 \nto make sure something like that never happens again. It passed the \nSenate 98 to 1. This Chamber can be pretty partisan at times, but at \nthat time 98 Senators thought it went far enough to protect civil \nliberties.\n  But now we hear how the PATRIOT Act is bad. The conference report we \nreceived in December makes permanent most of the expiring provisions of \nthe existing law but with additional protections for civil liberties. \nBut that was not enough, and 47 Senators filibustered the bill. So here \nwe are today, 2 months later, about to pass some changes to the \nconference report and finally send something to the President.\n  Now, do not get me wrong. I think the improvements in the conference \nreport are positive. We absolutely should write protections into the \nlaw where they do not tie the FBI's hands in stopping terrorist \nattacks. But the FBI was not using the PATRIOT Act to bother law-\nabiding Americans. We did not need to delay the law for 2 months. And \nwe do not need to rewrite it from scratch, as some of my colleagues in \nthe body are suggesting.\n  It is important to protect Americans' civil liberties, and the \noriginal PATRIOT Act and the updated one do this. But I think some \nSenators are missing the point. Civil liberties do not mean much when \nyou are dead. And that is what the PATRIOT Act is about: stopping us \nfrom ending up dead at the hands of terrorists.\n  Some Senators make the PATRIOT Act sound like some huge expansion of \nlaw enforcement powers. That is simply not true. The PATRIOT Act \nbrought our laws up to date with modern technology. It gave \nantiterrorist investigators the same tools as other investigators, and \nit tore down the artificial wall between intelligence and law \nenforcement. In other words, it removed the legal barriers that kept us \nfrom being able to prevent things like the September 11 attacks.\n  As Senators, it is our job to fix the laws when they put Americans in \ndanger. It is sad that it took September 11 for those problems to be \nexposed. But it is even sadder still that some want to second-guess \nthose changes and turn our antiterror laws into a partisan issue. But \nthe safety of Americans is not a partisan issue. We have to do \neverything we can within the Constitution to protect Americans from \nboth foreign and domestic threats. We all swore an oath to do so when \nwe joined this body.\n  The PATRIOT Act is critical to protecting Americans, and now is the \ntime to pass this bill once and for all.\n  Just last week, we were reminded that there are those in America who \nwant to do us harm. Three men in Ohio were indicted for conspiring to \ncommit acts of terrorism, including trying to make bomb vests that \ncould be used on the battlefield in Iraq or in a shopping mall in \nAmerica. The enemy is not sleeping, and now is not the time for us to \nlose our resolve.\n\n  Under the PATRIOT Act, we have captured over 400 terrorist suspects. \nThat is a lot of people who want to do us harm. Over 200 terrorists \nhave been convicted or pled guilty in investigations helped by the \nPATRIOT Act.\n  Using the PATRIOT Act, our investigators have seized cash and drugs \nbeing used to fund terrorism. They have also captured weapons and broke \nup plans to smuggle weapons into the country, including antiaircraft \nmissiles.\n  Home-grown terrorists have been caught, also. The list of successes \ngoes on and on. There are terrorists behind bars instead of advancing \nplots against us because of the PATRIOT Act tools and, more \nimportantly, there are many Americans alive who may be dead if those \nterrorists were successful in carrying out their plots.\n  We need the PATRIOT Act. We need to get it reauthorized and signed \ninto law. Our terrorist investigators need their tools to be permanent. \nThis gives them certainty. We need to send a strong message to the \nterrorists that we will come after them with everything we can.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these bills and to drop their \nobstruction so we can do our job to protect all Americans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Budget Priorities\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as we return from the President's Day \nrecess, the Senate will be debating the future direction of our \ncountry.\n  This debate will come in the form of the discussions we have on the \nFederal Government's budget.\n  A budget is a statement of our priorities. Families across our \ncountry make difficult decisions every day while living within their \nown budgets, choosing one priority over another and working hard to \nfulfill their own American dream.\n  Likewise, our national budget and the way we spend tax dollars \nreflects our priorities as a Nation. We make difficult choices, \nestablish priorities and try to set our Nation on a course to \nprosperity.\n  Unfortunately, the President's recent submission of his fiscal year \n2007 budget and subsequent request for supplemental appropriations for \nthe ongoing war in Iraq do not reflect the priorities our Nation needs \nto move ahead, and it makes the wrong choices in spending and saving.\n  Taken together, they represent a callous disregard for fiscal reality \nand a failure to prioritize our country's most important needs.\n  No American family would dare manage their finances this way, and I \nam on the floor today to say that we must take a different course.\n  In the 3 years since the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom, our \ncountry and Congress have stood with the President in staunch support \nof our troops.\n  While we are both proud and duty-bound to provide the resources our \nmen and women in uniform need to do their jobs safely and effectively, \nit is disingenuous to continue to ask for ``emergency'' spending to pay \nfor military action that has been ongoing for years.\n  Year in and year out, the President asks the Congress to provide the \nresources for his Iraq policy outside the bounds of the traditional \nbudget process, and in each one of those years, concerns over \naccountability swell and demands for a plan that will allow our troops \nto fulfill their mission and return home go unanswered.\n  Like every American, we all want to succeed in our mission in Iraq. \nWe want to achieve our military and policy goals, and to bring our \ntroops home safely.\n  We know that this will require sacrifice and that a U.S. presence \nwill be required for some period of time.\n  Despite these obvious facts, the administration continues to operate \nfrom the pretense that the cost of this ongoing war is unknowable and \nthus requires emergency spending.\n  The continued adherence to this policy deliberately misleads the \nAmerican people about the cost of this war.\n  But it also misses a central point, the real emergency is here at \nhome in our classrooms, in communities from the Gulf Coast to the \nPacific Northwest, in our hospitals, and in our firehouses.\n  The Senate has shown unwavering support for our men and women \nfighting overseas. These heroes deserve every bit of aid we can \nprovide--be it the best body armor, the best equipment, or the best pay \nand health care.\n  Time and again Democrats have stood shoulder to shoulder with the \nBush administration to do just that--and in many cases we have pushed \nto provide more than the President requested for our troops, our \nveterans, and their families.\n  My concern--and I know many of my colleagues share it as well--is \nthat while we provide the best for our men\n\n[[Page S1526]]\n\nand women overseas, we are doing far less for the men, women and \nchildren fighting to get ahead on our own shores.\n  They too deserve the best--the best education, the best health care, \nand the best protection from terrorist attack. I don't think anyone in \nthis Chamber today can honestly say that we are achieving that goal.\n  I am here to say that this Senator will not stand idly by as we send \nbillions to support and protect the heroes overseas while cutting basic \nneeds for the heroes waking up every morning across our great Nation \ntrying to provide themselves and their children a better life. We can \nand must do both.\n  So, as the Senate prepares to consider the budget and support our \ntroops, I am going to ask that we stand up to protect and support hard \nworking American families right here at home. That means: Providing \naffordable, accessible health care for every American, ensuring the \nbest education for our young people, taking care of our veterans when \nthey return home, pointing our Nation down a path toward energy, \nindependence, and protecting our homeland from both terrorists and \nnatural disasters.\n  The costs of mismanagement, corruption, and lack of investment at \nhome are creating a crisis of confidence in our current path among the \nAmerican people. We must change course.\n  There is precedent in our Nation's history for future oriented \ninvestment during difficult times--in fact, troubled times demand that \nwe don't just wallow in current events, but better prepare for our \nfuture.\n  In 1862, our great Country was torn apart. The Civil War defined our \nNation and determined our future. But war was not the only thing that \nwas debated that year, and war was not the only thing that determined \nour Nation's fate: 1862 was also the year that legislation creating the \nland-grant college system was passed by Congress and signed into law by \nPresident Lincoln.\n  Think of it, in the midst of war, when the Union's very existence was \nin question, our leaders took the forward looking step of establishing \na path by which average Americans could improve themselves and \ncontribute to the welfare of our Nation. And you know what--it worked.\n  Today, those same land-grant colleges and universities are the envy \nof the world because of the great education they provide many Americans \nand the economic benefit they provide to our country.\n  Today, we too, are in the grip of war, and there are forces arrayed \nagainst us that seek to do us real and lasting harm--we must combat our \nenemies with every ounce of energy we have.\n  But like previous generations of American leaders, we also have an \nobligation to prepare the American people for the challenges we will \nconfront in the future and to ensure that we are strong and secure in \nmeeting those challenges head-on. Today, our efforts in this regard are \nwoefully inadequate.\n  To be strong in the future--to have the ability to fight the wars of \nthe future, create the economy of the future, and lead the world in \nhuman liberty and freedom--we must create an environment of hope and \nopportunity here at home. And yes, this is an emergency.\n  We all support our troops, and we will support the President's \nefforts to provide for their well-being and to ensure that they have \nthe tools and resources they need to carry out their missions.\n  But, candidly, we must be able to both support our troops and create \na country full of hope and optimism for them to return to.\n  To accomplish this we need to make changes in policy and allocation \nof resources, and I am going to demand that we consider these important \nquestions when we debate the budget and the Iraq war supplemental \nappropriations request.\n  As I have said before on this floor, the Federal budget is the \nstatement of our priorities as a people, and it should be a moral, \nthoughtful document.\n  Today, America's need for sound fiscal policy and a solid commitment \nto prosperity at home is not being met.\n  We can do better. If the President and the majority won't lead our \ncountry toward a more hopeful, prosperous future, then we will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak and have \nmy speech recorded as if in morning business. I will use the time \nallotted with my hour postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan pertaining to the introduction of S. 2341 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Prescription Drugs\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, during this President's Day recess, I \njourneyed to Illinois and made stops in several cities. There were many \nplaces to visit, but I chose to visit drugstores. In each one of these \ntowns, large and small, I sought out pharmacists--whether it was \nCollinsville, IL, or Decatur, IL, or Chicago--to talk about the \nMedicare prescription Part D plan. I thought the pharmacist was the \nright person to speak to because these pharmacists are on the front \nline in health care. Across America, many Americans view the pharmacist \nas their friend when it comes to their medical conditions and their \nhealth. So they have a good, trusting relationship.\n  Also, of course, Medicare prescription Part D is the first time we \nare trying to provide prescription drugs to people under Medicare, \nsomething we should have done from the beginning, but we are doing now. \nWe are not doing it very well.\n  What I learned during my visit to Illinois is the fact that there are \nthousands of people in my home State who are struggling to make the \nright decision when it comes to their Medicare prescription drug \nprogram. They are struggling because there are some choices, and the \nchoices are very difficult to evaluate. In Illinois, there are about 42 \ndifferent plans from which seniors can choose. If you seek the \ninformation on the plan, you are directed to a Web site. A Web site may \nbe of value to many people who are following the Senate proceedings, \nbut to many senior citizens it is terror incognito; it is unknown \nterritory.\n  Only one in four senior citizens have ever logged onto a computer. \nThey do not have the luxury of going to the appropriate Web site using \ntheir mouse to click through the options trying to figure out the best \nchoice. They are lucky, in many cases, to have one of their kids who \nwill sit with them and work through the options.\n  But, I tell you, some of the professional people I run into, educated \npeople I run into, quickly tell me that this is not an easy thing to \nnavigate. With 42 plans, you had better make the right choice.\n  Most seniors start with the basic drug they are currently taking and \nthey go to the prescription drug plan to see if that drug is offered by \nthe drug plan. Then they calculate the prices of the drugs to try to \ndetermine how much they are going to have to spend to get into the \nprogram, or once in the program how they will pay for their drugs. What \nthey come to learn, to their chagrin, is that many of the drugs which \nare part of the formulary or the drugs that are being offered in a \nprogram today are changed tomorrow. The drug you needed, the drug you \nare looking for may be discontinued tomorrow.\n  In other words, instead of a discount you may have to pay the full \nprice. It is really a classic bait-and-switch situation.\n\n[[Page S1527]]\n\n  Second, the price that is quoted to you for this drug may change as \nwell. It is like following the stock market. You have had two different \nplans. These seniors are trying to choose the right one. The drugs that \nare covered can change day to day. The prices can change day to day. \nAnd seniors have to make their choice and live with it for a year.\n  It is fundamentally unfair. It is unfair that the drug plans can \nchange right as these seniors have made their choice. And the seniors \ncan't change their drug plan for a year.\n  I have introduced legislation that would give senior citizens that \noption, an option that if the price of the drug goes up 10 percent or \nmore, or it is dropped from the formulary, you can change your plan \nwithout a penalty. I think that is only reasonable.\n  I also have to tell you that many of these pharmacists are at their \nwit's end. They care for these people. They really do. These are \ncustomers of a lifetime, and they come to these drugstores--some of \nthem--distraught over what they are going through with Medicare \nprescription Part D, and the pharmacist tries to help. He gets on the \nphone. He may call that drug plan and try to make sure that the seniors \nare being treated fairly. He may ignore the plan, which says don't give \nsome tablets over the course of a month, and give the person what he \nknows they need.\n  These are things he does at his own peril in terms of his own \nfinancial well-being.\n  I talked to one pharmacist who said that the drug Ambien, which is \nused by some who can't sleep at night had been prescribed, and one of \nthe seniors who signed onto one of the plans brought in his monthly \nprescription for Ambien and was told he could only have 18 pills.\n  So the plan decided that whatever the doctor had said \nnotwithstanding, whatever the condition, the senior citizen, 12 days \nout of 30, was not going to have their medication.\n  That is the kind of thing these seniors are facing. It is no wonder, \nto me, that the seniors I meet and the pharmacists who are trying to \nhelp them are really upset about this plan. They understand, as I do, \nthat this plan wasn't written for senior citizens. This plan was \nwritten for health insurance companies that make these plans available, \nas well as the pharmaceutical companies. They are the big winners in \nmany respects, first, because Medicare is not offering an overall plan \nfor every senior to choose. I think that is where we should have \nstarted.\n\n  We have a Medicare plan in America. People were brought into it in a \nmatter of a few months, and it has worked very well for 40 years. There \ncould have been a Medicare prescription drug plan which would have been \nthe basic template, the standard model that is available to every \nsenior. If someone in the private sector wants to compete and offer an \nalternative, they could have. I would have voted for that. But Medicare \nshould have been able to offer the basic fundamental model plan that \nevery senior could turn to, and it would have been successful because \nMedicare, with the potential of bargaining for 40 million senior \ncitizens, could sit down with that drug company and tell them you can't \nraise the price of drugs 10 percent a year, we just won't let you under \nthe plan.\n  You know what happened. The same thing happened in Canada. That is \nexactly what the Canadian Government did to these same American drug \ncompanies. They told them if they wanted to sell to the Canadian health \nplan, they couldn't keep raising the cost of the drugs every single \nyear.\n  That is why exactly the same drugs manufactured in the United States \nsell for a fraction of the cost in Canada because the Canadian \nGovernment stepped in.\n  When we tried to do that on the floor of the Senate, the \npharmaceutical companies fought us and won big time. Now we have 500 \nplans across America trying to negotiate better prices. And you know \nwhat that means: You don't get the discount, the bulk discount, and the \nlower prices that can occur.\n  We know the VA had already tried this. They offered the veterans who \ncome to veterans clinics and hospitals prescription drugs at reduced \nrates because they bargained with the same drug companies, but these \ndrug companies didn't want to give up their power in this negotiation. \nSo they insisted that Medicare would not write a basic plan. They \ninsisted that there be 500 plans across America. They knew they would \nmake more money that way.\n  I am sure they will--but at the expense of senior citizens and \ntaxpayers.\n  There is also this strange, inexplicable, indefensible element in \nMedicare prescription Part D known as the donut hole. The donut hole \nsays as follows: Once you have spent out of pocket $2,200 for \nprescription drugs during the course of a year, you are on your own--no \nprotection, no payment. Everything from that point on is out of pocket. \nUntil you have spent an additional $2,900 and reached $5,100 total \nspending, then the plan kicks in and is generous to you.\n  The donut hole means that seniors truly in need of medication can \nfind themselves at some point during the course of a year reaching into \ntheir savings to pay for their prescription drugs. How often does that \noccur?\n  When I went to the Order of Saint Francis Health Center in Peoria, \nIL, I met with the pharmacy, Wayne Beckman, and his wife Bev. I asked \nBev if they had run into anyone who is concerned about this donut hole \nwhere they already spent out $2,200. She said: There was a woman in \nhere yesterday who already reached $2,200 in the month of February. She \nwas a transplant patient. She needed expensive medication.\n  So, now, this woman having gone through all of these surgeries, all \nof this medical care, has to reach into her pocket and pay out $2,900 \nbefore the Medicare plan kicks in again.\n  Could we have dreamed up a more complex and convoluted approach to \nproviding prescription drugs to seniors?\n  I learned during the course of my visit that many of these seniors \nare desperate. They know they have to decide by May 15 to sign up for a \nplan. Some of them are not taking drugs at this moment but are afraid \nif they do not sign up for some plan and start paying for it that they \nwill be penalized, which is part of the law as well. So they are trying \nto decide what the best decision might be.\n  I really wish my colleagues in Congress would get out of these marble \nhalls and get into some drugstores. I wish they would stop listening to \nlobbyists and start listening to pharmacists. If they did, they would \nrealize what a bad law this is. This was passed 2 years ago. We were \nsupposed to have all the time in the world to get this right, make sure \nthat when the moment came that this plan went into place nothing like \nthis would occur. Yet it does.\n  Some of the, I guess, most painful stories involve victims who are in \nnursing homes--people who have really spent down everything they have \nin life. They have nothing left. How do they live? Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid. Medicaid, of course, is health insurance for \nthe poorest among us.\n  These poor people who usually don't have many friends, other than \nmaybe a couple of family members, are sick in the nursing homes. Many \nof them are caught in the middle of this Medicare prescription Part D \nand what it does to them. Someone takes their prescription to a \npharmacy and finds out they will not fill a month's prescription, only \n10 days, and Governors across America have had to step in to protect \nthese people, these poor people, literally poor people, who need a \nhelping hand.\n\n  What a sad turn of events. What could have been a source of pride for \nAmerica, for seniors, for all has turned out to be a national \nembarrassment, an embarrassment that could have been avoided.\n  My colleagues have to understand unless and until we work to make \nMedicare prescription drugs Part D a program that reaches out and helps \npeople, a program that is simple, fair, gives true discounts on their \nprescriptions, then we have not done a service to our seniors. These \nmen and women are parents and grandparents, the greatest generation who \nserved in America's past in so many different ways. How can we put them \nin this predicament? They, unfortunately, had to go to the back of the \nline when it came to passage of this bill. The prescription\n\n[[Page S1528]]\n\ndrug companies, as well as the insurance companies, were the ones that \nwrote the bill.\n  I know what we have to do. We have to take from this calendar, after \nwe finish the PATRIOT Act, we have to push aside all the special \ninterest legislation. We spent a week and a half on a bill last week, \nthe clash of the special interest titans over asbestos. We have to set \nthose aside and say, for at least a week, instead of taking up special \ninterest legislation, we are going to take up the Medicare prescription \ndrug bill. We are going to make this work. We are going to finally put \nsomething together that is an honor to the people who are part of our \nMedicare system.\n  I don't know if we can do that. When the President signed this bill, \npeople said: You are going to have to change some parts of it. He said: \nI am not going to touch it, not a word.\n  The President should show a little humility. All of us in public life \nshould from time to time. As we look at this Medicare prescription drug \nprogram, we know it is not working for America, it is not working for \nseniors. It is causing much too much heartache, much too much concern.\n  This much I will say I have learned, having been in public life a few \nyears. There is one thing about senior citizens, they know who is on \ntheir side. They have long memories. I might add, they vote. If the \nleaders in Congress, the Republican leaders, the President's own party, \ndo not understand how badly this Medicare prescription Part D program \nis working, some of the seniors may give them their medicine in \nNovember. They have to understand we have a responsibility to these \npeople, not to the lobbyists in the hallway who represent the drug \ncompanies. They are doing quite well, thank you.\n  We have a responsibility to the people whom we were sent to \nrepresent. They may not have a lobbyist, but they have a vote and a \nvoice and we will hear from them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune).

Mr. President, each year, during the month of February, \nAmerica celebrates the achievements, contributions, and history of the \nAfrican-American community.\n  In previous years, I have had the honor of joining my colleague \nCongressman John Lewis on his civil rights pilgrimage to Alabama and \nTennessee.\n  It is an extraordinary journey that changes all who partake.\n  It connects us to our history, our geography, our shame and \nredemption, and to the astonishing bravery and commitment of the civil \nrights leaders who fought for America's honor: Martin Luther King, Jr., \nhis wife Coretta Scott, Rosa Parks, the Greensboro Four, to name a few.\n  Their willingness to face violence and intimidation, injustice and \noppression, with steadfast love and bravery transformed America.\n  Indeed, it led to a great awakening that continues to reverberate \naround the world.\n  This year, as we celebrate those extraordinary individuals and \nevents, let us also recognize the exceptional leaders in our midst who \ntoil every day for justice and racial reconciliation.\n  This year, I have the pleasure of presenting Mr. Jeffrey T. Higgs of \nMemphis, TN, with my office's first ever American New Trailblazer Award \nin honor of Black History Month.\n  In January, my office sent out requests to over 200 recipients of our \nAfrican-American leader's newsletter. We asked our readers to nominate \nindividuals of extraordinary character and achievement.\n  We received the nominations of published authors, clergy, local \ncommunity leaders, and business professionals. All were deserving \ncandidates and I am both humbled by and proud of their example of \nservice.\n  After culling through the nominations, we chose Mr. Higgs for his \noutstanding work as executive director of LeMoyne-Owen College \nCommunity Development Corporation.\n  For over 15 years, Mr. Higgs has been involved in urban community \nhousing, economic development and micro lending.\n  As CEO of the multi-million-dollar organization, he has led the \nefforts to revitalize the community surrounding LeMoyne-Owen College.\n  Among his many development projects, he led the renovation of the \nhistoric JE Walker House. Today, the building serves as a community \nresource center for housing development, computer training, economic \ndevelopment and investment.\n  Currently, Mr. Higgs is leading the charge for 2 major capital \nprojects generating over $25 million in economic activity.\n  His sponsor for the award, Bridget Chisolm, President and CEO of BBC \nConsulting, wrote to tell us that Mr. Higgs is, ``truly a Renaissance \nman and community trailblazer. We are blessed to have such a leader \nstriving to make a good city great.''\n  Indeed, America is blessed to have individuals like Mr. Higgs \nselflessly serving his fellow citizens.\n  I congratulate Mr. Higgs for his contributions to his community. And \nI thank him for carrying forward the torch of social justice.\n  As we close this month of celebration, let us remember that the \nmovement is not over. So much has changed in so very short a time. But \nthe great hope of the movement has yet to be realized: full equality \nnot only before the law, but in the lives of every citizen.\n  It is citizens like Mr. Higgs who are working to make that happen.\n  I close with a quote from the great Dr. King.\n  In his historic speech following the march to Selma, the Reverend \ntold his fellow freedom marchers,\n       We must come to see that the end we seek is a society at \n     peace with itself, a society that can live with its \n     conscience. And that will be a day not of the white man, not \n     of the black man. That will be the day of man as man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1528-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1528-S1529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, ``Celebrating Community: A Tribute to \nBlack Fraternal, Social and Civic Institutions'' is the theme this year \nof African American History Month. On this last day of the Month I want \nto pay a special tribute to the Alpha Phi Alpha, which is the oldest of \nthe African American Greek-letter collegiate fraternities and \nsororities. Alpha, which I am proud to say has its headquarters in \nBaltimore, this year celebrates its centennial. For the past one \nhundred years Alpha has upheld the principles of scholarship, \nfellowship, good character and the uplifting of humanity principles \nthat command our respect and admiration.\n  It has been my privilege to work closely with Alpha in the effort to \nestablish an appropriate memorial to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in our \nNation's Capital. More than 20 years ago I introduced legislation to \nassure that a monument would be built, and it took a decade to get the \nlegislation enacted. Since 1996, when the bill was signed into law, we \nhave moved steadily forward. The site on the Mall is set, lying between \nthe Memorial to President Franklin Roosevelt and the Lincoln Memorial. \nThe magnificent design is in hand. The challenging work of raising the \nnecessary funds continues, and in this Alpha and the other African \nAmerican campus organizations play a vital role. I look forward to the \nday, not too far in the future, when we will have on the Mall a \nmonument worthy of Dr. King's legacy, to remind us and future \ngenerations of the struggles the civil rights movement endured, and to \ninspire us all to continue the movement.\n  Even as we celebrate our progress toward a memorial to Dr. King, we \nmourn the loss of two great Americans, Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott \nKing.\n\n[[Page S1529]]\n\n  When Rosa Parks died 4 months ago, all Americans mourned her passing. \nFifty years ago, with a singular courageous act that in the words of \nthe New York Times became a ``mythic event,'' she galvanized the civil \nrights movement and helped to write a new and hopeful chapter in our \nhistory. As the Times put it, ``(W)hat seems a simple gesture of \ndefiance so many years later was in fact a dangerous, even reckless \nmove'' at the time. Her steadfastness in the face of harsh and unjust \nlaws struck a chord in the nation's conscience and challenged us to \nbuild a society worthy of the principles on which it was founded. When \nMs. Parks was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 1999, I was \nhonored to have an opportunity to meet her. At the time of her death I \njoined with my Senate colleagues in honoring her at her memorial \nservice.\n  We lost a second courageous leader with the death more recently of \nCoretta Scott King. She was a student at the New England Conservatory \nof Music with plans for a musical career when she met her future \nhusband, but she was from the beginning his steadfast partner in the \narduous fight for civil rights and a more decent and humane society. \nAfter Dr. King's death she continued the fight with the quiet dignity \nand determination that were her hallmarks. It was a privilege to work \nwith Mrs. King on the legislation establishing Martin Luther King day \nas a national holiday; I deeply regret that she could not live long \nenough to see the memorial to her husband built as well.\n  Last month we honored Dr. Martin Luther King and his legacy. If he \nwere with us today, Dr. King would be deeply gratified by the national \ntributes paid to Ms. Parks and Mrs. King. In the 50 years since Martin \nLuther King, Jr., Coretta Scott King and Rosa Parks first challenged \nthe Nation to live up to its founding principles, we have come a long \nway. We have changed our laws fundamentally to assure the rights of all \nAmericans. We have worked together--at the local, State and national \nlevel--to create hope and opportunity where there was none, and to \nguarantee respect for every person.\n  The role of the Black fraternal, social and civic institutions in \nbringing about these changes cannot be overstated. Over the years they \nhave fought for justice in courts of law and in the court of public \nopinion, and worked tirelessly to promote equality and opportunity for \nall.\n  Still, much remains to be done. Working together we continue to build \nthe society for which Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott King stood, and \nfought. Success in this effort is the finest tribute we can pay to \nthem.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Black History \nMonth and pay tribute to the enormous and varied contributions African \nAmericans have made to our Nation.\n  The other evening, on the final night of the Olympics, Tom Brokaw of \nNBC News did a story about an American soldier named Vernon Baker who \nfought in Italy in World War II. Mr. Baker is now 86 years old. He was \njust a young man on the day in 1945 when he wiped out three Nazi \nmachine gun nests and took out an enemy observation post.\n  Mr. Baker came home from the war without much fanfare. But like the \n1.7 million other Black soldiers who served our Nation during World War \nII, he came home a changed man. After fighting on foreign soil against \nan enemy that claimed superiority to other races, these men could no \nlonger accept second-class treatment in their own country.\n  World War II was the catalyst that finally convinced a significant \nportion of the American people that segregation was wrong. It was the \nbeginning of the end of segregation in our Nation.\n  After World War II, 432 Americans were awarded the Congressional \nMedal of Honor. Not one of them was African American. Finally, in 1997, \nthe Government bestowed our Nation's highest medal on six Black \nveterans of World War II. Vernon Baker was the only one of those men \nstill alive to accept his award.\n  Mr. Baker's story mirrors Black history in our Nation in the last \nhalf of the 20th century. It is a story of determination and hope. \nDuring World War II, African Americans fought to keep our Nation free, \neven when their own freedom was not fully enjoyed. In the same way, the \nideas and talent of African Americans have always enriched American \nlife, even as their own lives were impoverished by racism and the \nvestiges of slavery.\n  From the Nobel laureate Toni Morrison to the great composer Duke \nEllington, from the brilliant jurist Thurgood Marshall to my old friend \nLarry Doby, the first Black baseball player in the American League, \nfrom the uplifting leadership of Martin Luther King, Jr., to the \nheroism of Vernon Baker, African Americans have inspired and \nenlightened our Nation.\n  I join the people of New Jersey in celebrating the contributions of \nAfrican American citizens during Black History Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1529-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL EATING DISORDERS WEEK\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National \nEating Disorders Awareness Week to heighten awareness and emphasize \nprevention of eating disorders.\n  More than 10 million Americans today struggle with eating disorders, \nincluding anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and compulsive eating. Not \nonly do these serious illnesses afflict people of all races and \nsocioeconomic groups, eating disorders are now striking more men and \nchildren. The harm to the victims and their families can be tragically \ndevastating, yet too often they continue to suffer in silence.\n  This week, I hope that we can take an important step to reach out to \nthem and let them know that help is available. Inadequate information, \nmisunderstandings, or shame should never be a barrier to recovery.\n  For this reason, I proudly sponsored Eating Disorders Information and \nEducation Act of 1997 and the very first Senate resolution, S. Res. \n197, to designate a National Eating Disorders Awareness Day. And it is \nthe same reason I rise today. I hope that my colleagues will join me in \nthis effort to improve eating disorder awareness, prevention, and \ntreatment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Ms. Chelsey \nCogil, a resident of Zephyr Cove, NV, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Reid: Hello! My name is Chelsey Cogil and I am \n     writing to inform you that National Eating Disorders \n     Awareness Week is coming up next month starting on February \n     26th and lasting until March 4th.\n       Coming from a family where eating disorders run common, I \n     know first hand the importance of spreading eating disorder \n     awareness and prevention.\n       I would be absolutely delighted if you would make a \n     statement, in support of National Eating Disorders Awareness \n     Week, about the importance of spreading eating disorders \n     awareness.

Mr. President, February is American Heart Month. As \ncochair of the Congressional Heart and Stroke Coalition, I rise today \nto urge my colleagues to commit to the fight against this devastating \ndisease.\n  Heart disease remains the Nation's leading cause of death. Stroke is \nthe No. 3 killer. More than 70 million adults in the United States \nsuffer from heart disease, stroke, or other cardiovascular diseases. \nCardiovascular diseases will cost our Nation an estimated $403 billion \nin 2006, including more than $250 billion in direct medical costs.\n\n[[Page S1530]]\n\n  Although we need to continue to fund research to unlock the many \nmysteries that remain, we can make real progress in the fight against \ncardiovascular diseases by applying the knowledge that we already have \ntoday. A recent study funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood \nInstitute found that by quitting smoking, reducing obesity and \ncontrolling blood pressure and cholesterol levels, you can add 10 years \nto your life.\n  Thanks to our prior investments in cardiovascular research and \nprevention programs, we are now at a point where we have the tools in \nhand to make substantial progress. Yet, we find ourselves at a \ncrossroads. As the population ages, the number of Americans affected by \ncardiovascular diseases will rapidly increase if we don't take the \nright steps today. It is estimated that by 2050, the number of deaths \nfrom heart disease will increase by nearly 130 percent.\n  Now is the time to redouble our efforts to fight heart disease, \nstroke and other cardiovascular diseases, not back away from our \ncommitment. Yet, the President's budget proposal for fiscal year 2007 \nwould cut funding for medical research and cardiovascular disease \nprevention programs.\n  The administration has even proposed eliminating a program to help \nrural communities purchase automated external defibrillators, AEDs. \nLast year, over my objection, Congress cut funding for this program by \nmore than 80 percent. This makes no sense to me. AEDs are small, laptop \nsize devices that help restore normal heart function after cardiac \narrest. AEDs save lives, especially when placed in areas where large \nnumbers of people congregate and in rural communities where emergency \nmedical personnel are not readily available.\n  That is why I was pleased to see the Architect of the Capitol \nannounce last month that AEDs will be placed around the Capitol \ncomplex. However, I find it highly ironic that Congress decided to \npurchase AEDs for its own buildings while slashing funding for programs \nthat help rural communities purchase the same devices.\n  In the next several weeks, we will have a serious debate in the \nSenate about the administration's budget proposal. The decisions we \nwill make will clearly show our priorities. I urge my colleagues to \nmake the fight against heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular \ndiseases a top priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1530-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1530-S1531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HAWAII CREDIT UNION LEAGUE\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, every year, members of the Hawaii Credit \nUnion League meet with me during their trip to Washington, DC. They \nkeep me abreast of their work in Hawaii by providing affordable \nfinancial services to their members. I would like to recognize credit \nunions and other mainstream financial services organizations that \nprovide access to financial services that improve the lives of their \nmembers. Without credit unions, even more of our constituents would be \nsusceptible to predatory lending and high-cost financial services. For \nexample, individuals that lack credit union or bank accounts are \nconsidered to be unbanked. The unbanked rely on alternative financial \nservice providers to cash checks, pay bills, send remittances, utilize \npayday loans, and obtain credit. However, their earnings are \nunnecessarily diminished in the process by their reliance on these \nhigh-cost, and often predatory, financial services. These hardworking \nfamilies can ill-afford this hit to their paychecks. Not having a \ncredit union or bank account prevents families from being able to save \nsecurely to prepare for the loss of a job, a family illness, a down \npayment on a first home, or education expenses for their children.\n  I am proud that we have credit unions in Hawaii that provide \ninnovative services to more effectively meet the needs of their members \nsuch as offering payday loan alternatives to members of the armed \nservices. Payday loans are small cash loans repaid by borrowers' \npostdated checks or borrowers' authorizations to make electronic debits \nagainst existing financial accounts. Typically, the principal for \npayday loans is in the range of $100 to $500 with full payment due in 2 \nweeks. Finance charges on payday loans are normally in the range of $15 \nto $30 per $100 borrowed, which translates into triple digit interest \nrates of 390 percent to 780 percent when expressed as an annual \npercentage rate, APR. A common practice is loan flipping, which is the \nrenewing of loans at maturity by paying additional fees without any \nprincipal reduction. This practice often creates a cycle of debt that \nis hard to break. Furthermore payday lenders often locate near military \nbases because they know that a military servicemember's government \npaychecks represent a reliable source of fees and military personnel \nmay be court marshaled or dishonorably discharged for failing to repay \ntheir debt.\n  I am proud that the Windward Community Federal Credit Union in \nKailua, on the island of Oahu, has developed an affordable alternative \nto payday loans. I commend the staff of the Windward Community Federal \nCredit Union for their outstanding program which benefits the marines \nand other members that they serve. I have introduced legislation that \nwould encourage credit unions and other financial institutions to offer \nthis sort of low-cost, short-term credit product. S. 1347, the Low-Cost \nAlternatives to Payday Loans Act, would promote low-cost alternatives \nto payday loans by authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to award \ndemonstration project grants. I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee to \nenact this important legislation.\n  I also have included efforts to increase access to credit union and \nbank accounts in an attempt to combat refund anticipation loans, RALs. \nWhile the earned income tax credit, EITC, helps working families meet \ntheir food, clothing, housing, transportation, and education needs, \nEITC refunds are unnecessarily diminished by excessive use of RALs. \nInterest rates on RALs can range from 97 percent to more than 2,000 \npercent. Considering the low repayment risk of this type of loan, the \ninterest rates and fees charged on this type of product are not \njustified. Often, those who take out RALs are lower income families for \nwhom these costs are a particular burden.\n  I have introduced the Taxpayer Abuse Prevention Act, which would \nrestrict predatory practices associated with RALs and expand access to \nmainstream financial services. The bill would expand the eligibility of \nelectronic transfer accounts, ETA, which are low-cost accounts at banks \nand credit unions intended for recipients of certain Federal benefit \npayments, to include EITC benefits. These accounts will allow taxpayers \nto receive direct deposit refunds into an account without the need for \na refund anticipation loan. Additionally, my bill would mandate that \nlow- and moderate-income taxpayers be provided opportunities to open \nlow-cost accounts at federally insured banks or credit unions via \nappropriate tax forms. Providing taxpayers with the option of opening a \nbank or credit union account through the use of tax forms provides an \nalternative to RALs and immediate access to financial opportunities \nfound at banks and credit unions.\n  In addition, I have worked with my friend, the Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Bingaman, on the Taxpayer Protection and Assistance Act. \nThe legislation includes a provision that authorizes a grant program to \nlink tax preparation services with the opening of a bank or credit \nunion account. This will help encourage the estimated four million \nunbanked EITC recipients to establish a relationship with a mainstream \nfinancial institution. In turn, they will no longer be forced to pay \nthe excessive fees RAL providers assess. Once the previously unbanked \nhave established a credit union or bank account, they will be able to \nbenefit from the wide range of financial services that mainstream \nfinancial institutions provide.\n  I will continue to work to expand access to mainstream financial \ninstitutions so that more individuals can benefit from lower cost \nopportunities found at credit unions and banks. I thank the \nrepresentatives from the Hawaii Credit Union League for all of their \nwork in providing financial services and increasing the financial \nliteracy knowledge of their members. I also will continue to work to \nenact legislation that promotes the utilization of the services of \ncredit unions and banks so that even more people can improve their \nlives by having access to\n\n[[Page S1531]]\n\nlow-cost accounts, cheaper remittances, less expensive loans, and \ninsured savings accounts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1531-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I rise today to share with my colleagues \na letter written by the mayor of Tall-at Afar, Ninewa, Iraq, concerning \nthe 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment of the U.S. Army. This unit of brave \nsoldiers is completing its second deployment to Iraq. As the unit \nprepares to come home, they have recently received this letter from the \nmayor of that city:\n\n       In the Name of God the Compassionate and Merciful To the \n     Courageous Men and Women of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, \n     who have changed the city of Tall-at Afar from a ghost town, \n     in which terrorists spread death and destruction, to a secure \n     city flourishing with life.\n       To the lion-hearts who liberated our city from the grasp of \n     terrorists who were beheading men, women and children in the \n     streets for many months. To those who spread smiles on the \n     faces of our children, and gave us restored hope, through \n     their personal sacrifice and brave fighting, and gave new \n     life to the city after hopelessness darkened our days, and \n     stole our confidence in our ability to reestablish our city.\n       Our city was the main base of operations for Abu Mousab Al \n     Zarqawi. The city was completely held hostage in the hands of \n     his henchmen. Our schools, governmental services, businesses \n     and offices were closed.\n       Our streets were silent, and no one dared to walk them. Our \n     people were barricaded in their homes out of fear; death \n     awaited them around every corner. Terrorists occupied and \n     controlled the only hospital in the city. Their savagery \n     reached such a level that they stuffed the corpses of \n     children with explosives and tossed them into the streets in \n     order to kill grieving parents attempting to retrieve the \n     bodies of their young.\n       This was the situation of our city until God prepared and \n     delivered unto them the courageous soldiers of the 3rd \n     Armored Cavalry Regiment, who liberated this city, ridding it \n     of Zarqawi's followers after harsh fighting, killing many \n     terrorists, and forcing the remaining butchers to flee the \n     city like rats to the surrounding areas, where the bravery of \n     other 3rd ACR soldiers in Sinjar, Rabiah, Zumar and Avgani \n     finally destroyed them.\n       I have met many soldiers of the 3rd Armored Cavalry \n     Regiment; they are not only courageous men and women, but \n     avenging angels sent by The God Himself to fight the evil of \n     terrorism.\n       The leaders of this Regiment; COL McMaster, COL Armstrong, \n     LTC Hickey, LTC Gibson, and LTC Reilly embody courage, \n     strength, vision and wisdom. Officers and soldiers alike \n     bristle with the confidence and character of knights in a \n     bygone era. The mission they have accomplished, by means of a \n     unique military operation, stands among the finest military \n     feats to date in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and truly deserves \n     to be studied in military science. This military operation \n     was clean, with little collateral damage, despite the \n     ferocity of the enemy. With the skill and precision of \n     surgeons they dealt with the terrorist cancers in the city \n     without causing unnecessary damage.\n       God bless this brave Regiment; God bless the families who \n     dedicated these brave men and women. From the bottom of our \n     hearts we thank the families. They have given us something we \n     will never forget. To the families of those who have given \n     their holy blood for our land, we all bow to you in reverence \n     and to the souls of your loved ones. Their sacrifice was not \n     in vain. They are not dead, but alive, and their souls \n     hovering around us every second of every minute. They will \n     never be forgotten for giving their precious lives. They have \n     sacrificed that which is most valuable. We see them in the \n     smile of every child, and in every flower growing in this \n     land. Let America, their families, and the world be proud of \n     their sacrifice for humanity and life.\n       Finally, no matter how much I write or speak about this \n     brave Regiment, I haven't the words to describe the courage \n     of its officers and soldiers. I pray to God to grant \n     happiness and health to these legendary heroes and their \n     brave families.\n       Najim Abdullah Abid Al-Jibouri\n       Mayor of Tall-at Afar, Ninewa, Iraq.\n\n  This mayor's gratitude towards the soldiers of the 3rd Armored \nCalvary Regiment speaks volumes of the sacrifice and bravery that all \nof our soldiers are displaying in Iraq. Our service men and women are \nmaking a difference in Iraq by spreading democracy and fighting the \nterrorists. These soldiers ought to be proud of their efforts--we \ncertainly are, and so are the Iraqis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1531-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1531-S1532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CLEAN WATER AUTHORITY RESTORATION ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, for the last 33 years, the American \npeople have relied upon the Clean Water Act to protect and restore the \nhealth of the Nation's waters. The primary goal of the act to make \nrivers, streams, wetlands, lakes, and coastal waters safe for fishing, \nswimming and other recreation, suitable for our drinking water supply, \nand available for wildlife and fish habitat--has become accepted by the \npublic not only as a worthy endeavor but also as a fundamental \nexpectation of government providing for its citizens. It is our \nresponsibility to provide adequate protection to ensure that our \nfreshwater resources are able to enhance human health, contribute to \nthe economy, and help the environment.\n  Despite being one of our Nation's bedrock environmental laws, the \nClean Water Act faces new and unprecedented challenges.\n  The Supreme Court recently heard two Clean Water Act cases, the \noutcome of which will have significant implications for Federal efforts \nto protect the Nation's waters from pollution and destruction. \nFortunately, an unprecedented array of local, State, regional, and \nnational officials, professional organizations, and public interest \ngroups from across the country and the political spectrum have joined \nin the defense of the Clean Water Act. The unparalleled collection of \ninterested parties includes the attorneys general of 33 States plus the \nDistrict of Columbia; four former Administrators of the Environmental \nProtection Agency--Russell Train, Douglas Costle, William Reilly, and \nCarol Browner; nine current and former members of the U.S. Senate and \nU.S. House of Representatives who were directly involved in the passage \nof the 1972 Act and its reaffirmation in 1977; the Association of State \nWetlands Managers, the Association of State Floodplain Managers, the \nAssociation of State and Interstate Water Pollution Control \nAdministrators, and the International Association of Fish and Wildlife \nAgencies; numerous hunting, fishing, wildlife and outdoor recreation \norganizations and businesses, including Ducks Unlimited, the National \nWildlife Federation, Trout Unlimited, the American Sportsfishing \nAssociation, Bass Pro Shops, the Orvis Company, and the Wildlife \nManagement Institute, among others; and a number of local, regional, \nand national environmental groups. All of these interests filed briefs \nexpressing strong support of the Clean Water Act's core safeguard: the \nrequirement to obtain a permit before discharging pollutants into \nwaters of the United States.\n  With such strong support for the Clean Water Act, which is grounded \nin the language, history, and purpose of the law itself, I hope that \nthe Supreme Court will follow its own precedent and reaffirm Federal \nprotections for streams, headwaters, tributaries, and wetlands that \nhave long been covered by the Act.\n  Whatever the outcome of these critical cases, Congress must reaffirm \nthe historical scope of the Clean Water Act. The best way to do this is \nthrough passage of the Clean Water Authority Restoration Act, S. 912. \nThis bill simply confirms that the Act has always covered all of these \nwaters, consistent with Congress's clear intent, by codifying the \nregulatory definition of ``waters of the United States'' that has been \nin use since 1973.\n\n[[Page S1532]]\n\n  The bill addresses protections for certain so-called isolated streams \nand wetlands in the wake of the Supreme Court's 2001 decision in Solid \nWaste Agency of Northern Cook County v. Army Corps of Engineers and \nwill help to ward off any future legal challenges to the scope of the \nact.\n  Our Nation's streams, ponds, isolated wetlands, and other bodies of \nwater are too important to not take action to protect them. We owe \nfuture generations nothing less than healthy waters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1532-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1532-S1533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WDEV: SOUNDS LIKE HOME\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 2006 marks the 75th anniversary of a true \nVermont treasure. Locally owned and operated, WDEV of Waterbury, VT, \nfirst came to the airwaves on July 16, 1931. Its continuing and \nexpanded presence in Central Vermont and the Champlain Valley ever \nsince then is a rare and stellar example these days of the invaluable \nresources that independent, community-based media can offer.\n  WDEV station owner and President Ken Squier took the reins of WDEV \nfrom his parents, Guila and Lloyd, who first operated the station at \nthe same time my own parents were operating a small Waterbury newspaper \nnearby, and his parents and mine were friends. If things had gone \ndifferently Ken and I might have had a media conglomerate in the \nmaking. Growing up in the station's studios, Ken's life was steeped in \nthe culture and the craft of community radio. He understood WDEV's role \nin community life, and when he assumed operation of the station, his \napproach to community-based programming became the foundation of the \nstation's lineup. Today the residents of Waterbury and its surrounding \ncommunities turn the dial to WDEV to find everything from a trading \npost to buy and sell their goods and treasures, to such off-beat \nprogram offerings as ``Music to Go to the Dump By.'' WDEV is the place \nto go for everything from local news to high school sports to school \nclosings. It has become a vital source of news, information and \nentertainment to its devoted audience. WDEV is an authentic piece of \nthe Vermont that we cherish.\n  Under Ken's guidance and initiative, WDEV has broadened its scope, \nbecoming the anchor for the Radio Vermont Group, which now operates \nstations devoted to classical and country music, as well as news, \nsports and community events. It has taken to the web, where WDEV now \nstreams two of its most popular morning news programs, ``The Morning \nNews Service'' and ``The Mark Johnson Show.''\n  Ken has shepherded WDEV through the years with his acute sensitivity \nto the local perspective. I have always enjoyed stopping in to the \nstation for a quick chat, or greeting Ken and the station's longtime \npersonalities at local events, from parades to political rallies. I \nlook forward to chatting with Eric Michaels, Radio Vermont's general \nmanager and vice-president, every month during his daily morning show. \nThe connection that WDEV and the voices it carries have to the \ncommunity is as distinctive and unique as Vermont is to our country.\n  Vermont Life recently published a well-crafted piece, ``Community \nRadio Speaks,'' featuring the history and highlights of WDEV's 75 years \non the air.\n  I join my fellow Vermonters in congratulating Ken, Eric, and all the \npeople who, in 75 successful years, have made WDEV a station with a \ntrue touch for its Vermont audience.\n  I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Vermont Life, Spring 2006]\n\n                         Community Radio Speaks\n\n                          (By Marialisa Calta)\n\n       ``Rural radio is important to people,'' intones Eric \n     Michaels in his mellifluous radio-announcer's voice. He is \n     taking a break from his duties as on-the-road producer of \n     WDEV's ``Music to Go to the Dump By,'' broadcasting, on this \n     particular Saturday in September, from the Tunbridge World's \n     Fair. ``We feel that if we are out in the community, working \n     hard, people will know us and respect us. We take our work \n     very seriously.'' A cow in a nearby 4-H exhibit moos loudly, \n     and Michaels, fiddling with his equipment, sends a song over \n     the airwaves, a country-western tune called ``I Don't Look \n     Good Naked Anymore.''\n       There, in a nutshell, is the contradiction--and the \n     strength--of WDEV, which celebrates 75 years of broadcasting \n     from Stowe Street in Waterbury this July. Smart local \n     commentary is mixed with ridiculous tunes. Conservative local \n     pundit Laurie Morrow's show, ``True North,'' broadcasting an \n     hour or two before nationally known liberal icon Amy \n     Goodman's ``Democracy Now.'' Patsy Kline, the Texas Tuba \n     Band, stock car racing from Barre's Thunder Road and Harwood \n     Union High School boy's basketball share airspace with Miles \n     Davis, Red Sox baseball, state legislative reports and \n     Mozart.\n       It's the place on the dial (550 AM, 96.1 FM and 96.5 FM) \n     where a Vermonter can tune in for the Dow Jones average of \n     the milk prices. Where the Associated Press delivers news \n     from the world, and Bethany Dunbar, an editor at The Barton \n     Chronicle, delivers the news from the Northeast Kingdom.\n       A listener whose normal fare comes from ``dedicated'' \n     channels--all-sports, all-talk, all-country-music, all-jazz--\n     and who accidentally tuned in to WDEV might find the station \n     bewildering, if not downright schizophrenic. But, as \n     Middlebury College professor and author Bill McKibben points \n     out, the hodgepodge of views, opinion, musical styles, \n     reports (sports, business, agriculture, politics, news) \n     pretty much reflects the hodgepodge of views, opinion, \n     musical tastes and interests that make up the average Vermont \n     community.\n       McKibben, who included WDEV in a story about the virtues of \n     a life lived on a small scale that he wrote for Harper's \n     Magazine two years ago, said that when you listen to the \n     station ``you hear . . . things that other people are \n     interested in. Which is pretty much the definition of \n     community.''\n       You also hear--and this may be WDEV's genius--the actual \n     voices of the community. It is nearly impossible for anyone \n     who has lived in WDEV's broadcast area (which extends south \n     to Route 4 and north nearly to the Canadian border) to listen \n     to the station for even a few hours without hearing the voice \n     of someone the listener knows. It might be Dan DiLena reading \n     his menu from the Red Kettle in Northfield or Ben Koenig of \n     the Country Bookshop in Plainfield singing about his store in \n     a hokey Caribbean accent. It might be Ed from Morrisville, \n     phoning in to ``The Trading Post'' at 6:30 a.m. to sell an \n     old-fashioned grinding wheel and a prickly pear cactus. It \n     might be a birthday wish going out to someone the listener \n     works with. Or a caller to any one of the talk shows: \n     ``The Mark Johnson Show,'' Morrow's ``True North'' or \n     progressive activist Anthony Pollina's ``Equal Time.'' If \n     you listen to WDEV long enough you will get a sense of \n     what your neighbors are doing and thinking. Which is a \n     pretty good way to not only define community but to keep \n     it alive and well.\n       At the heart of this rich local stew is the station owner \n     and president, Kenley Dean Squier, who, at 70, has made a \n     national name for himself (and was part of two Emmy-award \n     winning broadcast teams) as a television broadcaster covering \n     stock-car racing and other sports for CBS, NBC, ABC, ESPN, \n     Fox, Turner Broadcasting and the Speed Channel, among others. \n     Squier is a walking conundrum, a serious fan of jazz and \n     classical music with a deep background in the auto racing \n     world of NASCAR. He is a man equally at home interviewing, \n     say, Governor Jim Douglas about fuel shortages or health care \n     or hosting ``Music to Go to the Dump By,'' and reading \n     advertising copy (including, full disclosure, an ad for this \n     magazine, a sponsor). He employs an enormous--by corporately \n     held radio standards--staff of more than 30 yet he is \n     famously cheap; Bryan Pfeiffer, who cohosts ``For the \n     Birds,'' (a show about birding), loves to joke about the \n     single light bulb that Squier allows, the bulb that all the \n     broadcasters purportedly have to share, unscrewing it from \n     one broadcast booth and taking it to another.\n       It is not unusual for Squier, in a single broadcast, to \n     support the death penalty, criticize the Bush administration \n     and fulminate about the rise of corporate monopolies. His \n     station may broadcast conservative Ann Coulter and \n     independent Congressman Bernie Sanders in the same morning. \n     ``It's as if Rush Limbaugh and Al Franken shared a brain,'' \n     wrote McKibben.\n       ``His watchword is `relevant,' '' says Mark Johnson, who \n     has been hosting a two-hour weekday call-in show on the \n     station since 1998. ``It's all about what's meaningful to the \n     community.''\n       And you can describe ``meaningful'' in different ways. The \n     All Men's Moscow Marching Transistor Radio Band, for example, \n     depends on WDEV to provide music for its parade up the main \n     street of the village of Moscow every July 4th. Farmers \n     depend on weatherman Roger Hill's forecasts for haying. Kids \n     tune in on snowy mornings to hear about school closings. \n     Representative Sanders recalls that once, when he was on the \n     air, a station newscaster interrupted him to inform listeners \n     about an accident on Main Street in Waterbury.\n       Squier was born to radio; for Christmas 1935, his parents \n     Guila and Lloyd Squier (then the program director) sent out a \n     holiday card depicting the infant Ken in front of a set of \n     building blocks spelling out the call letters WDEV. The \n     station itself was only four years old, having been started \n     in 1931 by the visionary Harry Whitehill, owner and operator \n     of the Waterbury Record and the Stowe Journal. Whitehill was \n     a man of many trades; he sold stationary, pens and ink, party \n     gods and wrapping paper from his\n\n[[Page S1533]]\n\n     newspaper headquarters at 9 Stowe Street in Waterbury. He was \n     also Vermont's Collector of Customs, an active post during \n     Prohibition and a job that brought him frequently to St. \n     Albans. In 1929, Whitehill heard Vermont's first commercial \n     radio station, WDQM, there, and, reasoning that ``more \n     people can hear than can read,'' he returned to his \n     newspaper to proclaim: ``We need a radio station.'' \n     ``Radio was big city . . . worldly stuff,'' writes Squier, \n     who chronicled the birth of the station in an unpublished \n     history of WDEV. On July 16, 1931, the dulcet tones of \n     Miss Kate Lyons of Waterbury Center singing ``The Rose in \n     the Garden'' were sent over the airwaves, marking the \n     station's official launch. The antenna was a copper wire \n     strung from the newspaper office to a nearby funeral \n     parlor.\n       It was a glorious venture, an opportunity, as U.S. Senator \n     Warren R. Austin put it, ``to sell a cow or an idea, quickly \n     to a great number of people.'' The engineer for that first \n     broadcast was 28-year-old Lloyd Squier, the son of the \n     Whitehills'' housekeeper. The young Squier (now known as \n     ``The Old Squier'' and frequently heard on the station via \n     old recordings) soon moved up to program director responsible \n     for an entire hour of airtime a day. Fred Somers & Sons \n     Hardware (still on Main Street in Montpelier) was an early \n     sponsor.\n       Within a year, the station was broadcasting local sports, \n     legislative hearings and other events of note. By 1936, the \n     WDEV offices were a ``mini-media Mecca'' according to Ken \n     Squier, complete with Western Union, New England Telephone \n     and Telegraph Co., the radio station and the newspapers all \n     under the same roof. ``Because of radio, people can live \n     among the most beautiful hills on earth, our own Vermont \n     hills, and yet in an instant feel the pulse of world affairs \n     by simply turning a switch,'' said then-Lieutenant Governor \n     George Aiken in dedicating a new tower and transmitter that \n     year.\n       Nowadays, what makes WDEV stand out is not that it brings \n     us world news, but that--unlike the huge networks of radio \n     stations fed formatted shows from a remote central location--\n     it brings us the local happenings. The staff, on any given \n     day, might be broadcasting from a State House hearing, the \n     opening of the Farm Show or a county fair, a race at Thunder \n     Road (which Ken Squier co-owns), a high school hockey game, a \n     ribbon-cutting at a local lumber store or from a phone booth \n     in downtown Montpelier, as Michaels did during the flood of \n     1992. (Michael's phoned-in report--replete with operator's \n     request for additional coins--aired on the morning of the \n     flood when the rising waters prevented him from getting \n     through the city). Events like the flood, in fact, underscore \n     the station's importance; Squier enlisted every employee--\n     from the news staff to the sales reps--as reporters that day. \n     The payoff came when then-Governor Howard Dean, asked at a \n     press conference how he was keeping abreast of flood news, \n     answered that he had been listening to WDEV.\n       Another of the station's strengths is the number of \n     unforgettable radio personalities who have taken on larger-\n     than-life characteristics in listeners' minds: Buster the \n     Wonder Dog (Squier's own border collie); the station's \n     country band, the Radio Rangers; Farmer Dave; the Old Squier; \n     Ma Ferguson; Glen Plaid; Seymour Clearly and Spike the Cat. \n     Past and current broadcasters--the late ``Cousin Harold'' \n     Grout (who hosted ``The Trading Post'' for at least 30 \n     years), the late Rusty Parker (who suffered a fatal heart \n     attack in 1982 while broadcasting the morning news) and many \n     more--seem like old friends to regular listeners.\n       In addition to sports of local interest--70 local high \n     school basketball and hockey games, Norwich University \n     hockey, local motor sports events, Red Sox games and \n     Mountaineers baseball--WDEV has pioneered ``sporting events'' \n     that have become community institutions: the Winter Croquet \n     Tournament, Opening Day at the ABCD Deer Camp, Opening Day at \n     Perch Camp (an ice-fishing extravaganza), the State Agency of \n     Transportation Snow Plow Championships and the Joe's Pond Ice \n     Out competition, to name a few.\n       There is no doubt in this era of corporately owned radio \n     stations that a locally owned station like WDEV and its Radio \n     Vermont affiliates (WLVB-FM in Morrisville, a country \n     station, and WCVT-FM, a classical music station in Stowe) are \n     anomalies.\n       An analogy can be made, in fact, between the physical \n     landscape and the aural landscape of Vermont. Think of \n     corporate-owned stations--what Mark Johnson calls \n     ``electronic jukeboxes''--as sprawl. Public radio is \n     analogous to state parks and land in conservation trusts. \n     WDEV is analogous to the working landscape. Like tractors and \n     manure pits, it's not always pretty. But it's real. And it's \n     distinctive.\n       ``It's a station that understands the community and \n     understands what the real issues are,'' says Congressman \n     Sanders. He has held hearings on the recent trends in \n     communication law that enable large media conglomerates to \n     own large numbers of stations. ``Local ownership of media is \n     increasingly important and increasingly rare,'' he said in a \n     telephone interview. ``When it goes, something valuable is \n     lost.''\n       Loyal listeners would say that ``something'' is a piece of \n     Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1533-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING GREGORY McCARTHY'S SERVICE TO THE DISTRICT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, when I began serving on the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on the District of Columbia in January of \n2001, my knowledge of the city's relationship with Congress was limited \nto someone who had lived here for only a few years. I quickly learned, \nhowever, not only the workings of the committee, but also the unique \nrelationship between the District of Columbia and the Congress. One of \nthe first people who helped me learn of this relationship and how to \nbest serve the District was the energetic, dedicated chief advocate for \nDC Mayor Anthony Williams, Mr. Gregory McCarthy.\n  Behind all of the big ideas, the hours of debate and the finely cut \ndeals, there is the staff. The staff must work the long hours to merge \nthe big ideas and the little details into policy and legislation that \nachieves the goals set forth by their boss. Gregory McCarthy was an \nexemplary staffer who did all of this and more. Gregory has worked \ntirelessly on behalf of the Nation's Capital to create policy that \nbenefited the city, met the needs of the elected officials of the \nDistrict of Columbia, and satisfied the oversight function of the \nCongress. While working in the Mayor's Office, he helped build the \ncredibility of the city, from the Halls of Congress, to the many \nvisitors to the capital city, to the bond rating agencies. And all the \nwhile, Gregory served as the best source for a history lesson on the \nDistrict, the current status of a program, and the gauge of the Mayor \non any issue that any member of the DC Appropriations Subcommittee \ncould ask for.\n  Gregory McCarthy exemplifies the public service that fuels a \ngovernment which serves the people. It is this type of public service \nthat benefits students in the District of Columbia especially. Through \nGregory's hard work, he navigated the strong and varying positions of \nMembers of Congress and local officials in order to create the first \nfederally sponsored, private school voucher program. While I have been \na tough critic of the program, I have always said that Gregory and the \ncity represented the District's constituents well by seeking more \nschool options, and through their tireless discussion and debate came a \nprogram that supports traditional public schools and public charter \nschools, as well as private school scholarships. Gregory's efforts to \nimprove education for District residents have not been limited to \nelementary and secondary alternatives. Similarly, he has worked to \nauthorize and fund college grants for more than 8,000 DC residents so \nthat those who wish to pursue a degree of higher education may see \ntheir dreams become a reality.\n  Gregory McCarthy shepherded these and numerous other programs through \na frequently arduous District of Columbia appropriations process. The \nresidents of the District have benefited greatly from his years of \npublic service. When the year 2006 draws to an end, a new mayor will be \nelected and a new staff of dedicated public servants will work to \nimprove this great city. As this new crew weaves their way through \ncharted and uncharted territories, they will build on the positive \nrelationships that Mayor Williams, Gregory McCarthy, and other members \nof the Mayor's staff have worked so hard to create. As Mr. McCarthy \nleaves the District of Columbia government for his next challenge, I \noffer him my congratulations and best wishes. From my own experience in \nworking with him, I know that Gregory will succeed in whatever he \npursues next.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1533-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1533-S1534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             NEW YORK YMCAS\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize the excellent work New York YMCAs are doing to \nbuild healthier communities. They are taking important steps to address \nhealth problems, such as obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity, by \nparticipating in the Pioneering Healthier Communities Project, Gulick \nProject, YMCA Healthy Kids Day, and Steps to a HealthierUS partnership. \nThese projects are part of the initiative, YMCA Activate America, whose \ngoal is to promote healthy living among millions of Americans.\n\n[[Page S1534]]\n\n  The Pioneering Healthier Communities Project--a partnership with the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention--brings leaders together to \npromote cultural and environmental changes in neighborhoods supportive \nof healthy lifestyles. Each year YMCAs are selected to convene teams of \nrepresentatives from the government and public health and private \nsectors to improve healthy living. This year, the YMCAs of Rye and \nGreater Rochester were selected and convened teams, resulting in \ncreative plans to help youngsters. For example, the Rye YMCA \nimplemented the Fitkids Program to increase healthy menu choices and \npromote physical activity and healthy eating in four school systems. \nThe YMCA of Greater Rochester introduced the Coordinated Approach to \nChild Health, CATCH, Program, which promotes physical activity and \nhealthy food choices and prevents tobacco use in children, as well as \nthe Family Cooks Program, which teaches children using a hands-on \napproach to nutritious cooking.\n  In addition, YMCAs in greater New York and greater Rochester are \nparticipating in the Gulick Project--an initiative that is dramatically \nimproving the way they work with individuals and families to support \nhealthy living. Through the Gulick Project, YMCAs in New York and in \nother States are enhancing their programs, facilities, and staff to \neffectively meet the needs of those who want to be active and healthy \nbut continuously stop and start the process. Cutting-edge work at four \nYMCA branches in Prospect Park, Cross Island, Long Island city and West \nSide, as well as at other Gulick YMCAs in the Nation, is leading to the \ndevelopment of best practices.\n  Moreover, YMCAs in New York are actively involved in YMCA Healthy \nKids Day, a grassroots event that encourages children and families to \nadopt and uphold behaviors that support healthy living through fun and \nengaging activities. Healthy Kids Day recognizes that there is local \nhelp for parents, from schools to public libraries and YMCAs. In 2006, \nmore than a half million people will participate in Healthy Kids Day \nwith events in more than 1,300 communities across the country.\n  New York YMCAs are also engaged in a variety of health initiatives \nthrough partnerships with the Steps to a HealthierUS, which offers \ngrants to address health problems like obesity and asthma and risk \nfactors like physical inactivity and poor nutrition. For instance, \nBroome County YMCA has partnered with the Steps program to develop \nMission Meltaway, an 8-week program that educates participants on ways \nto control weight. This partnership has also established nutrition and \nphysical activity policies for all YMCA afterschool programs. \nSimilarly, the Chautauqua County YMCA has joined with the Steps program \nto create a wellness resource center and expand a weight loss \nmanagement program, among other things. Through the Steps program, the \nRockland County YMCA is improving nutritious offerings at snack time in \nchild care programs called ``healthy snack Wednesdays.'' The Watertown \nFamily YMCA has teamed up with the Steps program to implement Kids \nNutriFit, a project that will increase physical activity in children \nages 5 to 12 by engaging them in traditional play and teaching them \nabout healthy snacking.\n  Many health problems are linked to habits common in American \nlifestyles, including overeating, underexercising, and poor diets. \nYMCAs in New York and their community partners are vigorously promoting \nhealthy lifestyle choices and behaviors through innovative programs. I \napplaud their hard work and dedication to build healthy families and \ncommunities in New York and look forward to continuing to work with \nthem.\n  As an advocate for strong and healthy children and families, I will \ncontinue to fight for increased funding for programs that promote \naccess to healthy food and nutrition education in our schools and \ncommunities. Specifically, I have supported Farm-To-Cafeteria programs, \nwhich promote using locally grown produce in school cafeterias through \ncommunity grants, and the USDA Team Nutrition program, which funds \ncoordinated efforts between Federal, State and local entities to offer \nnutrition education to children. Through my own Farm-to-Fork \ninitiative, I also have been working to get local New York State \nproduce in schools, colleges, and universities. Healthy food options in \nschool cafeterias teach kids about good nutrition and the importance of \nagriculture, as well as support local farms by keeping food dollars \nwithin the community.\n  Obesity, which has doubled in children and tripled in adolescents \nover the last two decades, is another serious health issue I am \ncommitted to addressing. Last year, I reintroduced the Improved \nNutrition and Physical Activity Act, IMPACT Act, that awards grants to \ntrain primary care physicians and other health professionals in \nidentifying, treating, and preventing obesity and eating disorders and \nallows States to use preventive health and health services block grants \nfor activities and community education programs targeting obesity and \neating disorders. This bill also promotes funding programs that \nencourage healthy eating and physical activity and collecting and \nanalyzing data to determine the fitness levels and energy expenditures \nof children.\n  I have used nonlegislative avenues to address obesity and eating \ndisorders as well. I wrote an article in the New York Daily News last \nsummer highlighting long-term physical and emotional problems that can \nresult from childhood obesity, such as cardiovascular disease, Type 2 \ndiabetes, cancer, and depression, not to mention low self-esteem, \nacademic problems, and discrimination. I have urged making childhood \nobesity a real priority for families, schools, government and \nbusinesses and outlined steps to do this, including educating parents \nand children about the importance of a healthy lifestyle, restoring \nphysical education programs during and after school hours, and \nenlisting health care professionals to join the antiobesity campaign. \nWorking with the Eating Disorders Coalition, I sponsored a \ncongressional briefing called Schools, Students, Obesity and Eating \nDisorders to raise awareness of obesity, eating disorders, and physical \nactivity in school-age youth.\n  I am dedicated to promoting safe and fit lifestyles in our children \nand to fighting for healthier and stronger communities. Together we can \ncombat the health problems afflicting our youth today and create a \nbetter, more promising future. I commend the exemplary efforts of New \nYork YMCAs as they contribute to this mission on many fronts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1534-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1534-S1535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JANET ALTMAN SPRAGENS\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, on February 19, 2006, our Nation \nlost a great lawyer, educator, advocate, and public servant. Janet \nAltman Spragens was a lifelong resident of Washington, DC, and a \nprofessor at American University's Washington College of Law for 33 \nyears.\n  I met Janet when she was a young graduate student at Northwestern \nUniversity and taught social studies at my alma mater, Maine South High \nSchool in Park Ridge, IL. She was a Wellesley graduate, and as I was \nmaking choices about where I would go to college, she urged me to \nconsider Wellesley. I am grateful to Janet for helping me make that \nimportant decision in my life.\n  Janet went on to law school and developed an expertise in tax law. \nShe used that expertise to benefit our Nation's underserved taxpayers \nby advocating for them in Congress and, in 1990, founding the Federal \nTax Clinic. The clinic continues to operate today and the American Bar \nAssociation's Tax Section called it one of the earliest and most \nsuccessful low-income taxpayer clinics in the country.\n  Janet Altman Spragens made a difference in the lives of many \nAmericans who never will have the pleasure and privilege of knowing \nher. I join her family and friends in mourning her loss and ask that \nher obituary in the Washington Post be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 22, 2006]\n\n    Janet Spragens, 62; Law Professor Set Up Tax Clinic to Aid Poor\n\n                            (By Joe Holley)\n\n       Janet R. Spragens, 62, a tax professor at American \n     University's Washington College of Law and the founder of the \n     nation's first tax clinic for low-income taxpayers, died Feb. \n     19 of cancer at her home in the District.\n\n[[Page S1535]]\n\n       Ms. Spragens joined the faculty of the Washington College \n     of Law in fall 1973 and founded the Federal Tax Clinic in \n     1990. Its purpose is to provide third-year law students the \n     opportunity to learn by doing instead of just reading legal \n     theory and to provide assistance to people who frequently are \n     not served well by the legal system.\n       ``Janet came to realize that the tax system is a place \n     where low- and moderate-income taxpayers don't have the \n     resources to protect themselves,'' said Andy Pike, an \n     associate dean at the law school.\n       The clinic's clients have included cabdrivers, single \n     working mothers, travel agents, construction workers, \n     retirees, high school teachers, household workers and others \n     who find themselves caught up in the complexity of the \n     nation's administrative and judicial systems. As Ms. Spragens \n     told a House committee in 2001, many are non-English speakers \n     who are frightened and confused. The clinic charges no fees \n     for its services.\n       Since the clinic was founded, participation in it has been \n     ``standing-room only,'' said its supervising attorney, Nancy \n     Abramowitz, referring both to students and clients. The \n     program's success has spawned others at law schools across \n     the nation.\n       Born in Washington into a family of lawyers, Ms. Spragens \n     considered becoming a teacher before deciding to pursue a \n     career as a lawyer who taught. She received a bachelor's \n     degree from Wellesley College in 1964 and a master's degree \n     in education from Northwestern University in 1965. She \n     received a law degree from George Washington University Law \n     School in 1968.\n       As a student teacher during her year at Northwestern, she \n     taught future Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), then a \n     high school senior. In her memoir, ``Living History,'' \n     Clinton credits Ms. Spragens with urging her to broaden her \n     horizons by leaving the Midwest and attending college in the \n     East. Like Ms. Spragens, Clinton chose Wellesley.\n       During her third year of law school, Ms. Spragens served as \n     a clerk to U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch. She was an \n     attorney with the appellate section of the Justice \n     Department's tax division before joining the faculty of the \n     Washington College of Law in 1973. At the time, she was the \n     only female member of the full-time faculty.\n       Federal funding for the tax clinic, thanks to Ms. Spragens' \n     efforts, came about almost accidentally. Testifying in 1997 \n     before the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal \n     Revenue Service, she was asked what could be done to \n     alleviate tax problems confronting the working poor.\n       ``She said, somewhat offhandedly, just provide funds to \n     create more clinics for the provision of services to this \n     needy population across the country,'' Abramowitz noted. \n     ``The rest is history.''\n       Ms. Spragens also was concerned about unethical tax \n     preparers who prey on low-income taxpayers and about the \n     complexities of the earned income tax credit, which is \n     designed to help the working poor. ``They are just \n     overwhelmed by the complexity,'' she told The Washington Post \n     in 2001.\n       Ms. Spragens served as executive director of the American \n     Tax Policy Institute from 1996 to 2001, was a member of the \n     council for the American Bar Association section on taxation \n     since 1999 and had chaired the section's low-income taxpayer \n     and teaching taxation committees. She was director of the \n     Israel program at the Washington College of Law and was \n     visiting professor of law at the University of Haifa Faculty \n     of Law in 2000.\n       For her work on behalf of low-income taxpayers, she \n     received the 2006 ABA Section on Taxation Pro Bono Award.\n       Her marriage to Jeffrey Spragens ended in divorce.\n       Survivors include two daughters, Robin Spragens Trepanier \n     of Washington and Lee Spragens of Los Angeles; her mother, \n     Sophie B. Altman of Washington; two sisters, Susan Altman of \n     Washington and Nancy Altman of Bethesda; and a brother, \n     Robert Altman of Potomac.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1535-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN HONOR OF ED McNAMARA\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week, Michigan lost a \ndistinguished public servant and a visionary leader, and I lost a good \nfriend. Ed McNamara passed away at the age of 79 after a lifetime of \nservice to our State, including 16 years as Wayne County executive and \n17 years as mayor of Livonia. He fought relentlessly to make Michigan a \nbetter place, and he succeeded in ways small and large. And as he made \na difference in the lives of average people, he did so with a sparkle \nin his eye and humor on his lips.\n  Ed was an old pol in the best sense of the word. He loved his \nconstituents, he loved serving them, and he made a difference in their \nlives. Ed brought health care to the poor, saved a countywide bus \nsystem, and revitalized the county's parks. He paved the roads, helped \nsave the Rouge River, and made big investments in the people and \ninfrastructure of Southeastern Michigan.\n  When Ed took office as county executive, Wayne County, which includes \nthe city of Detroit, was facing a $135 million deficit. Ed quickly \neliminated that red ink and revived the county's bond rating as a first \nstep toward the greater revitalization he envisioned. Ed McNamara never \nstopped believing in Wayne County, and we will be reaping the rewards \nof that leadership for years to come. Just this month, Detroit hosted \nthe Super Bowl at Ford Field, which Ed helped to build. Last year, \nDetroit hosted Major League Baseball's All-Star Game at Comerica Park, \nwhich Ed helped to build. And visitors to each of these events flew \ninto the Detroit Metro Airport terminal named in his honor, which Ed \nhelped to build.\n  Ed's legacy will also live on in the many people he has inspired and \nmentored, including the Governor of Michigan. Like them, I have learned \nso much from him in the years that I have known him. It has been a joy \nto know a man of such energy, talent, kindness, and warmth.\n  Ed's abundant good nature spread hope and opportunity for the \nmultitude that he touched. His life demonstrated what a difference one \nperson can make. He will be greatly missed by the people he loved and \nled. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Lucille and his \nchildren and grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1535-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO CENTER FOR PROVISIONAL ACCELERATED LEARNING\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nCenter for Provisional Accelerated Learning, PAL, in San Bernardino, \nCA. For the past 20 years, the Provisional Accelerated Learning Center \nhas been an outstanding community center for service and support.\n  The PAL Center was the vision of Dr. Mildred Dalton Henry, a retired \nprofessor emeritus from California State University at San Bernardino. \nIn August 1983, Dr. Henry, community resident Alonza Thompson, and \nother members of the community worked together to establish a \ncommunity-based learning center.\n  Today, these PAL Center founders can look back at 20 successful years \nof community outreach and mentorship that has changed the lives of \nmany. Many students have written about the gratitude and fond memories \nthey hold for the PAL Center and the positive effect it had on their \nlives.\n  At the PAL Center, individuals from throughout the community can \nreceive quality educational services and individual life assistance and \nsupport. The PAL Center values cultural diversity and strives to assist \nindividuals from all walks of life. In many communities throughout our \nNation, troubling situations have forced many individuals to go without \nthe assistance that could change their lives. In San Bernardino, these \nsame individuals can count on the PAL Center to help them plan for and \ntake action to face life's challenges and plan for successful futures.\n  I applaud the service and dedication of the community heroes at the \nCenter for Provisional Accelerated Learning in San Bernardino. Their \nefforts have made a lasting impression on their community, and set a \nstandard for our nation. Please join me in honoring them on their 20th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1535-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1535-S1536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING THE WILLIAMS INSTITUTE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to take a few \nmoments to recognize the work of The Williams Institute--formerly the \nWilliams Project--on Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy at UCLA \nLaw School, as it gathers for its Fifth Annual Update.\n  Founded 5 years ago with the generous support of Charles R. Williams, \nthe Williams Institute produces substantive scholarship on matters \npertaining to sexual orientation law and public policy. The first and \nonly institution of its kind in the United States, the institute \nproduces scholarship on sexual orientation issues through the \ncollaborative efforts of scholars, judges, advocates, and students. \nThose working for the Williams Institute have published an array of \ndocuments ranging from amicus briefs that have proved useful in key \ncourt cases to books that have helped legal scholars comprehend the \nramifications of a constantly evolving body of law.\n  Educating members of the legal community in America through \ncontinuing legal education, lectures, symposia, classes, and speakers \nis a critical part\n\n[[Page S1536]]\n\nof the Williams Institute's mission. This focus on disseminating \ninformation, coupled with the intellectual and material resources of \nUCLA, has made the Williams Institute into a national center for the \ninterdisciplinary exploration of sexual orientation law and policy \nmatters by scholars, judges, practitioners, advocates, and students.\n  The Williams Institute actively strives to produce well-informed \nyoung lawyers. To this end, student involvement in the organization is \nof paramount importance. Students partake in research with faculty \nscholars and contribute to the wide breadth of scholarship produced by \nthe Williams Institute.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in commending the work of the \nWilliams Institute. In a nation where equal treatment under the law is \na central tenet of citizenship, the Williams Institute plays a critical \nrole in ensuring that America lives by its creed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1536-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    IN CELEBRATION OF THE CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF SAN FRANCISCO'S \n                               JAPANTOWN\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

For the past 100 years, Japantown has been an integral \npart of San Francisco's rich and diverse cultural history. At 100 years \nold, it is the first and oldest Japantown in the continental United \nStates.\n  The first Japanese immigrants arrived in San Francisco in the 1860s. \nOriginally settling in the South Park and Chinatown areas, the Japanese \ncommunity relocated to the Western Addition after the great earthquake \nand fire of 1906 destroyed much of San Francisco. When Japantown \nrelocated to the Western Addition in 1906, the Japanese community had \nthe opportunity to grow. More Japanese businesses, shops, churches, \nschools, restaurants, and hotels moved to the area and supported \ncommunity development. Before long, the area became known as \nNihonmachi, or Japantown. At the height of its growth in 1940, more \nthan 5,000 Japanese lived in Japantown, and there were more than 200 \nJapanese-owned businesses.\n  We are not proud of what happened to the Japanese-American community \nduring World War II in the early 1940s. In 1942, President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which forced ``all persons of \nJapanese ancestry, including aliens and non-aliens'' into internment \ncamps until the end of World War II. The internment was fueled by \nracism and war hysteria and will forever tarnish our country's history. \nAs time has proved, there was no excuse for our Government's decision \nto intern American citizens. Since those dark days, our Nation has made \ngreat strides toward tolerance and inclusion.\n  In 1983, as part of Fred Korematsu's successful petition to the \nFederal District Court in San Francisco to overturn his conviction for \nviolating evacuation orders, the court also ruled that the internment \nof American citizens of Japanese descent during World War II was \nlegally unsupportable. In 1989, Congress passed legislation formally \napologizing for the internment of Japanese-American citizens during \nWorld War II and authorized a reparations fund for internment \nsurvivors. Though we still have further to go to assure equality for \nall, most Americans now realize that diversity is one of our country's \ngreatest strengths.\n  When the Japanese community returned to San Francisco after World War \nII, it was difficult to rebuild the extensive community that existed \nbefore the war. However, despite the many barriers, the Japanese \ncommunity did rebuild Japantown. And although San Francisco's Japantown \nis smaller today than it was in the past, it still plays a large and \nimportant role in our community. Not only does it serve as a reminder \nof our past, it provides us with an opportunity to celebrate the \nhistory, challenges, triumphs, and contributions of the Japanese-\nAmerican community in San Francisco.\n  For 100 years, San Francisco's Japantown has served as a cultural \nresource for the San Francisco Bay area and California. I thank the San \nFrancisco Japantown community for its many efforts to educate the \ncommunity about Japanese culture and traditions. I congratulate them on \ntheir centennial anniversary and wish them another 100 years of \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1536-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN MEMORIAM TO DAVE TATSUNO\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor \nthe life of Dave Tatsuno, whose courageous documentation of life in a \nJapanese-American internment camp contributed immensely to our \nknowledge of this dark time in U.S. history. Mr. Tatsuno passed away on \nJanuary 26, 2006. He was 92.\n  Mr. Tatsuno, born in 1913 to a family who had come to the United \nStates in the late 19th century, was raised in San Francisco, in my \nhome State of California. Mr. Tatsuno changed his first name from \nMasaharu to Dave when he successfully ran for student body president of \nhis junior high school; Masaharu was too long to fit on his campaign \nposters. In 1936, Mr. Tatsuno graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree \nin business and went to work at Nichi Bei Bussan, a department store in \nSan Francisco that his father founded.\n  After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which forced ``all persons of \nJapanese ancestry, including aliens and non-aliens'' into internment \ncamps until the end of World War II. Mr. Tatsuno and his family were \nforced to move to the Topaz Relocation Center, an internment camp in \nTopaz, AZ. Over the next 3 years, Mr. Tatsuno secretly filmed life in \nthe camp with an 8-millimeter Bell & Howell camera that Walter \nHonderick, his supervisor at the internment camp's co-op store, helped \nsmuggle in. Because the camera was forbidden, Mr. Tatsuno kept it \nhidden in a shoe box, taking it out only when guards were not looking. \nThese images of daily life in Topaz--of church services, of people \ngardening, of birthday celebrations--have left viewers with a stark \nimage of what life was like during those hard years.\n  After the Tatsuno family was released from the internment camp, Mr. \nTatsuno's footage of life in Topaz was turned into a 48-minute silent \nfilm, ``Topaz.'' In 1996, the Library of Congress placed ``Topaz'' on \nits National Film Registry, which was established in 1989 by Congress \nto preserve culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant \nfilms. Mr. Tatsuno's film is one of only two home movies on the \nregistry's 425-film list; the other film is Abraham Zapruder's footage \nof the John F. Kennedy assassination. The original footage for \n``Topaz'' is now a part of the permanent collection at the Japanese \nAmerican National Museum in Los Angeles.\n  After the war, Mr. Tatsuno helped his father reopen Nichi Bei Bussan \nand took over the business when his father retired. Through this work, \nMr. Tatsuno became a prominent and respected businessman and civic \nleader in San Francisco and San Jose, where he eventually made his \nhome. He also remained engaged and interested in film. His compassion \nand thoughtfulness inspired many others and he will be deeply missed.\n  Mr. Tatsuno is survived by three daughters, Arlene Damron, Valerie \nSermon, and Melanie Cochran; two sons, Rod Tatsuno and Sheridan \nTatsuno; his sister, Chiye Watanabe; four grandchildren; and two great-\ngrandchildren. I extend my deepest sympathies to his family.\n  Dave Tatsuno played down the importance of his role in chronicling \nthe history of the Japanese-American internment camps, always giving \ncredit to Walter Honderick. But Dave Tatsuno will long be remembered \nfor his courage and perseverance in difficult times. His film will have \na lasting effect on many generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1536-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1536-S1537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING WESTSIDE CENTER FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to take a few \nmoments to recognize the tremendous accomplishments of the Westside \nCenter for Independent Living, WCIL, based in Santa Monica and Los \nAngeles, as this unique organization celebrates its 30th year of \nservice.\n\n[[Page S1537]]\n\n  WCIL has devoted innumerable hours and incredible effort toward \ngiving senior citizens and members of our community with disabilities \nthe gift of independence. The WCIL was founded in 1976 during the \nheight of the ``independent living movement.'' Originating in Berkeley \nin 1970, the independent living movement has strived to provide \ndisabled persons with the opportunity to manage their own lives. Today, \ncenters such as the WCIL have become a vital staple of urban life \nacross the Nation.\n  Through an array of innovative methods, the center allows seniors and \ndisabled persons to become more fully integrated into our community. \nOne such technique is the peer training system, whereby veterans of the \nindependence training program share their tested knowledge with people \nwho are new to the program. Such pairing instills a sense of confidence \nin new participants, as it lets them know that they are not alone and \nthat others like them have succeeded in leading a more independent \nlife.\n  WCIL's Advocacy Action Group works with the disabled community and \nelected officials to modernize existing disability legislation. The \ngroup collects the ideas and complaints of disabled people and \ntransforms them into substantive legislation. Through true grassroots \ncampaigning and issue advocacy, the group ensures that elected \nofficials stay abreast of current accessibility issues in their \ncommunity.\n  Recognizing the necessity for information regarding accessibility \nthroughout Los Angeles, the WCIL, in partnership with UCLA, has \nestablished Living Independently in Los Angeles, LILA. LILA provides a \nhost of useful information regarding the accessibility of public and \nprivate places, community organizations working for the betterment of \nthose with disabilities, and advocacy groups. Thanks to LILA, numerous \ndisabled persons are better equipped to navigate Los Angeles.\n  The center provides invaluable educational services, including public \nawareness about the Americans with Disabilities Act. Countless \nbusinesses, community organizations, and local community members credit \nWCIL for helping them to ensure that buildings and offices are \naccessible for Americans with disabilities.\n  I am pleased to join the thousands of beneficiaries of this important \norganization in commending the Westside Center for Independent Living. \nThe Center's work has bettered the lives of countless disabled and \nsenior citizens and has enabled them to participate more fully in our \ncommunity. The center's efforts have clearly shown that ``a disability \nneed not be disabling.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1537-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVID L. CROW\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the \ndistinguished public service of David L. Crow. After 15 years at the \nhelm of the largest air-pollution control district in the Nation, he \nwill soon retire as the air pollution control officer and executive \ndirector of the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District, \nSJAPCD. During his tenure, the district grew from a fledgling union of \nregional air boards into one of the Nation's most active air-pollution \ncontrol districts.\n  After completing his undergraduate and graduate studies at California \nState University, Fullerton, David built a solid resume in public \nservice before he assumed the leadership of the SJAPCD in 1991. He \nserved as the acting city manager for Foster City, CA, budget director \nand director of policy development for Fresno County, as well as deputy \ncounty administrative officer for Fresno County before lending his \nconsiderable talents to improving air quality in the Central Valley.\n  David accepted the challenge to address and solve the air-quality \nissues in a region that perennially rank among the worst nationwide in \nsummertime smog and wintertime particulate pollution. Under his \nstewardship, the Valley air basin has made great strides in reducing \nozone exceedances, as it has seen a 50-percent reduction in the \nemissions from statutory sources. The SJAPCD has implemented programs \nsuch as the ``Check Before You Burn'' winter wood-burning restriction \nprogram; a system to reduce smoke emissions from agricultural burning, \nand creating cost-effective rules to encourage conservation management \npractices for farms.\n  During his tenure as the head of the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution \nControl District, David has earned a reputation as a skilled consensus-\nbuilder who forged partnerships between interests which seldom agreed. \nUnder his leadership, the air-pollution district has distributed over \n$100 million to implement a myriad of projects to reduce serious air \npollution in the region. David Crow's efforts, and those of the \ntalented staff that he helped build, are helping to improve the air \nquality in California's Central Valley, one of the fastest growing \nregions in the Nation.\n  Throughout his career, David Crow has proven to be a highly effective \nadministrator who was committed to protecting the public's health. As \nhe gets set to spend more time with his wife Vicky and sons, Ryan and \nMatthew, I wish him continued success and good luck in all his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1537-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICER EARL HARWOOD SCOTT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to honor the memory of \na dedicated public servant, Officer Earl Harwood Scott of the \nCalifornia Highway Patrol. Officer Earl Harwood Scott spent nearly 5 \nyears with the California Highway Patrol, providing the citizens of \nCalifornia with safety and service. On the morning of February 17, \n2006, while on motor patrol near the City of Salida, Officer Scott was \nmercilessly murdered in the line of duty during a traffic stop.\n  The California Highway Patrol was in Officer Scott's bloodlines. \nOfficer Scott's father, Sergeant William Scott, as well as two uncles, \nare proud retired California Highway Patrol veterans. Officer Scott was \nto celebrate his 5-year anniversary with the California Highway Patrol \non February 19. Officer Scott dutifully served the citizens and \ncommunities of Stanislaus and San Joaquin counties with great \ndedication and integrity. Officer Scott's commitment to help others, \ncombined with his passion for law enforcement, enabled him to become a \nmodel California Highway Patrol officer. Officer Scott's colleagues \nshall always remember his gregarious nature and commitment to his job.\n  Officer Scott is survived by his father, William Scott, and his \nmother, Judith. When he was not on duty, Officer Scott enjoyed spending \ntime with his neighbors, especially the children who would often play \ndarts and watch sporting events in his garage. Officer Earl Harwood \nScott served the State of California with honor and distinction and \nfulfilled his oath as an officer of the law. His contributions and \ndedication to law enforcement are greatly appreciated and will serve as \na shining example of his legacy.\n  We shall always be grateful for Officer Scott's heroic service and \nthe sacrifices he made while serving the community and protecting the \npeople he loved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1537-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1537-S1538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING THE LIFE OF ANDREA BRONFMAN\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nAndrea Bronfman, a respected philanthropist and a dear friend. Andrea \npassed away on January 23, 2006, at the age of 60.\n  Born in Great Britain in 1945, Andrea quickly demonstrated remarkable \ncompassion for those in need and an ardent desire to improve the world \naround her. She was married to Charles Bronfman in 1982, and together \nthey raised five children and six grandchildren. While their wonderful \nfamily was certainly one of Andrea's proudest achievements, she will \nalso be fondly remembered for her generous nature, her passion for \nlife, and her multitude of charitable endeavors.\n  Andrea's philanthropy benefited citizens of all countries and faiths, \nbut she is best known for her activism within the Jewish community and \nher devotion to Israel, Jewish life, and the Jewish people. In addition \nto serving on the boards of several well-respected Jewish \norganizations, she and Charles cofounded Birthright Israel, a program \nthat offers young adults a chance to travel to Israel and experience \nthe roots of their ancestry firsthand. As a result of these good works \nand her undying devotion to Jewish life, Andrea\n\n[[Page S1538]]\n\nwas named an honorary citizen of Jerusalem in 2002 and was given the \nkey to the city by then-Mayor Ehud Olmert.\n  Throughout her life, Andrea proved herself to be a true pillar of \ndecency and generosity both within the Jewish community and outside of \nit. Not content just to fund projects, Andrea was actively involved in \nthe community and was constantly devising new undertakings that would \nbenefit society and help more people. Most recently she served as \nfounder and deputy chairman of The Gift of New York, a nonprofit \ninitiative that provided free admission to concerts, theatrical \nproductions, and sporting events to the families of those who died at \nthe World Trade Center in 2001. Andrea recognized that grief is not an \nemotion that subsides after a few months. Long after the rubble of 9/11 \nhad been cleared, she ensured that the bereaved families knew that \ntheir loss and heartache had not been forgotten.\n  Our hearts go out to Andrea's family and friends as they deal with \nthe inevitable pain and sadness that come from an unexpected death. To \nmitigate that pain somewhat, we can remember and be grateful that \nAndrea lived a life filled with love, kindness, and compassion. Her \ndedication to humanitarian causes and deep devotion to her faith served \nas an inspiration to everyone who knew her and benefited from her \nachievements and generosity. While her determination and spirit will be \nmissed, her legacy will live on through the millions of people her work \nhas touched.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Mrs. Andrea \nBronfman and the legacy she left to philanthropy and caring about \npeople whether she knew them or not.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1538-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY BLOCKING \nPROPERTY OF PERSONS UNDERMINING DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES OR INSTITUTIONS IN \n                            ZIMBABWE--PM 41\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to ensure the security of United States ports, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I am proud that I have introduced today \nalong with Senators Clinton, Lautenberg, Nelson, and Boxer legislation \nthat would guarantee that foreign governments cannot control the \noperations of the ports of the United States. I thank Senator Clinton \nfor her leadership on this issue as we fight together, along with \nSenator Schumer and others, to keep the Port of New York/New Jersey \nsafe.\n  I think we all know why public attention has been focused on this \ndeal over the past 2 weeks. Our ports are the gateway to this country. \nThey are the gateway for much that we eat, that we drink, that we wear, \ndrive, and use on a daily basis. But just as they bring in goods we \nenjoy, the ports are also our Achilles' heel, the vulnerability that \ncould be exploited in an attempt to bring us down if terrorists \ntransport a nuclear, biological, or chemical weapon to our ports. That \nis why our legislation sets a new standard for the future control of \nour ports.\n  Our legislation would protect our national security by keeping our \nports from falling into the hands of foreign governments. Our \nlegislation bans foreign government-owned companies from operating in \nour ports and requires the President to report to Congress on how to \nmanage national security risks arising from any existing port \ncontracts. Our legislation would also end the secrecy associated with \nthe Dubai deal by making the executive branch notify Congress as well \nas State and local officials of future deals. The legislation also \nincludes a new public comment period.\n  Never again should the American public find out about a secret deal \nthrough the newspapers after the fact. Never again should Congress \nlearn about the sale of a key U.S. infrastructure asset to a foreign \nstate-owned company only after the deal is done. And never again can we \ncompromise national security by turning our port operations over to \nanother country, whether friend or foe.\n  Our message with this legislation today is clear: Never again.\n  I think all Americans instinctively know we cannot simply turn over \nour critical national security infrastructure such as terminal \noperations at our ports to a foreign government. Foreign governments \nact very differently than even foreign companies. Foreign governments \nact in their own national interests and in their own national security \ninterests. Privately held foreign companies are controlled by \nstockholders and answer to the needs of the market, not the needs of a \ngovernment. One must only study the way in which Venezuelan President \nHugo Chavez has used his state-owned oil company to pursue the \ninterests of the Government of Venezuela to understand that state-owned \ncompanies often behave very differently than publicly traded ones.\n  That is why our legislation bans foreign governments from owning, \nleasing, or operating any facilities in our ports. We believe that just \nas we would not turn over the operations of our airport facilities to a \nforeign government, why should we turn the operations of our ports, \nwhich are the biggest hole in our national security blanket, over to a \nforeign government.\n  The opponents of this thought process, of this bill, like to argue \nthis is the reality of global trade. But the people making this \nargument are the same ones who constantly remind us that the world has \nchanged since September 11 and that we must adapt our security response \naccordingly. Whatever happened before September 11, the world has \nchanged since then and we cannot rely on our old methods of looking at \nthe world in a traditional way.\n  One of the things the September 11 Commission told us was to think \noutside of the box. A simple envelope became a weapon of great injury \nwhen it was filled with anthrax; an airplane used to travel \ncommercially or for pleasure was turned into a weapon of mass \ndestruction. Think outside the box. And if we cannot think outside the \nbox in the context of understanding how the ports in the United States, \nin the hands of a foreign government in an operational capacity, can \nhave a security consequence, we are in trouble in this post-September \n11 world. This is an area in which security must take priority over \ncommercial transactions.\n  Make no mistake about it; the legislation is urgently needed, and I \nam writing the President today expressing my concern that this new 45-\nday review leaves the President with no authority to act to stop Dubai \nPorts World from taking control of United States port operations. I am \nnot sure that is clear with this 45-day review. This transaction was \nset to close on March 2, and\n\n[[Page S1542]]\n\nwe want to stop the clock now and make sure that 45-day investigative \nreview period is precedent to the fulfillment of that agreement.\n  We also believe it is time to end the secrecy surrounding these \ndeals. This secrecy apparently allowed the executive branch to ignore \nour own laws. These laws require a 45-day investigation of deals \ninvolving government-owned companies which could affect national \nsecurity. Clearly a deal to turn over part of our port operations to a \nforeign government-owned company would impact national security. We \nknow the Coast Guard warned the administration that there were \nintelligence gaps that made it impossible to determine the threats \nraised by the deal. Yet it is only now, after enormous external \npressure, that this 45-day review period may be carried out. But \nstarting an investigation that should have already been carried out \nunder the law is not enough, and that is why, from my position on the \nBanking Committee, during hearings later this week, I plan to seek to \ndiscover why the law wasn't followed. I am looking forward to working \nwith both the chairman and ranking member to come up with comprehensive \nsolutions to these problems that emanated under the Committee on \nForeign Investment in the United States.\n  As I said before, I am also concerned about the secrecy in this \nprocess. Many New Jersey residents have written or called me asking why \nthe process in approving the deal was so secretive and why Congress was \nkept in the dark. It is clear to me, to the people of New Jersey, using \ntheir common sense, and to the American public that we must have \ntransparency and openness as we address these national security issues.\n  Without our legislation, the committee that reviews this process \ndoesn't even have to tell Congress about the deal until after it has \nmade a decision. And even after they make a decision, they have no \nobligation to inform the American public. In the particular case of the \nDubai Ports deal, the committee sent out no information and the press \nonly learned about it when Dubai Ports World decided to put out its own \npress release. That is why our legislation would require the \nnotification of Congress, State, and local authorities where \nappropriate, as well as a public comment period to allow the public \nimpacted by any future deals to share their concerns with the Federal \nGovernment.\n  These are basic reforms which I think most Americans would agree seem \nnecessary, almost obvious when it comes to protecting our ports. The \nfight to secure our ports cannot and will not end with this \nlegislation.\n  Let me be clear: Our ports are not secure. I have been arguing on \nthis for quite a long time as a former Member of the House of \nRepresentatives representing the Port of Elizabeth and Newark, the \nthird largest port, the Port of New York/New Jersey and other ports on \nthe eastern seaboard. For all the money the Nation has poured into \nimproving our security, several critical links in the chain have been \nignored, and this week the spotlight has shone brightly on one aspect \nof the problem: our ports, the port of entry for thousands of \ncontainers every day, holding everything from clothing to electronics. \nBut these containers could also contain much more dangerous cargo such \nas a nuclear, chemical, or biological weapon.\n  The bottom line is we don't know what is in the vast majority of \ncontainers entering this country because despite repeated warnings from \nsecurity experts from both within and without our Government, only 1 \nout of every 20 containers that passes through our ports is screened, \nand 95 percent receive no screening whatsoever other than a cursory \nglance at a cargo manifest.\n  It is crucial that we also develop a national transportation plan \nthat includes a comprehensive strategy for protecting our ports. A \nweapon of mass destruction detonated in a shipping container at the \nPort of New York/New Jersey or any other seaport could cause tens of \nthousands of casualties and economic losses approaching a trillion \ndollars. According to the U.S. Coast Guard, $5.4 billion will be needed \nover the next 10 years for port security. Yet since the 9/11 attacks, \nCongress has provided less than $800 million.\n  This is not a new problem, and it should not be surprising that the \nadministration has let this problem fester. They have continuously \nfocused on the security of only one aspect of our critical \ninfrastructure to the detriment of the rest. That is something we can \nno longer continue to accept.\n  In New Jersey we face the reality of failures in our national \nsecurity every day when we look across the river at Ground Zero and \nmourn the loss of over 700 fellow New Jerseyans who died on September \n11, 2001. The problem of port security is not in some distant future or \nsome distant issue but an everyday reality, as we look at our own port \nwhich brings in hundreds of thousands of containers from around the \nworld every day: 145 million tons last year from over 5,000 ships. This \nis a port that generates over 200,000 jobs and $25 billion of economic \nactivity. It is a great economic engine. It is also a great risk.\n  In today's reality, a foreign government, if it were to be operating \nthe facilities at one of those ports and simply wanted to do something \nas benign maybe as shutting it down at a critical moment, such as when \nwe are sending supplies to our troops in the field--we use our \ncommercial ports increasingly to send military equipment and supplies \nto back our troops in the field--imagine if it were shut down at a \ncritical moment when we needed those supplies to be generated across \nthe sea.\n  That is why we have to face these realities together. We must stand \ntogether across party lines and across States to fight for the safety \nand security of our families. Our ports are on the front lines in our \nfight against terrorism, and with this legislation, we say we will \nnever again allow a deal which would compromise the national security \nof our ports, the safety of New Jersey, or the security of the United \nStates.\n  I urge my fellow Senators on both sides of the aisle to join with us \nin this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2334\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

It is the primary role of our \nNational Government to provide for the security of the American people. \nI hope that in the debate, though, about the control of our ports, we \ndon't operate on the basis of looking for political advantage but, \nrather, we take a calm and deliberate review of the facts.\n  I heard this morning, in the Armed Services Committee, from the \nDirector of National Intelligence, who said that after a review of this \ntransaction, it was his opinion, as the lead Government official for \nthe intelligence community in our Nation, that any risk in this \ntransaction was low. Certainly, that was useful information to have, \nand I anticipate that we will continue to hear more as the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee continues to look into \nthis transaction, and I trust we will do our due diligence during this \n45-day review period.\n  But I hope we don't make this a political football. I hope we don't \npaint this with such a broad brush that we consider any Arab nation our \nenemy when, in fact, this Nation has been an ally in the global war on \nterror. I hope we will make our judgments based on behavior and not \nwhere someone comes from or their ethnicity or other origins because, \nof course, fanning the flames of prejudice based upon those sorts of \nconsiderations would be inappropriate entirely.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mr. Akaka, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 2337. A bill to increase access to postsecondary education, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenators Snowe, Akaka, Kerry, Durbin, and DeWine, the College Pathway \nAct of 2006. The intent of this bill is to provide a means of \naddressing the critical issue of college access and postsecondary \nacademic success. College access for all will continue to be a struggle \nuntil the predictors of successful college performance are assimilated \ninto high school curricula. The degree to which high school students \nare successfully prepared for college continues to be at the forefront \nof educational concerns. Reports abound repeating the same message: our \nhigh school students, particularly students from low-income and \nminority populations, are not being adequately prepared for the \nchallenges of postsecondary education. The College Pathway Act seeks to \nfoster alliances among the interested and integral stakeholders in the \neducational arena to create consistency in content and assessment \nstandards between P-12 and higher education. We do this by encouraging \nthe establishment of P-16 Commissions. We must rise to the challenge \nand forge a pathway to enhance both college access and academic \nsuccess.\n  Postsecondary education is an important aspiration for most students \nand the future strength of our economy and workforce will largely \ndepend on the postsecondary educational attainments of students across \nthe country regardless of ethnicity or economic status. High school \npreparation is a major part of the problem. Published reports on the \nstatus of this topic stress the lack of preparedness of high school \ngraduates for postsecondary education. Most will need remedial help in \ncollege. More than 70 percent of high school graduates enter two and \nfour year colleges, but at least 28 percent immediately take remedial \nEnglish or math courses. At some point during their college years, 53 \npercent of students will take one remedial English or math class if not \nmore. For low-income and minority students, the percentage is higher. \nStates require a certain number of English and math courses to be \ncompleted prior to graduation, however, the certainty of course content \nreflecting the knowledge and skills important for college success is \nnot ensured.\n  Students find themselves taking high school courses lacking in rigor \nand challenging content, particularly in the areas of math and science. \nIf asked, 39 percent of students who have gone on to a postsecondary \ninstitution will admit they were not adequately prepared for college \nand there were gaps in their overall preparation. College instructors \nestimate that 42 percent of their students are not adequately prepared. \nThe quality and intensity of the secondary school curriculum are the \nmost significant predictors of college success; and are more \nsignificant than race, socioeconomic status, secondary school grade \npoint average, or ACT and SAT scores. These findings are particularly \nsignificant for minority groups enrolling in college. Students who \nengage in challenging secondary coursework will attend and persist in \npursuing higher education at a greater rate than those who follow \nprograms of study that are not rigorous in content. All states have \nEnglish and mathematics standards and assessments at the high school \nlevel, yet assessment standards and tests often do not reflect the \ndemands put on students in postsecondary education and in the \nworkplace. High school curricula must be aligned with college entry \nrequirements. The American Diploma Project states that the challenge \nahead is to create a system of assessments and graduation requirements \nthat considered together signify readiness for college and work. We, as \nFederal policymakers, have an essential role to play in making this a \nreality and creating college access for all.\n  In part, the misalignment between postsecondary institutions and high \nschool stems from current governance systems in place for P-12 \neducational systems and higher education. Both systems are generally \ngoverned, financed and operated differently. This gap must be bridged \nbetween the two systems. Creating a pipeline of shared information \nbetween the two entities and the business community will promote an \nexchange of necessary and useful information. Working to align \nstandards from the early grades through grade 12 recognizes that skill \nacquisition and content assimilation build one upon the other and \nacknowledges that high-school graduation and college success is a \nculmination of preparation originating in the beginning years of \nschool. Aligning curricula\n\n[[Page S1544]]\n\nacross school levels creates a more seamless education and ensures that \nstudents are prepared for each subsequent grade with particular \nattention to math, science, and engineering. Aligning P-12 and \npostsecondary education would reduce the number of students who arrive \nat college needing remedial coursework.\n\n  The need to develop high-quality data systems is also critical to \nimproving high school student outcomes. Accountability for high school \ngraduation numbers and drop-out rates is critical to addressing \neducation reform in our high schools. Currently reports have indicated \nthat the quality of high school graduation and drop-out data is often \nnot reliable and does not reflect the actual numbers.\n  Tracking student growth over time using longitudinal student-unit \ndatabases will provide the most accurate information for policy \ndecisions and assessments. Furthermore, information provided about \nstudent achievement over time can be linked to teachers, programs and \nschools serving those students. The National Governor's Association \n(NGA) recently convened a Task Force on State High School Graduation \nData--which included representatives from the American Federation of \nTeachers, the Business Roundtable, the Council of Chief State School \nOfficers, the Education Commission of the States, the Educational \nTesting Service, the Education Trust, the National Association of State \nBoards of Education, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the \nNational Education Association, Standard and Poor's and the State \nHigher Education Executive Officers--to make recommendations about how \nStates can develop a high-quality, comparable high school graduation \nmeasure, as well as complementary indicators of student progress and \noutcomes and data systems capable of collecting, analyzing, and \nreporting the data States need. The task force members concurred as a \ngroup on their mission and devised a compact to implement efforts to \nguide States in developing high quality data-systems ideally using a \nlongitudinal student unit record data system. This compact was signed \nby 51 governors in all States and Puerto Rico. The ultimate goal is \nbetter outcomes for students. Better information can lead to better \npolicies and program implementation. Our bill therefore includes \nincentives for States to develop or enhance such data systems.\n  The College Pathway Act supplies a remedy to the critical issue of \nthe disconnect existing between high school outcomes and college \nexpectations. Through the formation of partnerships between P-12 and \nhigher education systems in the States, academic success in \npostsecondary education becomes the priority agenda item for reform. We \nanticipate that P-16 Commissions will bring about an increase in the \npercentage of academically prepared students, particularly low-income \nand minority students, and a decrease in the percentage of college \nstudents requiring remedial coursework, particularly with respect to \nmath, science, and engineering.\n  The College Pathway Act of 2006 awards grants to States to establish \nP-16 Commissions in order to align P-12 outcomes with postsecondary \ninstitutions' expectations. The Commissions under the leadership of the \ngovernor or governor's designee, will convene stakeholders of the \nstatewide P-12 education and higher education community, and may \ninclude parent groups, State legislative representatives, and \nparticularly members of the business community. The commissions' goal \nto create a mission addressing college preparation will be the first \nand critical step of this process.\n  Many States across our country have already seen the wisdom of a P-16 \ncommission and have been working on goals and implementation. The \nresults, although preliminary for many States, are vastly encouraging. \nOur bill will provide support both to States with existing P-16 bodies, \nor States seeking to establish such commissions. It will give priority \nto the States also seeking to establish or enhance data systems.\n  The College Pathway Act of 2006 can offer States an opportunity to \ncraft a vision that will reach all students over time so that their \neducational pathway of access to and success in college will be \nensured.\n  I urge my colleagues to act favorably on this measure. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2337\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``College Pathway Act of \n     2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Postsecondary education is an important aspiration for \n     most students and the future strength of the United States \n     economy and workforce will largely depend on the \n     postsecondary educational attainments of all people of the \n     United States, regardless of sex, race, or ethnic background.\n       (2) Parents and students recognize the value of \n     postsecondary education. Ninety-seven percent of secondary \n     school students expect to attend college, and more than 75 \n     percent of secondary school graduates enroll in some \n     postsecondary education within 2 years of secondary school \n     graduation.\n       (3) Notwithstanding those expectations, only 32 percent of \n     students graduate from secondary school adequately prepared \n     to enter a 4-year institution of higher education. Students \n     living in poverty and students of color are roughly half as \n     likely to be college-ready.\n       (4) Despite the reality that most students will enter \n     college after secondary school, secondary school graduation \n     requirements are not aligned with the expectations of \n     postsecondary education.\n       (5) Rather than beginning college-level work upon entering \n     postsecondary education, many students (nearly 1 in 3) enroll \n     in developmental coursework, and more than half will take at \n     least 1 class of developmental coursework before leaving \n     postsecondary education. Students who need to take a class of \n     developmental coursework in college have less than a 40 \n     percent chance of completing their course of study, and \n     students who take 3 or more classes of developmental \n     coursework face reducing their prospects of completing their \n     course of study to less than 1 in 5.\n       (6) The quality and intensity of the secondary school \n     curriculum--\n       (A) are the most significant predictors of college success; \n     and\n       (B) are more significant than race, socioeconomic status, \n     secondary school grade point average, or ACT and SAT scores.\n       (7) States around the Nation have developed secondary \n     school academic standards, but there is often no relationship \n     between those standards and institutional expectations for \n     college-level study. Students, families, and school personnel \n     need information to address the gap that exists between \n     satisfying various kindergarten through grade 12 standards \n     and meeting the standards that indicate success in higher \n     education. The lack of clear information affects all \n     students, but the effect is particularly grave for students \n     living in poverty who are more reliant on schools and public \n     sources of information to gauge their preparedness for \n     college-level work.\n       (8) Numerous reports have cited the need to improve \n     mathematics and science achievement in prekindergarten \n     through grade 12.\n       (9) Current data systems are not designed to measure the \n     efficacy of State actions intended to prepare students to \n     enter and succeed in postsecondary education. State-level \n     data systems usually contain only data related to \n     kindergarten through grade 12, and often are not compatible \n     with postsecondary education data systems.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To broaden the focus of Federal, State, and local \n     higher education programs to promote academic success in \n     postsecondary education, particularly with respect to \n     mathematics, science, and engineering.\n       (2) To increase the percentage of low-income and minority \n     students who are academically prepared to enter and \n     successfully complete postsecondary-level general education \n     coursework.\n       (3) To decrease the percentage of students requiring \n     developmental coursework through grants that enable States to \n     coordinate the public prekindergarten through grade 12 \n     education system and the postsecondary education system--\n       (A) to ensure that covered institutions articulate and \n     publicize the prerequisite skills and knowledge expected of \n     incoming postsecondary students attending covered \n     institutions, in order to provide students and other \n     interested parties with accurate information pertaining to \n     the students' necessary preparations for postsecondary \n     education;\n       (B) to establish and implement middle school and secondary \n     school course enrollment guidelines--\n       (i) to ensure that public secondary school students, in all \n     major racial and ethnic groups, and income levels, complete \n     academic courses linked with academic success at the \n     postsecondary level; and\n       (ii) to increase the percentage of students in each major \n     racial group, ethnic group, and income level who graduate \n     from secondary school and enter postsecondary education with \n     the academic preparation necessary to successfully complete \n     postsecondary-level\n\n[[Page S1545]]\n\n     general education coursework, particularly with respect to \n     mathematics, science, and engineering;\n       (C) to implement programs and policies that increase \n     secondary school graduation rates; and\n       (D) to collect and analyze disaggregated longitudinal \n     student data throughout P-16 education in order to--\n       (i) understand and improve students' progress throughout \n     the P-16 education system;\n       (ii) understand problems and needs throughout the P-16 \n     education system; and\n       (iii) align prekindergarten through grade 12 academic \n     standards and higher education standards so that more \n     students are prepared to successfully complete postsecondary-\n     level general education coursework.\n\n     SEC. 4.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     Act $55,000,000 for fiscal year 2007 and such sums as may be \n     necessary for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2011.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a bill that will \nimprove college access by creating a framework to ensure that high \nschool graduates amass the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in \ncollege--the College Pathway Act. My colleague, Senator Lieberman, and \nI have been working hand-in-hand to identify the degree to which high \nschool students are unsuccessfully prepared for college and develop \npractical solutions to this issue. The bill we introduce today is the \nproduct of our combined efforts.\n  Today, 97 percent of secondary school students expect to attend \ncollege, however, high school students are not prepared academically \nfor the rigors of college coursework. Although States around the \ncountry have developed high school standards, there is often a \ndisconnect that exists between high school standards and college \nexpectations. Today, 53 percent of post-secondary students require \nremedial English or mathematics. Graduation rates for those requiring \nremedial classes are less then 40 percent. And that is why Senator \nLeiberman and I are working together in response to the concerns that \ntoo many students start college without the proper tools.\n  Part of the problem is that colleges and high schools generally have \nseparate statewide governing boards for their pre-kindergarten through \n12th grade and higher education systems. The College Pathway Act awards \ngrants enabling States the opportunity of a voluntary establishment of \npre-kindergarten through the 16th grade commissions in States, \nconsisting of representatives of the pre-kindergarten through 12th \ngrade and higher education communities, the governor's office, \nappropriate State legislators and members of the business community. \nThese partnerships within the commission would promote academic success \nin postsecondary education, increase the percentage of academically \nprepared low-income and minority students, and decrease the percentage \nof college students requiring remedial coursework, particularly with \nrespect to math, science and engineering.\n  This commission offers a framework for aligning lower, middle and \nhigh school curriculum and assessment standards with post-secondary \nexpectations. Students who are properly prepared before entering \ncollege are far more likely to succeed in college. Indeed, many States \nacross the Nation are looking to the pre-kindergarten through 12th \ngrade concept to improve alignment. Federal funding for establishment \nof pre-kindergarten through 12th grade commissions would allow States \nto implement or expand their current programs. In addition, many States \nare attempting to improve data collection systems in order to better \nevaluate those programs that lead to success. Our bill would also offer \nsupport to those States which voluntarily seek to enhance and improve \nthe effectiveness of their data systems. We believe that by promoting \ncoordination of grades pre-kindergarten through 12th grade, States will \nbetter align education systems helping to ensure that all students are \nprepared to successfully engage in and complete post-secondary level \ncoursework.\n  Our Nation must make a solid commitment to ensuring that every \nindividual has the opportunity to pursue a higher education. We should \npursue\n\n[[Page S1547]]\n\npolicies that will prepare students to begin their college career. I \nbelieve that education is the great equalizer in our society that gives \nevery citizen of our Nation the same opportunity to succeed in the \nglobal economy of the 21st century. That's why I will continue to \ntarget access to higher education for America's students. The College \nPathway Act will help to further this goal.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I would like to voice my strong support as \nan original cosponsor of The College Pathway Act, introduced by my \ncolleagues from Connecticut and Maine, Senators Lieberman and Snowe. I \ngreatly appreciate their foresight in creating legislation that will \nhelp Hawaii and other states bring greater links between education at \nall levels, as well as with business and industry.\n  I know the field of education well, having served as a teacher, vice \nprincipal, principal, and school administrator in Hawaii before holding \npublic office. I taught at the elementary, middle, and secondary \nlevels, and continue to hold great interest in developments in these \nareas, as well as in early childhood and higher education. From these \nexperiences, I have advocated that education should be an \ninterconnected pathway, from pre-kindergarten through postsecondary \nlevels and beyond, into the workforce.\n  We need all stakeholders in education and the labor force to work \ntogether, seamlessly. The Lieberman-Snowe bill will help to further \nthis very aim in Hawaii and other States with existing entities, and to \nassist other States in meeting similar, meaningful goals through the \ncreation of similar entities. By encouraging States to establish P-16, \nor as in Hawaii's case, P-20 commissions, to align lower, middle, and \nhigh school curricular and assessment standards with what is expected \nin higher education, we will better assure college readiness and reach \na fundamental goal: greater rates of college completion.\n  To describe the Hawaii P-20 initiative in more detail, the initiative \nbrings together public and private educators at all levels, working in \ncollaboration with representatives of state government, the business \ncommunity, labor, and educational support agencies to focus on \nimproving learner achievement. Its vision statement says, all Hawaii \nresidents will be educated, caring, self-sufficient, and able to \ncontribute to their families, to the economy, and to the common good, \nand will be encouraged to continue learning throughout their lives.\n  The initiative, which recently unveiled its strategic plan, is a \njoint commitment of the Hawaii Department of Education, the Good \nBeginnings Alliance, and the University of Hawaii, working with a \nstatewide P-20 Council to develop a seamless system of educational \ndelivery. I encourage anyone with interest in this effort to view \nthe details of the plan at www.p20hawaii.org. A main goal of the \ninitiative is to prepare my State's learners to succeed in a society \nfast becoming more global, technological and complex. Ultimately, it \nseeks to improve the quality of life for all of Hawaii.\n  I am pleased to support this effort and work toward providing this \nand similar programs in other states with the resources to achieve \ntheir aims. The Lieberman-Snowe bill does this, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues toward its enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Coleman, and Mr. Isakson):\n  S. 2340. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \npreserve access to community cancer care by Medicare beneficiaries; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce the Community Cancer Care Preservation Act, which will ensure \nMedicare beneficiaries' access to community-based cancer treatment and \nprovide Medicare reimbursement assistance for oncologists providing \nvital cancer care services.\n  Cancer takes a great toll on our friends, families, and our Nation. \nIn the United States, cancer causes one out of every four deaths and \nwas responsible for 570,000 deaths last year. In 2005, over 2 million \nnew cases of cancer were diagnosed, the most prevalent of which were \nbreast, prostate, lung, and colorectal.\n  While these statistics are daunting, the rate of cancer deaths in the \nUnited States has decreased since 1993. This decrease is the result of \nearlier detection and diagnosis, more effective and targeted cancer \ntherapies, and greater accessibility to quality care provided by \noncologists. These vital services have allowed millions of individuals \nto lead healthy and productive lives after successfully battling \ncancer.\n  In 2004, 42.7 million individuals were enrolled in Medicare; of those \nbeneficiaries over 29 percent have had cancer during their lives, 12.5 \nmillion beneficiaries. With such a large percentage of our seniors \nfacing this horrible disease, the need for access to community cancer \ncare is critical.\n  Community cancer clinics treat 84 percent of Americans with cancer. \nCommunity cancer centers are free-standing outpatient facilities that \nprovide comprehensive cancer care in the physician's office setting \nlocated in patients' communities. These clinics are especially critical \nin rural areas where access to larger cancer clinics is not available. \nThey provide patients with earlier diagnosis, more effective cancer \ntherapies, and innovative supportive care that reduces fatigue, nausea/\nvomiting, and pain. The accessibility of treatment in the hands of \nskilled community oncologists has decreased the cancer mortality rate.\n  On December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and \nModernization Act was signed into law by President Bush. This \nlegislation contained numerous provisions that were beneficial to \nAmerica's seniors and medical facilities; however, it also provided a \nreduction to Medicare's reimbursement for oncology treatment. The \nprovisions sought to bring a balance to the reimbursement for the cost \nof cancer drugs and services. Previous to the implementation of the \nlaw, CMS reimbursed the cost of cancer treatment drugs at a very high \nlevel. This level provided sufficient funding to supplement the costs \nof care, storage of the prescription drugs, and the costs of cancer \ncare services, which were not being provided adequate funding. The law \nenacted reimbursement reductions for the cost of prescription drugs \nwhile increasing the funding provided for cancer care services; \nhowever, that increase did not sufficiently offset oncologists' losses \nfrom the reduction in cancer drug reimbursement.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that Medicare \nreimbursements to oncologists would be reduced by \n$4.2 billion from 2004-2013. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that \nreductions will reach $15.7 billion over that time. This increased \nreduction will have a debilitating effect on oncologists' ability to \nprovide cancer treatment to Medicare beneficiaries, especially those in \nthe community setting.\n  For 2006, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) \nestimates that the beneficiary reimbursement for services provided by \ncommunity cancer care will be cut by 6.6 percent, a $200 to $300 \nmillion reduction. However, this reimbursement reduction may be larger \nthan estimated. CMS did not factor in the delay in drug manufacturer \nprice increases for cancer therapies and the bad debt of beneficiaries \nwho may not pay their Medicare 20 percent co-insurance payment. When \naccounting for these reductions, the overall cut to cancer care will \nlikely exceed $300 million.\n  The Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act mandated a \ntransitional increase of 32 percent in service fees in 2004, falling to \n3 percent in 2005, and 0 percent in 2006. This was done to provide time \nfor CMS to pay for essential unpaid medical services, such as pharmacy \nfacilities and treatment planning. In 2005, CMS created a cancer care \ndemonstration project as a quality enhancement initiative to examine \nthe effects of oncology drugs on patients. This demonstration project \nalso provided $300 million in critical funding because CMS had not \nincreased the reimbursement for essential unpaid medical services. On \nJune 29, 2005, I sent a letter with 38 other Senators to President Bush \nrequesting an extension to the demonstration project through 2006. CMS, \nhowever, announced a new oncology demonstration project for 2006 that \nexamines the quality of cancer care in relation to treatment \nguidelines, but at $180-$210 million less than the previous funding \nlevel.\n\n[[Page S1548]]\n\n  Accordingly, I am introducing legislation to provide community \noncologists with the tools to withstand the CMS reforms brought forth \nunder the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act. The bill's \n$1.7 billion price tag, over the next 5 years, is a relatively small \ncost in the face of the vast reductions in CMS's reimbursement to \noncologists. Let me briefly summarize the provisions of this \nlegislation.\n  1. Sales Price Updates: Currently, CMS updates the prices for cancer \ntreatment drugs quarterly. This delay in price updating forces \ncommunity cancer clinics to often pay increased prices for prescription \ndrugs for up to six months without increased reimbursement. This \nlegislation requires the sales price for oncology drug reimbursement be \nupdated as changes occur in the price to provide a more accurate \nreimbursement to oncologists for the cost of drugs. This will provide a \nreimbursement to oncologists that is fair and reflective of market \ncosts.\n  2. Removal of the Prompt Pay Discount: The prompt pay discount is a \ndiscount from the wholesaler to the physician for prompt payment on \nprescription drugs. This is a benefit for physicians that operate an \nefficient and organized practice and allows them to gain extra revenue \nas an incentive for conducting business in that manner. The current \naverage sales price for prescription drugs from CMS takes into account \nthe prompt pay discount provided by wholesalers. The inclusion of these \nfunds, which are not guaranteed unless the practice operates in a very \nefficient way, decreases the amount of reimbursement from CMS. My \nlegislation would remove the discount from the CMS average sales price \nrequiring CMS to reimburse oncologists at the price they pay for drugs \nwithout the inclusion of discounts.\n  3. Quality Care Demonstration Project Extension: The quality care \ndemonstration project provided information to CMS that was gathered by \noncologists about the effects of oncology drugs on patients. This \nproject was altered and funds were reduced provided to conduct the \ninformational interviews to oncologists. The bill would extend the 2005 \nquality cancer care demonstration project through 2006. The project \ncollects information from cancer patients on the effects of cancer \ntreatment including fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and the treatment of \nthese symptoms.\n  4. Increase in Payments for Oncological Drug Storage: The CMS \nreimbursement for oncology prescription drugs does not provide adequate \nfunding for storage and care needs. The prescription drugs for cancer \ncare often require special provisions including refrigeration and \nhandling as some drugs that are highly toxic. These special provisions \nresult in an increased cost, which is why my legislation provides a two \npercent increase in payments to account for the storage and care of \noncology drugs.\n  5. Reports Regarding Cancer Care: The legislation would also require \na report from the Secretary of Health and Human Services on a plan to \nincrease the number of cancer patients in clinical trails and a \nCongressional Budget Office Report on the effects of the Medicare \nPrescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 on cancer \ncare. These reports will assist Congress and the Administration in its \nfuture decisions impacting cancer care.\n  As Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \n(LHHS) Appropriations Subcommittee, I have sought to increase funding \nfor the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Cancer \nInstitute (NCI). Since becoming Chairman of the LHHS Subcommittee, the \nfunding for NIH has increased from $11.3 billion in fiscal year 1996 to \n$29.4 billion in 2006, an increase of 147 percent, while funding for \nthe NCI increased from $2.3 billion in fiscal year 1996 to $4.9 billion \nin 2006, an increase of 113 percent.\n  On February 16, 2005, I was diagnosed with stage IVB Hodgkin's \nlymphoma and had my first chemotherapy treatment two days later. I had \na total of 12 treatments, my last on July 22, 2005, and tests following \nthat final treatment concluded that I am cancer free. As a recipient of \ncancer treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma cancer, I have an acute \nunderstanding of the problems that confront patients as well as \nphysicians that administer their care.\n  This legislation provides Medicare reimbursement assistance for \ncommunity oncologists and ensures Medicare beneficiaries' access to \ncommunity-based cancer treatment. I encourage my colleagues to work \nwith Senators Coleman, Isakson and me to move this legislation forward \npromptly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN:\n  S. 2341. A bill to prohibit the merger, acquisition, or takeover of \nPeninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company by Dubai Ports World; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Commerce Committee is having a hearing \nthis afternoon--and I have been at a portion of that hearing--dealing \nwith the question of Dubai Ports World, which is a company largely \nowned by the United Arab Emirates. This is a company that has been \ngiven the green light by this administration to manage six of America's \nlargest seaports.\n  This has caused a substantial amount of controversy and discussion. \nIn the last couple of days some of that controversy has been resolved, \nat least in the minds of some, because the company owned by the United \nArab Emirates has asked the administration for a 45-day review of the \ncircumstances of this deal, and they will not take control of the \nmanagement of the American ports for these 45 days.\n  It is rather unusual for a company to be asking that the United \nStates Government do a 45-day review of the circumstances of whether a \nUnited Arab Emirates company should be managing America's ports. \nSpeaking for myself, I don't need 45 days to understand this. I don't \nneed 45 minutes to understand it. I know a bad idea when I see one.\n  The President has made up his mind. President Bush has said he will \nveto any legislation that is offered here in the Congress that would \nupset this deal which would allow the company owned by the United Arab \nEmirates to manage America's ports. If the President feels he should \nveto a piece of legislation, that is his right. He has not vetoed any \nbill since he became President of the United States, but if his \nproposition is he wants to veto a piece of legislation and turn over \nAmerica's seaports, six of America's large seaports, to management by \nthe United Arab Emirates, so be it. But I think the President would be \nmaking a very serious mistake.\n  Our country is under a terrorist threat. We get regular briefings on \nthat in the Senate, and the American people know that from watching the \nnews. We understand the terrorist threats take the form of threat to \nair travel because the terrorists, as we know, last used commercial jet \nairplanes to fly into the World Trade Center towers in New York City. \nWe understand the threats at our airports. That is why when you go to \nthe airport and try to board a plane they have you take off your belt, \ntake off your shoes, and run you through a metal detector. There is \ngreat concern about the threat of terrorism and security at our \nairports.\n  There is also great concern about security at our seaports.\n  I have spoken, I am guessing, about a dozen times on the floor of \nthis Senate about the security at our seaports since the time of the 9/\n11 attacks.\n  I recall shortly after 9/11 when a fellow from a Middle East country \ndecided to ship himself in a container on a container ship. He got \ninside a container, and he got loaded on a container ship. Here was \nthis man with a container. He had a cot to sleep on, he had a GPS \ndevice, a radio, a supply of water, and he was shipping himself, I \nbelieve, to Canada, and there was concern that he was a terrorist and \nhe was going to enter the country by shipping himself in a container on \na container ship.\n  I have spoken here, I suppose, almost a dozen times talking about the \ndanger of having anywhere from 5.7 to 5.9 million containers coming \ninto this country every year, millions of containers on a container \nship coming into this country every year, and somewhere around 4 \npercent of them and perhaps as much as 5 percent are inspected; the \nrest are not.\n  I went to a port facility once. We don't have ports in North Dakota. \nBut I went to a port facility to visit and see what the security was. \nThey were showing me a container they had taken off a ship. The \ncontainer they opened\n\n[[Page S1549]]\n\nhappened to be frozen broccoli from Poland, bags and bags and bags of \nfrozen broccoli. I said, How do you know what is in the middle of this \ncontainer? I see there are bags of frozen broccoli. How do you know \nthat is all that is here in the container? Well, we don't know. That is \nwhy we are inspecting this particular container. How many containers do \nyou inspect? We know the answer to that. Out of every 100, 96 are not \ninspected.\n  That is a threat to our country's seaports.\n  What about a terrorist organization deciding they want to try to \nsteal a nuclear weapon someplace? After all, there are tens of \nthousands of them--somewhere, we believe, between 20,000 and 30,000 \nnuclear weapons that exist in this world. Steal a nuclear weapon and \nput it in a container, on a container ship and run it up to a dock, \nappear at one of America's major cities. What about the prospect of \nthat happening? Then we would not see 3,000 deaths. No, we would see \n100,000 deaths or more.\n  Seaport security is a very serious issue.\n  Now, in the midst of all of these issues of national security, we \nhear that something called CFIUS--the Committee on Foreign Investments \nin the United States, composed of some 12 Federal agencies coming \ntogether as a committee, evaluating foreign investment in the United \nStates--decided it is all right if this company called Dubai Ports \nWorld, a company owned by the United Arab Emirates, is allowed to \nmanage six of America's largest ports, including ports in New York, New \nJersey, Miami, Louisiana, and Maryland.\n  That is not all right with me.\n  I just came from a committee hearing where we had some people say, \nWell, you are going to offend somebody here. The United Arab Emirates \nis a country that has been very helpful to us in the fight on \nterrorism. The last thing we want to do is offend them.\n  What about offending common sense? Should we be offending common \nsense here in the Senate? I don't think so. Common sense would say to \nus when threatened by terrorist threats, security in this country ought \nto be security provided by the United States. We can't provide for our \nown security in our management of U.S. ports?\n  The United Arab Emirates is probably a perfectly wonderful country. \nIt is not a democracy, I will tell you. And two of the hijackers on 9/\n11/2001 were UAE citizens. And the United Arab Emirates was only one of \nthree countries that recognized the Taliban Government which played \nhost to Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.\n  Let me read something from the 9/11 Commission report. On page 137:\n\n       Early in 1999, the CIA received a recording that Osama bin \n     Laden was spending much of his time at one of several camps \n     in the Afghanistan desert south of Kandahar. At the beginning \n     of February, bin Laden was reportedly located at the vicinity \n     of Sheik Ali Camp, a desert hunting camp being used by \n     visitors from a Gulf State. Public sources have stated that \n     those terrorists were from the United Arab Emirates.\n\n  I will not read all of this.\n  According to the reports, the military was doing targeting work to \nhit the camp where Osama bin Laden was thought to be, to hit it with \ncruise missiles. But no strike was launched. And Mr. bin Laden \napparently soon moved on and the immediate strike plans became moot.\n  According to the CIA and defense officials, the reason the strike was \nnot launched against bin Laden was that policymakers were concerned \nabout the danger that a strike would kill a prince from the United Arab \nEmirates who was visiting with bin Laden.\n  The 9-11 Commission report also talks about an official airplane for \nthe United Arab Emirates at a landing strip there. They believed the \nUAE officials were visiting with Mr. bin Laden. So apparently, any \nopportunity for this country to target Mr. bin Laden before 9/11 was in \npart fouled by the relationship between at least some in the Royal \nFamily of the United Arab Emirates and Mr. bin Laden.\n  One of our Cabinet officers said, Well, this issue is not just about \nnational security, but also about trade and about commerce.\n  Look, trade and commerce do not ever trump national security. If \nthere are national security issues, then they have to be dealt with and \nhave to be recognized.\n  We are told, Well, everyone signed off on this; there is not a \nproblem here. But now we find out today that not everybody did sign off \non this. Yesterday we found out that the Coast Guard expressed \nreservations about the deal in a secret report, which had already been \nmade public. The report said:\n\n       There are many intelligence gaps concerning the potential \n     for DPW or PNO assets to support terrorist operations. That \n     precludes an overall threat assessment of the potential DPW \n     and PNO ports merger.\n\n  So don't tell me that the Coast Guard signed off on this. They raised \nquestions about it, as they should have.\n  I have a GAO report that I showed a few moments ago in the Commerce \nCommittee. This is the title of the July 2005 GAO report: ``The DOD \nCannot Ensure its Oversight of Contractors Under Foreign Influence is \nSufficient.''\n\n  If the Department of Defense cannot ensure proper oversight of \nforeign contractors, the Department of Homeland Security can? I don't \nthink so. The Department of Homeland Security, after all, responded to \nHurricane Katrina. Look at the mess they made with that. Now they are \nsaying, even though the Department of Defense cannot ensure oversight \nof foreign contractors, Homeland Security is going to be able to do \nthat with respect to the security of our ports? I don't think so.\n  So national security is an issue. And saying so is not a slap in the \nface at any country. It is just recognizing the obvious.\n  Something else that has not been talked about should be talked about. \nWe have moved at a full gallop toward globalization. We are in a global \neconomy, we are told. Well, the fact that we are in a global economy \nshould not persuade us not to think. One of the questions ought to be \nraised by all is--aside from the national security interests, which are \nsignificant interests--one of the other questions is, why would our \ncountry not have the capability to provide its own port management, its \nown port security?\n  There are certain things we do that we know we must do. Again, go to \nthe airport and see what they tell you about your shoes and belt and \nsee a little 6-year-old boy spread-eagle against the wall being \n``wanded'' and ask yourself: Why is that happening? Because we have \ndecided there is a security threat at airports. Terrorists use a \ncommercial airliner as a guided missile to destroy buildings in our \ncountry and to murder Americans. So we have issues of national security \nto respond to a threat with airport screening.\n  What about our seaports? Does anyone think there is any less danger \nwith somewhere around 5.7 to 5.9 million containers coming into our \ncountry, with 96 percent of them not having been screened? Does anyone \nthink there is less danger to America to have just one of those \ncontainers be pulled up slowly at an American pier or port or dock that \nhas a weapon of mass destruction?\n  We are spending billions and billions of dollars building an \nantiballistic missile defense system that does not work, regrettably. \nWe have spent billions of dollars and are spending billions more trying \nto hit a bullet with a bullet because we are concerned that a rogue \nnation or a terrorist will get hold of a ballistic missile, put on its \ntip a nuclear weapon, and send it to us somewhere around 15,000 miles \nper hour. By far, the more significant threat is for a ship to pull up \nat one of our docks at about 5 miles per hour, leaded with containers, \nmost of which have never been inspected, containing in one circumstance \na weapon of mass destruction. That is by far a more significant threat \nto our country.\n  I have spoken, I suppose, a dozen times over the years since 2001 \nabout port security. Not because we have any ports in North Dakota, \nbecause we do not. But it is obvious to me that if you are going to \nbegin to provide security for this country, we do not just do it by \nmetal detectors at airports; we do it at seaports and rail security, as \nwell. And with respect to seaports, it seems completely illogical to me \nfrom a national security standpoint that we would decide to turn over \nto foreign countries the management of our ports, our seaports.\n  People have said today: Are you kidding? This is done all the time, \nfor God's sake. Get a life. This is going on\n\n[[Page S1550]]\n\neverywhere. You do not understand the global economy. We have had other \ncountries managing our seaports.\n  This has become an issue that most American people recognize is a \nproblem. But a number of Members in the Congress do not recognize it as \na problem. Some do. But I heard opening statements at a committee \nhearing suggesting this debate is about racial profiling, it is about \noffending a good neighbor. Well, that is all nonsense. This is about \ndemanding at least some level of common sense be used in establishing \npublic policy.\n  The President says: We did the right thing. I have already made up my \nmind, he says, and we approved it. And I will veto anything that would \noverturn that approval.\n  Then he says, when asked by the company that is owned by the United \nArab Emirates to review it for 45 more days, the President says: Yes, \nwe will review it for 45 more days. But, again, he put out a statement \ntoday saying: I've already made up my mind.\n  At a committee hearing this afternoon, others on the committee said: \nWell, some of you have already made up your mind. Shame on you.\n  As I said, it would not take me 45 days to figure it out. It does not \ntake 45 minutes to figure it out. We ought to, as a country, be able to \nfind ways to manage our seaports. And we ought to, as a country, take \nresponsibility for our own national security. After all, it is not \nevery country in the world where you pin a little pin on the map that \nsays: Here's target one, here's the bull's eye of the target for \nterrorists. They want to attack this country. This is where they want \nto attack. We understand that.\n  All of us feel fortunate we have not been attacked again since 2001. \nBut we all know, as well, that there is much yet to do. Seaport \nsecurity is one of those areas in which we have to do much better.\n  My colleague who sat behind me some years, Senator Fritz Hollings \nfrom South Carolina, would come to the Senate and speak at great length \nabout this. He would offer funding for more seaport security. It was \nroutinely turned down. All of us offered this and were routinely turned \ndown. We did not have the money. And we are inspecting 4 to 5 percent.\n  Someday, God forbid, if something happens at a seaport, we will all \nstand and scratch our heads and say: Why didn't we try to find a way to \ndo this better, more inspections? Why didn't we understand that is more \nvulnerable even than airport security? Why didn't we figure that out?\n  This is an opportunity. I understand this will be controversial. I \nunderstand the President is going to be upset if the Congress takes \naction.\n  I will offer legislation today that is very simple. It does not \ntiptoe around 45 days and all these things. It just says this should \nnot happen.\n  If that offends someone, I am sorry. But I do not want to offend \ncommon sense. And it seems to me, in this country there is a deep \nreservoir of common sense at the local cafe or down at the hardware \nstore to say it would make the most sense, given the fact we are \ntargeted by terrorists, it would make the most sense for our country to \ntake responsibility for itself. This is not about globalism. It is not \nabout the global economy. It is not about offending someone. It is \nabout deciding as a country to assume responsibility for your security.\n  Let me make one other point. Yes, we need friends. Yes, we need the \nUnited Arab Emirates to be our friend and other countries as well to \ncooperate with us. But wouldn't it have been nice, for example, if we \nhad more cooperation when Dr. Kahn in Pakistan was arranging to have \nnuclear materials and nuclear plans and nuclear parts sent around to \nNorth Korea and to Iran and to other countries? Our children will pay \nfor that, unfortunately. And most of that material went through the \nUnited Arab Emirates' ports.\n  Wouldn't it have been nice if we had more friends? We need more \nfriends. But, it seems to me, we ought not buy friendship by deciding \nthat we will put a company controlled by the United Arab Emirates in \nthe position of managing America's ports. Once again, this is merely \ncommon sense.\n  The GAO report of last summer ought to be instructive to us. If the \nDepartment of Defense cannot ensure its oversight of contractors under \nforeign influence, how on Earth can Homeland Security ensure oversight \nof a contractor that is owned by a foreign government in the Middle \nEast? How on Earth can we expect that to happen?\n  I come to the Senate to talk a lot about trade. In this age of \nglobalism people say: You are just a xenophobic isolationist stooge who \ndoes not get it. The world has changed. It is a global world. Everyone \ndoes everything everywhere.\n  It seems to me it is not inappropriate even in a global economy to \npursue our own interests from time to time, and that is especially true \nwhen it deals with the subject of terrorism. Does the global economy \nmean that you outsource or offshore everything? Is there anything you \ncannot do without?\n  Some 15 years ago, I used to question Carla Hills, the trade \nambassador, at various hearings. Managed trade was anathema to her, and \nit has been to virtually every administration. Yet virtually every \ncountry we do trade with has managed trade. They have managed trade \nwith a set of objectives. I used to continually ask Carla Hill: Is \nthere anything the loss of which would give you problems?\n  For example, if, in a completely open system of trade we lost our \nentire steel industry--it was gone, no steel mill and no steel produced \ndomestically--would that give you a problem? The answer was, no, \nwhatever happens, happens. That is nonsense. There are certain things \nthat a country must hang on to to remain a strong economic power, a \nworld economic power.\n  Maybe this, also, in addition to the national security issues--which \nI think are very important--maybe it is also an opportunity to wake up \nand answer the question: What is appropriate in a global economy?

Mr. President, today I am submitting a concurrent \nresolution establishing an independent Congressional Inspector General \nto investigate ethics violations in the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Every Member of Congress must be held to the highest ethical \nstandards. Those who violate the public trust must be held accountable \nfor their actions. Unfortunately, our current system does not measure \nup. Too often, Congress has been unable or unwilling to effectively \ninvestigate or appropriately punish those Members who commit serious \nethical violations.\n  In December 2005, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed that just \nfive percent of Americans believe all Members of Congress are honest \nand trustworthy. The same poll showed that most Americans believe that \nmost Members of Congress are dishonest and are not trustworthy.\n  This is simply unacceptable. We have to restore the faith of the \nAmerican people in the Congress. Thus, I am submitting a resolution to \nestablish an independent Congressional Inspector General with the \nauthority to investigate and punish violations of the ethics rules by \nMembers of Congress, Congressional staff and the Capitol Police.\n  The Congressional Inspector General will make a preliminary \ninvestigation into all ethical misconduct allegations to determine \nwhether there is probable cause that a full investigation is warranted. \nThe Congressional Inspector General has expansive authority to \ninvestigate ethics allegations, including improper conduct that may \nreflect upon the Senate or House of Representatives, significant \nviolations of law, violations of the Senate Code of Official Conduct or \nthe ethics rules of the House of Representatives, and violations of \nCongressional rules or regulations relating to the conduct of Members \nin their performance of official duties. If a full investigation is \nwarranted, a public report will be developed for the House and Senate \nEthics Committees or the Justice Department describing any credible \nevidence of improper conduct or a violation of law.\n  To insure that this new ethics process is not abused, anyone who \nknowingly files a false ethics complaint will be subject to a $10,000 \nfine or the costs incurred by the investigation, whichever is greater. \nThey could also be subject to up to one year in prison and will be \nbanned from making further complaints.\n  The Congressional Inspector General will not be able to accept new \ncharges filed 30 days prior to a primary election for which the Member \nof Congress in question is a candidate or 60 days prior to a general \nelection for which the Member of Congress is a candidate.\n  The Congressional Inspector General will also provide periodic \nreports to Congress on how to update our ethics laws and how to improve \nthe investigation and enforcement of current ethics laws. Finally, it \nwould release an annual report of violations by Members of Congress and \nCongressional staff.\n  I also strongly support other legislation to develop independent \noversight of the Congressional ethics process including the \nCongressional Ethics Enforcement Commission Act of 2006 that was \nintroduced by Senator Obama earlier this year. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to develop ethics reform legislation in the \nupcoming months.\n  We need to change the way business is done in Washington. We must \nconvince the American people that our government responds to the needs \nof our people, not to special interests. This resolution will help \nrestore the faith of the American people in their government. Together \nwe can work to change our government for the better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/28/senate-section/article/S1552-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n                      COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. McCain.
