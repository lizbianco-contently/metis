Mr. President, as the senior Democratic woman of the \nSenate, I rise to tell my colleagues today that we, the Democratic \nwomen of the Senate, want to take the floor together and unanimously \nstand up for Social\n\n[[Page S910]]\n\nSecurity. We want to stand up for American families, stand up for \nAmerican children, and stand up against the dismemberment of Social \nSecurity. This morning my colleagues will see all of us taking the \nfloor to speak with passion, to speak with fortitude, to say that no \nmatter what happens in the legislative days ahead, the outcome will be \nthat Social Security will always be a guaranteed benefit and not a \nguaranteed gamble.\n  When one gets old and they are sick, there are not many things they \ncan count on but they should be able to count on Social Security. Our \nseniors' retirement should never rely on the bull of political promises \nor the bear of the market.\n  We women are at risk, and that is why we want a guaranteed benefit, \nnot a guaranteed gamble. We, the women, know the odds. We know that \nSocial Security cannot be slot machine Social Security, that when one \npulls the lever they get a lemon instead of three gold bars.\n  All of our lives we have been placed in the penalty box just because \nof who we are. We earn less money than men, and we often work at jobs \nless likely to have a pension. We are in and out of the marketplace \nbecause of family responsibilities. We live longer, and the \nconsequences are when we retire we get less. Social Security is a great \nequalizer and we want to be out of the penalty box and be in a \nguaranteed benefit box.\n  Right now, even in the debate we are already getting ready to face \ndiscrimination. Chairman Thomas of the Ways and Means Committee said \nbecause women live longer, maybe our benefits should be reduced. That \nis outrageous. I thought we were all created equal under the \nConstitution, and we should all be treated equal under Social Security.\n  I am taking a position, along with my women Democratic colleagues, \nthat we will not support a plan that does not provide a guaranteed, \ninflation-proof, lifelong benefit.\n  We, the Democratic women of the Senate, have certain criteria as this \ndebate goes forward: Preserve Social Security's guaranteed lifetime \ninflation benefit; preserve Social Security for workers when they are \ndisabled and for workers' spouses and children when they are disabled; \nand protect against the impoverishment of women by maintaining Social \nSecurity's benefit structure. Social Security provides a minimum floor \nagainst dire circumstances and that is part of the social insurance.\n  When we talk about a guaranteed benefit, not a guaranteed gamble, it \nis very clear why. Today we know our benefits are benefits we can count \non. We do not have to worry about whether the stock market doing well. \nWe do not have to worry about did we make investments, do we know bonds \nand stocks and indexes? What we do know is this is the guaranteed \nbenefit. All other private savings, private pensions, are built around \nit. Social Security is the anchor tenet. Let us not eliminate it.\n  When we talk about why we need a lifetime benefit, I am concerned \nabout the gimmicks and proposals that are being made now that people \ncould outlive their savings. The great thing about Social Security is \none cannot outlive Social Security. It is theirs until the day they \ndie. One can outlive their IRA or their savings, but they can never \noutlive Social Security. This is an important anchor, particularly \nbecause we women live longer.\n  The plan must be inflation proof. Today, Social Security does not \npenalize for living longer. We women live longer and we need an \nadequate cost-of-living increase. When one retires in 2030, they cannot \nhave an income that has been pegged at 1990. That is why it has to be \ninflation proof.\n  So we, the democratic women of the Senate, will not support any \nreform that takes us backward, instead of forward. We will use a \nchecklist we developed to ensure that bad things do not happen to women \nand families in the name of improvements to Social Security. To have \nour support, any changes to Social Security must be able to answer \nthese questions:\n  Does the plan preserve Social Security's guaranteed, lifetime, \ninflation-protected benefits?\n  Does the plan preserve Social Security's protections for workers when \nthey are disabled, as well as when they retire, and for workers' \nspouses and children when workers are disabled, retire, or die?\n  Does the plan protect against impoverishment of women by maintaining \nSocial Security's progressive benefit structure?\n  Does the plan strengthen the financing of the Social Security system \nwhile ensuring that women and other economically disadvantaged groups \nare protected to the greatest degree possible?\n  These principles are the promises of Social Security we will fight to \nprotect. We must keep the ``security'' in Social Security. It must be a \nguaranteed benefit, not a guaranteed gamble.\n  Now let me talk about why these principles are so important and why \nprivatization will specifically hurt women. This checklist is important \nbecause Social Security is the primary, or only, income for retired \nwomen, disabled workers and their families, working families in \nretirement who usually do not have access to a pension or other \nretirement and spouses of retired workers.\n  First, we need to preserve Social Security's, guaranteed, lifetime, \ninflation-proof benefits. The plan must be a guarantee. Today you know \nwhat your benefits are. You know what you can count on. It is \nguaranteed. We do not have to worry if the stock market is doing well. \nWe do not have to worry if we invested wisely. We do not have to worry \nif our husbands planned well. We do not have to worry if we suddenly \nbecome disabled that we will also suddenly be poor. The benefit is \nthere for us. It must be a guarantee. The plan must last for our whole \nlifetime.\n  People are terrified that they will outlive their savings. Any \nproposed plan must guarantee you cannot outlive your Social Security \nbenefit. You can outlive your IRA. You can outlive your savings. But we \nmust guarantee that you will never be able to outlive your Social \nSecurity. This is especially important for women. Women live longer \nthan men. But you must never, ever be able to outlive your Social \nSecurity. You must know what your benefit is. It must keep pace with \ninflation. The plan must be inflation-proof.\n  Today Social Security also does not penalize you for living longer. \nWomen live longer than men. Women need a plan with adequate cost-of-\nliving increases. $800 a month in 2005 will not buy the same things in \n2015.\n  Think about it: How does rent today compared to 10 years ago, and \nwhat will it be in 2005, 2025? We must have a guaranteed plan that \nprotects against inflation.\n  Second, we need to preserve Social Security's protections for workers \nwhen they are disabled as well as when they retire, and for workers' \nspouses and children when workers are disabled, retire, or die.\n  Social Security guarantees that if you suddenly become disabled you \nwill not also be suddenly poor. If a woman's husband dies, Social \nSecurity guarantees that there will be an income for her. If your \nspouse suddenly dies, Social Security guarantees that your children \nwill be provided for.\n  Three million children in this country receive Social Security \nbenefits because their parent was disabled or killed; 52,000 in my \nState of Maryland alone. We must be able to depend on these benefits. \nHonor your mother and father.\n  It is a great commandment to live by--and it is a great commandment \nto govern by not only as a commandment, but in the federal law books. \nMake sure it is in the federal checkbooks. Now, this is family values.\n  Third, we need to protect against impoverishment of women by \nmaintaining Social Security's progressive benefit structure.\n  Social Security rewards work and recognizes that all work has value. \nSomeone may work for minimum wage but make maximum effort. Social \nSecurity provides a minimum floor of protection to keep seniors out of \ndestitution. Social Security has a progressive benefit structure. That \nmeans it protects women who work part-time to be a full-time mom. It \nprotects stay-at-home moms who do not earn wages, though what they do \nis priceless. It protects women who work at minimum wage.\n  Social Security, with its progressive benefit structure, guarantees \nthere will be enough benefit to live on, even\n\n[[Page S911]]\n\nthough you may not have earned much while working. Though you may \nstruggle to make ends meet now, the program will make sure you receive \na benefit you can live on. Social Security makes sure you won't be \npoor.\n  Fourth, we need to strengthen the financing of the Social Security \nsystem while ensuring that women and other economically disadvantaged \ngroups are protected to the greatest degree possible.\n  For many elderly women, Social Security is not a supplement to their \nincome, it is their income. Compared to men, most women do not receive \nemployer-provided pensions. One-third of women must rely solely on what \nthey receive from Social Security. When you are old and when you are \nsick, there are not many things you can count on, but you should be \nable to count on Social Security.\n  Social Security is more than a safety net. It is a life boat. We need \nto make sure more senior women and all low-income workers get the \nbenefit of the safety net, and share the life boat. To the people of \nMaryland, I am on your side. For today and tomorrow, I am going to \nfight for you to have a benefit that you can count on. In my state, \n732,000 people receive Social Security benefits, including nearly \n400,000 women. They all need a guaranteed benefit, not a guaranteed \ngamble.\n  Without Social Security, almost half of elderly women in Maryland \nwould be poor. Honor your mother and father? We need to protect them \nand the whole family. We often forget how Social Security protects \nchildren. There are 52,000 children in Maryland who depend on Social \nSecurity. That means that something happened to one of their parents. \nThey either died or became disabled. We must keep our promise to \nprotect our children. We cannot gamble their future. Now this is a \nfamily value. What will privatization cost Americans?\n  Another big issue for our children is the debt that privatization \nwill create, not just for us, but our children, our grandchildren, and \ntheir children.\n  The transition to a private account system will cost trillions of \ndollars--yes, trillions of dollars--trillions of dollars that we will \nhave to borrow from another country.\n  This will cause higher interest rates for our mortgages, our credit \ncards, our cars, our student loans.\n  Privatization will squeeze our federal budget even tighter. It will \nlead to higher taxes on everyone, and cuts in the funding for essential \nFederal programs besides Social Security, such as Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  This will be bad for the economy, bad for family budgets, and bad for \nfuture generations. This is not the legacy we want to leave to our \nchildren and grandchildren. Why must we prevent privatization?\n  Now let me repeat why privatization is bad for America. Privatization \nwill replace the security of a guaranteed check for a guaranteed \ngamble. Privatization will eliminate the dependability and \npredictability of seniors income. Privatization will not be inflation \nprotected so year after year seniors incomes will go down. \nPrivatization will eliminate guaranteed survivor benefits for widows.\n  Our seniors would have to give all this up for the hope that every \nsingle one of them will successfully invest in the stock market. We \nknow how unpredictable and brutal the stock market can be. We cannot \nplace the security of our senior citizens in the private market. They \ndeserve better. They have been promised more. I am here to say we are \ngoing to live up to those promises.\n  We are not going to go back to a time when elderly poverty was \ncommonplace and accepted. We need to strengthen Social Security and \nimprove it. How? By not playing politics, by not being ideological, by \nworking together, by being bipartisan, and doing what is right for \nAmerica. I am prepared to do that. Democrats are prepared to do that.\n  We did it last time Social Security faced problems. I worked with \nPresident Reagan on Social Security. He created a climate of civility \nand respect. We all worked together, across the aisle stabilized the \nSocial Security program.\n  We need to make some changes in the Social Security program, but only \nmodest changes to strengthen the program, not gut it, not gambling with \nour seniors.\n  President Bush should follow the Reagan Social Security model, seek \nresponsible changes to Social Security, work with Democrats, do what is \nright for our seniors, and do what is right for America.\n  I will join him.\n  I know the Democrats will, too.\n  There are colleagues on the floor and I want to yield so they have \nthe time to talk. There are many more things on which I am going to \nelaborate, such as how this privatization will increase debt, how it \nwill cause rising interest rates, how this foolhardy plan is based on a \nmodel that we are taking from the Government of Chile. I respect the \npeople of Latin America, but their pension program has gone bust. This \nis not what the United States of America should be.\n  So when I cast my vote, I want to vote for the stability of a social \ncontract that has a guaranteed lifetime benefit. I will not vote for \nsomething that is a gamble and then puts us in the wheel of misfortune. \nI am deeply concerned that if we pursue some of the recommendations \nthat are being made, we will have lower benefits, we will have rising \ninterest rates, and we will have instability in both the market, in \npensions, and in Social Security.\n  What is the wheel of misfortune we could end up with? People could \nend up outliving their savings. They could end up disabled and broke. \nSocial Security could lead to poverty rather than a minimum floor. It \ncould be that there has been a market crash and people could never \nretire and while that is going on interest rates go sky high.\n  I remember a time in the late 1970s and early 1980s when one could \nnot get a mortgage for less than 15 percent. If one got a home equity \nloan at 10 percent, they thought they had died and gone to heaven. Car \ninsurance was at 22 percent. Credit cards were at 24 percent. We do not \nwant to ever go there.\n  I worked with Ronald Reagan to stabilize Social Security in 1983. I \nwant to work with George Bush in 2005. But I will vote for a guaranteed \nbenefit, not a guaranteed gamble. And I would never want to have Social \nSecurity just turn to the wheel of misfortune.\n  I note that my colleagues are in the Chamber, and I now yield 10 \nminutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am very proud to join the senior \nDemocratic Senator from Maryland, along with all of my Democratic women \ncolleagues, to declare that we are going to fight to make sure we have \na guaranteed benefit to keep the security in Social Security.\n  A few short years ago, just after the 1932 stock market crash and the \nonset of the Great Depression, one of our Nation's greatest leaders, \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt, set out to create a program to provide peace \nof mind and a sense of security to America's retirees. During his \ncrusade to create that program, FDR said there is no tragedy in growing \nold, but there is tragedy in growing old without means of support.\n  The program that he created to this day is the single greatest social \ninsurance program in our Nation's history. Social Security has been a \nresounding success by keeping millions of people out of poverty in this \ncountry. We are here today to remind this country that women in \nparticular benefit from the guaranteed benefit that is in Social \nSecurity, and we are going to fight to make sure it remains there for \nthe women who follow us.\n  Months before the new program was enacted, back in the early 1930s, \nFDR laid out his vision of how important this program was and how it \nshould be implemented. He said:\n\n       We can never ensure 100 percent of the population against \n     100 percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life. But we \n     have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of \n     protection to the average citizen, and to his family against \n     the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age. This \n     law, too, represents a cornerstone in a structure which is \n     being built, but is by no means complete . . . It is . . . a \n     law that will take care of human needs and at the same time \n     provides for the United States an economic structure of \n     vastly greater soundness.\n\n  Those were the words of FDR in 1935. But today, this cornerstone, \nthis basic American value, is now under attack.\n\n[[Page S912]]\n\nWe are here today to say we are fighting back. President Bush is \ncurrently traveling the country, saying Social Security is in crisis \nand needs to be radically restructured. I rise today to reaffirm the \nvalues and the spirit FDR laid out 70 years ago. Social Security has \npulled seniors from poverty and put millions of retirees' minds at \nease. America's insurance program is a guaranteed benefit all Americans \ncan count on. It is a promise that, if you work hard, you will have \nsome security when you retire or if you become disabled. It is a \npromise our seniors will not live in poverty. It is a promise if your \nspouse passes on, you will continue to have the support and the \nsecurity you need.\n  Of course, this program is more than just security. It is about \ncommunity. That is a value we as women share--community. In America, we \nbelieve it is important to take care of the generation that came \nbefore. It is important to guarantee them a quality of life. It is \nimportant that we guarantee benefits after a lifetime of hard work. I \nam concerned that President Bush's so-called restructuring will imperil \nthe security of all Americans, from young workers who are going to \nretire decades from now to seniors who are retiring today.\n  The problem with this plan is it is not a guaranteed benefit. It does \nnothing to fix the long-term issues this system does face. It adds \ntrillions of dollars to our national debt at a time we cannot do that \nany longer, and it is dangerous. We cannot and we will not let \nPresident Bush tear apart our Social Security system.\n  While some are trying to enrich Wall Street or push an ideology of \nmarket experience on our senior citizens, our priority in this \ndiscussion should be to ensure we are doing right by those who are \nrelying on Social Security, from current workers to retirees, from the \ndisabled to widows.\n  Current and future retirees need someone to stand up for them. If I \nsee something that is going to hurt our workers, our families, our \nseniors, and women in particular, I want the Senate to know I am going \nto fight, along with my women colleagues, with everything I have.\n  Any discussion about Social Security that we have has to meet \ncriteria if it means to be productive. You can call it a test. Any \nproposal we discuss must pass this test if it wants to move from this \nbody.\n  First of all, we have to ensure Social Security has a guaranteed \nbenefit. Second, we need to make sure Social Security protects workers \nwhen they become disabled. Next, we must protect against benefit \nreductions for women, minorities, and others. And we have to protect \nour budget from growing deficits. Anything short of this would be an \nunnecessary, dangerous gamble, as the Senator from Maryland has pointed \nout, unworthy of an important insurance program.\n\n  While we are at the beginning of this discussion in this body, my \nfemale colleagues in this body have worked for years to ensure some \nbasic principles to follow as we move forward. The promise of Social \nSecurity is especially important to women because women face unique \nchallenges in retirement. Women make less money than men throughout \ntheir lifetimes. Women leave the workforce to raise their families and \nstay home, something we should value in this country. Women live longer \nand women are more likely to suffer from chronic health conditions.\n  Even with those special challenges, today Social Security keeps \nmillions of older women out of poverty. Its benefit formulas are today \ntilted to give a greater rate of return for lower wage workers such as \nwomen and minorities. If the President succeeds in privatizing Social \nSecurity, he will destroy the guaranteed benefit that low-wage earners \nneed in their retirement years.\n  Social Security is not just a retirement program; it is also a \nprogram that protects disabled workers and protects their families. \nThat is a value we women want to make sure we protect. If Social \nSecurity is privatized, what happens to a worker who is disabled and \ncannot contribute to her account? Today, under Social Security that \nworker is protected. But there is no guarantee under the Bush plan. \nPresident Bush could undo the progressive structure that older women in \nthis country depend on today, and they should be able to depend on it \ntomorrow. This is one reform that could have disastrous results and we \nwill not stand for it.\n  Under this administration, many things we take for granted--from \novertime pay, to community police, to safe drinking water--have been \nthreatened. Now President Bush wants to dismantle Social Security. I am \nhere with the women, the Democratic women of the Senate, to say some \nthings are too important to American families. Providing real security \nto all Americans is a basic value worth protecting. We will make sure \nPresident Bush does not gamble that security and break the promise \nSocial Security keeps for millions of women and their families.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from Washington State for her \neloquent statement and her passion. I would now like to yield 10 \nminutes to the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator Mikulski for \ntaking the lead in organizing the Democratic women. We don't always \nagree on every issue, but here is one that has united us. I think what \nis interesting about the Democratic women is we are very different. We \nare very different ages. We range from the 40s to the 70s. We go from \nthe west coast to the east coast, and places in between--the north and \nthe south. When we can come together like this--knowing that some of us \nare progressive, some of us are more conservative--in a whole group and \nsay we are going to protect Social Security, we hope it sends a very \npowerful message to the people of this country, particularly the women \nof this country and to their families, that we are going to be there \nfor you. That is what this is all about.\n  Whose side are we on, anyway? I think in the battle over Social \nSecurity the sides are becoming very clear. You are either on the side \nof the families, of our people, young and older, or, frankly, if you \nfollow money you are on the side of Wall Street because Wall Street is \ngoing to get billions of dollars if George Bush is successful, and it \nwill come straight out of the pockets of working families.\n  I used to be a stockbroker so I have absolutely nothing against \nstockbrokers and I loved working on Wall Street. But I can tell you, \nand I am sure you know it is true, that markets go up and markets go \ndown. I have seen elation and I have seen devastation. One thing I \nnever saw was a sense of security that the stock market was going to be \nthere necessarily when you need it to be there.\n  This year is Social Security's 70th birthday. It has been enormously \nsuccessful. Before Social Security, over half of all seniors were poor. \nToday, 10 percent live in poverty. That is too much and we want to take \ncare of that. What we do not want to do is go back to the days when 50 \npercent were living in poverty. So we, the Democratic women, are going \nto use every tool at our disposal to make sure the people of this \ncountry do not wind up in poverty.\n  Certainly we know Social Security needs adjustments, as your own \nfamily budget needs adjustments. We did a major adjustment in 1983. I \nwas over in the House side. Senator Mikulski was over in the House \nside. With Ronald Reagan as President, we all got together, Democrats \nand Republicans alike, and we strengthened Social Security. Under Bill \nClinton, we made some efforts to strengthen it again. The fact is, we \nhave to strengthen Social Security, not destroy it. The fact is, Social \nSecurity is not a handout, it is a promise we make to working men and \nwomen in this country: You pay into the system, it is insurance, and it \nwill be there for you in your retirement years.\n  Basically, when the folks on Social Security look at me and say, Will \nyou fight for my Social Security? do you know what I tell them? You \nearned it, and of course I will make sure it is never taken away from \nyou.\n  Unfortunately, President Bush's solution is to dismantle Social \nSecurity. He can call it anything he wants. He can say he is not going \nto change it for those already on it. But what about\n\n[[Page S913]]\n\nthose who are not already on it? Don't they have a right to have this \ninsurance program, which has been there for so many years?\n  I will show you what the LA Times wrote. This is not a new issue for \nGeorge W. Bush. He has been at it for a long time:\n\n       Even as a young man, Bush was sympathetic to revamping the \n     program. When he ran for Congress in 1978 he argued that \n     the program would go broke by 1988 if people were not \n     given the ability to invest money themselves.\n\n  So here you have the candidate George Bush, way back in 1978, calling \nfor privatizing Social Security. He said it would go broke in 1988.\n  That is what he said. He was wrong then and he is wrong now. We have \nto call it the way we see it. He underestimated the bipartisan will of \nCongress and President Reagan to keep Social Security for current and \nfuture generations. Instead of seeking to follow the path of Ronald \nReagan, who was supposed to be one of his heroes, he is seeking a path \nthat was plotted over 20 years ago to destroy Social Security. In the \ncourse of this debate--not today, at other times--I will share with my \ncolleagues the roadmap that was laid down in the 1980s, a plan to \ndestroy Social Security. George Bush was right there in 1978.\n  So he is misleading the American people by calling Social Security a \ncrisis. According to the Social Security trustees, there is enough \nmoney to pay full benefits until 2042. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, there is enough money to pay full benefits until 2052. \nSo, yes, we need to make adjustments so we can keep this program \nsecure, but we do not have to destroy it.\n  While President Bush is traveling around the country on Air Force \nOne, telling people there is a crisis in Social Security--this is what \nis amazing--he is giving lip service to the real crises that are right \nhere, right now, under his own nose and on his own watch. What about \nthe crisis of the budget deficit? It is well over $400 billion, that \ndeficit. You want to talk about bankrupt? In my family, if you are \nspending that much more than you are taking in, you are bankrupt. Let's \ncall it what it is.\n  What about the crisis of the trade deficit, and the plummeting of the \ndollar? What about the crisis of the IOU that is given to our kids and \ngrandchildren the day they are born? As Senator Reid has said, there is \na birth tax on every child today--$36,000 worth of debt. We know the \nPresident is going to have to borrow trillions for his plan.\n  What about the crisis of 40 million Americans without health \ninsurance? What about the crisis of millions of Americans, including 10 \nmillion children, who live within 5 miles of a toxic waste dump that is \nwreaking havoc on their health? What about the crisis of being \nunprepared for a domestic terrorist attack because we have not invested \nenough in rail security, port security, chemical plant security, \naviation security, nuclear plant security? What about the crisis in \nafterschool programs, where hundreds of thousands of kids are left out \nbecause the President has frozen funding for 3 consecutive years?\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute, if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The President's solution to Social Security is to borrow, \nborrow, borrow, throwing us deeper into debt. I will tell you, this is \nnot going to happen under our watch.\n  I will show you one more chart very quickly.\n  The plan the President has talked about a lot results in benefit cuts \nof 45 percent. The average yearly payment for a widow would only be \n$5,700. Who can live on that? Certainly not those of us here or those \nin the White House. Widows would be 35-percent below the poverty line \nif the President's plan goes into effect.\n  We think Social Security Plus is a place we can start. Keep Social \nSecurity and strengthen it, as Ronald Reagan did. We can work together \nto do that for our young people. I think we can solve this problem and \nkeep one of the greatest programs ever known in the history of our \ncountry.\n  I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nher longstanding commitment in standing up for what is right in this \ncountry, for her eloquent statement on why we need to preserve Social \nSecurity, and for outlining what is the real crisis in our country.\n  We are going to continue our debate with the other Democratic women.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 34\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Michigan is in the \nChamber, a sister social worker, and actually a person who is licensed \nto be a do-gooder in our country. She is one who stood up for seniors \nand who spoke with such passion on the need for prescription drugs. I \nnow yield 10 minutes to her to speak on Social Security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank the dean of our women in the \nSenate, the woman who was first and blazed the way for all of us, the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland. I thank her so much for her \nleadership on this and other issues.\n  Our dean has said so many times, honor thy father and thy mother. \nThey are not just important words in the Bible, but they are important \nwords to live by. This debate about Social Security certainly reflects \nour values in honoring our fathers and our mothers. So I thank her for \nthat.\n  I rise with my colleagues to speak today about the greatest American \nsuccess story of our time, Social Security. Prior to Social Security, \n50 percent of our retirees lived in poverty. Today, it is 10 percent. \nIf that is not a great American success story, I don't know what is.\n  We are here unified to say that we want to keep that success story by \nkeeping the ``security'' in Social Security. That is what this is \nabout. We join in advocating for additional ways for people to save. I \nknow my 20-something-year-old children are tired of hearing from me \nabout the fact that they need to be putting dollars aside for the \nfuture and not just rely on Social Security.\n  There are ways we can come together. I was, frankly, disappointed \nlast evening that we did not hear more from the President about ways we \ncan come together to be able to develop those opportunities for \neveryone to create wealth and retirement security. But we don't do that \nby undermining the ``security'' of Social Security. Social Security \nrepresents the best of who we are, the best in American values. Our \nbelief is that if you work hard and you play by the rules, you earn \nretirement security. We pay into that, all of us together pay into this \ninsurance policy called Social Security. We deserve a basic quality of \nlife and dignity in older years. Everyone does. And that comes from a \njoint community effort called Social Security, into which we all pay.\n  I think it is also important to look at the fact that Social Security \nis not just about tomorrow. It is an insurance policy, whether you are \na 25-year-old like my daughter who is starting a career or you are a \n78-year-old like my mother, whom I can barely keep up with, and who is \nin her retirement years. The fact is, Social Security is there for both \nof them. Heaven forbid that something were to happen to one of my \nchildren and they become permanently disabled. But Social Security \nwould be there as a disability policy. When they have children, if \nsomething were to happen and they would no longer be able to care for \ntheir children, Social Security steps in as a life insurance policy.\n  Think about it. This great American success story is a retirement \npolicy, a life insurance policy, and a disability policy. We all do \nthis together. That is what the ``I'' in FICA means. It is an insurance \nsystem.\n  We want to build upon that just as Federal employees are able to \nbuild upon that with thrift savings, and there are others, such as \n401(k)s, and so on.\n  By the way, that is on top of Social Security--not in the place of \nSocial Security.\n  But we stand here today, particularly because we know this insurance \nplan is of particular importance to women in the country. In fact, 60 \npercent of all Social Security recipients are women;\n\n[[Page S914]]\n\n1 in 10 adult women receive Social Security disability benefits. As we \nget older, since we tend to live longer--I think once you get over age \n85, you in fact see that the vast majority of people on Social Security \nare women. This is a fundamental women's issue of economic security.\n\n  We stand here unified to say we will fight to keep the ``security'' \nin Social Security for every woman and their families.\n  In my home State of Michigan, many Social Security recipients, of \ncourse, are retired. We also have 64,000 people who receive benefits \neither as a widow or widower, a spouse or child of a retired worker or \ndisabled worker. Again, the majority of those are women and children.\n  We know that strengthening Social Security will require a lot of hard \nchoices. We stand ready to join with colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle and the President to do that. But first we have to get this \nnotion of privatizing Social Security and undermining it, unraveling \nit, off the table.\n  I suggest one approach for us to look at. This is something I feel \nvery strongly about because we make decisions every day on values and \npriorities. Just like all of us do, we open our checkbook and we pay \nthe bills and write checks. That reflects our values and priorities.\n  Right now, when we look at the overall Federal revenue in the budget, \nas I do as a member of the Budget Committee, we have to reflect and \nlook at what we are really saying about our values and priorities for \nthe future.\n  Consider the fact that keeping Social Security secure for 75 years \nrequires only one-third--about 33 percent--of the costs of the tax plan \nenacted by the Congress and President Bush for the wealthiest \nAmericans. Think about that.\n  In other words, if we were to ask those who are most blessed in this \ncountry through hard work, through inheritance, through other means, \nthose who are most blessed with retirement security, if we asked them \nto keep 70 percent of that instead of 100 percent--70 percent is huge. \nIt is billions of dollars in tax cuts. But if they kept only 70 percent \nof that over the next 75 years, you could keep the ``security'' of \nSocial Security for 75 years.\n  To me, that makes sense. If we are really about making decisions and \ninvestments for all Americans, it certainly makes sense. And it \ncertainly makes more sense than privatizing Social Security.\n  Here is why. Privatization will cut benefits by one-third to one-\nhalf, even for working women who choose not to risk their money in \nprivatized accounts.\n  This is important. We are not just talking about cutting benefits for \nthose who choose to privatize accounts but for those who do not choose \nto go this direction. The average retiree would lose more than $152,000 \nin benefits over the course of a 20-year retirement--$152,000 in \nbenefits over 20 years.\n  An insurance policy was never meant to be a high-risk investment. We \nencourage people, on top of Social Security, to make investments. But \nthis was meant to be the foundation for retirement.\n  I wonder where women would be without the ``security'' in Social \nSecurity today.\n\n  Beyond the deep benefit cuts and added risks, privatization would add \n$2 trillion in debt over 10 years. That is almost a 50-percent increase \nof the debt we have now, which is the largest in the history of the \ncountry. It is unbelievable. Unfortunately, much of that would be \nborrowed from countries such as China and Japan. That raises a whole \nrange of issues economically in terms of our national security.\n  I think most women would agree that we don't want to pass the debt on \nto our children and grandchildren, forcing them to bear the burden of \never more debt and higher taxes.\n  I stand here today with by colleagues to say we will fight to keep \nSocial Security secure, and then we will join in those efforts to both \nstrengthen Social Security in the long run but also to create other \nopportunities for people to be able to save, people to be able to \ncreate wealth, to be able to have retirement security. If we take \nprivatization off the table, which we know doesn't solve any of the \nproblems of Social Security--it only creates more risk and \nuncertainty--we can then work together to get something done.\n  That is what people expect us to do. That is what we are here today \nto pledge to do. The women in this country, every one of our daughters \nand our granddaughters, and our mothers and our aunts, and all of those \ngirls yet to come, as well as their brothers, deserve a secure \nretirement. They deserve that under Social Security. They earned that. \nThey pay into it, and they are counting on it.\n  We are going to stand ready to make sure Social Security remains \nsecure.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, there are other Democratic women who \nwish to speak. They are sprinting from the prayer breakfast. I notice \nthat the senior Senator from Arkansas is here, Mrs. Blanche Lincoln. I \nwill be yielding her time.\n  I want to note for those observing the proceedings that Senator \nLincoln is a member of the Finance Committee. She is the only \nDemocratic woman on the Finance Committee. We look to her to champion \nour position, and at the same time we recognize her longstanding \ncommitment to the people of Arkansas--especially those people who work \nin those rice mills, end up with a bad back, varicose veins, dirt under \ntheir fingernails--and their Social Security.\n  I yield 10 minutes for her to tell us about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President. I especially thank my \ncolleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, who has just been a \ntremendous mentor to me and so many others with her great leadership. I \nvery much appreciate all of the female Senators who are here to join \nwith us today--to join our voices and make sure that as we begin this \ndiscussion on Social Security, which is such a vital program for not \njust the elderly of our Nation but the disabled, as well as the \nsurvivors, that we do it with thoughtfulness, that we do it in \nreflection of the people we represent, not only their hardships but, \nmore importantly, the dedication they have given to raising the \nfamilies of this great Nation, and providing the kind of unconditional \nlove and support that makes up the fabric of this great country.\n  We are proud to be here on the floor of the Senate. I am proud to \nrise today to speak about the enduring commitment that the American \npeople have made to themselves and to future generations through the \nSocial Security Program.\n  We find oftentimes that people like to grumble and gripe about \ngovernment. And we know that government can at times be a little bit \nrusty, that it is sometimes awfully large. We find that it in many ways \nmay not be a one-size-fits-all, but there is one thing for sure, we \nknow what this country has done right. That is Social Security. It is a \nprogram that we can all be proud of and which has allowed us as a \nnation to espouse the values that are at the core of our being.\n  I have heard my colleague from Maryland say all the time, honor thy \nfather and thy mother.\n  Here we have designed a program in years past to allow us to espouse \nthose values that are so important to us; that is, to care not only for \nour seniors, our mothers, fathers, grandfathers, and grandmothers but \nalso those who might be less fortunate; those who are in dire need of \nus being able to wrap ourselves around them and provide them the kind \nof quality of life that we as Americans are proud of--the disabled, the \nsurvivors. This is one program we got right. Government got it right.\n\n  Has our Nation changed over the last 70 years? Absolutely. And we \nhave an opportunity in a very thoughtful way to look at how we can \nbuild upon this program to make sure it meets the demands of today and \ntomorrow.\n  Almost 70 years ago, the Social Security Act was signed into law. \nThis law did embody the will of the American people to make sure those \nwho are near and dear to us--the elderly, the sick, the widowed, the \norphaned--would not lapse into poverty or deprivation on our watch. \nThat is our charge again today. We are up to the job if we are willing \nto work together and remind ourselves what our purpose is.\n  We are now faced with long-term challenges to this very successful \nprogram in part because our Nation is\n\n[[Page S915]]\n\ngrowing older. Folks are living longer. My husband's precious \ngrandmother, who turned 107 last year, sat in front of me in church on \nSunday, a remarkable woman with an unbelievable quality of life. She \ndoes the crossword puzzle every morning, plays bridge 4 days a week, \nand I make sure she has a good balanced diet of fruits and vegetables. \nShe is remarkable. There are many more centenarians in this country \nliving healthy lives. They need assurance they will not have to live in \npoverty.\n  How we deal with these challenges will affect millions of Americans \nfor generations. It is not just those in the present day, the working \nindividuals of today and the children of today who will be the adults \nof tomorrow, but it is just as important to me as a young mother of \nsmall children that the elderly in my community--my mother, my mother-\nin-law and father-in-law--have the advantage of this program to provide \nthem the assistance they were promised.\n  I grew up in a small community within walking distance of both sets \nof my grandparents. It was easier for us then in those circumstances to \ngo over and care for them, to be able to be a part of their lives. Our \nworlds are not like that anymore. How many live far distances from our \nparents or our children? How difficult is it to care for them?\n  This is a program that ensures, whether you live next door or you \nlive 10 States away, that your parents, the elderly of that community, \nwill have what they need.\n  I am certainly proud, again, that it is not just the elderly we take \ncare of but the survivors as well as those who are disabled. A young \nwoman on my staff mentioned to me the other day her father died the \nyear she was born and she received those benefits, which was the vision \nof this Nation and its values, wrapping its arms around her mother and \nthose children to say: Your Nation will be there for you to help you \ncare for these precious children.\n  Today I will take a few moments to speak on behalf of the millions of \nwomen who never made much money during their working lives perhaps, who \nnow depend heavily on their Social Security benefits and could be \nespecially hurt by privatization.\n  In my home State of Arkansas, more than 272,000 women rely on Social \nSecurity benefits. Without Social Security, virtually two-thirds of the \nelderly women in Arkansas would be forced to live in poverty. Many of \nthose women use Social Security as their only source of income.\n  I can remember going to the store with my mother and being a bargain \nshopper. I find myself as a young mother doing the same thing. But it \nwould break my heart to think that my mother had to choose between \nfood, utilities, or pharmaceuticals. Many women find themselves in that \nposition even today. If we privatize Social Security, that will \nexplode. Many of these women do not have trust funds or stocks or bonds \nto rely on. Their money was spent in different ways. They did not have \na lot of expendable money to put into savings accounts. It was used to \nfeed their children, to place a roof over their heads, to educate them, \nto send them out into the world with hope for a brighter future. They \nspent their time, their money, their energy, and their soul in creating \nthe lifeblood of this Nation. They also may have spent down their \nresources to care for a spouse or perhaps a disabled child. These women \nwent to work, and they played by the rules. They baked cookies for the \nCub Scout meetings, they paid their taxes on time, they supported their \nhusbands, and they supported their families. And when they became \neligible to receive their benefits, Social Security was there for them.\n\n  I have heard the rhetoric that those who are close to or in \nretirement will still receive their full benefit under privatization. \nWhat we never hear, however, is that under privatization proposals, \nyounger workers will have their benefits cut significantly. When we \ntalk about privatization and allowing the diversion of payroll taxes \ninto private accounts, we have been told by the Congressional Budget \nOffice and actuaries that there is no way we can do that without \ncutting benefits, increasing taxes, or creating an enormous debt. We \nknow that when we borrow dollars and we create debt, we are increasing \ntaxes on someone. It will be the children down the road who have to pay \nthat debt.\n  We have to take seriously the consequences of the decisions we make \non this program. Each Member in this body knows our decisions are based \non our values and our priorities. But those decisions have real and \nsubstantive consequences, and we must remember that every stretch of \nthis debate and understand what those consequences could be. It is not \nacceptable to tell retired women that we will support you in your \ngolden years, but your daughter and your granddaughter are on their \nown. We will privatize this system, and we do not know what will \nhappen, so your daughters and granddaughters will be on their own.\n  Seventy years ago, the American people made a promise to protect \nfuture generations of Americans from poverty, and for 70 years the \nAmerican people have kept their word. We are going to do no less. That \npromise has allowed hundreds of thousands of low-income elderly women \nin Arkansas to live lives of dignity. That is what we are here to \nensure.\n  Many women in Arkansas who receive those Social Security benefits \nlive in rural areas. The money they receive is used to buy groceries, \nto have lunch at the local diner, or to pay their light bills. It might \nsound like a small amount to some, but Social Security benefits brought \nalmost $5 billion of revenue to small towns in Arkansas. If we cut back \nthose benefits, remember what it is going to do to Arkansas and other \nrural States where there is a disproportionate share of elderly low \nincome who are spending every nickel of that Social Security check to \nmake sure they can keep body, soul and mind together. It is a \ntremendous amount of revenue to our States, and they are heavily \nindebted to those citizens who participate.\n  Addressing only a couple of issues here is going to be our downfall. \nWe have to focus on everything. We need to make sure we solve Social \nSecurity and shore it up for future generations and current \nbeneficiaries, but we cannot fail to see this is a dual path and we \nhave to provide the incentives for personal savings. We must continue \nto work to make sure that beneficiaries continue to receive 100 percent \nof the benefits they are due and that future generations are assured \nthat the program will be able to provide the economic security and \ninsurance for them and for their grandchildren. The promise of Social \nSecurity should be as good as the promise of a better life that a \nmother gives to her child.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes and 50 seconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We note that Senators Clinton and Feinstein are on \ntheir way. We now note that we have two wonderful women representing \nWashington State.\n  We now turn to the junior Senator, Ms. Cantwell, and I yield her 7 \nminutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator from Maryland for her recognition \nand hard work on this issue. I thank her for the recognition of the \nfact that we have two women Senators from Washington State. We achieved \na milestone this past November when we elected a woman Governor, making \nus the first State in the Union to have two women Senators and a woman \nGovernor. We are going to speak loudly about the issues impacting \nwomen.\n  I come to the Senate floor to join my women colleagues. I could, I am \nsure, expound on a lot of comments that have been made in the last \nseveral weeks that have gotten some notoriety: the fact that somehow \nwomen may be genetically different than men and not be able to excel in \nmath and science or the comment that a colleague made about the fact \nthat now we may be getting closer to pay equity in the future.\n  The bottom line of this debate on Social Security reform has to be \nthat women are impacted with greater significance because of their \nlongevity in life and because of the shortfall in pay equity that still \nexists in this country. Where does that leave American women when it \ncomes to Social Security reform?\n  I could talk a lot about whether the private accounts are great \nfoundations\n\n[[Page S916]]\n\nfor this country. I have some grave concerns about them. I also believe \nat this point in time taking money from the deficit, basically adding \nto our deficit and paying into what are to be these private accounts \nmay not be in the best interests of the American people.\n  The point I make this morning is that we are at a time in which women \nare still getting the short end of the stick in this country. If we \nwant to think about anything in the Social Security reform debate, why \ndon't we think about the way Social Security and cost-of-living \nadjustments are calculated. Social Security and cost-of-living \nadjustments do not take into consideration that seniors, older women, \nare living longer and actually have a greater percentage of their \nincomes go toward particular goods and services to a larger degree than \nyoung people's incomes do. Try buying prescription drugs, try balancing \nthings in retirement and living off of the benefits.\n  Women are particularly challenged, but older women, being the most \nimpacted by Social Security, will continue to have this challenge for \ndecades to come. So the benefit structure of Social Security is very \nimportant. The current pace of change that is happening in the way our \neconomy is transitioning has not necessarily impacted that. In 1963, \nwomen earned 59 cents to every $1 men earned. It is true women now earn \nconsiderably more than they did in the 1960s and 1970s, but in spite of \nthe steady growth of earnings, the pay gap between men and women has \nbasically been stalled for the past two decades, averaging slightly \nunder 20 percent less than men.\n  The Senate may be a very unique institution in that it is the only \nplace where you actually have a guarantee of pay equity between men and \nwomen. Yet in 2003 women actually saw their earnings decline for the \nfirst time since 1995. That means real median earnings of men who \nworked full time year round remained unchanged in 2002 at roughly over \n$40,000, and real median earnings of women with similar work experience \nactually decreased 0.6-percent to about $30,000. As a result, women \nstill only make 76 cents for every $1 that is now earned by men. That \nis down from what it was in 2000 at 77 cents. We are going in the wrong \ndirection. And now someone wants to suggest that we tinker with Social \nSecurity benefits. Think of my mother and the support she had as a \nwoman getting Social Security also from her husband and his Social \nSecurity, not having worked, or women who have not worked all their \nlives in the work place and, instead, being full-time mothers. Now we \nwill say we will calculate Social Security on your earnings. Great. \nWell, let's have pay equity for women so it is calculated on an equal \nfooting. We are living longer, we are earning less, and the President's \nproposal will impact us the most. Related to the pay equity statistics \nI just mentioned, for women's families, this means $24 less a month \nthan men to spend on groceries, child care, and other expenses. In \nfact, the Institution of Women's Research did an estimate that families \nin America lose over $200 billion of income per year in this wage gap \nbecause of unequal pay that women's families lose, an average of $4,000 \nannually.\n  I am asking my colleagues, at a time when we are talking about how to \nsecure the future, how are we going to secure that future for women who \nare living longer, in retirement, who have this inequity in the system? \nThat is why I am going to introduce a bill later today basically \nsuggesting that we change the cost-of-living index to specifically \nreflect the current costs that women are experiencing--women and men, \nalike--in retirement age.\n  But I think what we need to do now is look at this legislation that \nis before the Senate and say to ourselves, How is it fair to have the \ninequity with women when we are not doing anything to close the wage \ngap? It is actually going in the wrong direction. That includes making \nsure women in retirement, in the retirement structure of Social \nSecurity that we talk about and consider before this body, actually \nreflect the reality that is happening in America today.\n  I have talked to many of my constituents about this issue. I am sure \nwe are going to talk to many more over the next several months. One of \nmy constituents, a woman I happened to meet in a local convenience \nstore, said to me: The thing I want is my Social Security money. They \nhave paid into the system. They want something for it.\n  Frankly, they think when we take Social Security and use it off-\nbudget, to basically say this is how we are covering our huge deficit, \nthat is basically taking from Social Security and not protecting it. \nWhat they want to know is, Why don't we get a better return on our \ninvestment? Why don't we take, just like a retirement account that she \nor her husband gets, or a State pension program that gets a higher \nreturn, and, basically, take the money that is paid into Social \nSecurity and get a higher return on it as well? Yes, and I would say \nsome of my constituents probably think they themselves could do a good \njob at making private investments. But they do not necessarily think \neverybody in America will be able to make those decisions at a time in \nwhich our economy continues to sag, and there are some people who are \nunemployed and not fully benefitting and paying into the system, or, as \nI said earlier about the income-earning disparity between men and \nwomen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski).

Madam President, I thank the Senator.\n  As we go into this debate, the women are going to be loud and clear. \nThis plan for Social Security impacts us to a greater degree than our \nmale counterparts because of our longevity and because of the disparity \nin wages.\n  Let's talk about how we make Social Security better for women and for \nall Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S916-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S916-S917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SOCIAL SECURITY AND THE IMPACT ON WOMEN\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss \nthe significance that Social Security has for women.\n  Before the Social Security Act was signed into law by President \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt nearly 70 years ago, a majority of elderly \nwomen in America were living in poverty. If a woman's husband died, she \noften became destitute or, if she was lucky, went to live with her \nchildren or relatives.\n  The creation of Social Security changed these women's lives for the \nbetter. Today only one in five elderly women living on their own is in \npoverty, though, of course, we wish that number were zero.\n  Elderly women are now able to live independently and with dignity \nbecause of Social Security. We cannot forget the extent to which Social \nSecurity has improved the lives of women, and all Americans.\n  Since its beginning, Social Security has been a mainstay determining \nwhat kind of retirement security an individual will have. And because \nwomen rely more heavily on Social Security than men, it is a bigger \nfactor in determining their quality of life.\n  The plan that President Bush is putting forward to reform Social \nSecurity would dismantle the most important social program in our \nNation's history, upon which millions of Americans rely for their \nretirement.\n  I am concerned about this plan because it does not protect the fiscal \nhealth of Social Security and would dramatically add to the national \ndebt.\n  This could be disastrous for women as well as children and minorities \nbecause these Americans rely most heavily on Social Security.\n  Nearly half of all unmarried women 65 and older depend on Social \nSecurity for more than 90 percent of their total income.\n  An even greater number of minorities rely so heavily on Social \nSecurity with 66 percent of Hispanics and 74 percent of African \nAmericans in the same category using it for more than 90 percent of \ntheir total income.\n  Additionally, more children are part of families that receive some of \ntheir income from Social Security benefits than receive Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families.\n  All of this is underscored by the fact that women face greater \neconomic challenges in retirement than men:\n\n[[Page S917]]\n\n  Women tend to live longer than men.\n  The majority of women's Social Security benefits are based on their \nhusband's earnings, while less than 5 percent of male Social Security \nbeneficiaries depend on their wife's earnings.\n  Finally, women continue to have lower lifetime earnings than men \nbecause, disappointingly, women still earn less than 80 cents on the \ndollar compared to men, and they are more likely to take time out of \ntheir careers to raise a family.\n  Therefore, any change to Social Security will have a much more \npowerful impact on women than it will on men.\n  The administration has tried to instill a sense of urgency for making \nradical changes to Social Security. I cannot emphasize this enough, \nthere is no crisis.\n  Despite the cries from the Bush administration, Social Security is \nnot in crisis, though some changes are needed to strengthen its long-\nterm stability.\n  Based on demographic projections, including the retirement of the \nbaby-boomer generation, there will be more retirees seeking benefits \nand fewer workers paying payroll taxes. Even so, Social Security is not \nabout to go belly up.\n  Using very conservative predictions of U.S. economic growth, the \nSocial Security Board of Trustees estimates that promised benefits will \ncontinue until 2042, even if no changes are made. Recipients would \ncontinue to get 73 percent of their benefits for at least another three \ndecades after that--again, with no dramatic changes to the current \nsystem.\n  To ensure that benefits continue at the current level until 2080, the \nTrustees say we need $3.7 trillion.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which is headed by a \nformer Chief Economist of President Bush's Council of Economic \nAdvisers, says the Trustees are underestimating economic growth.\n  They believe that only $2 trillion is necessary to close the gap \nwithout any revisions to the program. This means that recipients would \nbe able to get all their promised benefits until 2052 when they would \ndraw 78 percent of their benefits until at least 2080.\n  These are big numbers, but we can ensure that the fund remains \nsolvent much further into the future by making some balanced, long-term \nchanges. We could do this by repealing President Bush's tax cut for \nthose earning more than $200,000 and transferring the revenues to \nSocial Security, which could save about $2.9 trillion over 75 years; \nraising the cap for payroll taxes gradually from the current $90,000 to \n$143,000, which could provide up to $1.6 trillion over 75 years; or \nasking the Social Security Trustees to present Congress with options \nfor updating the system periodically, which Congress would then vote up \nor down.\n  These proposals, and others, deserve careful study so that we fully \nunderstand the costs and benefits of each. I deeply believe that our \nNation should take the time to do this analysis instead of rushing \nheadlong into one plan or another.\n  It is apparent that change is needed in the system, though not \nnecessarily the fundamental and dramatic change that the President \nargues we need in the form of private accounts.\n  But even the President's own advisors acknowledge his proposal would \ndo nothing to address the Social Security shortfall.\n  In a leaked White House e-mail, Peter Wehner, one of the President's \nprincipal advisors, stated ``we simply cannot solve the Social Security \nproblem with Personal Retirement Accounts alone.''\n  In fact, establishing these private accounts will drain an estimated \n$1 trillion to $2 trillion from the Social Security Trust Fund in the \nfirst 10 years and more than $4 trillion in the following decade.\n  Too many retirees depend on Social Security as their main source of \nincome for us to rush into its reform without serious consideration of \nwhat is best to save the system for future generations of workers.\n  Mr. President, the advances of women in the workplace are a big \nreason for the great success of Social Security. When Congress takes up \nthis issue, we must not forget how important this program is, \nespecially to the women who have helped it thrive. It is a source of \ndignity, it is earned and it is a safety net for these women and it \ncannot be abandoned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, how much time is remaining on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I now yield 7 minutes to the Senator \nfrom New York State, Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton, a long champion of \nthe rights of women, and the rights of the elderly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I thank my colleague, the woman we \ncall the dean of the women in the Senate.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, we are here on the floor this morning, \nafter last night's State of the Union Address, to begin what is going \nto be a debate about the future of Social Security.\n  Now, last night we did not receive any details from the President, \nand we do not know exactly what the President intends to propose. But \nbased on the reports in the press and some of the briefings coming back \nthat Senators have held with administration officials, there seems to \nbe an expectation that the President will do several things.\n  First, launch a very aggressive campaign, using every tool at his \ndisposal, which is considerable, to persuade the country that Social \nSecurity is facing an imminent crisis, and that the responsible course \nof action is to do something, preferably what the President will \nrecommend, and that the irresponsible course of action is to somehow \nargue with or question this presumption of there being a crisis.\n  Secondly, it appears the President's plan will include privatization. \nNow, I understand the White House has sent out the word they do not \nwant to use that word anymore, but let's not be fooled. What they are \nattempting to do is take a Social Security system that has worked for \ngenerations of Americans and begin the process of privatizing it. They \ncan call it personal accounts, they can call it ownership, they can \ncall it wealth creation, they can call it whatever they want to call \nit, but the bottom line is this will be a plan to begin the \nprivatization of Social Security.\n  And thirdly, it appears the administration will attempt to finesse, \nif not downright conceal, the real costs of their plan--in benefit \ncuts, in additional borrowing, and increasing the debt facing our \nNation.\n  So this will be a generational debate. I regret that because I think \nthere are other ways to deal with some of the questions that are raised \nabout the future of Social Security.\n  I think we could do what was done under President Reagan, who showed \ngreat leadership in bringing together a bipartisan group which came \nforward with recommendations at a time when Social Security truly was \nfacing a crisis. People of good faith on both sides of the aisle came \ntogether, agreed upon the facts, did not try to spin, did not try to \nembroider, did not try to create a sense of hysteria, but, in a very \nbusinesslike, professional manner said, ``What are the facts?'' and \nthen came up with solutions to the problems faced in 1983. We should be \ndoing the same.\n\n  I earnestly hope the President would adopt that model of President \nReagan. He often refers to President Reagan. Here is one instance where \nI think everyone can salute the leadership President Reagan showed.\n  Those who support private accounts say they are necessary because \nSocial Security faces what they call a crisis and is on the verge of \nfinancial collapse. Supporters of privatization say the way to avoid \nthis collapse is by carving private accounts out of the system.\n  This is not only a scare tactic, which I deplore and regret, but it \nis wrong on\n\n[[Page S918]]\n\ntwo counts. First, there is no imminent collapse of the Social Security \nsystem. And I want to assure everybody who is a faithful C-SPAN watcher \nout there--and I know there are millions of you--tell your friends and \nneighbors: Do not be misled. There is not any danger of an imminent \ncollapse of the Social Security system.\n  Secondly, and equally important, privatization makes the challenge of \nfixing the problems Social Security faces decades from now more \ndifficult, not easier, to solve.\n  Now, let's be clear. Social Security does have a financial challenge \nthat does need to be addressed, but the fact remains that program will \ncontinue to run annual surpluses for decades to come and can pay full \nbenefits until between 2042 and 2052. After that--and I won't be around \nfor that, but hopefully my daughter and everyone else's children and \nthese young pages will be--Social Security still will not be bankrupt \nbecause payroll taxes coming into the system will be enough to pay \nalmost 80 percent of the benefits promised today if we do nothing to \nfix any problems so that we can provide whatever the 100-percent \nbenefit level would be in 2052.\n  So I believe Social Security may require some action to ensure that \nit remains strong, but it does not require fundamental changes. I would \nstrongly caution against this ``medicine'' the President is \nprescribing. It will make the patient, who is well, sick. It will \nundermine the long-term health and quality of this remarkable \nachievement of the 20th century. Because, after all, Social Security is \nthe largest source of retirement income in the United States. For 6 out \nof 10 seniors, it provides half or more of their total income.\n  My mother was born in 1919. I hope she does not mind me telling \neverybody. Let's remember that before the enactment of Social Security, \nmore than 50 percent of the Nation's elderly lived in poverty. We are \ntalking about destitute poverty. Today, only 8 percent of seniors live \nin poverty. Let us also not forget that it is women like my mother who \nconstitute the majority of Social Security beneficiaries: approximately \n60 percent of Social Security recipients over the age of 65, and \nroughly 72 percent of those over 85. In my State of New York, more than \n1.6 million women receive Social Security benefits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the Democrats has now \nexpired.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Thank you, Madam President.\n  So you can see why we have come to the floor today to talk about the \nway this affects women, because among elderly widows, such as my \nmother, Social Security provides, on average, nearly three-quarters of \ntheir income. Four out of 10 widows rely on Social Security to provide \n90 percent or more of their income.\n  Now, we heard the President say last night that people over 55 need \nnot worry. Well, what about people between 20 and 55? What about the \n50-year-old woman who has paid into Social Security for the last 30 \nyears? What about the 40-year-old woman who has paid into Social \nSecurity to ensure the retirement security of her mother and expects \nthe same from her daughter? These are very important questions because \nthey go to the heart of our intergenerational compact.\n  So this is the first of what will be a long and very active debate. \nLet us hope at the end we conclude that we should follow President \nReagan's example, swallow some medicine that will not kill the patient, \nwork in a bipartisan manner, and preserve Social Security for years to \ncome.\n  Madam President, I thank my colleague from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S918-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Madam President, the State of the Union Message has \nbecome a great moment in American political theater. Originally, State \nof the Union Messages, which are called for in the Constitution, were \nsubmitted to the Congress in writing. Perhaps it is a demonstration of \nthe fact that we have gotten into the world of modern communications \nthat it has now become not just a presentation to the Congress, but, \nthrough the medium of television and radio, it has become a speech to \nthe Nation.\n  So the Nation gathers around electronically to listen to its elected \nleader describe what is going on in the country and in the world. We \nhad that experience last night. Last night's was one of the better \nState of the Union Messages we have had.\n  In today's world we have instant polling, we have instant results. \nThis morning's hotline reports there are two polls out, one saying that \n86 percent of those who viewed the speech liked it; the second poll--\nCBS, less favorable to the President--says it was only 80 percent of \nthe people who viewed the speech liked it. And according to the Gallup \npoll, 77 percent of those who liked it now believe President Bush is \nleading the country in the right direction.\n  This is a home run, for a speech to have that kind of a reaction and \nmake that kind of an impact on those who listened to it. It was a \ndeparture, in my view, from the traditional format that has settled in \non State of the Union Messages--not a complete one but a partial \ndeparture in that State of the Union Messages have become laundry lists \nwhere Presidents have made a one-sentence or one-paragraph reference to \nthe issues that are of great importance to a variety of special \ninterest groups, so that each member of a special interest group can \nwait anxiously in the hope his or her moment will come when the \nPresident will say something nice about what he or she thinks is \nimportant.\n  There was some of that in the speech last night. You cannot have a \nmodern State of the Union Address without it. But there was far less \nthan we usually see because last night's speech was primarily a \nthematic statement of the President and his world view, both domestic \nand international.\n  As I listened to the speech unfold and caught that theme, I realized \nthis is a President who has a truly broad and far-reaching world view.\n  His primary focus was on the future. His primary concern, both \ndomestic and international, was on the benefit of what we might do that \nwould accrue to our children and our grandchildren.\n  We have had a lot of conversation so far about Social Security. The \nPresident did spend a good deal of time on Social Security. While I am \npraising the President, I will join with my friends on the Democratic \nside of the aisle to say that I think he made one mistake in his \npresentation. He used a word which, if I had been in conversation with \nhim and his speechwriters, I would have recommended he drop. The word \nwas ``bankrupt.'' The Social Security system will not go bankrupt.\n  If we do nothing, what will happen if we follow the impulse of those \nwho say there is nothing that needs to be done will be that when the \naccount balances currently listed under the heading of the Social \nSecurity trust fund run out, there will still be money coming in in the \nform of payroll taxes. It will simply not be enough to cover the \nobligations going out that have been laid there. So the Social Security \nAdministration will have to adopt some kind of strategy to deal with \nthat. Maybe it will be like the gas lines. If your birthday is in an \neven numbered year, you get a check this month. If it is an odd \nnumbered year, you have to wait until next month. Maybe it will be some \nkind of alphabetical choice, or maybe everybody will just be told: We \ncan't send out any checks this month. Wait another 30 days and we will \ndo the best we can.\n  By technical accounting terms, that is not bankruptcy, but by any \nstandard, that is not a result we want. So while I would say to the \nPresident, don't use the term ``bankrupt'' because, as an accounting \nterm, that is\n\n[[Page S919]]\n\nnot directly correct, I do say to the President: Thank you for having \nthe courage to lay out the facts that virtually everyone understands \nand knows.\n  The fact is that Social Security is under irreducible pressure from \nthe demographic trends in which we find ourselves today. There are \ntrends that we like. We are all living longer. We are all healthier. \nThe Nation is seeing more and more of its workers survive into old age. \nWho could be against that? But the references that have been made in \nthe Chamber about 1983, why don't we just do what we did in 1983, which \nwas basically to kick it down the road so it could get dealt with later \non, don't apply now, because we are on the verge of the retirement of \nthe baby boomers.\n  As I was driving in this morning, I heard the radio talk about 77 \nmillion baby boomers and when do they start to retire. When do they \nstart to put the pressure on the system? It is not 2048, when all of us \nare dead. It is not 2018, when the projection is that the lines will \nstart to cross between money coming in and money going out. It is 2008. \nIt is within the term of those of us who just got elected. Within our \nnext 6-year term the pressure on Social Security will begin to build. \nIn 2008, it won't be overwhelming pressure. In 2009, it won't break the \nsystem. But it will begin, it will continue, and it will grow. We need \nto do something about it now or future generations will look at us and \nsay we were the ones who were irresponsible, we were the ones who \nburied our heads in the sand, and we were the ones who said: Let \nsomebody else take care of it somewhere down the road. If we want to do \nthe responsible thing, we act in this Congress.\n  What struck me about the President's proposal is that he did not lay \ndown an edict and say: This is what it has to be or I won't sign it. He \nlisted a bunch of different solutions, most of which have been proposed \nover the years by Democrats, and then made the statement: They are all \non the table. In other words, let's talk. And the boos that came in the \nChamber--and I have never heard that in all of the State of the Union \nMessages I have ever heard--the boos that came in the Chamber as the \nPresident laid that down said: We are not willing to talk. We are not \nwilling to talk to you, Mr. President. We are so offended by the idea \nthat you say there is something that has to be done that we will not \neven engage in this dialog.\n  They are making a tremendous mistake when they take that position. \nBecause the President said, once again: Here are the various proposals. \nHe quoted a number of Democrats as to the proposals. He put forward his \nown proposal in general fashion, but he made the specific quote: It is \nall on the table. The reaction that came back from a portion of the \npeople on the other side of the aisle was: We are not willing to talk. \nWe are not even willing to have the conversation.\n  The message that sends to the young worker just graduating from high \nschool who is saying: I don't want to be there in my career when the \nSocial Security Administration has to decide which checks to send out \nor which months to pass up or which benefits to say we can't afford, I \nwant the Congress to start doing something now so when I retire, I can \nsee certainty--I think the people in that situation will look at what \nhappened last night and say: The person we must depend on to lead to \nthe solution of the problems that we will have in our lifetimes is \nPresident Bush.\n  Let's leave Social Security to make one other comment about the \nspeech. I thought this was very much a theme speech. The theme was the \nfuture, and the underlying force behind the President's theme was his \noptimism and his conviction that the future can be better, better \ndomestically, better for workers who are looking forward to a career \nand then retirement. The same sense was included in his statement about \nforeign affairs. The future can be better.\n  He talked about Afghanistan. The future is already better in \nAfghanistan. I have a high school and college classmate who does \nbusiness in Afghanistan. Can you imagine that--a businessman from Utah \nwho is doing business in Afghanistan. He says to me: Bob, you can't \nbelieve how marvelous it is, as an American, to walk up and down the \nstreets of Kabul and have people grab you and hug you and thank you and \nsay: What has happened in Afghanistan is magnificent. The future of \nAfghanistan is much brighter because of what George W. Bush did.\n  We ignore that because it is overwhelmed by events in Iraq. But as \nwas pointed out by the President, what happened last Sunday makes it \nclear that the future in Iraq is much brighter because of what George \nW. Bush did.\n  As he talked about the future and his optimism and his conviction \nthat what we do now is important for the future, it all came together \nin the most dramatic moment of the speech, when the woman from Iraq, \nwith her ink-stained finger, embraced the mother of the dead marine who \ndemonstrated America's resolve to bring freedom and liberty to the \nworld. I don't think there were many dry eyes in the Chamber when that \nhappened. And it was not scripted. It could not have been scripted.\n  I once said to Karl Rove: George W. Bush is as good a President as \nRonald Reagan, but he is not as good an actor. Last night he wasn't \nacting. We saw the real George W. Bush, and we saw the real emotion as \nthe woman from Iraq reached out to comfort and thank the mother of the \ndead marine.\n  Freedom is on the march in the world, and the future looks brighter \nthan it otherwise would have been if it had not been for the actions of \nGeorge W. Bush.\n  I close as I began: These speeches have become American political \ntheater and fairly predictable. Last night's was an exception. Eighty-\nsix percent of the people who watched it liked it. To get that kind of \nsupport from the American people is an extraordinary accomplishment, \nand the President deserves congratulations for having brought it off.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I congratulate my good friend from \nUtah on his evaluation of the President's outstanding State of the \nUnion speech last night. I was just thinking that this probably is the \n20th State of the Union I have had the privilege to witness and observe \nin the Chamber of the House of Representatives. None have been finer. \nIndeed, the moment that captured the evening was, of course, the \nembrace between Janet Norwood, mother of the marine who was killed in \nFallujah, and the Iraqi woman whose father was killed by Saddam \nHussein. The junior Senator from Utah has it exactly right: There was \nnot a dry eye in the House. I watched a lot of really tough customers \nshedding tears on the floor of the House during that moment. But it \nsummed it up, what this has all been about.\n  Of course, we went to war in Iraq to make ourselves safer, but there \nwas another sort of collateral purpose. The President believes deeply--\nand I think the American people are beginning to get it--that when \ndemocracy takes root, the world is a safer place. And just look at the \nsweep of democracy in the last few months in the most unlikely places.\n  I had the opportunity to go back to Afghanistan a couple weeks ago. \nIt was my second trip there. On my first trip driving from the airport \nto meet with President Karzai in downtown Kabul, the streets were \nlargely silent--not many people out, almost no commerce visible. But 15 \nmonths later, in January of 2005, there are little stores springing up \neverywhere, traffic jams in Kabul. And people are clearly on an \nemotional high as a result of the extraordinary election they had last \nOctober 9 which included a virtual 80-percent turnout, including 82 \npercent of women in Afghanistan, of all places, where little girls were \nnot even allowed to be in school a few years ago, a huge success story \nin one of the most backward and devastated countries in the world.\n  On the heels of an election in Georgia, which has had its problems \ngetting started in the wake of the end of the Soviet Union, and the \nliteral uprising in Ukraine, when there was an attempt to steal the \nelection, to deny the will of the people, the Ukrainians rose up and \neven a supreme court in Ukraine, obviously beholden to the President \nwho was in cahoots with those who were trying to steal the election, \nruled against those trying to steal the election and said: We are going \nto have another election, which they did the day after Christmas. The \nforces of democracy rose up and took control of\n\n[[Page S920]]\n\nUkraine for the first time since its freedom from the Soviet Union.\n  And the Palestinian territory--Palestinians used to Saddam-type \nelections, where there was a 99-percent turnout and no choice--had a \nreal choice of who to lead the Palestinian Authority in the wake of \nArafat's death. A man got elected who appears to be a reasonable \nleader, working hard with Prime Minister Sharon to try to achieve a \nlasting peace.\n  We wish Secretary of State Rice well as she departs today to go to \nthe Middle East to meet with Sharon and Abu Mazen to see if they can \nfinally get the roadmap back on track at a meeting with Abu Mazen and \nAriel Sharon, not to mention last Sunday's inspirational election in \nIraq. Many Members of the House of Representatives last night had \ninkstained index fingers themselves to sort of symbolize our enormous \nadmiration for the extraordinary courage that it took to go out and \nvote in Iraq last Sunday.\n\n  The critics and naysayers will say the turnout was not what it should \nhave been in the Sunni area. But the overall turnout was about what we \nhad last year in this country. I am fairly confident almost nobody in \nAmerica thought they might get shot if they went to the polls. So there \nwas extraordinary courage, literally under fire, dancing in the \nstreets, the waving of those inkstained index fingers all over the \ncountry. The Sunni turnout was not what it will be later, but the \npeople building a democratic Iraq understand and will include an \nadequate number of Sunnis by appointment in the interim government.\n  And remember, there are going to be two more elections in Iraq this \nyear. A constitution will be submitted to the voters of Iraq in \nOctober. It will not be ratified if only 3 provinces disapprove out of \n18. At least four provinces are Sunni majority. That constitution will \nhave to be crafted in such a way that the Sunni population of Iraq is \ncomfortable with it, or it will not be ratified. The leaders of the \nemerging democracy in Iraq are all acutely aware of the need to respect \nthe rights of minorities and to have proper balance in Iraq in order to \nhave a governing democracy.\n  If we had any doubts they would make it, we don't have any now. Our \nfriends and colleagues on the other side who have said the signal from \nthe election is to leave have it exactly wrong. The President made it \nclear last night, and he was absolutely correct, that you never \nannounce to your enemy when you are going to leave. We will leave Iraq \none day, even though we are still in Germany and still in Japan some 60 \nyears later; and we are nowhere in the world where we are not wanted. \nWe will leave Iraq some day, when the Iraqi democracy has taken hold \nand when the Iraqi military and Iraqi police can provide for their own \nsecurity--and not a day before that.\n  I had a chance to be in Iraq 2 weeks ago, too, for the second time. \nThere was some nervousness, candidly, about this election. Nobody knew \nfor sure how successful it would be. Carlos Valenzuela, from the U.N., \nan elections expert, was there and he said: ``This election is going to \npass international standards, I am absolutely certain of it.'' This is \na man who has been involved in conducting elections 14 times in \ndifficult places around the world. He was totally confident 2 weeks \nbefore the election. He was right and the naysayers were wrong.\n  Even those who originally were between skeptical and hostile to the \nIraq war we had an opportunity to sit down with on that same trip a \ncouple weeks ago. We went back to Brussels with the NATO Ambassadors \nand a European representative. I think it is not an exaggeration to say \nthat even the Ambassadors from France and Germany to NATO believe at \nthis point that it is in everybody's interest for Iraq to be a success.\n  Who benefits by a failure in Iraq? No one but the terrorists. I think \nthe President will find on his upcoming trip to Europe more interest in \ncooperating, in helping to move Iraq further down the road toward \ndemocracy.\n  So last night was indeed a celebration of the march of democratic \nforces in some of the most unusual places in the world over the last 4 \nmonths. The President went a step further, challenging our allies, the \nSaudis, to begin the march down the democratic path. Even our staunch \nally, Egypt--he challenged them to begin a march in the democratic \ndirection. The President deeply believes--and we are increasingly \ninclined to believe he is correct on a bipartisan basis--that the \nspread of democracy will make the world indeed safer.\n  Now, the President was, of course, criticized initially on Iraq for \nnot being very multilateral, in spite of the fact that a majority of \nNATO countries supported the war and helped us. Nevertheless, he was \ncriticized by some who, I guess, only feel that France and Germany are \nEurope and no one else counts, saying he was not multilateral enough. \nThe President laid out last night a completely multilateral strategy \nrelated to the two most obvious rogue states left in the world, Iran \nand North Korea. The Germans, the French, and the British are leading \nthe talks with the Iranians; and working with the North Koreans, we \nhave the Russians, the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Japanese, and \nourselves. That is the definition of a multilateral approach.\n  So the President develops his approaches depending upon the \nsituation, and every situation is not exactly the same. He knows, and \nthe new Secretary of State knows, we need significant international \ncooperation in order to achieve our goals in North Korea and in Iran. \nNorth Korea and Iran can take a look at Libya and see the rewards for \ngoing nonnuclear. To be welcomed into the community of responsible \ncountries means trade benefits, it means an opportunity for interaction \nwith the rest of the world, and a chance to improve the lives of the \ncitizens through trade. There are a lot of advantages that I hope the \nleaders of North Korea and Iran will observe that Libya is going to \nbegin to benefit from as a result of making the decision that maybe the \nLibyan people would be better off being engaged with the rest of the \nworld, rather than having some weapons of mass destruction sitting \nthere. For what purpose?\n  So enormous progress has been made in the last 4 years. The low point \nwas 9/11. We all remember it well. But extraordinary progress toward a \nsafer world and toward the spread of democracy has occurred under the \nextraordinary leadership of our President. We had a chance last night \nto celebrate that and to commend him for a job well done in last \nnight's State of the Union.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we must do everything possible to show our \nmilitary men and women and their families how much we appreciate and \nhonor their service. Last week I was proud to cosponsor legislation \nintroduced by Senators Allen, Sessions and Lieberman reaffirming the \ncommitment of this Congress to our military men and women and their \nfamilies. This effort has received my strongest support, and thanks to \nthe endorsement of the Leadership and the work over the past years by \nmany of my other colleagues, an increase in financial support to the \nfamilies of men and women killed in combat could soon be a reality.\n  When a soldier pays the ultimate sacrifice, no amount of money can \nease the grief of his or her family, but a significant increase in the \nbenefits paid to our military families sends a strong message of our \ngratitude and support.\n  Currently, when a service member is killed in combat, the family \nreceives only $12,420. This is simply unacceptable. We are a strong, \nprosperous Nation, a Nation that honors and respects our sons and \ndaughters in the Armed Services. We can and must do better to provide \nfor the families of those who've lost their lives. The current proposal \nto increase what is called the ``death gratuity'' to $100,000 is most \ncertainly a step in the right direction.\n  This increase, retroactive to October 2001, is critically important \nnot only to the families who lose loved ones, but to soldiers currently \nserving or those who are considering enlisting. It sends the message \nthat we value their service, and should something happen to them, their \nfamilies will be generously cared for.\n  Maxine Crockett of Fayetteville, NC, lost her husband, Staff Sergeant \nRicky L. Crockett, to a bomb blast in Baghdad in January of last year. \nShe and\n\n[[Page S921]]\n\nher 15-year-old daughter were left not only grief-stricken but worried \nabout surviving financially with the loss of a provider. Maxine told \nthe Raleigh News & Observer, ``When it comes down to just one income, \nthis [increase] would really help by giving you the time to get back on \nyour feet.''\n  When a family does receive the heartbreaking notification that a \nloved one was killed in action, they are understandably overcome with \ngrief. In the midst of their devastation, they are required to make \nmany decisions. Casualty Assistance Officers play a critical role in \nhelping them through this process. I had the privilege of meeting many \nof these dedicated, impressive men and women personally at Fort Bragg \nlast year. These officers are there with the families following \nnotification, through funeral preparations, burial and the process of \ndetermining benefits and compensation. They assist when any problems \narise and literally go above and beyond their job description. And long \nafter, these families know these officers can be contacted as concerns \narise. This is the kind of service and compassion these families \ndeserve.\n  We also have a responsibility to assist those servicemen and women \nwho are seriously injured and their families. With the improvements in \nbody armor and heroic efforts of our military medical teams both in \ntheater and at home, so many more of our soldiers are surviving, but \noften with debilitating wounds. We must ensure they are taken care of, \nphysically, emotionally and financially.\n  I am so pleased that the Department of Defense today launched a new \noperations center for these deserving heroes and their families to \nprovide them with the necessary support as they transition back to \nactive duty or into civilian life. This center will integrate the \nprograms currently sponsored by various military and Government \nservices, making it easier for these individuals to access the medical, \ncounseling, educational, and financial services they need and deserve.\n  Our injured and fallen heroes and their families must be a top \npriority. They deserve no less.\n  Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last night we had the occasion on the \nHouse floor to hear a speech from the Commander in Chief, the President \nof the United States of America--a speech that to me was about two \noverriding themes--one, freedom, and the other, security--and two \nprimary subjects--one, the war in Iraq and its liberation, and the \nother, the security of the American people and their retirement.\n  To the first, I simply say, as eloquent as the President's speech \nwas, as dramatic as his words were, and as many of them as there were, \nthe most powerful message last night was not words, but a picture. For \nwhen Janet Norwood embraced Sofia, the President stopped speaking, the \nChamber erupted, tears flowed, but not a word was said. If the saying \n``a picture is worth a thousand words'' was ever appropriate, it was on \nthat occasion.\n  I am very proud of our men and women in the Armed Forces, I am proud \nof this Congress, I am proud of this President, and I am proud of the \npeople of Iraq and Afghanistan, and all freedom-loving people.\n  The second subject the President addressed was Social Security, which \nis all about freedom and security, and it is the subject about which I \nwill make my few remarks on this morning.\n  I would like to begin these remarks by asking you to visualize \nanother picture. Think about how powerful Sofia and Janet were, and \nthink about this picture. Picture the year 2042 or 2052, if you like. \nPicture you in your living room or your den. Picture you looking at \nyour son or your daughter and their grandchildren squarely in the eye, \nand picture explaining to them that when you had the chance 37 years \nearlier, you did nothing to secure their future.\n  There are those who say Social Security does not have a crisis today, \nbut it has a big crisis tomorrow. When I entered into my campaign for \nthe Senate, I ended every speech by saying ``I will soon be 60''--and I \nam 60 now--``and the rest of my life is about my children and my \ngrandchildren.'' So it is true about all of us in this room. To do \nnothing is unacceptable if you visualize that picture 37 years from \nnow, if you look at your daughter or your son or their grandchildren. I \nwant to talk about Elizabeth Sutton Isakson and Jack Hardy Isakson, \nboth born last year, both of whom will be 37 in 2042 when I would have \nto give them the ``good'' news--if this Congress did nothing--that \nAmerica's promise on Social Security is gone, that by law their \nbenefits are lowered and, by absolute practice, their taxes will be \nraised.\n  I heard someone in opposition to reform last night criticize the \nPresident for saying it is their money. They said it is not their \nmoney. They said, ``It is my mother's money.'' That is what is wrong \nwith the system. We have robbed Peter to pay Paul. We are running out \nof Peters, and we are getting a greater number of Pauls.\n  Now, personal accounts and a nest egg in the future are a viable \ndecision that should not be criticized and rejected out of hand. In \nfact, I will tell you an interesting little fact. Had the United States \nof America 70 years ago invested the surpluses of the payroll tax paid \nby the American workers throughout that time, we would not have the \nproblem today. But we robbed Peter to pay Paul.\n  There are those who say personal accounts are a gamble. Arithmetic is \na fact, and facts are stubborn. In the 70-year period since the advent \nof Social Security, pick any 20 consecutive years that you like and \npick any traditional conservative investment model that you like, and \nin that 20-year period of time, it exceeded the return on Social \nSecurity four to five times.\n\n  The time value of money is the solution to all problems. \nProcrastination on the investment of money is a message for disaster. \nWe should not reject this debate out of hand. We should embrace it. We \nshould not reject personal investment; we should encourage it.\n  Who in this room has not told their children, when we created IRAs, \nto invest in them because you cannot count on Social Security? Who in \nthis room has not said it? It has been said this morning. I told my \nchildren to plan on more because Social Security would not be enough.\n  The President has said for a modest debt today, we can prohibit a $26 \ntrillion catastrophe 37 years from now by giving younger Americans a \nchoice to do what we do as Members of Congress in the Thrift Savings \nPlan. We have the opportunity to empower their future and enhance their \nsecurity.\n  Yes, there are disciplines we should apply. Yes, there is math that \nwe should run. But facts are stubborn. Had we done as a country, with \nthe surpluses we received, what the President wants to offer \nvoluntarily to younger Americans, we would not be here today.\n  Facts are stubborn, and pictures are worth a thousand words.\n  I hope I am here in 2042, and I pray to God that Elizabeth and Jack \nwill be here, too, and they are going to sit in my den in front of my \nfireplace, and we are going to talk. I am not going to tell them that \n37 years before when I had a chance to make their future brighter I \nsaid we really did not have a crisis, we really did not need to do a \nthing.\n  George W. Bush is a great President for many reasons but, most \nimportantly, because he is willing to look a problem square in the eye \nregardless of size and make suggestions and solutions for its \ncorrection. We owe the American people no less, and I owe Elizabeth \nSutton Isakson and Jack Hardy Isakson no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I do not know if this is the first \ntime the junior Senator from Georgia has spoken in the Senate, but I am \nsure it is one of the first times, if not the first time. I just want \nto tell him I thought what a persuasive argument the junior Senator \nfrom Georgia made that we need to not ignore this problem but tackle it \nfor our children and grandchildren.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, first, I would like to say straight out \nthat I thought the President gave a great speech yesterday. I thought \nit\n\n[[Page S922]]\n\nwas forward looking, positive, and I think he issued a challenge to \nMembers of Congress. It is a challenge we should face up front.\n  I rise today to talk about the President's State of the Union \nAddress. The President last night reminded us of our freedom and \nliberty, our personal responsibilities, and solemn obligations. Freedom \nand liberty--no two words have given more to those blessed by them and \ndamned more those who have taken them away.\n  The President's address reminded us that the march of freedom \ncontinues throughout the world. The success of the elections in \nAfghanistan, Iraq, Palestine, and the Ukraine clearly demonstrate a \ndesire for liberty and democracy, a desire that was revealed to the \nworld this week by an ink-stained finger, an understated expression of \nmankind's inalienable right.\n  Tyranny has no place in the world. We must oppose it with great \ndetermination and diligence wherever it appears. The election in Iraq \nin particular showed that people are willing to risk their lives to \nbear the privilege of freedom and the mark of democracy.\n  Recent success does not mean our obligations are fulfilled. As the \nPresident articulated, our Nation must continue to root out tyranny \nwherever it resides. We must oppose extremism, whether it be religious \nor ideological. We must assist those who are in need, those who live in \ndesperate poverty, and those who are suffering from deplorable disease \nand epidemic.\n  Sadly, freedom comes at great expense. We have witnessed the cost of \nliberty, first at the birth of our Nation and later at the salvation of \nour Union. Today we see the price of liberty as freedom-fearing \nterrorists lash out against the builders of democracy.\n  The sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has been great. I \ncannot fully express my admiration and respect for those willing to \nserve our Nation, protect our country, and defeat those seeking the \nreturn of oppression. Their commitment to freedom is an inspiration to \nme, to the people of Colorado, and to the Nation. To these men and \nwomen, we owe our solemn obligation, our pledge to not waste the \nblessings their sacrifice has bestowed.\n  The President also spoke of the future, our obligations to elderly \ngenerations, and the duties owed to our youngest children. The \nPresident has chosen reality over popularity and will address the \ngrowing threat of insolvency, ensuring stability for all Americans.\n  Those resistant to the reality of a losing system claim that Social \nSecurity is not broken. They want to bury their heads in the sand and \npretend the looming bankruptcy will go away. But the reality is this: \nIn three short years, the baby boomers will be eligible for Social \nSecurity. At that point, the balance in the Social Security trust fund \nwill begin its permanent decline. Even if President Bush were to sign \nthe necessary reforms into law this year, it would most likely take at \nleast a couple years to implement. If we do not act, we will \nshortchange the American people. I believe, that the time to act is \nnow.\n  Social Security was created in 1935 under President Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt. At that time, the average life expectancy was 63 years of \nage, most women did not work outside the home, most adult males did not \nlive to reach retirement age, and payroll taxes were only 2 percent on \nthe first $3,000 of income.\n  Today the average life expectancy is 77 years, men and women work \noutside the home, both are likely to reach retirement age, and the \npayroll taxes are 12.4 percent on the first $90,000 of income. The \nAmerican people deserve a system that has been modernized to reflect \n21st Century realities.\n\n  The President is not using scare tactics--Social Security is safe for \ntoday's seniors. Let me repeat that. Social Security is safe for \ntoday's seniors. But it is in serious jeopardy for our children and our \ngrandchildren. Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system with today's \nworkers paying to support today's retirees. But each year there are \nmore retirees receiving benefits and fewer workers to support them. In \nthe 1950s, there were about 16 workers for every beneficiary. Today \nthere are about three workers for every retiree, and eventually, there \nwill be only two. Social Security's source of income is rapidly \ndisappearing. If the program continues under current law, younger \nworkers will face a 26-percent cut in benefits when they retire. \nCongress must act now to save this valuable program for future \ngenerations.\n  In the 1990s, President Clinton advocated reforming Social Security. \nIn his 1999 State of the Union Address, President Clinton stated:\n\n       First, and above all, we must save Social Security for the \n     21st century.\n\n  At the time, Democrats wholeheartedly agreed. The current Democratic \nleader said on Fox News Sunday on February 14, 1999:\n\n       Most of us have no problems with taking a small amount of \n     Social Security proceeds and putting it into the private \n     sector.\n\n  Many other Democrats agreed. The current Democratic whip said:\n\n       Due to the increasing number of baby boomers reaching \n     retirement age, Social Security will be unable to pay out \n     full benefits. . . . But the sooner Congress acts to avert \n     this crisis, the easier and less painful it will be.\n\n  But Democrats are now trying to convince Americans there is not a \nproblem, that reform is not necessary, and this simply is not true.\n  I worked with President Clinton and Senate Democrats to try to reform \nthe Social Security system in the 1990s. I am now pledging to work with \nPresident Bush in making sure the American people have a long-term \nsecure Social Security system. Social Security reform is a bipartisan \nissue.\n  Some groups oppose the President's push to reform Social Security by \nclaiming that personal retirement accounts are not a necessary addition \nto the Social Security system. One such group is the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons, commonly referred to as the AARP. On \nJanuary 3, 2005, they announced they were beginning an advertising \ncampaign in 59 newspapers across the country, and these advertisements \nare intended to warn the public that basing the Social Security Program \non private investments poses serious risks. I would agree with the AARP \nif this were, in fact, true. However, to my knowledge, that proposal \nhas never been on the table. Rather, the President has discussed adding \nthe option for younger workers to build a nest egg in a personal \naccount.\n  The AARP offers its employees a generous benefits package, including \na pension and 401(k) plan similar to the very option they now oppose. \nMany other employers offer these plans to their employees as well. How \ncan it be that personal retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s, are good \nenough for the AARP, Members of Congress, and a good portion of the \ncountry, but, according to the AARP and the Democrats, they are not \ngood enough for all Americans?\n  Some reform opponents have suggested that simply raising or \neliminating the taxable income cap of $90,000 will fix the problem \ncompletely. By doing this, we would only postpone Social Security trust \nfund deficits by 6 years, and this is why: Under the current structure, \nthe more you pay into Social Security, the more you get back upon \nretirement.\n  President Bush has said that benefits for current beneficiaries are \nnot to be cut or are in any way at risk. The President would like to \noffer the option, not requirement, for workers to invest a portion of \ntheir own paycheck into a personal retirement account. This account \nwould travel with workers from job to job as opposed to a 401(k) plan \nthat is with one single employer.\n  It is possible that this personal account could even be passed on to \nfuture generations. This option would benefit all Americans, and give \nthem more choices for their retirement. If reforms take place soon, \nretirees could begin retirement with a nest egg far larger than what \nSocial Security can offer. It would be irresponsible for any elected \nofficial, regardless of party, to oppose reform.\n  As we head into this debate, I hope that everyone will enter with an \nopen mind in forging new ideas on how to solve this very pressing \nproblem. Social Security cannot be fixed with minor alterations. Social \nSecurity is a valuable, successful program from which our country's \nretired citizens benefit. However, unless Congress fulfills its duty \nand obligations to protect its solvency, it will not be around for my \nchildren's retirement--or yours.\n\n[[Page S923]]\n\nAddressing Social Security is not divisive--it is responsible.\n  The 109th Congress will be long on debate, but we must all work \ntogether to make sure that it is also filled with accomplishments for \nthe American people. I look forward to working with my colleagues in \nthe Senate and the House as we pursue a policy of hope and empowerment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the bold and forward-thinking agenda that President Bush laid out \nfor us last night.\n  The President was right in saying that the state of our Union is \n``confident and strong.'' We have been blessed with a healthy, growing \neconomy, with more Americans going back to work, and with our Nation \nacting as a positive force for good in the world.\n  Our economy is bouncing back, but we all know that more must be done \nto make it stronger and more productive. The President understands that \nby making our economy more flexible, more innovative, and more \ncompetitive, we will keep America the economic leader of the world.\n  The President was very clear about the need for Congress to help \nreduce wasteful spending and burdensome regulations, make tax relief \npermanent, eliminate junk lawsuits, and lower health care costs. But I \nwas most impressed with the President's willingness to tackle tax \nreform.\n  The President accurately pointed out that year after year, Americans \nare burdened by an archaic, incoherent Federal Tax Code. We all know \nthat the Federal Tax Code is the No. 1 job killer in America, but very \nfew of us seem willing to stand up and push for meaningful reform.\n  Earlier this year, the President established a bipartisan panel to \nstudy the Tax Code and to make recommendations. This is something I \nhave been calling for for many years. When their recommendations are \ndelivered, I stand ready to work with the President to give this Nation \na Tax Code that is progrowth, easy to understand, and fair to everyone. \nIf we want to secure the best jobs in the future, we must make America \nthe best place in the world to do business. The President understands \nthis, and I am hopeful that this body can make strides toward \naccomplishing that important goal.\n\n  Another goal the President put forward last night that is very close \nto my heart is the challenge of permanently fixing Social Security. I \nthought the President was clear about the financial problems facing the \nprogram. He pointed out what we all know but often fail to \nacknowledge--that Social Security will begin paying out more than it \ncollects in just 13 years.\n  The current program does not have enough money to pay for all its \npromised benefits. Some may argue with this and say the trust fund will \nkeep Social Security afloat until 2042, but I challenge them to show me \nthe money, show me how they plan to make good on all of those IOUs. Our \nfuture seniors will not accept IOUs instead of real money, nor should \nthey.\n  It is not enough to just oppose and obstruct one solution. The \ncritics of reform must put forward their own plan. So far, we have not \nseen one.\n  I am very concerned about the misinformation surrounding this debate, \nand that is why I am introducing legislation today to require the \nSocial Security Administration to update the information it gives \nAmerican workers. The current statement entitled ``Your Social Security \nStatement'' fails to communicate the serious problems facing Social \nSecurity. The current statement reads like a passbook savings account \nand leads workers to believe that the Government is actually saving \ntheir money. It is not. The statement should tell workers that their \ncombined employee and employer taxes total 12.4 percent of their wages \nthroughout their life. It should tell them that none of that money is \nsaved for their retirement. And it should tell them that each year that \ngoes by, retirees get a lower and lower rate of return.\n  I thought the President's argument last night for the personal \nsavings account was very accurate. He said:\n\n       Your money will grow, over time, at a greater rate than \n     anything the current system can deliver, and your account \n     will provide money for retirement over and above the check \n     you will receive from Social Security. In addition, you will \n     be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your \n     personal account, if you wish, to your children and \n     grandchildren. And best of all, the money in the account is \n     yours, and the Government can never take it away.\n\n  That last point is the most important part of this debate. Reforming \nSocial Security with personal accounts is about forcing the Government \nto start saving workers' money for the first time in history so that no \nPresident, no Congress, can ever again spend it on other programs.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume executive session for the consideration of Executive Calendar \nNo. 8, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Alberto R. Gonzales, of \nTexas, to be Attorney General.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 8 \nhours of debate equally divided between the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nMr. Specter, and the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, or their \ndesignees.\n  Under the previous order, time shall alternate every 30 minutes \nbetween the majority and minority for the first 2 hours, with the first \n30 minutes under the control of the majority.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to support a man of remarkable \nachievement, Judge Alberto Gonzales, to be the next Attorney General of \nthe United States.\n\n  Judge Gonzales is proof that in America, there are no artificial \nbarriers to success. A man or a woman can climb to any height that his \nor her talents can take them. For Judge Gonzales, that is a very high \naltitude indeed. And luckily for his country, he is not finished \nclimbing yet.\n  Judge Gonzales is quite literally from humble beginnings. He was \nraised in the town of Humble, with seven siblings. The eight of them, \nand their mom and dad, lived in a small two-bedroom house that Judge \nGonzales's father and uncles built from scratch.\n  Judge Gonzales's parents were both migrant workers of Mexican \ndescent. They met while picking crops in the fields of south Texas. \nBoth spoke little English, and had only 8 years of schooling between \nthem. The house they raised Al in had no hot water or telephone.\n  But by teaching their gifted young son the value of perseverance and \nhard work, Pablo and Maria Gonzales raised a man who has been one of \nthe most trusted advisors to the President of the United States.\n  Judge Gonzales got his first job when he was 12. He sold Cokes at \nRice University football games. No one in his family had ever gone to \ncollege, and at that age Al didn't expect to either. When each football \ngame ended, and the Rice students streamed out of the gates and back to \ntheir dorms, Al wondered about the world of education they were going \nback to.\n  He graduated from MacArthur Senior High School, a Houston public \nschool, after challenging himself in college preparatory classes. He \nenlisted in the Air Force and was stationed north of the Arctic Circle \nat Fort Yukon, AK.\n\n[[Page S924]]\n\nThose North Pole winds must have been a lot colder than anything he \never felt in Texas. It was probably a shock to young Al.\n  At the urging of his officers, Judge Gonzales applied and was \naccepted into the United States Air Force Academy. Our armed services \nare superb at finding and grooming talented Americans, and they \nsucceeded again by pushing Judge Gonzales to the fore.\n  And then, in one of the moments where life begins to come full \ncircle, Al transferred from the Air Force Academy to the very \nprestigious Rice University--the same Rice University where he had sold \nCokes at football games as a boy. He fulfilled his 10-year dream of \nattending his hometown's preeminent institution.\n  He excelled at Rice and immediately entered Harvard Law School. \nBefore the ink on his Harvard Law diploma was dry, he was recruited by \nthe number-one law firm in Houston, one of the most esteemed firms in \nthe Nation.\n  Judge Gonzales built himself from very modest beginnings to become \none of the most distinguished attorneys in the country. A lot of us \nhere are lawyers. We can tell the good ones from the mediocre ones, and \nJudge Gonzales is one of the best.\n  He could have stayed a highly paid Houston attorney. But he has \nanswered the call to serve his country. Not just once, but again and \nagain.\n  First he served as General Counsel to Governor Bush in Texas. Then \nthe Governor appointed him as Texas's Secretary of State. Next, he was \nselected as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Texas. Then, he was asked \nto serve as Counsel to the President. Now he has been selected to be \nthe 80th Attorney General of the United States--the first Hispanic-\nAmerican to be the Nation's top law-enforcement officer.\n  But some in this body have made it clear they don't care about Judge \nGonzales's exemplary record of service.\n  I want to rebut some galling allegations a few of my Democratic \nfriends have made about Judge Gonzales. For instance, that he supports \ntorture. I even saw one outrageous ad that juxtaposed Judge Gonzales's \nface with a picture of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib. Attempts to tar \nJudge Gonzales with this dirty brush are despicable.\n  Let me be clear: Judge Gonzales, President Bush, and the \nadministration have never supported torture or the inhumane treatment \nof terrorist prisoners. Never.\n  Anybody who tries to tie Judge Gonzales to the depraved acts of a few \ntwisted renegades ought to be ashamed.\n  Judge Gonzales has stated repeatedly that he does not support \ntorture. He has stated repeatedly that no matter the answer to the \nquestion of whether al-Qaida terrorists deserve the privileges accorded \nto lawful combatants under the Geneva Conventions, it is the policy of \nthis President that every prisoner will be treated humanely. And he has \nbeen repeating this long before he was the Attorney General nominee.\n  I am very disappointed that some of my colleagues refuse to \nacknowledge the frightening situation that President Bush faced after \nSeptember 11. That a determined gang of terrorists could so easily kill \n3,000 Americans. That many more terrorist cells may be poised to \nstrike. Were our schools, our sports stadiums, our city halls safe? \nEven the postal system couldn't be trusted.\n  In that environment, Judge Gonzales aggressively explored every \npossible lawful means of gaining information about the terrorists, and \ntheir plots to murder innocent Americans. He was absolutely right to do \nso. He was fighting on behalf of his client, the United States of \nAmerica. With the lives of his countrymen at stake, any less would have \nbeen a dereliction of duty.\n  Judge Gonzales doesn't owe anybody an apology for his record. But \nsome owe him an apology, for rimracking him with phony allegations \ninstead of honoring his willingness to serve his country.\n  Some have also criticized Judge Gonzales for supposedly not being \nsufficiently forthcoming with answers to questions from the Judiciary \nCommittee. This is demonstrably untrue: Judge Gonzales has been \nextremely cooperative, and he has been asked far more questions than \nother Attorney General nominees in recent memory.\n  Judge Gonzales answered every question put to him at the committee's \nhearing, and then received hundreds of written questions afterward. \nWithin days, he returned to the committee over 440 responses. I repeat: \nWithin days, he returned to the committee over 440 responses. Then the \ncommittee asked Judge Gonzales even more questions, despite the fact \nthat the deadline for questions imposed by the chairman had already \npassed. And still, Judge Gonzales graciously provided an additional 54 \nresponses to every question that the Judiciary Committee could think \nof.\n\n  By contrast, Attorney General Janet Reno got only 35 questions from \nthe Judiciary Committee in 1993. And records show she responded a \nwhopping 9 months after she was confirmed. Let me repeat that. Janet \nReno got 35 questions from the Judiciary Committee in 1993, and records \nshow she responded 9 months after she was confirmed. I wish I had that \nplan when it came time to pay my bills.\n  Even the New York Times made the right call when it admitted Judge \nGonzales has been very forthcoming. From January 19 of this year:\n\n       His written responses totalling more than 200 pages on \n     torture and other questions . . . offered one of the \n     administration's most expansive statements of its position on \n     a variety of issues.\n\n  That is the New York Times, not exactly a bastion of conservative or \nRepublican supporters.\n  The position of the Attorney General, as we know, is a position of \nvery high trust. After the President, he is the supreme law enforcement \nofficer in the land. Like the President, he is charged with defending \nthe Constitution. The office is reserved for those of great character. \nI don't have any doubt that Alberto Gonzales will fight to protect this \ncountry from terrorists with every bit of his power, while guarding the \ncivil rights of every single American.\n  In short, he is supremely qualified to be the next Attorney General \nof the United States. I look forward to giving him my vote, and I am \nconfident a vast majority of the Senate will, as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Kentucky for \nhis excellent remarks, which I heard in my office, and the wrap-up I \nheard here. I congratulate all who have come forward in support of \nJudge Gonzales for their excellent statements and, I am prompted to \nsay, in his defense.\n  It is a sad situation that a man of his integrity, of his \naccomplishments, of his skills, of his background, has to be defended \nin the Senate. This discussion we have had in committee and in the \nSenate is further evidence that the system of bringing not just \nAttorney General nominees but judicial nominees and other nominees--\nSecretary of State--has some serious problems. We have allowed the \npartisan politics to enter into some of these debates and discussions \nwhen we should be looking at the qualifications of the person, the \nintegrity of the person, the skills of the person, the trustworthiness \nof the person, and whether they can do and execute the jobs faithfully.\n  Judge Gonzales has shown throughout his career, whether in his career \nas a lawyer, whether in his career as a counsel to the Governor, \nwhether in his career as supreme court justice and elected official in \nthe State of Texas, secretary of state, he has shown the highest degree \nof integrity and the skills necessary to do the job. He has proven to \nbe trustworthy when given authority, taking that authority seriously \nand handling it with great responsibility.\n  I personally have worked with him on many occasions, and in some very \ndifficult situations, and I have always found him to be completely \nforthright, brutally honest--in some cases telling me things I did not \nwant to hear but always forthright, always honest, sincere, serious. \nThis is a serious man who takes the responsibilities that have been \ngiven to him as a great privilege and a great honor which he holds very \ncarefully and gently in his hands.\n  There is a wonderful spirit in this man of understanding the \npositions he has held, certainly the position he holds now as Counsel \nto the President, and the awesome responsibility that\n\n[[Page S925]]\n\ncomes with that. He has never given me any indication in any dealings I \nhave had with him that he would do anything but faithfully execute his \nduties to the President and to the country, first and foremost.\n  Knowing the man--he is not a friend; I don't know him socially--\nhaving dealt with him on many occasions in my time in the Senate, to \nsee this man being portrayed as someone who would condone torture in \nspite of all the statements to the contrary, someone who would not \nfaithfully execute the laws of this country despite endorsements from \nevery law enforcement agency there is out there--not just endorsements \nbut glowing endorsements from law enforcement agencies and \nprosecutors--to see this man's integrity questioned, his forthrightness \nquestioned, is a sad commentary on the questioners because this man's \nhistory, this man's record of service for the State of Texas and this \nGovernment is spectacular, as was Dr. Rice's service.\n  The sad part of this is that ultimately it is less about the \nindividual and more about the politics. More and more we see that. We \nsaw that last session of Congress with judicial nominations where it \nwas more about the politics, the partisanship, than about the \nindividual. Looking from afar and observing the political scene, as \nmany people do in America, we see that, and that is just part of the \ngame. Everyone is making their points when they have the opportunity \nand trying to drive the message. Maybe I can understand that a few \nmonths before an election, if you want to drive a pledge and position \nyourself on the wedge issues.\n\n  It is the first week of February. It is 3 months after the last \nelection. Don't you think we can take a little time around here to \ntreat people decently, people who serve this country well and have been \nrole models and examples? Dr. Rice, Judge Gonzales--what two better \nstories in America of people who have achieved, from very humble \nbeginnings, achieved at the highest level, and then to be treated as \npartisan pawns in this political process barely 3 months after an \nelection. The Senate deserves better than that. More importantly, these \nare individuals. We are not debating a bill. This is not a piece of \npaper with words on it. If we say this language is bad or that language \nis bad, that is one thing. But to impugn the character of individuals, \nwhen you go after someone on a personal basis, when you say things and \naccuse people of things that are not supported by any of the evidence \nout there, and you do so principally not because you believe this \nperson actually holds those characteristics but you do so for a grander \npolitical motivation, I argue that is something the Senate should not \ncondone, and hopefully today we will see the votes in the Senate in a \nvery strong and overwhelming bipartisan fashion.\n  There are a lot of people I commend on the other side of the aisle \nwho have stood and spoken of their own experiences with this man. They \nhave spoken about their review of the record and the facts and have \ngiven this extremely qualified nominee their support. It shows there \nare some on that side of the aisle who still are positioning themselves \nas if we are in the last week of October of last year instead of beyond \nthat and moving on to try to do something that is positive for the \nfuture of our country.\n  I would argue Alberto Gonzales is going to be a great, positive \ncontribution to the war on terror, to the crime-fighting obligation \nthat he will have, to the integrity of our laws in this country. There \nis no question in my mind he will faithfully uphold the Constitution of \nthe United States, and he will serve with great honor and distinction. \nIt is my pleasure to speak in support of him.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as I understand it, there are several \nminutes left for the majority at this particular moment. I inquire if I \ncould begin my remarks--I think it has been agreed that I will be the \nfirst speaker on the minority side--and reserve whatever time the \nmajority has for some point later so they do not lose their time. I ask \nunanimous consent that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise, late this morning, to speak on the \nnomination of Alberto Gonzales to serve as the Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  I would, as an initial matter, note that I know one of our colleagues \ncame to the floor yesterday and spoke some words in Spanish in support \nof this nomination. And as someone who speaks Spanish, I was urged by \nsome of my colleagues to do the same. I would not want to complicate \nthe life of our reporters here. It is hard enough to understand us in \nEnglish from time to time, and doing so in Spanish might make things \nmore difficult.\n  I take great pride in the fact that I lived in a Spanish-speaking \ncountry as a Peace Corps volunteer, and that I have been a long-time \nmember of the Senate subcommittee that concerns itself with Latin \nAmerica. I understand this nomination is certainly a matter of ethnic \npride to many. I understand that. But I would further suggest that to \nconsider this nomination as only or even principally as a matter of \nethnic pride does a disservice to the Latino, the Hispanic community. \nAs far as I can tell, members of that community are no different than \npeople throughout our great Nation. They want to know not only who you \nare and what you are, but also what you think and what you believe in. \nThey want to know if a person nominated to be this Nation's chief law \nenforcement officer will uphold the rule of law.\n  The outcome of this nomination at this hour is not in doubt. It \nappears quite likely, if not altogether certain, that Mr. Gonzales will \nbe confirmed by the Senate of the United States as our country's next \nAttorney General. So what I am about to say is of little, if any, \nconsequence to the ultimate outcome of this particular nomination. If, \nin fact, this nominee is confirmed, I hope what I have to say might \nhave some impact on his thinking as he assumes this office.\n  I have asked for time to participate in this debate because of the \nimportant questions that this nomination raises, for not only this body \nbut for our Nation. I thank the two leaders for allotting time for a \nfull debate on these questions.\n  I am going to oppose this nomination. I say that with deep regret. \nLike all or nearly all of my colleagues, I had very high hopes for this \nnomination when it was first announced. When Mr. Gonzales was nominated \nfor this position several weeks ago, I didn't know a single Member who \nexpressed any intention to vote against this nominee. That is certainly \nthe case for this Senator. However, I also said at the time that I \nwould reserve an ultimate decision until after the nomination was \nconsidered by the Judiciary Committee and put before the full Senate.\n  In the interim, the committee chairman and ranking member have done a \ntremendous job of holding a careful, thorough, and substantive set of \nhearings. They have given members of the committee every opportunity to \nask questions of the nominee. Just as importantly, if not more, they \nhave given every opportunity to the nominee to answer those questions \nfully.\n  As many of my colleagues may know, particularly those with whom I \nhave served over the past almost quarter of a century, I have long \nadhered to the practice of according Presidents great deference in \ntheir nominations of term-limited appointees. Those who campaign for \nand win the highest office in our land deserve to name their team to \nthe President's Cabinet. Accordingly, my standard of review for \nnominations such as this is different than it is for lifetime \nappointments.\n  There are two basic questions that must be answered. First, does the \nnominee have the personal qualities required to discharge the duties of \nthe office to which he or she has been nominated? And secondly, has the \nnominee demonstrated an understanding of the duties that he or she will \nbe required to discharge if confirmed?\n  Based on that standard of review and only that standard, I have \nsupported overwhelmingly a number of Cabinet appointees during the \nquarter of a century I have served in this body. That\n\n[[Page S926]]\n\nincludes nominees of this President, including the current Attorney \nGeneral, as many of my colleagues may recall 4 years ago. It also \nincludes nominees proposed by Presidents and opposed by a majority of \nmembers of my own party, including, in at least one instance, a nominee \nopposed by a majority of the Senate. But I have, on rare occasions, \nless than five in my 24 years here, through all five Presidents during \nthat time, opposed only a handful of Cabinet nominees, including \nnominees supported by the majority of Members of the Senate and a \nmajority of members of my own party.\n  There is no question that this nominee possesses a number of \nadmirable personal qualities. He has demonstrated considerable \nintellectual ability. He is an experienced and accomplished attorney. \nHe has by all indications been a responsible member of his profession. \nAnd he has demonstrated commitment to public service. Like our \ncolleagues, I have been deeply impressed with his proud family history.\n  But this nomination is not simply about Alberto Gonzales's impressive \npersonal qualities. If it were, then he would be unanimously confirmed. \nWhat is at stake is whether he has demonstrated to the Senate that he \nwill discharge the duties of the office to which he has been nominated, \nspecifically whether he will enforce the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States and uphold the values upon which those laws are based.\n\n  Regrettably and disturbingly, in my view, Alberto Gonzales has fallen \nshort of meeting this most basic and fundamental standard. Let me \nexplain why I take this position for two reasons: One, because in a \nnation founded on the principle of human freedom and dignity, he has \nendorsed, unfortunately, the position that torture can be permissible. \nAnd two, in a nation dedicated to the proposition that all are equal \nand none is above the law, he has suggested that the President of the \nUnited States, acting as Commander in Chief, has the right to act in \nviolation of the laws and treaties prohibiting torture and may \nauthorize subordinates to do the same. I will address briefly each of \nthese issues in turn.\n  The issue of torture is relatively straightforward. Is it acceptable \nfor the United States of America ever to effect or permit the torture \nor cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment of human beings? The \nConstitution clearly says no. The eighth amendment explicitly prohibits \n``cruel and unusual punishments.'' The Geneva Conventions say no. They \nprohibit the torture and abuse of detainees and prisoners of war.\n  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights says no. Article 5 states:\n\n       No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman \n     or degrading treatment or punishment.\n\n  The International Convention Against Torture also says no to torture. \nThis document, signed by President Reagan, supported by former \nPresident Bush, and approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nunder Chairman Helms with a unanimous committee decision, says:\n\n       No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of \n     war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any \n     other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification for \n     torture.\n\n  Lastly, the Army Field Manual says no to torture as well. This manual \ncontains the knowledge, insight, and wisdom gathered by American \nsoldiers over decades of hard experience.\n  It says:\n\n       U.S. policy expressly prohibit[s] acts of violence or \n     intimidation, including physical or mental torture, threats, \n     insults, or exposure to inhumane treatment as a means of or \n     to aid interrogation.\n\n  So this document, relied on for decades by U.S. military personnel in \nthe theater of war to protect their lives and to do their duty, \nexpressly prohibits torture. Why? Because, to again quote from the Army \nField Manual:\n\n       The use of torture is a poor technique that yields \n     unreliable results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, \n     and can induce the source to say what he thinks the \n     interrogator wants to hear. . . . It also may place U.S. and \n     allied personnel in enemy hands at greater risk.\n\n  From the very earliest days of our Republic, the right to be free \nfrom torture has been a fundamental value of our Nation. Other values \nand rights have evolved or been won by the deprived and dispossessed: \nthe emancipation of slaves, civil and voting rights for racial and \nethnic minorities, equal rights for women, the right of privacy, just \nto name a few. But the right to be free from torture or similar \ntreatment has never been in doubt, has never been seriously debated in \nour Nation. It has always been considered intrinsic to a nation such as \nours, founded, as it is, upon the belief that all people are endowed \nwith certain inalienable rights.\n  Yet, unfortunately, this nominee has in crucial aspects stood against \nthe overwhelming and unequivocal weight of precedent and principle. \nHe has instead stood on the side of policies that are in direct \nconflict with the laws, treaties, and military practices that have long \nguided our Nation and its citizenry. Moreover, the record strongly \nsuggests that he, in fact, helped shape those policies to the great \ndetriment of our Nation's moral standing in the world.\n\n  Indeed, as the White House Counsel, he is one of the chief architects \nof those policies. Let me review the record.\n  In January of 2002, Mr. Gonzales wrote a memorandum to the President \nof the United States regarding the applicability of the Geneva \nConventions to the conflict in Afghanistan. He concedes in the memo \nthat:\n\n       Since the Geneva Conventions were concluded in 1949, the \n     United States has never denied their applicability to either \n     the United States or opposing forces engaged in armed \n     conflict, despite several opportunities to do so.\n\n  But then Mr. Gonzales argues that the war on terror presents a ``new \nparadigm [that] renders obsolete Geneva's strict limitations on \nquestioning of enemy prisoners.'' He urged a blanket exclusion of the \nAfghanistan war from the Geneva Conventions.\n  This position was strenuously opposed by Secretary of State Colin \nPowell. Powell pointed out:\n\n       It will reverse over a century of U.S. policy and practice \n     in supporting the Geneva Conventions and undermine the \n     protections of the rule of law for our troops, both in the \n     specific conflict and in general.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       It will [also] undermine public support among critical \n     allies, making military cooperation far more difficult to \n     sustain.\n\n  Secretary Powell's legal adviser added that Mr. Gonzales's view that \nGeneva did not apply to Afghanistan was inconsistent with the plain \nlanguage of the treaty, the unbroken practice of the United States over \nthe previous half century, the practice of all other parties to the \nConventions, and the terms of the U.N. Security Council resolution \nauthorizing the intervention in Afghanistan.\n  Ultimately, in February 2002, President Bush ordered that all \ndetainees captured by U.S. forces be treated in ``a manner consistent \nwith'' the Geneva Conventions. But it has been pointed out that the \ntreatment of detainees at places such as Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo \nraised questions about whether this order was effective in actually \naccording detainees the protections of the Geneva Conventions.\n  What is most troubling to this Senator is that Mr. Gonzales argued \nfor a view of the Geneva Conventions that was inconsistent with \nAmerican law, American values, and America's self-interests.\n  Nor was this an isolated event. This administration's policy on \ntorture was largely established in August of 2002. At that time, a \nmemorandum regarding standards of conduct of interrogations was \nprepared at Mr. Gonzales's request by the Justice Department Office of \nLegal Counsel. This memorandum was accepted by the administration as \npolicy until December 2004, when it was repudiated, at least in part, \nby the Justice Department on the eve of Mr. Gonzales's nomination \nhearing. The memorandum is 50 pages long. I will not dwell on it. \nOthers among our colleagues have already thoroughly discussed it. I \nwill only touch on two aspects of it.\n  One is its novel and absurdly narrow definition of torture. The only \nconduct it recognizes as torture is where the interrogator has the \nprecise objective of inflicting ``physical pain . . . equivalent in \nintensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as \norgan failure, impairment of bodily function, or death.'' Any other \nconduct implicitly would not, as defined by this document, constitute \ntorture--and thus would be allowed.\n\n[[Page S927]]\n\n  Mr. President, this is a truly stunning and offensive reading of the \nlaw, not to mention plain English. It twists and contorts the meaning \nof the word ``torture''--so much so that the word is drained of any \nmeaning whatsoever.\n  It would allow all manner of mistreatment, including the acts of \nbrutality and degradation committed by Americans against Iraqis in \nplaces like Abu Ghraib prison. Incredibly, it would even excuse the \nbeatings, rapes, burnings, and deprivations of food and water \nperpetrated at the behest of Saddam Hussein himself.\n  A second aspect of this memorandum that deserves mention is its \ndiscussion of the powers of the President of the United States when \nacting as Commander in Chief. The memorandum says that the criminal \nprohibition against torture ``does not apply to the President's \ndetention and interrogation of enemy combatants pursuant to its \nCommander in Chief authority.'' Under this reasoning, executive branch \nofficials can escape prosecution for torture if ``they were carrying \nout the President's Commander in Chief powers.''\n  Here again, this legal reasoning is stunning in its implications. It \nsuggests that an American acting on behalf of the United States of \nAmerica can commit heinous acts of torture without the slightest fear \nof prosecution. All he or she needs to do to avoid sanction is to show \nthat he or she was ``just following orders.'' Whether the law prohibits \ntorture is of no consequence. The President and anyone acting under his \nauthority are in effect above the law.\n  This memorandum has been rightly condemned by legal experts. One is \nHarold Koh, a professor of law at Yale Law School. He served in the \nReagan Justice Department and the Clinton State Department. In \ntestimony before the Judiciary Committee last month, he called the \nAugust 2002 memorandum ``perhaps the most clearly erroneous legal \nopinion that I have ever read,'' and ``a stain upon our law and our \nnational reputation.''\n  Yet while condemned as beyond the pale of American law and American \nvalues, these ideas were accepted and even embraced by the nominee to \nbecome the Attorney General of the United States of America. There is \nno evidence in the record that he even questioned them, much less \ndisagreed with them. Apparently, he had them shared with the Department \nof Defense.\n  At his confirmation hearing, Senator Leahy asked Mr. Gonzales whether \nhe agreed with the memorandum's legal reasoning on the issue of \ntorture. Mr. Gonzales replied, ``I don't have a disagreement with its \nconclusions.''\n  Our colleague, Senator Kohl from Wisconsin, asked if the nominee \nagreed with Attorney General Ashcroft's statement that he does not \nbelieve in torture because it doesn't produce anything of value. The \nnominee replied, ``I don't have a way of reaching a conclusion of \nthat.''\n\n  Don't have a way of reaching a conclusion? Mr. President, that is an \nastounding admission for someone seeking to become the Nation's top law \nenforcement officer. If he cannot reach a conclusion about the \nillegality or immorality of torture, what can he reach a conclusion \nabout? What other legal principles are open to similar legal \nevisceration and repeal? What does it say about our Nation's commitment \nto the rule of law that this nominee will not say torture is against \nthe law? What does it say about our Nation's commitment to equal \njustice under the law that this nominee would have the President and \nhis subordinates be above the law?\n  How do we explain this to the citizenry of our Nation, to the \ncitizenry of other nations, particularly our allies, and most \nespecially to the citizens of tomorrow, our young people who will \ninherit this country as we leave it to them? Will we tell them that \ntorture is wrong--unless the President orders it? Will we teach them \nthat America stands for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--\ndepending upon who you are?\n  Almost 60 years ago, this very day, the first allied forces liberated \nthe condemned people of Auschwitz. On that day, the full horror of the \nNazi genocide was laid bare, and all doubt about it was laid to rest.\n  Within weeks of that event, my father and a group of other attorneys \nin this country were on a plane to a place called Nuremberg, Germany. \nThere, he, along with others from our allies, began what would perhaps \nbe the most formative experience of my father's professional life at \nthat time: serving as executive trial counsel at the trials of Nazi war \ncriminals.\n  At that time, there were loud calls against trying the Nazi leaders. \nMany called not for due process of law, but for summary executions. In \nfact, Winston Churchill, a person we revered, who had great values, \nstrongly suggested that summary executions would be the way to deal \nwith the people responsible for the incineration of 6 million Jews and \n5 million other civilians, not to mention the millions of combatants \nwho lost their lives as a result of Nazi terror.\n  Yet the United States stood up for something different 60 years ago, \nin the summer of 1945 through the fall of 1946. As members of the \nallied powers, we insisted that the rule of law, rather than the rule \nof the mob, would rule. Even these most despicable and depraved human \nbeings were given an opportunity to retain counsel and to testify in \ntheir own defense.\n  We were different. It did not depend on who the enemy was. It \ndepended on what we stood for. If we begin to tailor our values and \nprinciples based on who our adversaries are, what do these laws mean? \nWhat do these bedrock principles stand for, if we can tailor them based \non who we look across a battle line at? You cannot do that if you \nbelieve in these principles.\n  At that moment in history, the world learned something very important \nabout the United States of America. It learned that this Nation would \nnot tailor its eternal principles to the conflict of the moment. It \nlearned that, as far as the United States of America is concerned, even \nthe mightiest cannot escape the long arm of justice. And it learned \nthat our Nation will recognize the words ``I was just following \norders'' for what they really are--a cowardly excuse, which has no \nplace in a nation of free men and women.\n  Mr. President, as I said, the outcome of this nomination is in little \ndoubt at this hour. I understand that. My argument is not going to \npersuade anybody to vote differently. I want to be on the record saying \nthat there have been only a handful--two or three cases in 24 years--\nwhere I have stood in the Chamber to oppose a Cabinet nominee. I \nsupported and voted for the nominations of John Ashcroft and John \nTower. My colleagues who served with me know that I generally believe \nthat Presidents deserve to have their Cabinets--except in rare \ncircumstances.\n  While I admire the personal story of this nominee, when he walks away \nfrom these critical principles, I cannot in good conscience give my \nvote to him to be Attorney General of the United States--the chief law \nenforcer of our country--when I know how important the rule of law is \nto this country, its history, and our reputation.\n  As I said earlier, the outcome of the nomination is not in doubt. I \ndo not expect that the nominee in question is paying attention to these \nproceedings or what I have to say. But I hope Mr. Gonzales will pay \nheed to the lessons of history, if not to this Senator. In his second \nState of the Union Address, Abraham Lincoln said that in giving or \ndenying freedom to slaves, ``We shall nobly save or meanly lose the \nlast, best hope of earth.''\n  The issue then was how our Nation treats the enslaved. The issue \ntoday is, in some respects, no less profound: how our Nation treats its \nenemies and captives, including those in places such as Abu Ghraib \nprison and Guantanamo Bay.\n  By treating them according to our standards, not theirs--our \nstandards, not theirs--we feed the flame of liberty and justice that \nhas rightly led our Nation on its journey over these past two and a \nquarter centuries.\n  I strongly oppose this nomination, and I hope the President will come \nup with a better choice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, a few days ago, the world watched as the \nseeds of democracy began to take root in Iraq. As a result of the sheer \ncourage of the Iraqi people and the untold sacrifices of American \nsoldiers, the success of the elections showed just how\n\n[[Page S928]]\n\nfar people will go to achieve self-government and rule of law.\n  As Americans, we can take enormous pride in the fact that this kind \nof courage has been inspired by our own struggle for freedom, by the \ntradition of democratic law secured by our forefathers and enshrined in \nour Constitution. It is a tradition that says all men are created equal \nunder the law and that no one is above it.\n  That is why even within the executive branch there is an office \ndedicated to enforcing the law of the land and applying it to people \nand to Presidents alike.\n  In this sense, the Attorney General is not like the other Cabinet \nposts. Unlike the Secretary of State, who is the public face of the \nPresident's foreign policy, or the Secretary of Education, whose job it \nis to carry out the President's education policy, the Attorney \nGeneral's job is not just to enforce the President's laws, it is to \ntell the President what the law is. The job is not simply to facilitate \nthe President's power, it is to speak truth to that power as well.\n  The job is to protect and defend the laws of freedoms for which so \nmany have sacrificed so much.\n  The President is not the Attorney General's client; the people are. \nAnd so the true test of an Attorney General nominee is whether that \nperson is ready to put the Constitution of the people before the \npolitical agenda of the President. As such, I cannot approach this \nnomination for Attorney General the same way I approached that of \nSecretary of State Rice or Veterans Affairs Secretary Nicholson or any \nother Cabinet position. The standard is simply higher.\n\n  Like the previous speaker, Senator Dodd, I wanted to give Alberto \nGonzales the benefit of the doubt when we began this process. His story \nis inspiring, especially for so many of us--like me--who shared in \nachieving the American dream. I have no question that as White House \nCounsel, he has served his President and his country to the best of his \nability. But in my judgment, these positive qualities alone are not \nsufficient to warrant confirmation as the top law enforcement officer \nin the land.\n  I had hoped that during his hearings, Judge Gonzales would ease my \nconcerns about some of the legal advice he gave to the President, and I \nhad hoped he would prove that he has the ability to distance himself \nfrom his role as the President's lawyer so that he could perform his \nnew role as the people's lawyer.\n  Unfortunately, rather than full explanations during these hearings, I \nheard equivocation. Rather than independence, I heard an unyielding \ninsistence on protecting the President's prerogative.\n  I did not hear Judge Gonzales repudiate 2\\1/2\\ years of what appears \nto be official U.S. policy that has defined torture so narrowly that \nonly organ failure and death would qualify, a policy that he himself \nappears to have helped develop and at least has condoned.\n  Imagine that, if the entire world accepted the definition contained \nin the Department of Justice memos, we can only imagine what atrocities \nmight befall our American POWs. How in the world, without such basic \nconstraints, would we feel about sending our sons and daughters off to \nwar? How, if we are willing to rationalize torture through legalisms \nand semantics, can we claim to our children and the children of the \nworld that America is different and represents a higher moral standard?\n  This policy is not just a moral failure, it is a violation of half a \ncentury of international law. Yet while Judge Gonzales's job was White \nHouse Counsel, he said nothing to that effect to the President of the \nUnited States. He did not show an ability to speak with responsible \nmoral clarity then, and he has indicated that he still has no intention \nto speak such truths now.\n  During his recent testimony, he refused to refute a conclusion in the \ntorture memo which stated that the President has the power to override \nour laws when acting as Commander in Chief. Think about this. The \nNation's top law enforcement officer telling its most powerful citizen \nthat if the situation warrants, the President can break the law from \ntime to time.\n  The truth is, Mr. Gonzales has raised serious doubts about whether, \ngiven the choice between the Constitution and the President's political \nagenda, he would put our Constitution first. And that is why I simply \ncannot support his nomination for Attorney General.\n  I understand that Judge Gonzales will most likely be confirmed, and I \nlook forward to working with him in that new role. But I also hope that \nonce in office, he will take the lessons of this debate to heart.\n  Before serving in this distinguished body, I had the privilege of \nteaching law for 10 years at the University of Chicago. Among the \nbrilliant minds to leave that institution for Government service was a \nformer dean of the law school named Edward Levi, a man of impeccable \nintegrity who was committed to the rule of law before politics.\n  Edward Levi was chosen by President Ford to serve as Attorney General \nin the wake of Watergate. The President courageously chose to appoint \nhim not because Dean Levi was a yes man, not because he was a loyal \npolitical soldier, but so that he could restore the public's confidence \nin a badly damaged Justice Department, so that he could restore the \npublic's trust and the ability of our leaders to follow the law.\n  While he has raised serious doubts about his ability to follow this \nexample, Judge Gonzales can still choose to restore our trust. He can \nstill choose to put the Constitution first. I hope for our country's \nsake that he will, and part of the reason I am speaking in this Chamber \ntoday is to suggest three steps that he can take upon assuming his role \nthat would help restore that trust.\n  First, he can immediately repudiate the terror memos in question and \nensure that the Department of Defense is not using any of its \nrecommendations to craft interrogation policies.\n  Second, Judge Gonzales can restore the credibility of his former \nposition as legal counsel by appointing an independent-minded, \nuniversally respected lawyer to the post.\n  And third, he can provide this Congress regular detailed reports on \nhis efforts to live up to the President's stated zero tolerance policy \nwith respect to torture.\n  Today we are engaged in a deadly global struggle for those who would \nintimidate, torture, and murder people for exercising the most basic \nfreedoms. If we are to win this struggle and spread those freedoms, we \nmust keep our own moral compass pointed in a true direction. The \nAttorney General is one figure charged with doing this, but to do it \nwell, he must demonstrate a higher loyalty than just to the President. \nHe must demonstrate a loyalty to the ideals that inspire a nation and, \nhopefully, the world.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nPresident's nominee for Attorney General, Judge Alberto Gonzales. Judge \nGonzales is a gentleman whom I have had the opportunity to work with in \nhis role as counsel to President Bush. I have found him to be \nintelligent, steady, discreet, and honest in all our dealings. He is \nwell qualified to be Attorney General. One should look at someone's \nrecord of performance. He served with skill and integrity as an \neffective counsel to the President. He has served as a distinguished \njurist on the Supreme Court of Texas, as the 100th Secretary of State \nand chief elections officer in Texas and then as chief counsel to then-\nGovernor Bush.\n  People say he has a life story that is inspirational and then dismiss \nall of that. I say to my colleagues, if one looks at someone's \nbackground, how they were raised, their life experiences tell a great \ndeal about how a person is as an adult and as a leader with \nresponsibility.\n  Alberto Gonzales was one of eight children, born to parents who were \nmigrant workers. He was the first person to go to college in his \nfamily. He was a graduate of Rice University and Harvard Law School. He \nunequivocally has demonstrated that hard work and integrity will earn \ndividends no matter who one is in this country. He will not tolerate \ndiscrimination or limits on the ability of Americans to exercise their \nGod-given rights or restrain any citizen in their equal opportunities \nand due process in the law.\n\n[[Page S929]]\n\n  He was raised in the way of achieving those goals and achievements in \nlife that one aspires to regardless of one's race, ethnicity, or \nreligious beliefs. With any nominee, it seems there have to be a number \nof accusations that Senators and others will level against them, but I \nbelieve Mr. Gonzales has clearly, forcefully, and consistently made \nclear his position on a number of issues. In fact, he is one of the \nmost responsive nominees in recent history.\n  Judge Gonzales received hundreds of questions from 14 Senators who \nserve on the Judiciary Committee and one member not on that committee. \nWithin 3 days, Judge Gonzales provided the committee with over 440 \nresponses encompassing 221 single-spaced pages, in comparison to prior \nAttorney General nominees who received far fewer questions. Former \nAttorney General Janet Reno received only 35 questions for the record \nfrom five Senators. Records show that she responded to those questions \n9 months after the Senate confirmed her.\n  Even the New York Times took note of Judge Gonzales's responsiveness. \nIn a January 19, 2005, article, it stated:\n\n       His written responses totaling more than 200 pages on \n     torture and other questions . . . offered one of the \n     administration's most expansive statements of its positions \n     on a variety of issues, particularly regarding laws and \n     policies governing the CIA interrogation of terror suspects.\n\n  If this is an indication of how Judge Gonzales responds to his job as \nAttorney General, I am fully confident he will make an excellent and \nfair Attorney General.\n  Some will say he has not answered questions. Maybe they have not \nheard one of his many responses to this question about torture. But I \nthink his statement in the Judiciary Committee that he ``denounces \ntorture and if confirmed as Attorney General he will prosecute those \nwho engage in torture,'' says it all. Maybe he can say it 12 more times \nand maybe 1 or 2 more Senators might understand it, but that is the \nrecord.\n  There is obviously a relatively small number of people who oppose \nthis nomination, but there is a strong majority who support his \nnomination and from all sides, Republicans, Democrats, men and women \nfrom all ethnic groups. Henry Cisneros, former HUD Secretary under \nPresident Clinton, opined that he has voted only once for a Republican \nin his life and Judge Gonzales was that person. He felt confirming \nJudge Gonzales as Attorney General would be good for America because \n``he understands the realities many Americans still confront in their \nlives.''\n\n  Mr. Cisneros goes so far as to say:\n\n       As an American of Latino heritage, I also want to convey \n     the immense sense of pride that Latinos across the Nation \n     feel because of Judge Gonzales's nomination . . . to one of \n     the big four--State, Defense, Treasury and Justice. This is a \n     major breakthrough for Latinos, especially since it is so \n     important to have a person who understands the framework of \n     legal rights for all Americans as Attorney General.\n\n  Lynne Liberato, a self-proclaimed partisan Democrat and former \npresident of the State Bar of Texas and the Houston Bar Association, \nstated the first good result of President Bush's reelection was that he \nnominated Alberto Gonzales to become Attorney General and that the only \ndownside is he will not be nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court. She \ngoes on to opine that she can say with complete confidence he is a good \nman with a good heart.\n  Judge Gonzales's commitment to the betterment of America as a whole \nand its citizens has led to all sorts of accolades and awards. He has \nreceived many honors. In 2003, he was inducted into the Hispanic \nScholarship Fund Alumni Hall of Fame. The United States-Mexico Chamber \nof Commerce honored him for the Good Neighbor Award. He received \npresidential awards from the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the \nLeague of United Latin American Citizens. We should strongly support \nthe President's nomination of Judge Gonzales to become Attorney General \nof the United States. He is the embodiment of the American dream, a man \nof hard work, of legal sense and intellect, and that has lifted him to \nsome of the highest positions in our Nation.\n  I like the fact that the President has nominated people who are good \nrole models. I thought the fact that Dr. Rice had grown up in the \nsegregated South. She applied and educated herself to obviously hold a \nvery important position as Secretary of State--beyond her intellect and \ncapabilities, it is a great life story that should be something for \nyoung people to be inspired by. The same with Judge Gonzales to become \nAttorney General of the United States.\n  We have other heroes, such as our new Senator from Florida, Mel \nMartinez, a modern-day American dream coming from Castro's repressive \nCuba. All Senators should aspire to be role models, and to the extent \nthat people who have led the American dream, modern-day Horatio Algers \nstories should be an added plus to all their intellect, capabilities, \nand experiences.\n  I say to my colleagues: Adelante con Alberto Gonzales. Let's move \nforward with this nomination.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like the record to reflect that I \nnow have the privilege to speak to my colleagues with regard to the \nnomination of Alberto Gonzales to serve as U.S. Attorney General. I do \nso with a great sense of pride. I compliment our distinguished, strong \nPresident for having selected this outstanding American to serve in \nthis exceedingly important position.\n  Article II of the Constitution provides that the President:\n\n     . . . shall nominate, and by and with Advice and Consent of \n     the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the supreme Court, \n     and all other Officers of the United States. . . .\n\n  Thus the Constitution provides a role for both the President and the \nSenate in the process. And that is precisely what this August body is \nnow undertaking, their constitutional responsibilities of giving advice \nand consent of a President's nomination of a principal Cabinet officer.\n  In fulfilling the constitutional role of the Senate, I have tried \nthroughout my career to give fair and objective consideration to both \nRepublican and Democratic Presidential Cabinet level nominees. There \nare times when I have voted for nominees whom I, frankly, perhaps, if I \nhad been in the position, would have picked others. But the leader of \nthe opposition party, the President, in those instances chose those \nindividuals. I searched in my heart to find those qualifications which \nI felt justified the President's decision. I have no difficulty \nwhatsoever finding in my heart and knowledge more than adequate reasons \nto support this distinguished nominee.\n  His personal story is a compelling one. He was of seven children that \nwere raised in a two-bedroom household in Humble, TX, that his family \nbuilt and in which his mother still lives.\n  From these modest roots, Mr. Gonzales became the first in his family \nto go to college, graduating from Rice University and then later \ngraduating from Harvard law school.\n  Throughout his life, Alberto Gonzales has demonstrated a strong \ncommitment to public service, beginning with his service in the United \nStates Air Force between 1973 and 1975. Then, after a number of years \nin private practice at a Houston, TX law firm, Mr. Gonzales served as \nTexas' Secretary of State from 1997 to 1999. In 1999, he was appointed \nto serve as a Justice on the Supreme Court of Texas.\n  In 2001, Judge Gonzales left the Texas bench and was commissioned as \nCounsel to President Bush. In this capacity, I have had the opportunity \nto work with Judge Gonzales on a number of matters, particular matters \nrelated to the Department of Defense. I have come to know him as a \nconscientious, soft-spoken man with a brilliant legal mind.\n  While our next Attorney General will continue to face the unique \nchallenges that many in law enforcement have faced since September 11, \n2001, I am confident that Judge Gonzales will meet these challenges \nhead on with a respect for our Constitution, and the laws and \ntraditions of the United States.\n  I look forward to voting in support of Judge Gonzales's nomination \nand look forward to working with him on the challenges that lay ahead.\n  I say to those who have spoken in opposition, I respect that right \nand on the whole I feel this debate has been a good one, a proper one, \nand shortly we are going to vote. I am confident a strong majority of \nthe Senate will approve this distinguished American for this post.\n  I would like to talk about some personal experiences I have had with \nthis\n\n[[Page S930]]\n\ndistinguished nominee. I go back, with a sense of modesty in my humble \ncareer--I guess it was in the late 1950s and 1960s. I was privileged to \nbe an Assistant U.S. Attorney. I met literally the first Attorney \nGeneral I had ever met, having been summoned to his office with regard \nto some matters. I remember walking up into that vast chamber in the \nupper floors of the Department of Justice, and there was Bill Rogers, \nthe Attorney General of the United States under President Eisenhower. I \ngot to know him. As a matter of fact, he had a great deal to do with \ninfluencing me to remain in public office and I am everlastingly \ngrateful to him. In the ensuing years I had the privilege of working \nwith a classmate at the University of Virginia Law School. Although he \nwas a year or so ahead of me, that classmate, Robert Kennedy, later \nbecame Attorney General.\n  So I have been privileged through my modest career in public office \nto have had an association with many Attorneys General. What stands out \nin my mind about Alberto Gonzales is this interesting observation. When \nwe debate on this floor, as we are obligated to do, and do so often \nwith a sense of fairness, we talk about judicial temperament. In many \nrespects, you can go into the dictionaries and into the case studies, \nyou can look wherever you want and there isn't any precise definition \nof what judicial temperament is. But it is an essential quality of \nthose individuals who ascend to the bench.\n  I have had a number of meetings over the years with Judge Gonzales, \nsome in the White House. Often he would say, Senator, I will come to \nyour office. In addition, Judge Gonzales has always given me, and I am \nsure others in the Congress, the courtesy of promptly returning my \ntelephone calls. That is something sometimes members of the executive \nbranch don't do often with Members of Congress. But he returned the \ncalls and returned them promptly. Throughout my interactions with Judge \nGonzales, he always manifested to me in his mannerisms, the courtesies \nthat he extended to me, and I presume other Members of Congress, the \nquiet manner in which he would listen to your points of view, or \nexpress his point of view. To me, his thoughtfulness and the courtesy \nemulate the very essence of what judicial temperament should be and the \nqualities an Attorney General should have.\n\n  It is so important that I bring that forward because he is \ninstrumental in advising, and as Attorney General he will continue to \nbe instrumental in advising, the President of the United States with \nregard to his Constitutional power with respect to judicial and \nexecutive branch nominees. I often say, yes; the power, but it is a \nresponsibility that the Constitution places on the President to fill \nthe vacancies in the third branch of Government, the judicial branch.\n  I can't think of a more important framework of appointments than the \nmembers of the Federal judiciary. So often they continue in office long \nafter a President's term has been completed--or terms, as the case may \nbe--and expound upon interpretations of the law. They often continue \nsome of the goals for the President--not writing, hopefully, new law, \nwhich a jurist should not do, that is the function of the Congress, but \ninterpreting the law within the framework of the Constitution and the \nseveral statutes of our Government.\n  But this man, to me, stands out as one who brings a great sense of \ndignity, a great sense of inspiration, particularly to those in the \nDepartment of Justice who continue and come to serve. I am confident \nthat in his continuing interactions with the Congress of the United \nStates he will not change what I view as the extraordinary and, indeed, \nmagnificent manner in which he performs his duties, formally as chief \ncounsel to the President, and hopefully soon to be, with the advice and \nconsent of this distinguished body, as Attorney General of the United \nStates of America.\n  I wish him and his family well. I thank them for their continued \npublic service. I recount the other portions of my remarks today about \nhis extraordinary background. He overcame such impediments and hardship \nto receive and to be grateful for what this country offered to him and \nhis family by way of opportunities of education and public service.\n  This has been a very important moment in the history of the Senate as \nwe begin to give our advice and consent on an Attorney General, one who \nis imminently qualified and able to fulfill this office with that \ndegree of dignity and intellect, fairness, and firmness that is needed \nto serve our President, but most importantly to serve Congress and the \nNation.\n  We are a nation of laws. That separates us from so many other nations \nin the world. We believe in the fairness of the law as it relates to \nevery citizen--I repeat, every citizen.\n  I am proud to have the privilege to give these brief remarks on his \nbehalf and indicate my strong support. I hope I encourage others to \nlikewise support this important nomination.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise to also express my strong support \nfor the confirmation of Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  I would like to say to my colleague from Virginia, the senior Senator \nfrom Virginia, before he leaves, what a great honor it is for me to \nserve with him, to listen to his experience--his experience in this \nbody, his experience serving this country as Secretary of the Navy, and \nexperience which allows him to bring judgment on matters such as this.\n  I have also served under one President. If I have an opportunity to \nserve under a President of a different party, I want to bring the same \nkind of judgment here--judgment that the senior Senator from Virginia \nhas already talked about. It is not about politics. It is not about \nwhat jersey you wear. We have had an election. The President then gets \nto pick his team. We look at character, we look at intellect, we look \nat integrity, and all of those factors. That should be the judgment we \nbring every time.\n  That is what the senior Senator from Virginia, with his experience, \nhas brought to the table. I would like him to know that I intend to \nfollow that in my time here. I think it is the right standard.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am deeply humbled by the comments of the \nSenator. It has been a privilege. I have had an awful lot of good luck, \nand a lot of people have given me the wisdom and counsel in which I \nhave put together this modest career. I thank the Senator for his \nservice and I enjoy working with him.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I enjoyed the statement I heard the other \nday, that a pessimist is someone who complains when opportunity knocks. \nOpportunity is knocking--a unique opportunity to send a message that \nAmerica belongs to us all. It is a chance to prove that hard work and \ncharacter can take you wherever you want to go in this country, no \nmatter where you came from.\n  I urge my colleagues not to major in the minors today, and to take \nthis historic opportunity to confirm Alberto Gonzales by an \noverwhelming vote.\n  This is a land of opportunity--a place where anything can happen. It \nis a place where a Jewish kid from Brooklyn can grow up to be a Senator \nfrom Minnesota; a place where a young man from South Carolina takes on \na lot of responsibility at a young age to take care of his family and \nfinds himself presiding over the Senate; a place where success is not \ndefined by who your parents are or what they did or were able to do but \nhow hard you work. Judge Alberto Gonzales is such a person.\n  The son of migrant workers--we have heard the story again and again. \nI will repeat part of it--he grew up with seven siblings in a small \nhouse in Texas that his father built with his own two hands. As a \nchild, Mr. Gonzales often stood outside of Rice University football \ngames selling soft drinks to earn a few extra dollars. It was while \nstanding outside of one of those Rice football games that he promised \nhimself that he would one day attend that university and make the \nAmerican dream his own.\n  He not only graduated from Rice University, but he went on to attend \nHarvard Law School, and to eventually become the first Hispanic partner \nin a prestigious international law firm.\n  However, Mr. Gonzales's story does not end there. He chose to enter \npublic\n\n[[Page S931]]\n\nservice. He was general counsel to Governor Bush in Texas, served as \nsecretary of state in Texas, a member of the Texas Supreme Court, and \nfor the last 4 years served as chief counsel to President Bush.\n  Alberto Gonzales embodies the American dream, and he should be \nconfirmed for Attorney General.\n  I have served as an attorney myself. The Presiding Officer has had \nthat same honor, that same distinction. I was Solicitor General of the \nState of Minnesota and served 17 years in the attorney general's \noffice.\n  I can tell you from that experience that there are two types of \nlawyers. A good lawyer will tell you what the law is, while a lesser \nlawyer might be tempted to tell you what you might want it to say.\n  Mr. Gonzales is a good lawyer. And part of that controversy \nsurrounding his nomination comes from his strict interpretation of what \nthe law actually says, and not what some might want it to say.\n  According to article 4 of the 1949 Geneva Convention, only lawful \ncombatants are eligible for POW protection. When Mr. Gonzales \ndetermined that as a legal matter al-Qaida and the Taliban represented \nuncharted legal territory for which the Geneva Convention was never \nintended, he did his job as Counsel to the President.\n  In fact, the Red Cross, a world-respected humanitarian organization, \nstates that in order to earn POW status, combatants must be commanded \nby a person responsible for his subordinates, have a fixed distinctive \nsign recognizable at a distance, carry arms openly and conduct their \noperations in accordance with the laws and customs of war--\nqualifications that do not easily fit al-Qaida or the Taliban, do not \nfit at all.\n  Now, this is not to say al-Qaida fighters should not be treated \nhumanely, but only that Alberto Gonzales's interpretation of the \nconvention was well grounded in the letter of the law and strictly \nadhered to the structure and history of the convention.\n  Alberto Gonzales did what any good lawyer should have done. He \ninformed President Bush of the letter of the law. He did what is \nexpected of a good attorney.\n  I serve on the Homeland Security Governmental Affairs Committee. We \nwere in the process of hearing testimony yesterday from the new head \nand Secretary of Homeland Security, Judge Chertoff. Questions came up \nwith Judge Chertoff about a memo that defined torture. He was pressed \nbefore the committee about his definition. He came back and said he \nexercised his legal judgment to let people know that if you move \nforward in this area, which is not clear, you better be careful. He did \nwhat was expected of a good lawyer.\n  I note that his nomination was put forth from two Senators across the \naisle, both my friends, my Democrat colleague from New Jersey, standing \nside by side with Judge Chertoff, who did what a good lawyer should do, \nas Judge Gonzales has done.\n  I take a moment to remind my colleagues Article II, Section 2 of the \nConstitution states the President ``shall nominate, and by and with the \nAdvice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, or other \npublic Ministers and Counsels, Judges of the Supreme Court and all \nother offices of the United States . . . '' That provision creates a \nspecial responsibility for this body.\n  While the Constitution does not spell out the criteria by which \nMembers of the Senate determine whether to approve nominations, we can \nall agree our standards should be consistent, regardless of who is in \nthe White House. That is what the senior Senator of Virginia talked \nabout a while ago.\n  I have made it clear I do not believe it is appropriate for the \nSenate to use the nomination process as a referendum on the policies of \nthe administration. Our democratic system has a method for determining \nthe basic policy thrust of the President. It is called an election. \nThose who lose the election should not use the nomination process to \nrehash the issues the people have already decided. We went through this \nwith the nomination of Condoleezza Rice for Secretary of State. Some \nchose to rehash some of the issues that were before the public in the \nelection. The President has a right to appoint his team. Are they \ncompetent? Do they have integrity? Do they have the intellectual \ncapacity to do the job? The American people have heard the argument and \nmade their choice. It is time to move on.\n  The appropriate questions for the Senate are, Is the nominee \nqualified? Does the nominee have any ethical lapses in his or her \npublic record? And does he or she possess the necessary temperament to \nserve the Nation well? It would also do some of my colleagues well to \nremember the approval of the nominee is not the same as approving every \nposition the nominee has taken. Checks and balances remain after the \nadvice and consent. No matter what the outcome of the vote, we will \nstill maintain oversight of the Justice Department.\n  Thomas Edison once said:\n\n       Most people miss opportunity because it shows up in \n     overalls and is disguised as hard work.\n\n  Alberto Gonzales saw an opportunity and worked hard to capitalize on \nit. He makes me proud to be an American. He is an exceptional attorney \nand a good man and eminently qualified to be the top law enforcement \nofficer of the land. I enthusiastically support the nomination of \nAlberto Gonzales to be Attorney General of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent my half hour be \ndivided, with the first 10 minutes for myself, the second 10 minutes \nfor the Senator from Washington, and the third 10 minutes to the \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we are not voting today on just any \nappointment. We are voting today on a nominee to be Attorney General of \nthe United States, historically one of the most important positions of \npower in our Government. The position is more important today than it \nhas ever been as we wage the war on terror. At a time with \nunprecedented tension between the goals of security and liberty, we \nmust be absolutely certain the person we confirm as Attorney General is \nright for the job.\n  The Attorney General stands apart from all other Cabinet officers. \nFor those other Cabinet officers, simply carrying out the President's \nagenda is enough. The Attorney General, on the other hand, has to be \nsomeone who will follow the law, not just toe the party line. He must \nbe someone who will do justice for all people, not just push the \nPresident's program. There are many times that demand independence from \nthe President, when the Attorney General is asked, for instance, to \napprove a wiretap of an entire group. The Attorney General must make \nthat decision based on the law and the precedent, not on loyalty to the \nPresident. The Attorney General owes his ultimate loyalty to the law on \nmany of the decisions he makes, not to the person who nominated him.\n  There will be times when the legal weight of precedent is more \nimportant than the political weight of the President. That is the nub \nof why the Attorney General is not a typical Cabinet position. At such \ntimes the country needs an Attorney General who can stand the heat and \ndo the right thing.\n  Independence is not such a critical quality in other Cabinet \npositions. The position of Attorney General requires more neutrality \nand independence than, for example, the Secretary of State, whose \nobligation is to advance the President's interests abroad. We must be \nabsolutely sure that an Attorney General nominee not only has the right \nexperience but the right view of the proper role of an Attorney \nGeneral, to be an independent, nonpartisan chief enforcer of the laws.\n  For that reason, it is with great sadness and some heartache, because \nI so like and respect Judge Gonzales as a person and as an inspiration \nto so many, that I report I am unsure Judge Gonzales is the right man \nfor this crucial job.\n  As I have said before, Judge Gonzales has many impressive qualities. \nHe is a good person. He has impeccable legal qualifications. He has a \nbreadth of legal experience, including time as a lawyer, a judge, and a \nWhite House Counsel. And, of course, Judge Gonzales has the kind of \nHoratio Alger\n\n[[Page S932]]\n\nstory that makes us proud to be Americans. But excellent credentials \nand an inspiring story are not enough, not in these times. One must \nalso have the independence necessary to be the Nation's chief law \nenforcement officer.\n  When the White House asks the Justice Department for legal advice, on \nthe other hand, the Justice Department is charged with giving an \nobjective answer, not one tailored to achieve the President's goals. \nThe Attorney General is supposed to provide sound legal advice in many \nof the decisions he or she renders, not political cover. As I have said \nbefore, it is hard to be a straight shooter if you are a blind \nloyalist.\n\n  I like Judge Gonzales. I respect him. I think he is a genuinely good \nman. I was initially inclined to support his nomination. I also \nbelieved, and I said publicly, that Judge Gonzales was a much less \npolarizing Attorney General than Senator Ashcroft has been. As I also \nsaid, being less polarizing than John Ashcroft is not enough to get my \nvote.\n  There are two models for an Attorney General, loyalist and \nindependent. We know there are Attorneys General over the years who \nhave been close to the President. There is no better example than \nRobert F. Kennedy, who served his own brother. That said, no one ever \ndoubted in the confines of the Oval Office Bobby Kennedy would oppose \nhis brother if he thought the President was wrong. Judge Gonzales is \nmore of the loyalist type of Attorney General nominee than an \nindependent type of Attorney General nominee, which does not alone \ndisqualify him, but it raises serious questions.\n  After an extensive review of the record, unfortunately and sadly, \ndespite my great personal affection for the judge, his testimony before \nthis committee turned me around and changed my vote from yes to no. He \nwas so circumspect in his answers, so allied with the President's \nposition on every single issue, there was almost an eagerness to say, I \nwill do exactly what the President wants, that I worry Judge Gonzales \nwill be too willing to toe the party line even when the Attorney \nGeneral is supposed to be above party. The Attorney General and the \nPresident are not supposed to be peas in the pod but, in short, Judge \nGonzales still sees himself as chief counsel to the President rather \nthan as chief law enforcement officer in the land, a very different \ntype position.\n  Time and time again, this administration has gotten itself in trouble \nby going at it alone, by not seeking new opinions, by not reaching out, \nby doing things behind closed doors in the Justice Department, whether \nit was the total information awareness project, the TIPS Program, or \ntorture. This Justice Department has been burned by a curious \ncommitment to secrecy. I encouraged Judge Gonzales to be candid with \nthe committee when discussing these issues. I encouraged him to give us \nsome hope that he would run a very different Justice Department than \nJohn Ashcroft. But, unfortunately, even a cursory review of his \nanswers--and I reviewed them more than once--reveals strict adherence \nto the White House's line and not a scintilla of independence. If his \nanswers are any indication, once again, Judge Gonzales still sees \nhimself as White House Counsel rather than a nominee to be Attorney \nGeneral.\n\n  When push comes to shove, the Attorney General needs to stand up to \nthe White House. We live in critical times and face crucial tests. The \nage-old struggle between security and liberty, which defines so many of \nthe Founding Fathers' debates is alive and kicking. In fact, at no time \nsince the internment of Japanese citizens in World War II has it been \nmore relevant. We should have open debate about where the line should \nbe drawn. We should not be afraid to confront the difficult questions \nthat face us.\n  I have gotten in trouble with some of my friends on the left for \nsuggesting there should be a reexamination of how we interrogate terror \nsubjects. If a terrorist knew where a nuclear bomb was in an American \ncity, and it was about to go off in 30 minutes, my guess is everyone in \nthe room would say, do what it takes to find out. But we just cannot \nremake these rules behind closed doors.\n  Judge Gonzales's hearing was an opportunity for real debate on those \nissues. Instead, we got canned answers. I have great respect for the \njudge. The story of his life and the record of his achievements are \ninspirations to all of us. I am mindful of the fact that if he is \nconfirmed, as I anticipate he will be, Judge Gonzales will become the \nNation's first Hispanic Attorney General. It is a tremendous success \nstory that makes this vote even more difficult.\n  When I called Judge Gonzales, last week, to tell him how I would be \nvoting, it was one of the more painful phone calls I have had to make \nin a long time. He was understandably disappointed, but he was, as \nalways, a total gentleman. He assured me we would be working together \nto solve our Nation's problems. He assured me he would prove me wrong. \nI hope he does. But this is just too important a job at too critical a \ntime to have an Attorney General about whom I have such severe doubts. \nI really have no choice but to, with sadness, vote no.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWashington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, last week, I announced that I would \noppose the nomination of Alberto Gonzales to be the Attorney General. I \nshare many of the views on and reasons for opposing this nominee that \nmy other colleagues have detailed--among them, the very grave concerns \nraised about Judge Gonzales's role in producing the so-called ``torture \nmemos.''\n  But, I rise today to share with the Senate a reason for opposing this \nnominee that is particularly important to my home State of Washington. \nIt is a reason that has not gotten much attention, but it is an issue I \nwant to highlight because I feel Senators should know about it when \nthey cast their vote on this nominee.\n  Among the reasons I am opposing Mr. Gonzales is his connections to \nEnron and his failure to commit to recuse himself from the Department \nof Justice's ongoing Enron investigation.\n  The Attorney General of the United States, as the chief law \nenforcement officer in the land, holds a special independent place in \nthe government. After carefully listening to Judge Gonzales during his \nSenate hearings and reading his responses to questions, I do not have \nconfidence that a Justice Department under his leadership will conduct \nthe Enron investigations with sufficient vigor and independence.\n  We want our Attorney General to uphold the law no matter who the \ncriminal is no matter how politically inconvenient and no matter who \nasks for his advice.\n  This administration's ties to Enron are common knowledge. In \naudiotapes released last summer, we heard Enron traders bragging about \nEnron's status as the number one contributor to the President's \nelection campaign in 2000. We know that former Enron executives even \nhad a hand in bankrolling the President's Inaugural festivities last \nmonth. So I think it's important for my colleagues to also realize that \nJudge Gonzales himself also had substantial ties to Enron while he was \nan attorney in private practice and then a candidate for the Texas \nSupreme Court.\n  Given the significance of this case and the past recusal of the \noutgoing Attorney General, Judge Gonzales should have made clear his \nintention to recuse himself from that investigation. Let me repeat this \nimportant point. Attorney General Ashcroft knew to recuse himself \nbecause of similar political ties to Enron.\n  Before his confirmation, I wanted the same assurances from Gonzales, \nor at least an explanation of why these former professional and \npolitical ties to Enron do not constitute grounds for recusal. I got \nnone.\n  Let me make a few comments about the status of Federal investigations \ninto the Enron mess, and why I believe it is so troubling that Judge \nGonzales has to date refused to recuse himself from this matter.\n  It's my belief that, to date, the Department of Justice has done a \ngood job in pursuing the case against Enron. I stood on this floor \nabout seven months ago and applauded the work of the Enron Task Force \nwhen it handed down indictments of top executives including Ken Lay and \nJeff Skilling last summer.\n  And the U.S. Attorneys in Northern California have been equally \nsuccessful in bringing charges and securing guilty pleas from some of \nthe Enron traders\n\n[[Page S933]]\n\nimplicated in the conspiracy to manipulate our Western power markets.\n  But this investigation is not finished. The Enron investigation must \nbe allowed to proceed, free from any potential political interference \nfrom special interests, particularly the interests under investigation.\n  I would also note that we have not seen the same vigor--the same \npursuit of justice--by other departments and agencies within the \nAdministration, and in particular the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission. FERC is charged with protecting American consumers from \nprecisely the types of fraud Enron perpetrated in our Nation's energy \nmarkets.\n  FERC is also run by three Bush administration appointees who had ties \nto Enron. In fact, the Senate Government Affairs Committee uncovered \nEnron memos recommending their appointment to the White House.\n  To date, these FERC appointees have failed to take any meaningful \naction to provide the victims of Enron's power market manipulations \nwith any measure of relief. At every step of the way, it has taken \npublic embarrassment to get FERC to pursue an Enron investigation of \nany integrity. Or in the words of a November 2002 report by the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, ``Over and over again, FERC displayed a \nstriking lack of thoroughness and determination with respect to key \naspects of Enron's activities.'' Since then, the situation has only \ndeteriorated. FERC's Enron investigation to date has been marked by a \nlack of aggressive action.\n  In fact, I'm going back to my office in just a few minutes to \nparticipate in a conference call with officials from the Snohomish \nPublic Utility District in my home State of Washington. We are going to \nair publicly, for the first time, new Enron audiotapes. Shockingly, \nthese Enron tapes were just discovered sitting in one of Enron's \nHouston warehouses. They were left behind by the same Federal \nregulators that are supposed to be defending our Nation's consumers \nfrom the types of fraud Enron perpetrated in our energy markets.\n  Only a small portion of these new tapes have been processed.\n  But on these tapes, the American public will hear Enron employees \nduring the company's collapse bemoaning the fact they couldn't get \npromoted unless they ``cooked the books;'' speculating that ``everyone \nknew,'' and that ``nothing happened at Enron that Ken Lay didn't \nbless.'' This is evidence that was left behind.\n  New evidence will also show Enron traders fabricating excuses to shut \ndown a power plant--on the very same day that rolling blackouts hit \nCalifornia and disrupted the Western power market. The blackouts \naffected at least half a million people that day. As we learned with \nthe recent Northeast/Midwest blackout, these are serious matters. Not \nonly do blackouts cost hundreds of millions of dollars in lost economic \nactivity, they pose serious risks to human health and safety. They are \nno laughing matter. In my mind, this represents a whole new level of \ncallousness.\n  But what Enron did was not just disgraceful on a human level--it was \nalso illegal. It was a direct violation of power market rules and a \ndirect violation of a DOE emergency order issued by former Secretary \nBill Richardson the very same day.\n  And yet, our Federal agencies are not unearthing this new evidence. \nThe FERC remains content to sit on its hands, more than four years \nafter the Enron collapse. Utilities in the West are actually being sued \nby Enron for even more money. Yet FERC stands by, while Washington \nState ratepayers wait for the other shoe to drop.\n  The consumers in my State, in the States of Nevada and California, \ndeserve justice. But what they've gotten are years of process--a \nprocedural shell game.\n  We need more aggressive action from our Nation's top law-enforcement \nofficer.\n  This is why I was so deeply troubled to read Judge Gonzales's answers \nto questions posed by Members of the Judiciary Committee in this \nmatter. I want to thank my colleague, the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. \nFeingold, for asking these important questions. In his answers, Judge \nGonzales would not state whether he would recuse himself, and he would \nnot be specific about how his former ties to Enron might impact the \nDepartment of Justice's investigation of that company.\n  In his responses, Mr. Gonzales stated, ``I did some legal work for \nEnron over 10 years ago. I am told the work was totally unrelated to \nthe collapse of the company.'' He added that ``it would be premature \nfor me to commit to recuse myself from ongoing Enron prosecutions.''\n  Mr. Gonzales was clearly asked to provide more specificity, more \ndetails and more of a commitment on what Americans can expect from the \nJustice Department leadership on the Enron investigation. These answers \nof the nominee were not satisfactory.\n  I find this particularly troubling, given the fact Judge Gonzales has \na clear history of employment related and political ties to Enron, and \na track-record that leads me to question his judgment and his \nindependence from the President.\n  As I stated at the outset, we want our Attorney General to uphold the \nlaw no matter who the criminal is no matter how politically \ninconvenient--and no matter who asks for his advice.\n  So I will vote against Judge Gonzales's nomination today, for this \nand other important reasons. But I am also here to note that the \nFederal Enron investigation is not over. It is likely that Judge \nGonzales may be confirmed as Attorney General later today. Perhaps \nJudge Gonzales will recuse himself after he is confirmed.\n  But whatever his decision, I am here today to put Judge Gonzales on \nnotice. If there is any hint whatsoever that the Enron Task Force is \nbeing undermined, underfunded, or otherwise hindered, this Senator will \nnot stand for it. The Enron investigations must be allowed to proceed. \nAnd this Senator will be watching every single step of the way.\n  This Senate deserves straight answers from the President's nominees. \nCorporate criminals deserve to be prosecuted to the full extent of the \nlaw. And the victims of Enron's fraud in our Nation's power markets \ndeserve relief.\n  What Enron did to my constituents in Washington and to countless \nothers across the Nation was disgraceful.\n  Given these issues, I have substantial lingering questions about \nwhether Mr. Gonzales would exercise independent judgment, especially \nwhen a clear commitment to conduct investigations and uphold a strict \nstandard of conduct is needed.\n  I also have serious concerns about Judge Gonzales's legal judgment. \nAs White House Counsel, his office generated a legal opinion on whether \nthe President is bound by domestic and international law on torture, \nwhich the government recently repudiated as legally faulty.\n  Such a repudiation calls Judge Gonzales's judgment into question, \njudgment that is critically important for our country's top attorney. \nIt also suggests he is not independent of the President, which is \nessential for his new Cabinet role. Further, Judge Gonzales's changed \nposition on the torture memos in the weeks before his confirmation \nhearings appears to demonstrate political convenience, not a truly \nself-reflective change in his thinking on these matters.\n  Had Judge Gonzales recognized the serious problems with the judgments \nhe made on these issues and given convincing assurances that he \nunderstands that his new role will require a different approach and a \nnew allegiance to the law, I might have been convinced to defer to the \nPresident on this nomination. Without those assurances, and a clear \ncommitment to ensure that there is no appearance that the Justice \nDepartment may take a difference course on the Enron investigation, I \ncannot support his nomination to be the next Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  In conclusion, many of my colleagues have spoken about this \nnomination. They have talked about a variety of issues, and certainly \none of those issues is the independence of the Attorney General. That \nis clearly an issue that is at the forefront of my interest today.\n  The reason is because ongoing in the Department of Justice, and I \nwish ongoing in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, is an \ninvestigation of Enron and Enron fraud. This is an issue that Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft decided, when taking office--and the evidence started \nto pour in of market\n\n[[Page S934]]\n\nmanipulation--he basically looked at his record and background of \nhaving taken contributions from Enron and he recused himself from the \nEnron investigation and task force.\n  Now we have before us a new Attorney General nominee who not only has \naccepted campaign contributions from Enron, he actually worked to \nrepresent them at the law firm in his private practice, specifically \nworking for the Enron company as an outside counsel.\n  If our past Attorney General clearly identified a conflict of \ninterest and basically stepped aside to make sure he was not in any way \nunduly influencing the Enron investigation, why should not this nominee \nhave clearly done the same thing--in particular, giving answers to the \nJudiciary Committee that he would recuse himself?\n  I am not a member of the Judiciary Committee. I am a past member of \nthat committee, but I certainly asked my colleagues to submit questions \nto Judge Gonzales asking him if, in fact, he would recuse himself and \nto be explicit about any other ways in which he could ensure that this \nEnron investigation continued with its independence. Judge Gonzales \nwould not commit to recusing himself from this situation.\n  Because he will not recuse himself, I cannot, today, give him my vote \nknowing that he will achieve the independence this agency so much needs \nto have when it comes to this investigation.\n  Just today, this very day, Snohomish County PUD will be releasing new \ninformation, new audiotapes from Enron employees that just happened to \nbe left behind at the Enron Houston facility that investigators forgot \nto claim. These tapes actually have Enron employees discussing the fact \nthat superiors, Enron traders, had asked them to cook the books.\n  We also will see other tapes and information that basically says that \nvarious, what are called, cogeneration facilities, that Enron had \nbusiness relationships with, were actually asked to take generation \noffline, to come up with a scheme of why they should stop production of \nthese powerplants. The result was a blackout in California in the next \nfew days following this time period--something that is very troubling \nto us in the Northwest.\n  We have spent billions of dollars of economic impact, and we want an \ninvestigation to continue to take place. We want the independence that \nthe Federal Energy regulators should have in this case in determining \nthat just and reasonable rates have not been charged by Enron. We want \nthe Department of Justice to do its job, unfettered by any kind of \ninfluence, and continue to pursue all those involved with the Enron \ncase until justice is given and ratepayers have relief in the West.\n\n  So it is unfortunate that we cannot get Judge Gonzales to make a \ncommitment up front about where he is going to be in recusing himself \non this very important matter that has had great fiscal consequence to \nthe people of the Northwest.\n  I wish, given all the other aspects of this nomination, I could \noverlook this issue or other questions that some of my colleagues have \nbrought up, but I cannot.\n  As a young woman, when I first learned about our Attorney General, at \na time and era when a White House and President and outside influence \nsaid that the Attorney General should just follow the line of what was \nhappening in the White House, we had Attorneys General who decided, \ninstead of not carrying out the law, they were not going to be \ninfluenced by the White House; that they would rather resign than not \ncarry out the law. That is the kind of independence we want to see in \nan Attorney General.\n  The case is clear against Enron. The case for recusing himself is \nclear. Unfortunately, I cannot support the nomination of Alberto \nGonzales today because I am not sure he will recuse himself in this \ncase.\n  The ratepayers of Washington State need relief. We do not want to \ncontinue to have to be the policemen on the beat investigating this \ncase, finding new evidence, proving that wrongdoing has happened, \ncontinuing to prove how much we have been hurt. We want Federal \nregulators to do their job and give us relief.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Gonzales's written responses to \nJudiciary Committee questions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Ethical Issues\n\n       1. During your service as Justice of the Supreme Court of \n     Texas, it has been reported that you on occasion accepted \n     donations from parties interested in cases before you. For \n     example, in 2000, you reportedly accepted a $2,000 donation \n     from the Texas Farm Bureau, which ran the defendant insurance \n     company in Henson v. Texas Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance, in \n     the period between oral arguments and decision. You also \n     reportedly accepted a $2,500 donation from the law firm \n     defending the insurer in another case, Embrey v. Royal \n     Insurance, just before oral arguments.\n       a. Are these reports accurate:\n       Response: In Texas, the voters elect the Justices of the \n     Supreme Court. My contributors, as well as those of every \n     other Justice, are a matter of public record. I am confident \n     that during my service as a Justice on the Supreme Court of \n     Texas, I complied with all legal and ethical requirements \n     regarding acceptance of campaign contributions.\n       b. Do you think it is ethical or appropriate for a judge to \n     accept donations from parties appearing before him?\n       Response: Please see my response to 1a, above.\n       2. The Department of Justice is currently pursuing multiple \n     prosecutions related to Enron's collapse into bankruptcy. \n     Currently, voluminous evidence related to Enron's \n     manipulation of Western electricity markets remains under a \n     Department of Justice sought protective order, out of public \n     view. This includes thousands of hours of Enron audiotapes as \n     well as reams of emails from the files of traders and senior \n     executives. Based on the small amount of materials publicly \n     released thus far, it is reasonable to conclude this evidence \n     will provide more insight into the inner-workings of Enron's \n     schemes to manipulate Western power markets. While there may \n     be reasons to withhold some of this evidence in light of \n     ongoing Department criminal prosecutions, this material is \n     also of extreme importance to regulatory agencies such as the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and to parties \n     attempting to secure financial relief from power prices \n     resulting from Enron's schemes. Likewise, it is of interest \n     to Congress, as we attempt to craft legislation that would \n     prohibit future Enrons from defrauding American investors and \n     ratepayers.\n       a. Please detail your previous contacts with Enron Corp. \n     and its executives, both in your previous career in Texas as \n     well as in your role as White House Counsel?\n       Response: As an attorney at Vinson & Elkins, I did some \n     legal work for Enron over ten years ago. I am told the work \n     was totally unrelated to the collapse of the company seven \n     years later. I had contacts with certain Enron executives in \n     connection with my election to the Texas Supreme Court. I \n     also had contact with Enron officials in connection with my \n     civic work in the Houston community. I do not recall any \n     contacts with Enron and its executives in my role as White \n     House Counsel.\n       b. Given these contacts, do you plan to recuse yourself \n     from involvement in ongoing Enron prosecutions?\n       Response: If confirmed, I would take very seriously my \n     obligation to recuse myself from any matter whenever \n     appropriate. I would also treat with equal seriousness the \n     charge that the Attorney General has to enforce the law \n     fairly and equally on behalf of all Americans. It would be \n     premature for me to commit to recuse myself from ongoing \n     Enron prosecutions without knowing all of the facts and \n     without consulting with Department personnel about recusal \n     practice and history.\n       c. If you do intend to recuse yourself, who will be the \n     point of contact for Members of the Senate interested in \n     exercising oversight of the Department's handling of this \n     matter?\n       Response: If confirmed, I would consult the attorneys at \n     the Department handling this matter regarding congressional \n     oversight.\n       d. Will you commit to releasing to Congress and the public \n     the maximum amount of evidence now under seal at the earliest \n     possible date?\n       Response: If confirmed, I would consult the attorneys at \n     the Department handling this matter regarding the release to \n     Congress of any sealed evidence.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, there are strong reasons that cause me \nto want to support the nomination of Alberto Gonzales. He is clearly \nwell educated. He has the experience and credentials to be our Attorney \nGeneral. He clearly has the confidence of the President, and, as a \ngeneral matter, the President should be given broad discretion in \nchoosing his Cabinet.\n  Alberto Gonzales's personal history, as the son of immigrant parents, \nis truly inspiring, and he would be the first Hispanic Attorney General \nin our Nation's history.\n  So under any normal circumstances, these reasons would be more than \nadequate to gain my support for this nomination.\n\n[[Page S935]]\n\n  But the fact is that the policies of this administration, which in \nsome cases Judge Gonzales has championed, and in other cases he has \nwillingly acquiesced in, have constituted a sad chapter in our Nation's \nhistory. This administration's willingness to evade and sidestep our \nhistoric commitment to the rule of law is unfortunate, indeed, and I \nfear that a vote for the nominee would be interpreted as condoning \nthose reprehensible policies.\n  In July of 2003, I spoke on the Senate floor about my concerns with \nthe policies and practices of the administration with regard to the \ndetention of three categories of individuals: immigrants, persons \ndetained as material witnesses, and persons detained as enemy \ncombatants.\n  This morning I reviewed those comments, and I believe today my \nconcerns regarding the failure to afford basic due process rights that \nI discussed then are well founded.\n  The administration, in reaction to the terrorist attacks of September \n11, 2001, chose to argue against any and all legal protections against \narbitrary and abusive exercise of the power of the Government to \nincarcerate individuals. It made those arguments by using the rationale \nthat we were a nation at war and that the law of war overrode the rule \nof law as we have known it.\n\n  Judge Gonzales played a key role in developing the legal \njustifications for some of those policies. He strongly supported the \ndecision to hold individuals unilaterally deemed enemy combatants by \nthe President, including American citizens, indefinitely without \njudicial review. He advised the Judiciary Committee that he accepted \nthe views in the Department of Justice memo that significantly limited \nthe definition of torture and drastically expanded the President's \npower to overrule Federal and international restrictions to its use.\n  In remarks to the Standing Committee on Law and National Security of \nthe American Bar Association in February 2004, Alberto Gonzales argued \nthat the ``law of war'' justified the administration's position that \nthe President has virtually unfettered authority to designate \nindividuals as ``enemy combatants'' and then to incarcerate those \nindividuals ``for the duration of hostilities.''\n  He went on to state:\n\n       They need not be guilty of anything; they are detained \n     simply by virtue of their status as enemy combatants in war.\n\n  Since that speech was given, the Federal courts have soundly rejected \nthe proposition that the Government could hold individuals without \naccording them the right to challenge the basis of their detention. In \ntwo cases decided this last June, Rasul v. Bush and Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, \nthe Supreme Court reaffirmed the right of all individuals detained \nwithin the territorial jurisdiction of the United States to file a \npetition for a writ of habeas corpus and inquire into the legality of \ntheir detention. Indeed the right to challenge the Government's \ndeprivation of a person's liberty is fundamental to our Nation's \ncommitment to justice.\n  In the Hamdi case, the administration maintained that the President's \nauthority to hold enemy combatants included American citizens and that \nFederal courts could provide minimal judicial oversight. The Government \nargued that a simple affidavit by a Department of Defense official \nalleging that Hamdi was involved in hostilities in Afghanistan was \nsufficient to indefinitely deprive an American citizen of his liberty. \nAccording to this administration, it was neither proper nor necessary \nto hold any factual or evidentiary hearing or to give Hamdi an \nopportunity to rebut the Government's assertions.\n  The Supreme Court disagreed and held that an American detained as an \nenemy combatant must be given a meaningful opportunity to contest the \nfactual basis for his detention before a neutral arbiter. In \nreaffirming ``the fundamental nature of a citizen's right to be free \nfrom involuntary confinement by his own government without due process \nof law,'' the Court sent a clear message to the administration that ``a \nstate of war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to \nthe rights of our Nation's citizens.''\n  In Rasul, which involved the cases of foreign nationals held in \nGuantanamo for over 2 years, the administration argued that despite the \nfact the United States has exercised exclusive jurisdiction over \nGuantanamo since 1903, Federal courts have no jurisdiction to hear \ntheir claims because Cuba technically retained sovereignty in the area.\n  Once again, the Supreme Court disagreed and granted the detainees the \nright to demonstrate that they were being held contrary to domestic and \ninternational law.\n  Our failure to afford these individuals a right to be heard and to \nassert their innocence has in certain cases resulted in the unnecessary \nand lengthy detention of people who were merely in the wrong place at \nthe wrong time. According to a Wall Street Journal article dated \nJanuary 26 of this year:\n\n       Commanders now estimate that up to 40% of the 549 current \n     detainees probably pose no threat and possess no significant \n     information.\n\n  Whether or not this number is completely accurate, it demonstrates \nthe importance of providing individuals with the right to challenge the \nGovernment's claims and the right to refute the basis for their \ndetention.\n  As many of my colleagues have pointed out, the administration's \nposition regarding the treatment of detainees is as troubling as its \nposition on its unfettered right to incarcerate. The Justice \nDepartment, through its Office of Legal Counsel, on August 1, 2002, \nissued its now discredited and withdrawn memorandum regarding standards \nof conduct for interrogation. That document provided legal sanction for \nabuse of prisoners by narrowing the definition of what we would \nrecognize as torture under the Convention against Torture and other \nFederal law. It is true that this memorandum was prepared for Alberto \nGonzales and not by him, but there is no indication that he disagreed \nwith its conclusions. In fact, when asked about the memorandum in his \nconfirmation hearing, he stated:\n\n       I don't have a disagreement with the conclusions that were \n     reached by the Department.\n\n  Removing the bright line that has guided our troops for the last 60 \nyears increases the chances that other countries will refuse to afford \nour troops legal protections in future conflicts and enhances the \nlikelihood that they will be made subject to harsh interrogation \ntechniques.\n  MG Mel Montano, former head of the National Guard in the State of New \nMexico, in his letter to the Judiciary Committee eloquently gave voice \nto those concerns. He said:\n\n       I was among 12 retired Admirals and Generals . . . who \n     wrote to you urging that you closely examine Judge Gonzales's \n     role in setting US policy on torture during the confirmation \n     hearing.\n       At that hearing, Judge Gonzales did not allay concerns \n     about his record. To the contrary, his evasiveness and memory \n     lapses raised even more concerns. Judge Gonzales continues to \n     maintain that he can't remember how the infamous torture memo \n     was generated. He has refused to explain the language in his \n     own memo which implied that rejecting the applicability of \n     the Geneva Convention would insulate US personnel for \n     prosecution of war crimes they might ``need'' to commit. And \n     he asserts that the Convention Against Torture's prohibition \n     on cruel and inhuman treatment doesn't apply to aliens \n     overseas.\n       In my view these positions put our servicemen and women--\n     already facing enormous danger--at even greater risk. . . .\n\n  The Constitution is clear that the President ``will take care that \nthe laws be faithfully executed.'' The obvious first responsibility of \nthe Counsel to the President is to advise him concerning what is meant \nby that obligation.\n  As regards the basic protections in our Constitution and laws against \nincarceration and abuse of individuals by the Government, both the \nPresident and his legal counsel have failed in that duty. I am \ncompelled to vote no on the nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full letter from Major General \nMontano to the Judiciary Committee be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Major General Melvyn Montano,\n\n\n                                     Ret. USAF National Guard,\n\n                                Albuquerque, NM, January 25, 2005.\n     Hon. Members of the Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n\n            An Open Letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\n       Dear Senators: I am writing to urge that you reject the \n     nomination of Alberto\n\n[[Page S936]]\n\n     Gonzales for Attorney General. I understand that some \n     Hispanic groups support Judge Gonzales's nomination and have \n     urged you to confirm him. I write, as a Hispanic and as a \n     military officer and veteran, to offer a different \n     perspective.\n       I know what it feels like to be the first Hispanic named to \n     an important leadership position in this country. I was the \n     first Hispanic Air Nationa1 Guard officer appointed as an \n     adjutant general in the United States. I am a Vietnam veteran \n     and served 45 years in the military, including 18 years in a \n     command position. I welcome the prospect of more Hispanics \n     serving in leadership positions in the government, and I \n     respect Judge Gonzales's inspiring personal story. But I \n     reject the notion that Hispanics should loyally support the \n     nomination of a man who sat quietly by while administration \n     officials discussed using torture against people in American \n     custody, simply because he is one of our own.\n       I was among 12 retired Admirals and Generals, including \n     former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John \n     Shalikashvili (Ret. USA), who wrote to you urging that you \n     closely examine Judge Gonzales's role in setting U.S. policy \n     on torture during his confinnation hearing.\n       At that hearing, Judge Gonzales did not allay concerns \n     about his record. To the contrary, his evasiveness and memory \n     lapses raised even more concerns. Judge Gonzales continues to \n     maintain he can't remember how the infamous torture memo was \n     generated. He has refused to explain the language in his own \n     memo which implied that rejecting the applicability of the \n     Geneva Conventions would insulate U.S. personnel from \n     prosecution for war crimes they might ``need'' to commit. And \n     he asserts that the Convention Against Torture's prohibition \n     on cruel and inhuman treatment doesn't apply to a1iens \n     overseas.\n       In my view, these positions put our service men and women--\n     already facing enormous danger--at even greater risk. In my \n     capacity as Major General of the National Guard, I oversaw \n     4,800 National Guard personnel. When I think about how many \n     of our troops fighting in Iraq today are drawn from the \n     National Guard, it angers me that the danger they face has \n     been increased as a resuIt of the policies Judge Gonzales has \n     endorsed. I wonder, if Judge Gonzales' children grow up to \n     serve in the military, would he be so cavalier in dismissing \n     the Geneva Conventions as obsolete?\n       Some have cynically suggested that Americans who question \n     Judge Gonzales's record on these issues do so because they \n     are anti-Hispanic. I reject this view. My own concerns about \n     Judge Gonzales' fitness to serve as Attorney General grow \n     ftom a deep respect for American values and the rule of law. \n     Judge Gonzales should be evaluated on his record, not his \n     ethnicity. On the basis of that record, I urge you to reject \n     his nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                     Major General Melvyn Montano.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, while it is true, as many of my \ncolleagues have pointed out, that Alberto Gonzales has chartered an \nimpressive path, the son of migrant workers rising from humble \nbeginnings to establish an impressive record as a judge and a lawyer, I \ndo not cast my vote because of his life story.\n  I cast my vote in favor of Judge Gonzales because of two reasons: I \nbelieve it is the prerogative of the President to choose who is to \nserve in his Cabinet, and I believe Judge Gonzales is a smart and \nqualified lawyer.\n  Judge Gonzales served in the U.S. Air Force, graduated from Harvard \nLaw School, was a partner in a prestigious law firm, a justice on the \nTexas Supreme Court, and the chief lawyer for Governor Bush and \nPresident Bush.\n  As a justice on the Texas Supreme Court, I have seen evidence of his \nindependence and commitment to the rule of law in reaching decisions on \ncontroversial issues like parental notification for a minor seeking to \nterminate a pregnancy. While he may oppose it personally, he was able \nto set those feelings aside and issue a ruling based on the law. I \nbelieve that this is the Judge Gonzales who will serve as this Nation's \nAttorney General. I believe that this Judge Gonzales will appreciate \nthe very important role he is to play as the top law enforcer who is \ncharged with the duty of being the ``people's lawyer.''\n  The  U.S. Attorney General serves at the pleasure of the President, \nbut he does not serve to please the President. I believe that Judge \nGonzales, the man I have met several times, is able to appreciate this \nimportant difference and will be faithful to fulfilling his \nresponsibilities to enforce our laws and protect our freedoms.\n  I, as many of my colleagues were, was very troubled by the ``Bybee \nmemo'' submitted by the Department of Justice and the memo Judge \nGonzales drafted advising the White House as to the inapplicability of \nthe Geneva Conventions.\n  As the President's lawyer, Judge Gonzales's responsibility was to \nrepresent the President and to provide legal advice in light of \nquestions presented to him by the President.\n  I believe that Judge Gonzales understands the different role he is to \nplay as Attorney General in representing the people's interest as a \nnation that honors the rule of law.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, although Congress has the responsibility \nto advise and consent on the confirmable posts of Cabinet Secretaries, \nI have historically cast my vote in a manner that provides wide \nlatitude for a President to select his Cabinet team. I have voted for \nCabinet nominees with whom I have very substantial and deep \ndisagreements because I believe a President should be able to select a \nteam of his choice to pursue his administration's goals.\n  But there are those occasions where it is important for the Congress \nto express its independent judgment about the record and the \nqualifications of a Cabinet nominee.\n  That is the case with the nominee the President has sent us for the \npost of Attorney General.\n  I have met with Judge Gonzales on a number of occasions, and I think \nhe is smart and capable and has served the President loyally for a long \nperiod of time. But I am very troubled by the results of the Judiciary \nCommittee hearings on the nomination of Judge Gonzales. I believe there \nare serious questions about the role of Judge Gonzales in the \ndevelopment of guidelines defining ``torture'' in the war on terror \nthat should be unsettling to all Americans. Judge Gonzales was evasive \nin answering direct questions about these issues and refused to release \nall of the information that has been requested by the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  With respect to civil liberties and issues relating to how our \nGovernment conducts itself, I want an Attorney General who will follow \nthe law and not look for cracks or crevices in the law that will enable \nan administration to pursue its own course. Frankly, and regrettably, I \nthink that Judge Gonzales in his work in the White House has not \ndemonstrated the willingness to be independent, nor has he shown the \nconcern about civil liberties that I want to see in an Attorney \nGeneral.\n  These are difficult and uncertain times for our country. The war on \nterrorism is difficult and will likely be lengthy. It is important we \nhave the tools available to combat terrorism, but it is also equally \nimportant for us to preserve our civil liberties and protect the \nconstitutional rights of our citizens even as we wage the war on \nterrorism. For that reason, I believe it is critical to have an \nAttorney General who will understand that his responsibility is not to \nthe administration, but rather to the Constitution.\n  Because of my concern for all of these issues, I cannot vote to \nconfirm Judge Gonzales for the post of Attorney General. It is unusual \nthat I vote against a President's choice for a Cabinet post, but I \nbelieve this an unusual time and circumstance, and I believe it is \ncritical that we have an Attorney General who can resist the efforts of \nthose who would diminish our civil liberties as we wage this war on \nterrorism.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today we consider the nomination of Judge \nAlberto Gonzales--President Bush's selection for Attorney General of \nthe United States. I will oppose this nomination for several reasons. \nJudge Gonzales's deep involvement in formulating the administration's \ndetention and interrogation policies and his refusal to candidly answer \nquestions about these matters concern me.\n  As White House Counsel, Judge Gonzales played a pivotal role in \nshaping the administration's policies on the detention and \ninterrogation of enemy prisoners. In 2002 Judge Gonzales advised the \nPresident that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to terror suspects, \nand described some of the treaty's provisions as ``quaint.'' This \ndismissive approach to our international commitments laid the basis for \nPresident Bush's decision to treat terror suspects as ``unlawful enemy \ncombatants.'' In casting aside the Conventions, Judge Gonzales opened a \nPandora's Box that brought the country and American troops less \nsecurity.\n  Separately, the Department of Justice circulated a memo it had \nwritten--\n\n[[Page S937]]\n\nat Judge Gonzales's request--that provided an extremely narrow \ndefinition of torture. The memo was widely condemned and contrary to \nthe plain language of the U.S. anti-torture statute and all legal \nprecedents. When asked about this memo at his confirmation hearing, \nGonzales said he did not recall, ``whether or not I was in agreement \nwith all of the analysis.''\n  Do these revelations necessarily mean that Judge Gonzales is directly \nresponsible for the prisoner abuse scandal that has damaged our \nnational security and tarnished our Nation? Of course not. But his \nactions--at the very least--helped to create the environment in which \nthe Abu Ghraib scandal took place. The result is less certain \nintelligence and more danger for American forces around the world.\n  I was struck during the hearings on Judge Gonzales's nomination when \nSenator Leahy asked if leaders of foreign governments could torture \nU.S. citizens if they thought it necessary to protect their own \nnational security. Judge Gonzales replied: Senator, I don't know what \nlaws other world leaders would be bound by. And I think it would--I'm \nnot in a position to answer that question.\n  I wrote to Judge Gonzales asking him to clarify his answer. He \nresponded, in fact that: international law forbids the use of torture. \nAll parties to the Convention Against Torture have committed not to \nengage in torture and to ensure that all acts of torture are offenses \nunder their criminal law. But it does not address the heart of the \nissue. Judge Gonzales interpreted U.S. and international law to suggest \nthat U.S. citizens could conduct torture when the President of the \nUnited States gave them authority to do so. In doing so, he undermined \nthe legitimacy of the very international norms he asserts would protect \nU.S. citizens. His assertions collapse under the weight of their own \nflawed logic.\n  This is not simply my judgment alone, but the judgment of some of \nAmerica's most distinguished, retired military officers--including \nGeneral John Shalikashvili, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, General Joseph Hoar, former Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Central \nCommand, and Lt. General Claudia J. Kennedy, the former deputy Chief of \nStaff for Army Intelligence. In an open letter to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, they wrote:\n\n       During his tenure as White House Counsel, Mr. Gonzales \n     appears to have played a significant role in shaping U.S. \n     detention and interrogation operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, \n     Guantanamo Bay, and elsewhere. Today it is clear that these \n     operations have fostered greater animosity toward the United \n     States, undermined our intelligence gathering efforts, and \n     added to the risks facing our troops serving around the \n     world.\n\n  Judge Gonzales's interpretation of our commitments under U.S. and \ninternational law has been widely condemned in the United States and \nabroad, including by members of the State and Defense Departments. He \nis not an appropriate selection for the Attorney General of the United \nStates.\n  Judge Gonzales's confirmation process presented him with an \nopportunity to reassure the country that as Attorney General he would \nuphold and enforce the laws that prohibit torture. Instead he offered \nevasive and overly legalistic answers. Judge Gonzales's refusal to \nanswer questions about administration policy--either in oral testimony \nor in written responses to questions--raises doubts about his \ncommitment to the rule of law.\n  His lack of candor before the Judiciary Committee leaves many \noutstanding questions about his role in determining administration \npolicy. One can only conclude that either he lacks a fundamental \nunderstanding of U.S. and international law, which I believe to be \nuntrue, or he is dismissive of its applicability as it relates to the \nPresident.\n  We have seen this approach taken by this administration before. They \ndo not consult, they do not confer, they do not exercise good judgment \nand that is the end of the story. The rest of us are left to deal with \nthe consequences. The policies Judge Gonzales favored have tarred the \nimage of America in the world--not made us safer. They have placed our \ntroops at even greater risk--not protected them. The choices he made as \nWhite House Counsel showed unacceptable judgment.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, there has been a lot of discussion \nthroughout this debate of the personal story of White House Counsel \nAlberto Gonzales, who has been nominated by President Bush to serve as \nthe next Attorney General of the United States.\n  I agree that Judge Gonzales's life story embodies the American dream. \nJudge Gonzales is the son of immigrants, and lived in a home with his \nparents and eight brothers and sisters that I am sure had a lot of love \nbut that did not have a lot of comfort, with no running water and no \ntelephone. Thanks to his hard work and dedication, he went on to \ngraduate from Rice University and Harvard Law School; he served as the \nTexas Secretary of State and a Justice on the Texas Supreme Court; and \nof course he became White House counsel in 2000.\n  This is an extremely impressive record of personal accomplishment, \nand I admire Judge Gonzales for his life story, which proves that hard \nwork can take you anywhere in this country, no matter where you start \nout on the economic ladder. It is inspiring not only for Hispanic \nAmericans, but for all Americans.\n  But while a Cabinet nominee's personal story is relevant to our \nconsideration of whether that nominee should be confirmed, I believe \nthat our constitutional responsibility to advise and consent requires a \nmore thorough look.\n  We in the Senate owe an obligation to the American people to consider \nand evaluate fully an Attorney General nominee's current policy and \nlegal views, as well as his or her prior views and actions taken \nconcerning relevant issues.\n  I have reviewed Judge Gonzales's record and his responses, or lack of \nresponses, to the many thoughtful questions posed by members of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. On the basis of his professional record and \nhis unwillingness to answer critical questions, I am compelled to \noppose his nomination.\n  Judge Gonzales's record as White House counsel contains misjudgments \nand misreadings of U.S. and international law that were so grievous as \nto have shaken the conscience of our Nation and the bedrock of the most \nfundamental aspects of our democracy.\n  Judge Gonzales advised President Bush in January 2002 that the Geneva \nConventions did not apply to the conflict in Afghanistan. He wrote that \nthe ``war on terrorism'' offers a ``new paradigm [that] renders \nobsolete'' the Geneva Convention's protections. Memos prepared under \nhis direction that same year recommended official authorization of \ncruel interrogation methods including: waterboarding, feigned \nsuffocation, and sleep deprivation.\n  In response to a draft memorandum prepared and circulated by White \nHouse Counsel Gonzales on the applicability of the Geneva Convention to \nthe conflict in Afghanistan, then-Secretary of State Colin Powell, who \nserved our Nation for decades with distinction both in and out of \nuniform, prepared a memo outlining his deep concerns with both Judge \nGonzales's assertions and his reasoning.\n  Secretary Powell wrote that he was ``concerned that the draft \n[memorandum] does not squarely present to the President the options \nthat are available to him. Nor does it identify the significant pros \nand cons of each option.'' The Secretary also noted a number of \nsignificant inaccuracies in the draft memorandum, concerning previous \napplications of the Geneva Convention.\n  In discussing the option of declaring that the Geneva Convention does \nnot apply, Secretary Powell noted a number of key concerns, including \nthat doing so ``would reverse over a century of U.S. policy and \npractice in supporting the Geneva conventions and undermine the \nprotections of the law of war for our troops, both in this specific \nconflict and in general.''\n  Secretary Powell also noted many other major disadvantages of \npursuing such a position, including the high cost in terms of a \nnegative international reaction, which would hinder the ability of the \nUnited States to conduct its foreign policy, and noting that the policy \nwould undermine public support among critical allies.\n\n  Judge Gonzales dismissed out-of-hand these concerns, as well as \nothers raised by senior members of the military, and recommended that \nthe Geneva Conventions do not apply.\n\n[[Page S938]]\n\n  I believe that all Members of this body strongly support our men and \nwomen in the military. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, \nhowever, I feel a particular personal obligation to do my utmost to \nensure that our government does not do anything that unnecessarily puts \nour troops in harm's way; that diminishes our standing among our \nallies, from whom we have asked and will continue to ask much in \nhelping us fight the global war on terror; or that blurs the values \nthat distinguish us from our enemies, whose depraved actions and \nnihilistic morality stand in stark contrast to our Nation's historic \nvalues and conduct.\n  In serving as the President's top legal adviser on matters of both \ndomestic and international policy and law, Judge Gonzales had that \nobligation as well. Unfortunately, I believe he fell short of meeting \nthat obligation and let the American people, and especially America's \nmen and women in uniform, down.\n  These are not just my views but the views of some retired senior \nmembers of our military. In an open letter to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, this group of retired military leaders expressed their deep \nconcern with this nomination. They noted his significant role in \nshaping U.S. detention and interrogation policies and operations in \nAfghanistan, Iraq, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere and concluded, ``it is \nclear that these operations have fostered greater animosity toward the \nUnited States, undermined our intelligence gathering efforts, and added \nto the risks facing our troops serving around the world.'' Their open \nletter went on to say,\n\n     [p]erhaps most troubling of all, the White House decision to \n     depart from the Geneva Conventions in Afghanistan went hand \n     in hand with the decision to relax the definition of torture \n     and to alter interrogation doctrine accordingly. Mr. \n     Gonzales' January 2002 memo itself warned that the decision \n     not to apply the Geneva Convention standards ``could \n     undermine U.S. military culture which emphasizes maintaining \n     the highest standards of conduct in combat, and could \n     introduce an element of uncertainty in the status of \n     adversaries.'' Yet Mr. Gonzales then made that very \n     recommendation with reference to Afghanistan, a policy later \n     extended piece by piece to Iraq. Sadly, the uncertainty Mr. \n     Gonzales warned about came to fruition. As James R. \n     Schlesinger's panel reviewing Defense Department detention \n     operations concluded earlier this year, these changes in \n     doctrine have led to uncertainty and confusion in the field, \n     contributing to the abuses of detainees at Abu Ghraib and \n     elsewhere, and undermining the mission and morale of our \n     troops.\n\n  Almost as troubling to me as the advice Judge Gonzales gave the \nPresident as White House counsel is his unwillingness to respond to \nimportant questions posed by members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nDuring his nomination hearing before the Committee, Judge Gonzales was \npresented with repeated opportunities to repudiate his prior positions, \nand to respond to legitimate concerns. He consistently refused to do \nso. He also refused to respond freely to important written questions \nsubmitted by Judiciary Committee members that remained unanswered after \nthe hearing.\n  Judge Gonzales's unwillingness to answer questions or to submit \nhimself fully to the nomination process has extended beyond his \ndealings with the Judiciary Committee. The Congressional Hispanic \nCaucus has announced that it will not support his nomination, because \nJudge Gonzales refused to meet with the Caucus or address their \nquestions. According to the White House, Judge Gonzales was ``too \nbusy'' to meet with the CHC.\n  The CHC has determined that ``the Latino community continues to lack \nclear information'' about how Judge Gonzales would influence policies \nimportant to the Latino community. It is for this same reason that the \nNew York-based Puerto Rican Legal Defense & Education Fund has withheld \nits endorsement from Judge Gonzales. PRLDEF signed a letter prior to \nJudge Gonzales's hearing before the Judiciary Committee, identifying \nserious concerns about his nomination. PRLDEF reports that Judge \nGonzales has still not adequately addressed these concerns.\n  I believe the Congress and the American people deserve much more from \na nominee who seeks to become the Nation's chief law enforcement \nofficer.\n  What saddens me the most is that Judge Gonzales is an accomplished \nand bright public servant, and the circumstances that have forced me to \noppose his nomination were eminently avoidable, had Judge Gonzales \nsimply met his basic obligations as a lawyer and as a nominee.\n  Underlying my opposition to Judge Gonzales's nomination as Attorney \nGeneral is the fact that as White House Counsel, one of the most \nimportant legal positions in the Nation, Judge Gonzales had a firm \nduty, as do all lawyers, to advise his client in this case President \nBush with independent, professional judgment grounded in law, and based \nupon standards of morality and decency.\n  Indeed, the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional \nConduct speak explicitly to the role of lawyers as counselors and \nadvisors. One of those rules states that ``[i]n representing a client, \na lawyer shall exercise independent professional judgment and render \ncandid advice. In rendering advice, a lawyer may refer not only to law \nbut to other considerations such as moral, economic, social and \npolitical factors that may be relevant to the client's situation.''\n  The duty to exercise independent judgment and provide informed advice \nto one's client is a duty that all lawyers must uphold; lawyers are \ncompelled to speak the truth as they independently see it, and not \nsimply parrot back what they believe their clients want to hear.\n  I believe that as White House counsel, Judge Gonzales breached that \nduty, not only to his client President Bush, but to the American \npeople. He advised that the President adopt a number of incorrect legal \npositions that were wrong on the law and wrong morally. And he did so \non some of the most important issues confronting our Nation, at a time \nwhen thousands of young Americans fighting to promote democracy and \nfreedom in Afghanistan and Iraq and around the world were at risk of \nmistreatment if captured. We cannot control the behavior of our \nenemies, but we can avoid giving them any excuse or rationale to \nmistreat Americans. And we can avoid giving them any basis on which to \nclaim there is no difference between us and them.\n  For all of these reasons, I must oppose this nomination and ask my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I begin by thanking my colleagues on the \nJudiciary Committee who did the hard work of exhaustively examining the \nnominee's record. They have done what the Constitution requires of us \nand the Founders intended--that Senators take seriously their role in \ngiving advise and consent on members of the President's Cabinet.\n  The Attorney General is our Nation's chief law enforcement officer, \ntasked with upholding the Constitution and our laws.\n  While I believe Mr. Gonzales has a truly remarkable personal story, \nthe poor judgment he has exercised in his role as White House Counsel \nhas resulted in a serious consequences that cannot simply be overlooked \nwhen considering his nomination.\n  I will be voting against Mr. Gonzales for two main reasons.\n  First, Mr. Gonzales was the legal architect of the administration's \npolicies on torture.\n  In 2002, when the intelligence community sought legal guidance about \ninterrogation techniques, Mr. Gonzales asked the Justice Department to \ncome up with legal justification for abusive interrogation tactics. The \ntorture memo was drafted at his request and tacitly accepted by Mr. \nGonzales. The Defense Department then used that memo to justify \nhorrific and abusive interrogation tactics in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nelsewhere.\n  This memo sets forth a position so outlandish that even the Dean of \nYale Law School has said that much of Saddam's Hussein's horrific \nabuses--like cutting off fingers, electrical shock, branding and \nburning of skin--would not meet the memo's definition of torture.\n  Mr. Gonzales has never clearly repudiated this memo even though it \nhas been a stain on our law and national reputation. Mr. Gonzales was \nasked about this memo at his confirmation hearings before the Judiciary \nCommittee. Senator Leahy specifically asked him if he agreed with the \nmemo's very narrow reading of the law about what constitutes torture. \nMr. Gonzales replied: ``I don't recall today\n\n[[Page S939]]\n\nwhether or not I was in agreement with all of the analysis, but I don't \nhave a disagreement with the conclusions then reached by the \nDepartment.'' Mr. Gonzales's response was completely unacceptable.\n  It was his acceptance of this memo that formed the basis of \nadministration policy for 2 years until the Department of Justice \nrepudiated it on December 30, 2004, 1 week before Mr. Gonzales's \nhearings.\n  Second, Mr. Gonzales played a central role in shaping the Bush \nadministration's policy toward detainees.\n  He called the Geneva Conventions ``quaint'' and ``obsolete''. And he \nadvised President Bush to deny prisoners the protections under the \nGeneva Conventions, which had been the unbroken practice of the United \nStates for over 50 years, and which have protected our soldiers since \n1949.\n  He did this over the objection of Secretary Powell and State \nDepartment legal counsel. They warned that this advice could undermine \nmilitary culture, generate confusion about how to treat detainees, and \nultimately lead to abuse. Tragically, this is exactly what happened.\n  The torture and other abuses of prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan \nhave done immeasurable damage to America's standing in the world, have \nundermined our military rules and traditions, and exposed our own \nsoldiers and citizens to greater risks.\n  I cannot support a nominee who has done so much damage to America's \nfundamental values and moral leadership in the world, and has taken \nactions and positions that put our soldiers and citizens at greater \nrisk.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today we are considering the nomination \nof Alberto Gonzales to be the next Attorney General of the United \nStates. Like many of my colleagues, I was inclined to support Judge \nGonzales's nomination. I have had several dealings with Judge Gonzales \nand each time I have found him to be both cooperative and a gentleman. \nHe has been extremely helpful and gracious in our mutual effort to fill \nthe vacancies on the New Jersey Federal bench, and for that I am \nthankful.\n  Unfortunately, I cannot in good conscience support his nomination. \nEven though my personal interactions with Judge Gonzales have always \nbeen positive and productive, I have serious reservations and concerns \nabout his role in the administration's attack on our laws and, more \nimportantly, our sensibilities of what is right and just.\n  My vote against Judge Gonzales is not a vote against the man. In many \nways, Judge Gonzales's story is the American success story. He grew up \nof modest means, the son of immigrants who came to this country in \nsearch of a better life. Judge Gonzales would not disappoint his \nparents. He has persevered academically and professionally, displaying \na work ethic that would see him rise to the upper echelons of his \nprofession and earn the trust and confidence of a President.\n  Yet while Judge Gonzales has ably served President Bush as his \nCounsel, as Attorney General his duty will be to the American people. \nAnd therein lies my concern.\n  As White House Counsel, Judge Gonzales played an integral role in \nformulating the Bush administration's policy on coercive interrogations \nin its war on terror. He advised the President to suspend the \napplication of the Geneva Conventions, calling these international \nstandards for humane treatment of detainees ``quaint'' and \n``obsolete.'' He then tasked the Department of Justice with the job of \nidentifying legal authority to justify the harsh interrogation tactics \nthat became an international stain on our country's once proud moral \nstanding in the world.\n  The ramifications of this abhorrent policy condoning torture cannot \nbe downplayed. The United States has the most to lose by turning its \nback on the Geneva Conventions. Not only does the position advocated by \nthe administration prevent the United States from claiming the moral \nhigh ground in future international entanglements, it also compromises \nour Nation's ability to build international coalitions. Finally, and \nperhaps most importantly, it signals to other countries that all bets \nare off, endangering U.S. troops who might be captured in future \nconflicts.\n  As many legal observers have noted, Judge Gonzales's advice was not \nonly flawed from a legal standpoint, it also spoke to a larger failure. \nA client--even when he is the President--cannot always be deferred to. \nThis is especially true when a client seeks justification for a \nposition that runs contrary to the law. Judge Gonzales advocated for \nthe administration's reversal of longstanding U.S. policies and \npractices supporting application of the Geneva Conventions and \nantitorture laws. He urged their suspension, relying on convoluted \nlegal reasoning in order to justify an end. This willingness to skirt \ninternational law demonstrates a lack of independence from an \nadministration committed to violating international principles of \njustice and humanity.\n  The job of Attorney General, unlike other Cabinet positions that \nadvocate the President's agenda, requires independence. The Attorney \nGeneral is tasked with enforcing the laws of the land, whether they \nadvance or impede the President's policies. Judge Gonzales has not \ndemonstrated a willingness to break from the President's agenda, and I \nfear his penchant for deferring to the President would hamper the \nDepartment of Justice in its mission to uphold the law. The need for \nindependence is especially important in an administration that time and \ntime again has demonstrated a cavalier attitude toward civil rights and \ncivil liberties.\n  Should he eventually be confirmed, the challenges facing Judge \nGonzales are numerous and daunting. And it is against this backdrop \nthat I ask him to take on remedial efforts to restore not only \nAmerica's moral standing in the world, but to restore the civil rights \nand liberties trampled on by this administration.\n  We need to strive to curb this administration's overreaching and to \nreinstate constitutionally protected civil liberties sacrificed by the \nadministration in the name of fighting terrorism. I believe strongly \nthat we can protect our Nation while preserving our cherished freedoms. \nIndeed, we can be both safe and free. Measures like racial profiling, \nwhich make people suspect because of their ethnicity or religion--\nrather than because of suspicious activity--are repugnant to our \ncitizens, divert valuable resources from finding real terrorists, and \nignore our Nation's commitment to freedom. I am certain that we can \nfight terrorism without resorting to hateful tactics such as racial \nprofiling that cast a cloud of immorality over our country.\n  I sincerely hope that, if confirmed, Judge Gonzales takes up these \nchallenges and provides an independent voice for the Department of \nJustice.\n  I know Judge Gonzales to be a gentleman and a patriot. And while I \nregrettably must oppose his nomination, I know that his confirmation is \nassured and pledge to work with him to ensure that our laws are \nenforced and our freedoms protected.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the nomination by President George W. Bush \nof Mr. Alberto Gonazales to serve as the Attorney General of the United \nStates has stirred strong opposition. Although my first instinct is to \nsupport the prerogative of any President to select his own Cabinet, I \nhave concluded upon a thorough review of Mr. Gonzales's record that I \nmust oppose his nomination.\n  The Constitution confides in the Senate the duty of advice and \nconsent. This means that my colleagues and I have the responsibility of \nconsidering the men and women the President nominates for high \nGovernment offices, and either confirming or rejecting them. Although \nmany consider advice and consent to be a Senate right, I think of it as \na duty that carries an obligation of fairness and due diligence. The \npower to reject a nominee should only be invoked where there is \nsubstantial doubt as to a nominee's fitness for office--not when there \nis a simple difference in political philosophy.\n  I do not personally agree with some of the positions that Mr. \nGonzales has advocated, but that should come as no surprise, because I \ndo not agree with many of the proposals made by the man who nominated \nhim, President Bush. Most strikingly, I am appalled that he has \nprofessed only a ``vague knowledge'' of the racial and ethnic \ndisparities in the imposition of the death penalty in Federal cases. \nThese\n\n[[Page S940]]\n\nvery disparities in the State of Hawaii's penal system led me to \nchampion the abolition of the death penalty in our territorial \nlegislature many years ago, and I have remained opposed to this \nultimate and irreversible sentence ever since.\n  Our philosophical disagreement over issues such as the death penalty, \ndo not, in my mind, constitute a sufficient basis for opposing his \nnomination. His lack of candor and forthrightness in answering simple \nquestions about his record does.\n  A January 2002 memorandum from Mr. Gonzales to the President \nadvocated abandoning the Geneva Convention and its prohibitions on \ntorture and inhumane treatment of prisoners of war. As a former officer \nin our Nation's military, I find this conclusion horrifying and \nrepugnant. As a Senator, I find Mr. Gonzales's refusal to clarify his \nrole in the subsequent development of a U.S. policy for torturing POWs \ninexcusable.\n  His decision--supported by the refusal of the Bush administration to \nturn over key documents--to stonewall efforts to bring this matter to \nthe light of public scrutiny strikes to the very foundation of our \nNation's democratic government. Our citizens have a right to openness \nand transparency in their public officials. Clandestine maneuvers under \nthe ever-growing cloak of ``national security'' and ``executive \nprivilege'' disenfranchises the electorate and deprives them of the \ninformation they need in order to make their choices at the polls.\n  Mr. Gonzales's failure to respond to questions legitimately posed to \nhim by the Senate raises grave doubts in my mind as to his fitness to \nserve the people of the United States as their Attorney General. Mr. \nBush may have the privilege of choosing his own ``team'' for his \nCabinet, but American citizens have an unqualified right to be served \nby public officials who will answer candidly for their actions.\n  Accordingly, I must reluctantly oppose this nomination.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, almost 35 years ago, in July of 1970, when \nI was a staff person in the House of Representatives, I was sent with a \ncommission to Vietnam. My commission was to investigate reports about \nthe South Vietnamese military using tiger cages to imprison, torture \nand kill people. Our State Department denied the existence of the \ncages, and our military denied the existence of the cages, calling \nreports of their existence Communist conspiracy stories.\n  Thanks to the courage of Congressman William Anderson of Tennessee \nand Congressman Augustus Hawkins of California, we were able to uncover \nthe notorious tiger cages on Con Son Island. When the pictures I took \nappeared in LIFE magazine, the world saw North Vietnamese, Vietcong, \nand civilian opponents of the war in South Vietnam all bunched into \nthese tiger cages, in clear violation of human rights, and in clear \nviolation of the Geneva Conventions. The reaction was overwhelming. The \npictures presented evidence of the cruel, torturous conditions in these \ntiger cages, how people had been tortured and killed, and how we, the \nU.S. Government, had provided not only the funding but the supervision \nfor these prisons.\n  I thought that we had learned from that experience. So it was with a \nterrible sense of deja vu that I saw the pictures of abuse at Abu \nGhraib prison last year.\n  Since the Vietnam era, as a Government and as a society, we have \ntaken strong measures against torture. We have passed a Federal law \nbanning torture, and ratified an international treaty banning torture. \nThe Army field manual today reads: ``The use of torture is a poor \ntechnique that yields unreliable results, may damage subsequent \ncollection efforts, and can induce the source to say what he thinks the \ninterrogator wants to hear. . . . It also may place U.S. and allied \npersonnel in enemy hands at greater risk.''\n  Yet, it was in an extraordinary document prepared at the request of \nAlberto Gonzales, the nominee for Attorney General, that the groundwork \nfor the abuses at Abu Gharib was laid. That document reaches three \nconclusions:\n  That the President has the inherent constitutional power as Commander \nin Chief to override the prohibitions against torture enacted by \nCongress;\n  That only acts that inflict the kind of pain experienced with death \nor organ failure amount to torture and that the interrogator must have \nthe ``precise objective'' of inflicting severe pain even if he knew \n``that severe pain would result from his actions''; and\n  That government officials can avoid prosecution for their acts of \ntorture by invoking the defenses of ``necessity'' or ``self-defense'' \neven though the Convention Against Torture says the opposite.\n  Because he had never spoken publicly about his involvement in the \ndevelopment of these policies, Alberto Gonzales's confirmation hearing \ntook on unusual importance. The hearing was his opportunity to explain \nhis role in the preparation of this document and to step away from its \nconclusions. Instead, when asked about the memo, Gonzales stated ``I \ndon't recall today whether or not I was in agreement with all of the \nanalysis, but I don't have a disagreement with the conclusions then \nreached by the Department.'' Gonzales also reasserted his view that the \nPresident has the power to override laws passed by the Congress and to \nimmunize others to perform what would otherwise be unlawful acts. These \npositions are wrong as a matter of law and wrong as a matter of \nconscience. The torture memo laid the groundwork directly for the \nabuses at Abu Ghraib and has done great harm to our stature in the \ninternational community.\n  As the nominee for Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales is the person \nwith the single greatest responsibility to uphold and defend the rule \nof law. Not only is the torture memo a reprehensible document that \nsanctioned engaging in illegal acts of torture in violation of basic \nhuman rights, it is also a prime example of a legal analysis that \ntwists, turns and makes far-fetched leaps of logic in order to justify \na policy end sought by the administration. This sort of willingness to \ncircumvent the law, to treat it as an obstacle to be negotiated around, \nshows a fundamental lack of independence. It calls into question Mr. \nGonzales's fitness to be the Attorney General. Because of this, but \neven more because of his fundamental lack of respect for basic human \nrights, I cannot support him to be the chief law enforcement officer of \nthis country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to President \nBush's nomination of Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney General of the \nUnited States. While I have long held that any President deserves a \npresumption in favor of his nominees for Cabinet positions, the advice \nand consent role of the Senate should never be regarded as a mere \nformality.\n  The Attorney General, in particular, is far more than simply another \npolitical appointee or adviser to a President. The Attorney General \nplays a key role in the provision of justice for all Americans, and \nnominees to this enormously important office must be reviewed with \nsenatorial scrutiny which is fair and not political but demanding.\n  I am profoundly troubled that Mr. Gonzales's promotion of torture \nflies in the face of deeply held American values, undermines our \nNation's reputation around the world, and places American troops and \nother citizens abroad in great danger. As the father of a soldier who \nserved in combat in both Afghanistan and Iraq, I am particularly \nconcerned that our Nation's utilization of torture creates an \nenvironment where other nations and other organizations feel they have \njustification for torturing our troops and our citizens. There is \nlittle wonder why Mr. Gonzales's position was strongly opposed by the \nU.S. Army's legal corps and by the U.S. State Department.\n  Mr. Gonzales oversaw and approved the decision to disregard the \nGeneva Conventions for detainees from Afghanistan, he endorsed \ninterrogation methods that military and FBI professionals regarded as \nillegal and improper, and he supported the indefinite detention of both \nforeigners and Americans without due process. It was only after the \nSupreme Court's intervention, which ruled that the prisoners were \nentitled to appeal their detentions in Federal courts, that some of the \nharmful policies were reversed. The Court also ruled that an American \ncitizen could not be detained and held as an ``enemy combatant'' \nwithout court\n\n[[Page S941]]\n\nreview or the right to counsel, invalidating Mr. Gonzales's position in \nthe cases of Yaser Esam Hamdi and Jose Padilla.\n  Mr. Gonzales made a second horrible judgment about the Geneva \nConventions--that their restrictions on interrogations were \n``obsolete.'' Quite apart from the question of POW status for \ndetainees, this determination invalidated the Army's doctrine for \nquestioning enemy prisoners, which is based on the Geneva Conventions \nand had proved its worth over decades. Regarding this issue, Mr. \nGonzales ignored advice from the Army's own legal corps to Secretary of \nState Colin L. Powell. Why is this so alarming? The President's \npromotion of torturous interrogation practices, such as \n``waterboarding,'' would likely invite retaliation against Americans \nbeyond what already exists. This could have grievous effects on our men \nand women serving abroad. I can think of few things worse, as the \nfather of a soldier, than to know America's own torture policies would \nincrease the likelihood of more torture directed at our American \ntroops.\n  Mr. Gonzales had an opportunity to clarify this issue while \ntestifying in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. During that \nhearing, Judge Gonzales refused to reject a narrow definition of \ntorture and directly answer whether he thought the President has the \nauthority to overrule the statute that condemns torture and provide \nimmunity for those who commit torture based on the directive of the \nPresident.\n  Turning to another issue of importance, it is incumbent upon me to \npoint out that while Mr. Gonzales was serving as counsel to then-\nGovernor George W. Bush, he provided questionable advice regarding \nclemency of inmates. It appears Mr. Gonzales failed in his duty to \nprovide complete information regarding death row inmates in the State \nof Texas. In some of the 57 memos he composed for Governor Bush, Mr. \nGonzalez failed to include all mitigating circumstances that should be \nconsidered in clemency for death row inmates. Some of these mitigating \ncircumstances include inmates' ability to have qualified representation \nas well as the questionable mental status of some of the death row \ninmates.\n  Mr. Gonzales faced rigorous questioning by members of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. Despite the opportunity to explain away concerns \nthe American public had pertaining to his record and his beliefs, Mr. \nGonzales did not convince me that he is the proper person to serve as \nour Attorney General, the chief law enforcement officer of the United \nStates.\n  The New York Times correctly observed that the Attorney General does \nnot merely head up the Justice Department; he is responsible for \nensuring that America is a nation in which justice prevailed. Mr. \nGonzales's record makes him unqualified to take on the role to \nrepresent the American justice system to the rest of the world.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \neditorials from the Washington Post and the New York Times wherein \nthese highly respected newspapers contend that the confirmation of Mr. \nGonzales would be counter to fundamental American values. I share those \nviews.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 26, 2005]\n\n                       The Wrong Attorney General\n\n                              (Editorial)\n\n       Alberto Gonzales's nomination as attorney general goes \n     before the Senate at a time when the Republican majority is \n     eager to provide newly elected President Bush with the \n     cabinet of his choice, and the Democrats are leery of \n     exposing their weakened status by taking fruitless stands \n     against the inevitable. None of that is an excuse for giving \n     Mr. Gonzales a pass. The attorney general does not merely \n     head up the Justice Department. He is responsible for \n     ensuring that America is a nation in which justice prevails. \n     Mr. Gonzales's record makes him unqualified to take on this \n     role or to represent the American justice system to the rest \n     of the world. The Senate should reject his nomination.\n       The biggest strike against Mr. Gonzales is the now \n     repudiated memo that gave a disturbingly narrow definition of \n     torture, limiting it to physical abuse that produced pain of \n     the kind associated with organ failure or death. Mr. \n     Gonzales's attempts to distance himself from the memo have \n     been unconvincing, especially since it turns out he was the \n     one who requested that it be written. Earlier the same year, \n     Mr. Gonzales himself sent President Bush a letter telling him \n     that the war on terror made the Geneva Conventions' strict \n     limitations on the questioning of enemy prisoners \n     ``obsolete.''\n       These actions created the legal climate that made possible \n     the horrific mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners being held in \n     Abu Ghraib prison. The Bush administration often talks about \n     its desire to mend fences with the rest of the world, \n     particularly the Muslim world. Making Mr. Gonzales the \n     nation's chief law enforcement officer would set this effort \n     back substantially.\n       Other parts of Mr. Gonzales's record are also troubling. As \n     counsel to George Bush when he was governor of Texas, Mr. \n     Gonzales did a shockingly poor job of laying out the legal \n     issues raised by the clemency petitions from prisoners on \n     death row. And questions have been raised about Mr. \n     Gonzales's account of how he got his boss out of jury duty in \n     1996, which allowed Mr. Bush to avoid stating publicly that \n     he had been convicted of drunken driving.\n       Senate Democrats, who are trying to define their role after \n     the setbacks of the 2004 election, should stand on principle \n     and hold out for a more suitable attorney general. \n     Republicans also have reason to oppose this nomination. At \n     the confirmation hearings, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican \n     of South Carolina, warned that the administration's flawed \n     legal policies and mistreatment of detainees had hurt the \n     country's standing and ``dramatically undermined'' the war on \n     terror. Given the stakes in that war, senators of both \n     parties should want an attorney general who does not come \n     with this nominee's substantial shortcomings.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 26, 2005]\n\n                           A Degrading Policy\n\n       Alberto R. Gonzales was vague, unresponsive and misleading \n     in his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee about the \n     Bush administration's detention of foreign prisoners. In his \n     written answers to questions from the committee, prepared in \n     anticipation of today's vote on his nomination as attorney \n     general, Mr. Gonzales was clearer--disturbingly so, as it \n     turns out. According to President Bush's closest legal \n     adviser, this administration continues to assert its right to \n     indefinitely hold foreigners in secret locations without any \n     legal process; to deny them access to the International Red \n     Cross; to transport them to countries where torture is \n     practiced; and to subject them to treatment that is ``cruel, \n     inhumane or degrading,'' even though such abuse is banned by \n     an international treaty that the United States has ratified. \n     In effect, Mr. Gonzales has confirmed that the Bush \n     administration is violating human rights as a matter of \n     policy.\n       Mr. Gonzales stated at his hearing that he and Mr. Bush \n     oppose ``torture and abuse.'' But his written testimony to \n     the committee makes clear that ``abuse'' is, in fact, \n     permissible--provided that it is practiced by the Central \n     Intelligence Agency on foreigners held outside the United \n     States. The Convention Against Torture, which the United \n     States ratified in 1994, prohibits not only torture but \n     ``cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.'' The Senate \n     defined such treatment as abuse that would violate the Fifth, \n     Eighth or 14th amendments to the Constitution--a standard \n     that the Bush administration formally accepted in 2003.\n       But Mr. Gonzales revealed that during his tenure as White \n     House counsel, the administration twisted this \n     straightforward standard to make it possible for the CIA to \n     subject detainees to such practices as sensory deprivation, \n     mock execution and simulated drowning. The constitutional \n     amendments, he told the committee, technically do not apply \n     to foreigners held abroad; therefore, in the administration's \n     view the torture treaty does not bind intelligence \n     interrogators operating on foreign soil. ``The Department of \n     Justice has concluded,'' he wrote, that ``there is no legal \n     prohibition under the Convention Against Torture on cruel, \n     inhuman or degrading treatment with respect to aliens \n     overseas.''\n       According to most legal experts, this is a gross distortion \n     of the law. The Senate cited the constitutional amendments in \n     ratifying the treaty precisely to set a clear standard that \n     could be applied to foreigners. Nevertheless, Mr. Gonzales \n     uses this false loophole to justify practices that contravene \n     fundamental American standards. He was asked if there were \n     any legal prohibition against U.S. personnel using simulated \n     drowning and mock executions as well as sleep deprivation, \n     dogs to inspire fear, hooding, forced nudity, the forced \n     injection of mood-altering drugs and the threat of sending a \n     detainee to another country for torture, among other abuses. \n     He answered: ``Some might . . . be permissible in certain \n     circumstances.''\n       This is not a theoretical matter. The CIA today is holding \n     an undetermined number of prisoners, believed to be in the \n     dozens, in secret facilities in foreign countries. It has \n     provided no account of them or their treatment to any outside \n     body, and it has allowed no visits by the Red Cross. \n     According to numerous media reports, it has subjected the \n     prisoners to many of the abuses Mr. Gonzales said ``might be \n     permissible.'' It has practiced such mistreatment in Iraq, \n     even though detainees there are covered by the Geneva \n     Conventions; according to official investigations by the \n     Pentagon, CIA treatment of prisoners there and in Afghanistan \n     contributed to the adoption of illegal methods by military \n     interrogators.\n       In an attempt to close the loophole, Sen. Richard J. Durbin \n     (D-Ill.), Sen. John McCain\n\n[[Page S942]]\n\n     (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) sought to \n     attach an amendment to the intelligence reform legislation \n     last fall specifying that ``no prisoner shall be subject to \n     torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or \n     punishment that is prohibited by the Constitution, laws or \n     treaties of the United States.'' The Senate adopted the \n     provision unanimously. Later, however, it was stripped from \n     the bill at the request of the White House. In his written \n     testimony, Mr. Gonzales affirmed that the provision would \n     have ``provided legal protections to foreign prisoners to \n     which they are not now entitled.'' Senators who supported the \n     amendment consequently face a critical question: If they vote \n     to confirm Mr. Gonzales as the government's chief legal \n     authority, will they not be endorsing the systematic use of \n     ``cruel, inhumane and degrading'' practices by the United \n     States?\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 16, 2005]\n\n                        The Vote on Mr. Gonzales\n\n       Despite a poor performance at his confirmation hearing, \n     Alberto R. Gonzales appears almost certain to be confirmed by \n     the Senate as attorney general. Senators of both parties \n     declared themselves dissatisfied with Mr. Gonzales's lack of \n     responsiveness to questions about his judgments as White \n     House counsel on the detention of foreign prisoners. Some \n     expressed dismay at his reluctance to state that it is \n     illegal for American personnel to use torture, or for the \n     president to order it. A number of senators clearly believe, \n     as we do, that Mr. Gonzales bears partial responsibility for \n     decisions that have led to shocking, systematic and ongoing \n     violations of human rights by the United States. Most \n     apparently intend to vote for him anyway. At a time when \n     nominees for the Cabinet can be disqualified because of their \n     failure to pay taxes on a nanny's salary, this reluctance to \n     hold Mr. Gonzales accountable is shameful. He does not \n     deserve to be confirmed as attorney general.\n       We make this judgment bearing in mind the president's \n     prerogative to choose his own cabinet, a privilege to which \n     we deferred four years ago when President Bush nominated John \n     D. Ashcroft to lead the Justice Department. In some important \n     respects, Mr. Gonzales is a more attractive figure than Mr. \n     Ashcroft. His personal story as a Hispanic American is \n     inspiring, and he appears less ideological and \n     confrontational than the outgoing attorney general. Mr. \n     Gonzales is also not the only official implicated in the \n     torture and abuse of detainees. Other senior officials played \n     a larger role in formulating and implementing the policies, \n     and Mr. Bush is ultimately responsible for them. It is \n     nevertheless indisputable that Mr. Gonzales oversaw and \n     approved a decision to disregard the Geneva Conventions for \n     detainees from Afghanistan; that he endorsed interrogation \n     methods that military and FBI professionals regarded as \n     illegal and improper; and that he supported the indefinite \n     detention of both foreigners and Americans without due \n     process. To confirm such an official as attorney general is \n     to ratify decisions that are at odds with fundamental \n     American values.\n       Mr. Gonzales's defenders argue that his position on the \n     Geneva Conventions amounted to a judgment that captured \n     members of al Qaeda did not deserve official status as \n     prisoners of war. If that had been his recommendation, then \n     the United States never would have suffered the enormous \n     damage to its global prestige caused by the detention of \n     foreigners at the Guantanamo Bay prison. In fact, the White \n     House counsel endorsed the view that the hundreds of \n     combatants rounded up by U.S. and allied forces in \n     Afghanistan, who included members of the Taliban army, \n     foreign volunteers and a few innocent bystanders, as well as \n     al Qaeda militants, could be collectively and \n     indiscriminately denied Geneva protections without the \n     individual hearings that the treaty provides for. That \n     judgment, which has been ruled illegal by a federal court, \n     resulted in hundreds of detainees being held for two years \n     without any legal process. In addition to blackening the \n     reputation of the United States, the policy opened the way to \n     last year's decision by the Supreme Court, which ruled that \n     the prisoners were entitled to appeal their detentions in \n     federal courts. The court also ruled that an American \n     citizen could not be detained and held as an ``enemy \n     combatant'' without court review or the right to counsel, \n     invalidating Mr. Gonzales's position in the cases of Yaser \n     Esam Hamdi and Jose Padilla.\n       Mr. Gonzales made a second bad judgment about the Geneva \n     Conventions: that their restrictions on interrogations were \n     ``obsolete.'' Quite apart from the question of POW status for \n     detainees, this determination invalidated the Army's doctrine \n     for questioning enemy prisoners, which is based on the Geneva \n     Conventions and had proved its worth over decades. Mr. \n     Gonzales ignored the many professional experts, ranging from \n     the Army's own legal corps to Secretary of State Colin L. \n     Powell, who told him that existing interrogation practices \n     were effective and that setting them aside would open the way \n     to abuses and invite retaliation against Americans. Instead, \n     during meetings in his office from which these professionals \n     were excluded, he supported the use of such methods as \n     ``waterboarding,'' which causes an excruciating sensation of \n     drowning. Though initially approved for use by the CIA \n     against al Qaeda, illegal techniques such as these quickly \n     were picked up by military interrogators at Guantanamo and \n     later in Afghanistan and Iraq. Several official \n     investigations have confirmed that in the absence of a clear \n     doctrine--the standing one having been declared \n     ``obsolete''--U.S. personnel across the world felt empowered \n     to use methods that most lawyers, and almost all the \n     democratic world, regard as torture.\n       Mr. Gonzales stated for the record at his hearing that he \n     opposes torture. Yet he made no effort to separate himself \n     from legal judgments that narrowed torture's definition so \n     much as to authorize such methods as waterboarding for use by \n     the CIA abroad. Despite the revision of a Justice Department \n     memo on torture, he and the administration he represents \n     continue to regard those practices as legal and continue to \n     condone slightly milder abuse, such as prolonged sensory \n     deprivation and the use of dogs, for Guantanamo. As Mr. \n     Gonzales confirmed at his hearing, U.S. obligations under an \n     anti-torture convention mean that the methods at Guantanamo \n     must be allowable under the Fifth, Eighth and 14th amendments \n     of the U.S. Constitution. According to the logic of the \n     attorney general nominee, federal authorities could deprive \n     American citizens of sleep, isolate them in cold cells while \n     bombarding them with unpleasant noises and interrogate them \n     20 hours a day while the prisoners were naked and hooded, all \n     without violating the Constitution. Senators who vote to \n     ratify Mr. Gonzales's nomination will bear the responsibility \n     of ratifying such views as legitimate.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, while I have voted in favor of President \nBush's other Cabinet nominees, I stand in strong principled opposition \nto the confirmation of Mr. Gonzales.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nJudge Alberto Gonzales to be the next Attorney General of the United \nStates of America. Based on my relationship with him over the last 4 \nyears, I am certain he will make an outstanding Attorney General for \nall of the people in the United States.\n  Judge Gonzales has the education, experience, and character to make \nan excellent Attorney General. I know this to be the case because I \nhave worked closely with him virtually every week, and many times every \nday, for 4 years on many issues, including terrorism and judicial \nnominations. I can tell my colleagues that he is a good man, and he is \nmore than up to facing this challenging assignment.\n  Before making a few remarks in support of this nomination, I want to \nagain commend the many contributions of Attorney General Ashcroft. We \nall owe him a debt of gratitude for working so hard over the last 4 \nyears to make America safer for all of our citizens.\n  Unfortunately, but perhaps not unexpectedly, the Gonzales nomination \nhas become as contentious as the nomination of Attorney General \nAshcroft. I can only hope that once Judge Gonzales is sworn in as \nAttorney General, his opponents will work with him in good faith in the \ninterest of the American people.\n  I have been here over the last 2 days as some of my colleagues have \ngone on at great length about what they misleadingly allege is the Bush \nadministration torture policy and how Judge Gonzales acted to condone \ntorture. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  They attempt to make him responsible for a memo he did not write, \nprepared by an office he did not run, in a department in which he did \nnot work, and they claim he gave advice that President Bush did not \nfollow, which, of course, he did not.\n  In fact, the memo Judge Gonzales did not write was written by a \nperson he did not supervise in a department in which he did not work \nand which was ultimately rescinded in July of 2004 and later replaced \nby a new memorandum.\n  In his effort to oppose the Gonzales nomination, my good friend from \nMassachusetts has now even tried to give a new name to the Bybee \nmemorandum. This week, for the first time, the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts actually called it the Bybee-Gonzales memo.\n  I said it before, and I will say it again. Judge Gonzales did not \nwrite the memo. Yet his name is added to Bybee as if he were a \ncoauthor. Somehow holding Judge Gonzales responsible for a memo he \nreceived is not fair.\n\n[[Page S943]]\n\n  Apparently, all Judge Gonzales did was ask a very important question \nof the entity within the Department of Justice, the Office of Legal \nCounsel, whose job it is to answer such inquiries. Is that a crime? \nJust because you ask for information does not mean you will agree with \nthe information you receive.\n  Most importantly, we know the administration's policy. They have been \nvery clear. The President has been clear. Judge Gonzales has been \nclear: No torture. That is their position. It has always been their \nposition. Treat all detainees humanely, even those such as captured al-\nQaida suspects who are not covered by the Geneva Conventions.\n  Regardless of what the rescinded and replaced Bybee memo says about \nthe law, the bottom line is that the President never authorized or \nacquiesced in the use of torture. He never ordered torture. The \nFebruary 7, 2002, memorandum that precedes the Bybee memo by months \nmakes that clear. Judge Gonzales also never recommended torture.\n  The President made clear that regardless of whether there might be a \ntheoretical right to override the Convention Against Torture, he was \nnot and is not authorizing torture.\n  Several Senators correctly argued that no one is above the law. I \nagree with that. Judge Gonzales has also made clear that no man, \nincluding the President, is above the law. The President and Judge \nGonzales never said the President could override the Convention Against \nTorture.\n  There has been some discussion at the nomination hearing in the \nJudiciary Committee and on the floor of the Senate about whether a \nPresident's independent duty to preserve, protect, and defend the \nConstitution of the United States might one day require a President not \nto enforce a statute enacted by Congress but viewed by the President \nas unconstitutional.\n\n  I want to discuss this matter a little further.\n  Although President Bush has clearly not to date exercised this \nauthority--if it, indeed, does exist--some are criticizing Judge \nGonzales's views of this power saying they are somehow out of the \nmainstream, dangerous, or even reflecting a profound disrespect for the \nrule of law.\n  Let me respond to the arguments made by several Judiciary Committee \nDemocrats who say Judge Gonzales somehow believes the President is \nabove the law, or that the President can pick and choose the laws or \nstandards he will follow.\n  Specifically, my esteemed colleague from Vermont, the ranking \nminority leader of our committee, has asserted that Judge Gonzales has \n``indicated that he views the President to have the power to override \nour law and, apparently, to immunize others to perform what would \notherwise be unlawful acts. This is about as extreme a view of \nExecutive power as I have ever heard. I believe it is not only dead \nwrong, as a constitutional matter, but extremely dangerous. The rule of \nlaw applies to the President, even this President.''\n  I have looked closely at Judge Gonzales's opinion on this issue, and \nI can tell you he is being wrongly criticized.\n  Let me talk about Judge Gonzales's position on Presidential \nauthority.\n  It should go without debate that Judge Gonzales has specifically \nrejected that portion of the August 1, 2002, Office of Legal Counsel \nmemorandum which asserted that the President, as Commander in Chief, \npossessed the constitutional authority in certain circumstances to \ndisregard the Federal criminal prohibition against torture. He \nemphatically stated in his confirmation hearing that the memorandum has \n``been withdrawn. It has been rejected, including that section \nregarding the Commander in Chief's authority to ignore the criminal \nstatutes. So it has been rejected by the executive branch. I \ncategorically reject it. . . . [T]his administration does not engage in \ntorture and will not condone torture.''\n  That is what Judge Gonzales has already said, and every member of the \ncommittee knows that. So why would they come here and say he said \notherwise when, in fact, that is explicit?\n  I should also point out that Judge Gonzales made it very clear that \nno man, including the President, is above the law. If confirmed as \nAttorney General, I have no doubt that he will remain faithful to his \noath to defend the laws of the United States.\n  At the same time, however, Judge Gonzales has appropriately \nrecognized that the President, consistent with his oath to preserve, \nprotect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, as well as \nlongstanding historical practice, may in rare circumstances conclude \nthat a statute is unconstitutional. This is not new or even surprising. \nWhat is significant to me is that Judge Gonzales recognizes the gravity \nand limitation of this practice.\n  When my colleagues learn more about Judge Gonzales's views on this \nmatter, I believe most will agree with him.\n  In his written answers to questions posed by Senators, Judge Gonzales \nnoted that a decision to disregard a statute on constitutional grounds \nis an extremely serious matter and should be undertaken with \nconsiderable caution and care and only in extraordinary circumstances.\n\n  In response to my friend from Vermont, Senator Leahy, Judge Gonzales \nemphasized:\n\n       I would be reticent to conclude that statutes passed [by \n     Congress] are unconstitutional and would make every \n     reasonable effort if I am confirmed as Attorney General to \n     uphold and defend those statutes.\n\n  That is what a good lawyer would do.\n  Similarly, in responding to a question from my learned friend on the \ncommittee, the Senator from Illinois, Judge Gonzales stated:\n\n       For a President to consider whether or not to ignore a \n     particular law as unconstitutional, however, would pose a \n     question of extraordinary gravity and difficulty. I would \n     approach such a question with a great deal of care.\n\n  During his confirmation hearing, Judge Gonzales rendered his opinion \non this delicate issue when he stated the following:\n\n       I think that . . . the executive branch should always look \n     very carefully with a great deal of seriousness and care \n     about reaching a decision that a statute passed by Congress \n     is somehow unconstitutional and should not be followed. \n     Certainly if I were confirmed, I would take my oath very, \n     very seriously to try to defend any act passed by Congress, \n     but it does appear to me, based upon my review of the history \n     and precedent . . . that Presidents and White Houses on both \n     sides of the aisle have taken the consistent position that a \n     President may choose to not enforce [a] statute that the \n     President believes is unconstitutional.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The President is not above the law. Of course, he is not \n     above the law. But he has an obligation, too. He takes an \n     oath as well. And if Congress passes a law that is \n     unconstitutional, there is a practice and a tradition \n     recognized by Presidents of both parties that he may elect to \n     decide not to enforce that law.\n\n  Again he goes on to say:\n\n       Whether or not the President has the authority in that \n     circumstance to authorize conduct in violation of a criminal \n     statute is a very, very difficult question, as far as I'm \n     concerned. And I think that any discussion relating to this \n     line of reasoning would be one that I would take with a great \n     deal of seriousness, because there is a presumption that the \n     statutes are, in fact, constitutional and should be abided \n     by. And this President does not have a policy or an agenda to \n     execute the war on terror in violation of our criminal \n     statutes.\n\n  That is what he said.\n  These are the statements of a man who understands that no one, \nincluding the President, is ``above the law,'' and that history and \nlegal precedent allows, on the most serious and rarest of occasions, a \nPresident, if he believes a law is unconstitutional, to veto or even \ndisregard such a law. Judge Gonzales appropriately described what we in \nthis body have known for many years and through many administrations, \nboth Republican and Democratic.\n  What if Congress passed a law that was discriminatory against a \nparticular group of people? Now, I do not think Congress is going to do \nthat, but what if it did? Should a President enforce that law knowing \nit is unconstitutional? I think most of us would conclude, no, he \nshould not.\n  Now I want to go through the history and precedents that support \nJudge Gonzales's views regarding Presidential authority. Let me begin \nby pointing out that the Department of Justice's view that the \nPresident, in rare circumstances, may decline to enforce statutes that \nhe finds to be unconstitutional is consistent with the position taken \nby the Justice Department in administrations of both parties for over \n100 years.\n\n[[Page S944]]\n\n  In the 19th century, both James Buchanan's and Abraham Lincoln's \nAttorneys General argued that the President possesses the authority, \nunder certain circumstances, to decline to enforce or disregard \nstatutory provisions he views as unconstitutional. In 1860, Attorney \nGeneral Jeremiah S. Black explained that ``[e]very law is to be carried \nout so far forth as is consistent with the Constitution, and no \nfurther.'' Thus, ``[t]he sound part of it must be executed, and the \nvicious portion of it suffered to drop.''\n  In 1861, Attorney General Edward Bates echoed this view when, in \nanswering a question from the Secretary of the Interior as to whether \nthe executive branch had the power ``to examine and decide upon the \nvalidity of an act of Congress, and to disregard its provisions,'' he \nadvised that in cases where the conflict between the Constitution and a \nstatute is ``plain and obvious,'' officials in the executive branch \n``must disregard [the] statute.'' They may not, Attorney General Bates \nexplained, ``disregard the Constitution, for that is the supreme law.''\n  In the 20th century, Democratic and Republican administrations \nconsistently maintained that the President, in rare circumstances, may \ndecline to enforce statutes he believes to be unconstitutional.\n  In 1918, Acting Attorney General John W. Davis of the Wilson \nadministration agreed with the advice given by Attorney General Bates \nmore than 50 years earlier that the President may decline to enforce a \nstatute when its conflict with the Constitution is ``plain and \nobvious.''\n  My gosh, this is elementary law. I think almost anybody would have to \nagree with these conclusions, except somebody who just does not know \nelementary law or does not know constitutional law at all.\n  The Carter administration also took the position that the President \nmay decline to enforce in certain circumstances statutes he viewed as \nunconstitutional. Carter administration Attorney General Benjamin \nCiviletti recognized that ``the Executive's duty to execute the law \nembraces a duty to enforce a fundamental law set forth in the \nConstitution as well as a duty to enforce the law founded in the Acts \nof Congress, and cases arise in which the duty to the one precludes the \nduty to the other.''\n  He therefore instructed in 1980 that the Education Department could \nimplement regulations that Congress had already disapproved through the \nuse of the legislative veto because the administration believed the \nstatute authorizing the legislative veto to be unconstitutional.\n  Attorney General Civiletti, a Democrat in a Democratic \nadministration, even went so far as to advise that the President could \ndisregard a statutory provision forbidding the executive branch from \nexpending money to implement regulations disapproved by legislative \nveto. Now, this is very significant because disregarding such a \nprovision would constitute a violation of the Antideficiency Act, which \ncarries with it criminal penalties.\n\n  The Carter administration's Office of Legal Counsel also took the \nposition that ``the President's duty to uphold the Constitution carries \nwith it a prerogative to disregard unconstitutional statutes.'' It \ntherefore advised that if the unconstitutionality of a statute was \ncertain, then ``the Executive could decline to enforce the statute for \nthat reason alone.''\n  During the Reagan administration, Attorney General William French \nSmith also took the position that the President possesses the authority \nto disregard statutes he viewed as unconstitutional deviations from the \nseparation of powers set forth in the Constitution.\n  In explaining President Reagan's decision to disregard certain \nprovisions in the Competition in Contracting Act that he believed to be \nunconstitutional, Attorney General Smith stated the President's \ndecision was ``based on the fact that in addition to the duty of the \nPresident to uphold the Constitution in the context of the enforcement \nof Acts of Congress, the President also has the constitutional duty to \nprotect the Presidency from encroachment by the other branches.''\n  In the George H. W. Bush administration, the Office of Legal Counsel \nconcluded in three separate opinions that the President could choose to \ndisregard statutes that infringed on his constitutional authority. \nFirst, in 1990 the Office of Legal Counsel noted that ``[t]he \nDepartment of Justice in modern times has . . . consistently advised \nthat the Constitution authorizes the President to refuse to enforce a \nlaw that he believes is unconstitutional.''\n  In another issue that occurred in 1992 which involved a statute that \nlimited the President's ability to issue more than one passport to U.S. \nGovernment personnel, the Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the \nPresident was ``constitutionally authorized to decline to enforce \n[it]'' because it ``interfere[d] with the `plenary and exclusive' power \nof the President to conduct foreign affairs.''\n  In the Clinton administration, the Office of Legal Counsel in 1994 \nreaffirmed the view that ``there are circumstances in which the \nPresident may appropriately decline to enforce a statute that he views \nas unconstitutional.'' In particular, that Clinton Office of Legal \nCounsel in the Justice Department explained that ``[w]here the \nPresident believes that [a statute] unconstitutionally limits its \npowers,'' ``he has the authority to defend his office and decline to \nabide by [the statute], unless he is convinced that the [Supreme] Court \nwould disagree with his assessment.''\n  In the Clinton administration, the Office of Legal Counsel noted that \nthe Department of Justice in the Carter, Reagan, and Bush \nadministrations had consistently advised that ``the Constitution \nprovides [the President] with the authority to decline to enforce a \nclearly unconstitutional law,'' and we reaffirm that ``this advice \n[was] consistent with the views of the Framers.''\n  Let me also point out that the view that the President, in rare \noccasions, may decline to enforce a law that unconstitutionally \nrestricts his authority has also been consistently embraced by \nPresidents of both parties. Let me give a few examples.\n\n  In 1920, President Wilson announced that he would refuse to carry out \na provision in the Jones Merchant Marine Act directing him to terminate \ncertain tariff-related treaty provisions because he considered such a \nrequirement to be unconstitutional.\n  President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in signing an appropriations act in \n1955 that contained a legislative veto provision, stated that any \nlegislative veto would ``be regarded as invalid by the executive branch \nof the Government . . . unless otherwise determined by a court of \ncompetent jurisdiction.''\n  Similarly, Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy \nCarter, and Ronald Reagan later issued similar signing statements \nregarding the invalidity of legislation containing legislative veto \nprovisions.\n  Moreover, Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford announced in \nsigning statements that they would disregard legislative provisions \nrequiring that a congressional committee approve the exercise of \nExecutive authority, and they should have. In fact, according to one \nhistorian's survey, it is estimated that from 1789 to 1981, there were \nat least 20 instances where Presidents had failed to comply with \nstatutory provisions they viewed as unconstitutional.\n  In these cases, Presidents have disregarded statutes that they \nbelieved intruded on, among other powers, their Appointments Clause \npowers, Recommendations Clause powers, removal powers, foreign affairs \npowers, pardon powers, and powers as Commander in Chief. Such \nPresidents include James Buchanan, Chester Arthur, Grover Cleveland, \nWilliam Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Dwight \nEisenhower, Lyndon Johnson, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald \nReagan.\n  In at least four of these cases, Presidents refused to follow the law \nbecause they believed it to infringe their powers as Commander in \nChief. In 1860, President Buchanan disregarded a law requiring an Army \nCorps of Engineers project to be supervised by a particular captain, \nreasoning that this requirement intruded on his powers as Commander in \nChief. Likewise, Presidents Ford, Carter, and Reagan disregarded \nvarious provisions of the War Powers Act, arguing that certain \nconsultation, notification, and termination provisions contained in the \nact infringed upon their constitutional authority as Commander in \nChief.\n\n[[Page S945]]\n\n  Finally, I want to draw particular attention to the holdings of the \nU.S. Supreme Court which has implicitly agreed with the view that the \nPresident, in extraordinary circumstances, has the authority to decline \nto enforce statutes that he views as unconstitutional when he believes \nthat such statutes intrude upon the constitutional prerogatives of the \nPresidency. In 1926, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld President Wilson's \ndecision to remove a postmaster from office in violation of a statute \nrequiring him to first obtain the Senate's consent. The Court held that \nthe statute in question constituted an unconstitutional limitation on \nthe President's power to remove executive officers, and thus that the \nremoval of the postmaster without the Senate's consent was legal. This \nis the teaching of the case of Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 \n(1926).\n  Most notably, not a single member of the Court in Myers found or even \nsuggested that the President had exceeded his authority or acted \nimproperly by refusing to comply with what he viewed as an \nunconstitutional statute. As a result, the Clinton administration's \nOffice of Legal Counsel concluded that:\n\n     [t]he [Supreme] Court in Myers can be seen to have implicitly \n     vindicated the view that the President may refuse to comply \n     with a statute that limits his constitutional powers if he \n     believes it is unconstitutional.\n\n  More recently, four Supreme Court Justices have explicitly endorsed \nthe position that the President may refuse to obey statutes he believes \nto be unconstitutional. In the 1991 case of Freytag v. Commissioner, \nJustice Scalia, in an opinion joined by Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and \nSouter, explicitly stated that ``the means [available to a President] \nto resist legislative encroachment'' upon his power include ``the power \nto veto encroaching laws, or even to disregard them when they are \nunconstitutional.''\n  Consequently, there should be no hesitation regarding Judge \nGonzales's responses to and analyses of this area of the law. He would \nbe derelict were he to not acknowledge that there was indeed, in rare \ncircumstances, precedents for a President to find a statute \nunconstitutional. It is unfair and unjustified to criticize this \nnominee for his accurate and, as I have just pointed out in some \ndetail, traditional legal analysis of this issue. On top of that, these \ncriticisms have ignored Judge Gonzales's very firm resolve that no man \nis above the law and that the President himself is not above the law. \nSooner or later in this body we have to take people at their word. \nHaving spent 4 years working with Judge Gonzales, I think you can take \nhim at his word. I know you can.\n\n  I hope that this discussion puts to rest the erroneous suggestion \nthat somehow Judge Gonzales holds some perverted view of the reach of \nthe power of the President. President Bush certainly has never felt the \nneed to assert this authority over the last 4 years which makes it hard \nto understand why it has become an issue in the Gonzales confirmation.\n  Of course, Judge Gonzales respects the law. Here is a man who was a \njustice on the Texas Supreme Court, where it was his job every day to \nuphold the law and mete out justice. He practiced law with one of the \nmost prestigious law firms in the United State, Vinson and Elkins.\n  Here is a man who served honorably for his Country in the United \nStates Air Force. Here is a man who was Texas's Secretary of State. And \nsome of my colleagues say they will vote against him because he does \nnot have the proper respect for the law. I simply do not understand \nthis.\n  We know that Judge Gonzales is fully capable of acting independent of \nthe President. It is not as if this will be the first time Judge \nGonzales will be in a job that requires independence from President \nBush. When he was a justice of the Texas Supreme Court, he was \nindependent. At that time, he was no longer representing the interests \nof a Governor, he was representing the judicial system. He was \nupholding the law for those in Texas.\n  To suggest that he does not know how to exert his own opinions is \noffensive. He has done it before and he will do it again.\n  To those who criticize Judge Gonzales's responsiveness to questions \nsubmitted by the committee, let me just say this. When President \nClinton nominated Janet Reno for the position of the next Attorney \nGeneral, she was presented with 35 questions by the committee. We \nconfirmed her--and I personally voted for her even though she did not \nrespond to any of those questions prior to the vote. In fact, she did \nnot submit her responses until 8 months after she was confirmed. We \ndidn't rake her over the coals. We didn't send her 500 questions that \nrequired 250 pages of single-spaced answers. In contrast, Judge \nGonzales responded to over 450 questions within 2 business days. He \nthen responded to several series of additional questions over the next \nweeks. In total, he submitted 250 pages of single-spaced written \nresponses to 500 questions posed by members of the Judiciary Committee. \nTo claim that we do not know enough about his policy views simply is \nnot supported by the voluminous record.\n  We didn't know anything about Janet Reno's policy views. We supported \nher because she was the nominee of the President and we believed her to \nbe a good person and that she could do the job.\n  There is no excuse for people not supporting Judge Gonzales as the \nnominee of the President, because he is a good person and he has more \nthan convinced any reasonable person that he can do this job.\n  Judge Gonzales is someone with whom I have worked very closely on \nmany difficult issues during President Bush's first term. I didn't know \nhim before President Bush was elected--at least I don't remember having \nmet him. But I know him very well since he was appointed as White House \nCounsel. He is a first rate attorney. He is a straight shooter. He has \nalways told it like it is, and he will tell it like it is. He is \nhonest, hard working, intelligent, and experienced and he has said that \nhe understands these principles.\n  He understands the difference between being Attorney General and the \nWhite House Chief Counsel. He understands that he represents all the \npeople in America as Attorney General.\n  He came up the hard way and he is his own man. I am proud to know \nhim. I am proud to have worked with him. I believe in the man. I \nbelieve he will do a great job. And I believe it is time for us to \ntreat him with a little more respect than we have in the past.\n  I thank my colleague from Michigan. I know he probably wants to \nspeak. I spoke at length. I apologize for that. But I thank him for his \ngraciousness as he always listens to me, and to others as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Utah.\n  Mr. President, I will vote against the nomination of Alberto Gonzales \ntoday because of the central role he played in establishing the legal \nframework that set the stage for the torture and mistreatment of \npersons in U.S. custody. That framework ignored prohibitions in our law \nand our international obligations. Of immense significance, this legal \nframework endangered American troops by making them more vulnerable to \nlike treatment.\n  The shocking photographs of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison--\nimages of a hooded man connected to electric wires, prisoners on dog \nleashes, naked men in so-called stress positions, and beaten, \nhumiliated, or murdered prisoners--are now linked with American \nbehavior. Prisoner abuse in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere has \ndeepened the anger and resentment that some feel toward our country and \nhas given a propaganda club to our enemies.\n  Longstanding legal prohibitions against torture and inhumane \ntreatment are pivotal to the protection of American troops engaged in \ncombat outside the United States, because upholding our commitments to \ninternational prohibitions against torture and inhumane treatment gives \nus the moral and legal standing to demand that others refrain from \ntorturing or mistreating American service men and women in their \ncustody and to enforce those demands.\n  Our top military lawyers, including the Legal Adviser to the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Army's Judge Advocate General, \nexpressed reservations and concerns at various times during the \ndevelopment of the administration's legal policies\n\n[[Page S946]]\n\nregarding the handling of detainees. Military lawyers warned against \ndeviating from the standards of the Geneva Conventions. Military \nlawyers also reportedly argued against tough interrogation techniques \nadvocated by civilian attorneys saying such tactics would violate \nestablished military practice and, if revealed, would provoke public \ncondemnation both at home and abroad. In the end, Judge Gonzales sided \nwith the civilian attorneys in opposing the recommendations of our \nSenior military lawyers.\n  Also, a group of 12 retired senior military officers, including \nformer Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired Army General John \nShalikashvili, took the highly-unusual step of writing the Senate \nJudiciary Committee a letter critical of Judge Gonzales. They expressed \ndeep concern in particular over his role ``in shaping U.S. detention \nand interrogation operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Guantanamo Bay, and \nelsewhere.'' Those retired military officers stated, ``Today, it is \nclear that these operations have fostered greater animosity toward the \nUnited States, undermined our intelligence gathering efforts, and added \nto the risks facing our troops serving around the world.'' They also \nstated that Judge Gonzales's positions were ``on the wrong side of \nhistory.''\n  Judge Gonzales's personal history is inspiring. However, it is not \nenough to qualify someone to hold the office of Attorney General of the \nUnited States. The Attorney General is our chief law enforcement \nofficer, the leader of the Department of Justice, and the first arbiter \nof our laws. We rely on the Attorney General to help maintain the rule \nof law in this country.\n\n  The rule of law seriously broke down in our treatment of prisoners. \nThe Defense Department's own investigations show that abuses of \ndetainees were not restricted to the acts of a few lower-ranking \nReservists working the night shift at Abu Ghraib prison. They were \nwidespread. The panel chaired by former Secretary of Defense James \nSchlesinger which examined the causes of these abuses found in their \nAugust 2004 report that ``There is both institutional and personal \nresponsibility at higher levels.''\n  At two critical decision points, Judge Gonzales was at the center of \nthe administration's development of an overly aggressive legal \nframework for the interrogation of detainees. Their policies broke with \nlong-standing legal doctrine regarding the treatment of detainees and \nexceeded the limits of the law regarding permissible interrogation \ntechniques. In doing so, Judge Gonzales contributed to creating an \nenvironment in which the systematic and abusive behavior toward \ndetainees in U.S. custody was either permitted or was perceived to be \npermitted.\n  The first critical point at which Judge Gonzales played a role was in \nformulating the Administration's policy regarding the status of al-\nQaida and Taliban combatants under the Geneva Conventions on the \nTreatment of Prisoners of War.\n  Judge Gonzales's view of the Geneva Conventions was revealed in his \nJanuary 25, 2002, draft memorandum to the President. In that \nmemorandum, Judge Gonzales advised the President against agreeing to \nSecretary of State Powell's request that the President reconsider his \ndetermination that the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners \nof War does not apply to either al-Qaida or the Taliban. The State \nDepartment's position at the time, according to the Schlesinger panel \nreport, was that the Geneva Conventions' legal regime was \n``sufficiently robust'' for effectively waging the Global War on \nTerrorism. The Schlesinger panel also stated, ``The Legal Adviser to \nthe Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff and many service lawyers agreed \nwith'' the State Department.\n  Judge Gonzales, on the other hand, argued that the situation America \nfaced after September 11th rendered ``obsolete Geneva's strict \nlimitations on questioning of enemy prisoners . . .'' and that other \nprovisions of the Convention were rendered ``quaint.''\n  Judge Gonzales's January 25, 2002, memo could have simply advised \nthat the protections of the Geneva Conventions do not apply to al-Qaida \nand Taliban fighters, if that were his conclusion. He went beyond that. \nInstead he denigrated the Geneva Conventions where they do apply.\n  To say that the Geneva Conventions are obsolete and quaint is wrong \nand dangerously so. Judge Gonzales tried to evade the impact of his own \nmemo when he told the Senate Judiciary Committee at his confirmation \nhearing, ``Contrary to reports, I consider the Geneva Conventions \nneither obsolete nor quaint.'' But these were not ``reports.'' These \nwere Judge Gonzales's own words in his own memo. The tone set by those \nwords and the approach of that memo helped put in place an environment \nwhich spawned prisoner abuse. It was a tone that was heard around the \nworld.\n  Consistent with Judge Gonzales's January 2002 memo, the President \ndetermined on February 7, 2002, that the Geneva Convention on the \nTreatment of Prisoners of War does not apply to the conflict with al-\nQaida, and that because Taliban combatants were ``unlawful combatants'' \nthey were not entitled to POW status under the Convention and would not \nbe protected by the Geneva Conventions. The President determined \ninstead that ``to the extent appropriate and consistent with military \nnecessity,'' detainees would be treated ``in a manner consistent with \nthe principles of Geneva.''\n  The President's February 7, 2002, determination created a legal \nvacuum--a never-never land for detainees in our custody. His \ndetermination and implementing procedures did not identify which \nprinciples of the Geneva Conventions would continued to be followed. \nFurthermore, the President's decision that the principles of Geneva \nwould be followed was qualified by the words ``to the extent \nappropriate and consistent with military necessity,'' a qualification \nso broad and vague as to render the pledge to follow the principles of \nGeneva nearly meaningless. Major General George Fay, who investigated \ndetainee abuses by military intelligence personnel at Abu Ghraib \nprison, found in his August 2004 report that, ``Specific regulatory or \nprocedural guidance concerning either `humane' treatment or `abuse' was \nnot available in the context of [the Global War on Terrorism] and the \nrecently promulgated national policies.'' The vacuum General Fay \nreferred to was created at the top. Judge Gonzales has a major role in \nthat creation. He was present at the creation.\n  Judge Gonzales has adamantly denied any relationship between his \nadvice to the President, and the Presidential decision which followed, \nand the horrendous abuses at Abu Ghraib prison. But the Defense \nDepartment's own investigations found a connection to the abuses in \nIraq.\n  The Schlesinger panel found that the Command Headquarters in Iraq, \nCombined Joint Task Force-7, used ``reasoning from the President's \nMemorandum of February 7, 2002'' in approving the use of \nadditional, ``tougher'' interrogation techniques beyond those approved \nunder existing Army doctrine. Major General Fay's August 2004 report \nsaid that ``National policy and DOD directives were not completely \nconsistent with Army doctrine'' on detainee treatment and \ninterrogation, ``resulting in CJTF-7 interrogation . . . policies and \npractices that lacked basis in Army interrogation doctrine.'' He added \nthat ``as a result,'' interrogators at Abu Ghraib used non-standard \ninterrogation techniques that ``conflicted with other DOD and Army \nregulatory, doctrinal and procedural guidance.''\n\n  Clearly, there was a change in signals from the top about the \ntreatment and interrogation of captured adversaries. This, combined \nwith the failure of ``national policies'' to provide specific guidance \non ``humane'' treatment, helped produce a more lawless environment \nwhich contributed to the mistreatment of enemy prisoners at Abu Ghraib \nand elsewhere.\n  The second point at which Judge Gonzales played a central role was \nthe administration's effort to push the limits regarding permissible \ninterrogation techniques for use against enemy prisoners. It was Judge \nGonzales who requested the flawed legal memorandum by the Justice \nDepartment's Office of Legal Counsel, or OLC, interpreting the scope of \nthe Federal anti-torture statute, 18 U.S.C. 2430-2430A. Congress had \nenacted this criminal statute in 1994 to implement U.S. obligations as \na party to the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \nDegrading Treatment or Punishment. The anti-torture statute prohibits \nany person from committing or attempting to\n\n[[Page S947]]\n\ncommit torture, which is defined in the statute as ``an act . . . under \nthe color of law specifically intended to inflict severe physical or \nmental pain or suffering . . . upon another person within his custody \nor physical control.''\n  But the OLC memorandum provided in response to Judge Gonzales's \nrequest, the so-called ``Torture Memorandum'' of August 1, 2002, \nsignificantly weakened the prohibition in the statute by asserting in \neffect that ``Physical pain amounting to torture,'' doesn't count as \ntorture unless it is ``equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying \nserious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily \nfunctions or even death.'' Mental pain or suffering amounting to \ntorture doesn't count unless it causes ``significant psychological harm \nof significant duration,'' that is, months or years. The memorandum \nalso interpreted the ``specific intent'' requirement in the statute to \nmean that even if a person knows ``that severe pain will result from \nhis actions, if causing such harm is not his objective,'' then he is \nnot guilty of torture.\n  The legal reasoning employed by the Office of Legal Counsel has no \nbasis in military law, the legislative history of the Federal anti-\ntorture Statute, or the Convention Against Torture.\n  More importantly, it should have been apparent when the OLC \nMemorandum was received by Judge Gonzales in the summer of 2002 that \nits definition of torture, as well as other sections, were flawed. At \nhis confirmation hearing, Judge Gonzales was asked, ``Wasn't it obvious \nto you that someone can suffer physical pain without being in danger of \norgan failure? . . . Wouldn't the removal of fingers, for example, fall \noutside the [memorandum's] definition of torture . . . ?'' Judge \nGonzales responded, ``Obviously, things like cutting off fingers, to me \nthat sounds like torture. . . .'' That is the Judge Gonzales at his \nconfirmation hearing--very different from the Judge Gonzales in 2002, \nwhen the tone was set in memos to him and from him.\n  When the Torture Memorandum was finally leaked to the press in early \nJune 2004, it shocked the American people and the world. The \nadministration quickly disavowed the memorandum and the Department of \nJustice undertook to review all of the OLC's legal advice relating to \ninterrogations. Finally, on December 30, 2004, shortly before Judge \nGonzales's nomination hearings, the OLC issued a legal opinion \nsuperceding the 2002 memorandum.\n  What impact did the Office of Legal Counsel's August 1, 2002 \nMemorandum have on the interrogation of enemy prisoners in U.S. custody \nduring the nearly 2 years that it was official U.S. policy? The \ninvestigative reports received by the Armed Services Committee show \nthat OLC's legal opinions provided the legal framework for the Defense \nDepartment's approval of a number of additional interrogation \ntechniques, beyond those in standard Army doctrine, for use with enemy \ncombatants at Guantanamo Bay. These additional, more aggressive \ntechniques eventually migrated to Afghanistan and Iraq, and contributed \nto the prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib.\n\n  On December 2, 2002, Secretary Rumsfeld approved the use of a range \nof ``aggressive'' non-doctrinal interrogation techniques at Guantanamo \nBay, including stress positions, isolation for up to 30 days, 20-hour \ninterrogations, nudity and use of dogs to induce stress. However, in \nresponse to concerns raised by the Navy General Counsel, 1 month later \nSecretary Rumsfeld rescinded his approval and in January 2003 \nestablished an internal Defense Department Working Group to review \ninterrogation techniques for use in the Global War on Terrorism.\n  According to the Schlesinger panel report, this Defense Department \nWorking Group ``relied heavily'' on the OLC's legal opinions for the \nlegal framework for its review of interrogation techniques. Much of the \nlegal analysis in the Working Group's April 4, 2003 report was drawn \ndirectly from the OLC Torture Memorandum.\n  The Defense Department Working Group reviewed and recommended \napproval of 35 interrogation techniques for use against unlawful \ncombatants outside the United States, all of which it deemed legally \navailable subject to certain conditions. Eighteen of these were \ntechniques not found in the standard Army doctrine of Field Manual 34-\n52. Of this group, the Working Group designated nine to be \n``exceptional'' techniques that should only be used with the approval \nof the Secretary of Defense. These included isolation, prolonged \ninterrogations, sleep deprivation, nudity, and increasing anxiety by \nthe use of a detainee's aversions, for example, the use of dogs. Many \nof these are the same techniques that had been approved by Secretary \nRumsfeld for use at Guantanamo Bay in December 2002.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld issued a new memorandum on April 16, 2003, \napproving 24 interrogations techniques for use on unlawful combatants \nat Guantanamo Bay, 7 more than contained in standard Army interrogation \ndoctrine. Even though Secretary Rumsfeld approved only one \n``exceptional'' technique from the Working Group's report, specifically \nisolation, other ``exceptional'' interrogation techniques recommended \nby the Working Group migrated to Afghanistan and Iraq. According to the \nreport of General Fay, military officers at the Combined Joint Task \nForce Headquarters in Iraq, CJTF-7, ``relied heavily'' on Guantanamo \nBay operating procedures, provided by Major General Geoffrey Miller, in \nrevising CJTF-7 interrogation policies for the conflict in Iraq.\n  Major General Fay found that, ``By October 2003, interrogation policy \nin Iraq had changed three times in less than thirty days and it became \nvery confusing as to what techniques could be employed and at what \nlevel non-doctrinal approaches had to be approved.'' He went on to say \nthat interrogation techniques beyond those in Army doctrine ``came from \ndocuments and personnel in Afghanistan and Guantanamo. The techniques \nemployed in JTF-GTMO [Joint Task Force-Guantanamo] included the use of \nstress positions, isolation for up to thirty days, removal of clothing, \nand the use of detainees' phobias.''\n  So the prisoner abuse and mistreatment at Abu Ghraib, can be traced \nback to the various Defense Department memoranda approving \n``exceptional'' interrogation techniques and these Defense Department \nmemoranda relied, in turn, on the legal framework set up in the \nopinions of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, including \nthe August 1, 2002 Memorandum. As the Defense Working Group report \nstated regarding the standards applied in evaluating specific \ninterrogation techniques, ``Generally, the legal analysis that was \napplied is that understood to comport with the views of the Department \nof Justice.''\n  The OLC August 1, 2002 memorandum was addressed to Judge Gonzales. In \nhis testimony, Judge Gonzales initially said that he was doing his \n``job as Counsel to the President to ask the question'' regarding the \ndefinition of torture. However, when pressed on the issue later on in \nthe hearing, Judge Gonzales claimed that he couldn't remember if he \nrequested the memo, even though, again, the memo says it is addressed \nto him and was requested by him.\n  At his confirmation hearing, Judge Gonzales disclosed that \ndiscussions leading to the August 2002 memorandum on torture took place \nin his office, that he participated in those discussions, and that he \ngave his views to the OLC, although he could not recall at the hearing \nwhat those views were. When I asked Judge Gonzales in post-hearing \nquestions to consult with his staff or other documents relating to his \nviews at the time of these discussions to refresh his recollection, he \ndeclined to do so, claiming that to do so would involve ``predecisional \ndeliberations'' that he was not free to disclose.\n\n  Judge Gonzales was asked at his confirmation hearing whether he \nagreed with the definition of torture in the August 2002 memorandum on \ntorture. He replied, ``I don't recall today whether or not I was in \nagreement with all of the analysis, but I don't have a disagreement \nwith the conclusions then reached by the Department.'' Later in the \nhearing, he said, ``it's a position that I supported at the time.'' In \nother words, Judge Gonzales concurred in the torture definition and the \nother legal conclusions in the August 2002 memo at the time it was \ncirculated. So, it was only after the memorandum became public and \nelicited outrage that the OLC withdrew it, and the White House, with \nJudge Gonzales out front, withdrew support.\n\n[[Page S948]]\n\n  When asked during his confirmation hearing what were his views on \nwhether specific interrogation techniques might constitute torture \nwithin the meaning of our laws, Judge Gonzales was evasive. He \nacknowledged that he discussed specific interrogation techniques with \nthe OLC. He said that, ``As Counsel to the President, my job was to \nensure that all authorized techniques were presented to the Department \nof Justice, to the lawyers, to verify that they met all legal \nobligations, and I have been told that that is the case.'' He also \nsaid, ``It is of course customary . . . that there would be discussions \nbetween the Department and the Counsel's Office about legal \ninterpretation of, say, a statute that had never been interpreted \nbefore, one that would be extremely emotional, say, if you're talking \nabout what are the limits of torture . . . . And so there was \ndiscussion about that.''\n  When asked what his views were on specific techniques, however, he \ndid everything but give a direct answer. In response to a written \nquestion about what methods he considered to be torture Judge Gonzales \nwrote, ``I do not think it would be prudent for me to address \ninterrogation practices discussed in the press and attempt to analyze \nthem under the prohibitions of [the federal anti-torture statute]. . . \n.'' At another point he said, ``we had some discussions [about specific \ninterrogation techniques] . . . [a]nd I can't tell you today whether or \nnot I said, `That's offensive. That's not offensive.' ''\n  Judge Gonzales was also repeatedly evasive and nonresponsive to \nSenators' requests for clarifications regarding his record on specific \ninterrogation techniques. I submitted post-hearing questions to Judge \nGonzales asking him to refresh his recollection by consulting with his \nstaff. He declined. When asked by other Senators to refresh his \nrecollection by examining relevant documents, Judge Gonzales responded \nthat he had not conducted a document search. Period. To my knowledge, \nhe has since taken no actions to obtain or review documents that could \nrefresh his recollection.\n  One of the reasons given by Judge Gonzales for his refusal to provide \nthe Senate with requested documents relating to his views on torture \nand specific interrogation techniques was that such disclosures would \ninvolve ``predecisional deliberations that I am not at liberty to \ndisclose.'' For instance, when asked how many meetings took place prior \nto development of the 2002 memo and who was present, he gave that \ndismissive answer. When asked whether any of his staff attended the \nmeetings or recalled his reactions to the legal issues, Judge Gonzales \nagain for the same reason. His stonewalling of legitimate requests for \ninformation under the claim of some newly-created ``predecisional \ndeliberation'' privilege to withhold information relevant to the Senate \nconfirmation process, is totally unacceptable. It is extraordinary that \nthe ACLU and other groups have had more success in obtaining \nadministration documents through the Freedom of Information Act than \nthe U.S. Senate has through the confirmation process. Does the U.S. \nSenate have to file Freedom of Information requests to get information \nfrom nominees?\n  The Senate has a right and a responsibility under its \nconstitutionally assigned role in the nomination process to know what \npositions Judge Gonzales took with respect to any specific \ninterrogation techniques which violated our laws. In his testimony and \nresponses for the record, Judge Gonzales repeatedly refused to say what \nposition he had taken on certain interrogation techniques, including \nsimulated drowning (``waterboarding''), stress positions, sexual \nhumiliation, or use of dogs, as constituting either torture or cruel, \ninhuman or degrading treatment. He claims it is the responsibility of \nthe Justice Department to make such determinations. How Judge Gonzales \naddressed those issues and his views on these issues go to the very \nheart of the matter before us--whether the Senate should give consent \nmade necessary by the Constitution before he assumes the office of \nAttorney General.\n  In the end, we are left with Judge Gonzales's memo stating that \nprovisions of the Geneva Conventions have been rendered ``obsolete'' \nand other provisions ``quaint.'' We are left with his statement that he \nsupported the legal position that physical pain amounting to torture is \nonly prohibited if it is equivalent in intensity to the pain \naccompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment \nof bodily function, or even death. We are left with his insistence that \nhe cannot remember important meetings and discussions relative to \nspecific interrogation techniques, while refusing to take steps to \nrefresh his recollection.\n\n  The record is clear that Judge Gonzales played a central role in the \ndevelopment of U.S. legal policy in 2002 that set the stage for torture \nand inhumane treatment.\n  By undermining the importance of the Geneva Conventions and by \nrefusing to acknowledge ``waterboarding,'' stress positions, sexual \nhumiliation, or use of dogs, as violations of our anti-torture statute, \nJudge Gonzales falls short of the high standards needed in an Attorney \nGeneral, whose office is at the pinnacle of the rule of law.\n  Finally, just as there must be accountability for those who carried \nout the acts of detainee abuse and mistreatment, there must be some \naccountability for the people who set the policies and established the \nlegal framework that set the stage for those abuses.\n  To vote in favor of confirmation of Judge Gonzales for Attorney \nGeneral would be to mean endorsement of the discredited legal theories \nwhich have endangered the safety of our Armed Forces, caused severe \ndamage to the moral standing of the U.S. and to our efforts to promote \nfreedom throughout the world.\n  Our troops deserve better. The American people deserve better. For \nthese reasons, I will vote against the nomination of Judge Gonzales.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is there a time allocation, as a matter of inquiry, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The two sides are dividing 8 hours today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will not take long, but I welcome the opportunity to \naddress this issue in the final moments before the Senate will make an \nextremely important judgment.\n  We face a fundamental choice in the Senate today. The nominee for \nAttorney General of the United States is a good person, with an \nextraordinary life story that reflects, in many ways, the best of the \nAmerican dream. If we were voting on that story, Mr. Gonzales would be \nconfirmed in an instant.\n  But our vote today is not a vote on whether he is a good person or \nwhether we admire and respect his life story. It is a vote on whether \nhis performance in the highest reaches of our Government has shown that \nhe should be entrusted with the Department of Justice. It is a vote on \nwhether we mean what we say when we express our commitment to America's \nfundamental ideals, for abhorrence to torture is a fundamental value, \nand the world is watching us and watching what we do on this \nnomination.\n  Torture is an issue that cannot be wished away. Our attitude toward \ntorture speaks volumes about our national conscience and our dedication \nto the rule of law.\n  Mr. Gonzales was at the heart of the Bush administration's notorious \ndecision to authorize our forces to commit flagrant acts of torture in \nthe interrogations of detainees in Afghanistan, Guantanamo, and Abu \nGhraib. The war room in the White House became the torture room. Under \nthis policy, our own agents burned detainees with lighted cigarettes. \nThey bound them hand and foot and made them lie down in their own urine \nand feces. They administered forced enemas. They exploited our own \nfemale agents by ordering them to humiliate and degrade their male \nMuslim prisoners. They terrorized prisoners with unmuzzled dogs.\n  How did this start? Where did it start? Who is responsible?\n  We do not know everything because the administration refuses to come \nclean. But what we do know gives us some clear answers. And those \nanswers should disqualify Mr. Gonzales from becoming Attorney General.\n  It started when those who wanted to use extreme methods of coercion \napproached the White House and asked for legal cover. They went to the \nOffice\n\n[[Page S949]]\n\nof the White House Counsel, the President's lawyer, Mr. Gonzales.\n  Mr. Gonzales went to Jay Bybee in the Justice Department and asked \nhim for a legal opinion on torture. Mr. Gonzales helped Mr. Bybee write \nthat opinion. And when Mr. Gonzales received it, he thought it was \nappropriate, and he allowed it to be disseminated throughout the \nGovernment. Its words appeared in the Defense Department's guidelines \nfor military interrogation. Its standards were used by the Justice \nDepartment to advise the CIA and other agencies on the legality of \nextreme methods of interrogation.\n  When Mr. Gonzales received the Bybee memorandum he did not ask for it \nto be rewritten; he did not object to it; he did not ask for a second \nopinion. He agreed with the conclusions.\n  And so for over 2 years the Bybee-Gonzales memorandum--which \nshamefully narrowed the definition of torture almost to nothingness--\nwas a roadmap to torture.\n  In the year since we first heard about prisoner abuses, no one has \nsuggested any other source for our torture policy. If President Bush \nwants to take responsibility, let him do so. If Secretary Rumsfeld \nwants to take responsibility, let him do so. If the CIA wants to take \nresponsibility, let it do so. But so far, they have let Mr. Gonzales \ntake full responsibility, and the facts make clear that he was at the \nepicenter of the government's torture policy.\n  Many Senators, many military lawyers, and lawyers throughout the \nworld knew the minute they saw the Bybee memorandum when it first came \nto light--2 years after it was written--that it was a political \ndocument, not a legal document. It was a document designed to reach a \npreordained result, not a document to say what the law really is.\n  Dean Harold Koh of Yale Law School, a former official in both the \nClinton and Bush administrations, told our committee that it was ``the \nmost clearly legally erroneous opinion'' he has ever read.\n  Yet it remained the administration's policy on torture for over 2 \nyears.\n  In our Senate committee, Senator Graham called the Bybee Gonzales \nmemorandum, ``a lousy job''. On the floor Tuesday, Chairman Specter \ncalled it unacceptable and wrong.\n  Yet Mr. Gonzales did not share that view, and for more than 2 years, \nthe memorandum remained in force as the administration's roadmap to \ntorture.\n  The administration rewrote the law, twisted legal interpretations, \nand turned a blind eye to the predictable consequences. This set in \nmotion events that have stained our Nation by authorizing and \nencouraging the commission of cruel, inhumane, and degrading acts, \nincluding torture.\n  The issue is now beyond dispute. Abu Ghraib tells us some of the \ntruth. The FBI e-mails tell us some of the truth. The many Defense \nDepartment reports tell us some of the truth. There are too many \nreports of torture and abuses committed by too many people to be \ndismissed as the work of a few bad apples on the night shift, as the \nadministration has tried so hard to do.\n  The Defense Department is now investigating over 300 cases of \ntorture, sexual assault and other abuse of detainees. When the head of \nthe Defense Intelligence Agency reports that DIA personnel were \nthreatened and confined to their base by Special Forces agents because \nthey had seen and tried to report interrogation abuses, we as a nation \nhave lost our way. When senior FBI agents are forced to complain about \nabuses committed in their presence, we as a nation have lost our way.\n  It happened on Mr. Gonzales's watch, but that is only the beginning. \nIt happened in Mr. Gonzales's office. Mr. Gonzales was an active \nparticipant. He was the principal enabler. Yet Mr. Gonzales can't \nremember much of any of this. He won't search for his torture-related \ndocuments. The White House won't give us the documents that exist. Yet, \non this incriminating record, his supporters continue to ask us to look \nthe other way, and ignore his central role in this scandal.\n  It is a sad day for the Senate, for our constitutional role in our \nsystem of government, and for our responsibility to advise and consent \non presidential nominations, if we consent to the nomination for \nAttorney General of the United States of a person who was at the heart \nof the policy on torture that has so shamed America in the eyes of the \nwhole world and has so flagrantly violated the values we preach to the \nworld.\n  Surely the administration can find a person who is capable, who is \ntrusted, and who has not had such a central role in undermining our \nNation's fundamental dedication to the rule of law.\n  The President had countless candidates to choose from. Yet of all the \nrespected men and women available, he chose Mr. Gonzales. He sent a \nmessage to the country and the world that the rule of law came in a \ndistant second to his desire to reward Mr. Gonzales for his \nunquestioning loyalty.\n  The debate today is what we in the Senate do about it now. We know \nthe country is engaged in a continuing, public debate about values. We \nhave debated ``family values,'' ``religious values,'' ``social \nvalues,'' and ``fundamental values.'' All too often, the words are used \nas code words for a political agenda.\n  All too often, we shy away from having a true discussion about our \nvalues as a nation, our character as a society, the legacy we wish to \nleave our children; and our role in the world community. Too often, \nstating noble words becomes a cover for committing ignoble acts.\n  Today's debate and today's vote give us the opportunity to \ndemonstrate our commitment to our core values. We need to show that our \ncommitment to ``human dignity'' is a reality, not a slogan. We need to \nshow that respect for law is an obligation, not an option.\n  We are a nation of laws, not hypocrites. This country is strong, and \nour constitutionl system has endured, because it permits us to do great \nthings and still ensure that we treat people fairly and humanely. To \nsuggest that the two are mutually exclusive is a failure of faith in \nthe American people, and in our proud tradition of justice. We respect \ninternational law. If we do not, who will? The provisior1s of the \nGeneva Conventions and the Convention Against Torture serve us well, \nbecause they protect our own soldiers who go off to war. They proclaim \nthat we are more than just the sum of our fears.\n  Mr. Gonzales's supportes claim it's just politics if we vote against \nhim, but statesmanship if we vote for him. But on this record the only \nreason to vote for him is politics. Conscience and principle demand \nthat we vote against him. All of our statements about values will have \na hollow ring if we ignore this record and promote Mr. Gonzales to the \nposition of Attorney General of the United States.\n  We have a choice--do we stand for the rule of law, or do we stand for \ntorture? This vote will speak volumes about whether our specific \nactions in the Senate match our lofty rhetoric about fundamental \nvalues. That is why we should vote to reject this nomination.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the decision on whether to vote to \nconfirm Alberto Gonzales to be the next Attorney General of the United \nStates has been difficult. As all of my colleagues know, I believe that \nPresidents are entitled to a great deal of deference in their cabinet \nnominations. I have voted in favor of a number of this President's \nnominees, including the current Attorney General, with whom I had \nserious disagreements on matters of policy and general ideology. My \nvotes may not have always pleased my political supporters or my party's \nleadership. But in carrying out my part in the constitutional scheme, \nas one who is asked to advise on and consent to a President's \nnominations, I am guided by my conscience, and by the history and \npractices of the U.S. Senate. Rejecting a Cabinet nominee is a very \nrare event. The decision to do so must never be taken lightly.\n  After a great deal of thought and careful consideration, I reached \nthe conclusion that I could not support Judge Gonzales's nomination. \nLet me take a few minutes to explain my decision.\n  The Attorney General of the United States is the Nation's chief law \nenforcement officer. The holder of that office must have an abiding \nrespect for the rule of law. A formative experience for me, and for \nmany of my generation, was the Watergate scandal, and particularly the \nSaturday night massacre\n\n[[Page S950]]\n\non October 20, 1973. On that night, Attorney General Elliot Richardson \nand his deputy William Ruckelshaus both resigned from office rather \nthan carry out President Nixon's order to fire special prosecutor \nArchibald Cox. Those acts of courage remain for me a shining example of \nthe role that the Attorney General plays in our government. They give \nme the unshakeable conviction that his or her ultimate allegiance must \nbe to the rule of law, not to the President.\n  As Judge Gonzales himself said as he stood next to the President on \nthe day he was nominated\n\n       The American people expect and deserve a Department of \n     Justice guided by the rule of law.\n\n  I am pained to say that Mr. Gonzales's performance as White House \nCounsel and, particularly, his appearance before the Judiciary \nCommittee and his responses to our questions, have given me grave \ndoubts about whether he meets that test.\n  Judge Gonzales too often has seen the law as an obstacle to be dodged \nor cleared away in furtherance of the President's policies.\n  Judge Gonzales has held the position of White House Counsel since the \nbeginning of this administration and through a very difficult and \nchallenging period in our history. The response of the administration \nto the September 11 attacks and the fight against terrorism have \nbrought some very difficult legal issues to his desk. Some of these \nissues touch on the very core of our national identity. What kind of \nnation are we going to be during times of war? How will we treat those \nwe capture on the battlefield? How will we live up to our international \ntreaty obligations as we fight terrorism?\n\n  Time after time, Judge Gonzales has been a key participant in \ndeveloping secret legal theories to justify policies that, as they have \nbecome public, have tarnished our Nation's international reputation and \nmade it harder, not easier, for us to prevail in this struggle. He \nrequested and then disseminated the infamous Office of Legal Counsel \nmemo that for almost 2 years, until it was revealed and discredited, \nmade it the position of the Government of the United States of America \nthat the International Convention Against Torture, and statutes \nimplementing that treaty, prohibit only causing physical pain \n``equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical \ninjury; such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even \ndeath.'' Under that standard, the images from Abu Ghraib that revolted \nthe entire world would not be considered torture, nor, according to \nsome, would the shocking interrogation technique called \n``waterboarding.''\n  Judge Gonzales advised the President that he could declare the entire \nlegal regime of the Geneva Conventions inapplicable to the conflict in \nAfghanistan. Secretary of State Powell rightly pointed out the danger \nof this course, but Judge Gonzales persisted. This theory could \nactually have given greater legal protection to terrorists, by taking \naway a key part of the legal regime under which war crimes can be \nprosecuted. The idea that the Geneva Conventions protect terrorists who \ncommit war crimes, which Judge Gonzales repeated in his hearing, is a \ndramatic misunderstanding of the law, and it was very troubling to hear \nit from the person who would coordinate our legal strategy in the fight \nagainst terrorism.\n  Judge Gonzales was also an architect of the administration's position \non the legal status of those it called ``enemy combatants,'' a position \nthat was soundly rejected by the Supreme Court of the United States \nlast year.\n  In all of these areas, Judge Gonzales served as the President's \nlawyer, and facilitated the President's policies. I believe that he \nfailed the President and the Nation badly. But these past mistakes need \nnot have been conclusive in my assessment of his suitability for the \noffice of Attorney General. For example, I also have serious concerns \nabout the role that the national security adviser--and now Secretary of \nState--Dr. Condoleezza Rice, played in crafting and implementing the \nadministration's badly flawed foreign policy. But I do not think that \ntaking part in a policy I strongly oppose is sufficient grounds for me \nto oppose a cabinet nomination. As I have indicated, the President--any \nPresident--is entitled to be advised by those who share his beliefs and \nconfidence.\n\n  Had Judge Gonzales in his testimony before this Committee recognized \nthe serious problems with the judgments he made on these issues and \ngiven convincing assurances that he understands that his new role will \nrequire a different approach and a new allegiance to the rule of law, I \nmight have been convinced to defer to the President once again. \nAttorney General Ashcroft, for example, was unequivocal in expressing \nhis commitment, under oath, to enforcing laws with which he disagreed \nas a Senator--laws and court decisions that he, I think, abhored, but \nhe made it very clear that his role was to uphold the law as it stands.\n  But Judge Gonzales's appearance before the Judiciary Committee was \ndeeply disappointing. When given the opportunity under oath to show \nthat he would be adequately committed to the rule of law as our \nNation's chief law enforcement officer, he failed to do so. He \nindicated that the infamous OLC torture memo is no longer operative, \nbut that he does not disagree with the conclusions expressed in it. He \nreiterated erroneous interpretations, of the effect that applying the \nGeneva Conventions to the war on Afghanistan would have on the \ntreatment of members of al-Qaida captured in combat. Most disturbingly, \nhe refused time after time to repudiate the most far-reaching and \nsignificant conclusion of the OLC memo--that the President has the \nauthority as Commander-in-Chief to immunize those acting at his \ndirection from the application of U.S. law.\n  This failure goes directly to the question of his commitment to the \nrule of law. Under our system of government, the Attorney General of \nthe United States may be called upon to investigate and even prosecute \nthe President. We cannot have a person heading the United States \nDepartment of Justice who believes that the President is above the law. \nI and other members of the Judiciary Committee questioned Judge \nGonzales closely about this issue. He hid behind an aversion to \nhypothetical questions, he conjured up his own hypothetical scenarios \nof unconstitutional statutes, but he simply refused to say, without \nequivocation, that the President is not above the law.\n  On the torture issue in particular, Judge Gonzales repeatedly told us \nthat he opposes torture and that the President has never authorized \ntorture. Thus, he indicated, the question of whether the President \nacting as Commander in Chief can authorize torture has never and will \nnever come up. I certainly hope that we can rely on those assurances, \nbut the Founders of this Nation designed a system where even the \nPresident is bound by our laws--precisely so that we would not have to \nrely on trust alone that the President will act in accordance with \nthem. I think the Judiciary Committee, and the American people, \ndeserved to hear whether the next Attorney General agrees that the \nPresident has the power to disobey laws as fundamental to our national \ncharacter as the prohibition on torture. Judge Gonzales refused to \naddress this question unequivocally, and that left me deeply troubled.\n  Mr. President, Judge Gonzales has a compelling personal story, and \nmany fine qualities as a lawyer. If he is confirmed by the Senate, \nthere are many issues on which I hope we can work together for the good \nof the country. But I cannot support his nomination. Not because he is \ntoo conservative, or because I disagree with a specific policy position \nhe has taken, but because I am not convinced that he possesses the \nabiding respect for the rule of law that our country needs in these \ndifficult times in its Attorney General. I will vote ``No.''\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Are we in Republican time at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to hear that we may bring \nthis\n\n[[Page S951]]\n\ndebate to a conclusion shortly. Certainly it seems to me we have had \nplenty of time to talk about it. We have heard the same things over and \nover. Of course, everyone has a perfect right to have a different point \nof view, and I understand that. They also have a right to share that \npoint of view. However, there does come a time when we ought to come to \nthe snubbing post and vote, and I hope that can happen soon.\n  I come to the floor to express my support for the nomination of \nAlberto Gonzales. It occurs to me the President should have the right \nand does have the right and the responsibility to surround himself with \npeople with whom he can work the best, people who reflect his point of \nview. After all, we are talking about a manager surrounding himself \nwith people who will carry out his programs. Obviously, he is going to \nhave people who fit that order.\n  If something is found that is disingenuous or disagreeable about the \nnominee, of course, it is legitimate to talk about that. I do think it \nis interesting, however, that people from the other side of the aisle \non the Judiciary Committee have gotten up and talked about all these \ndifficult issues on the memos. The fact is, the same committee members \non this side of the aisle have not mentioned that at all. One has to \nthink if there is a little bit of politics here. That would not be a \nbrand new idea, of course.\n  It is time to go forward. Certainly lots of people have had lots of \ngood things to say about Judge Gonzales. They talked about his legal \ncareer, which is very impressive. He entered Harvard Law School. That \nis a good thing. He certainly has had military service, which does not \nhave any direct involvement with this job, but it is something he \nshould be recognized for having done. He served in Texas as the \nsecretary of state. He was a distinguished jurist in Texas, and the \npeople from Texas from whom we hear are all very complimentary of what \nhas happened there with respect to Judge Gonzales.\n  We ought to consider those comments from people such as Senator \nCornyn who worked with him in the same government in Texas and who has \nnothing but good things to say. Certainly no one has suggested that \nthis jurist is one who is an activist judge who is seeking to make law \nas opposed to interpret it. That is one of the questions we have had, \nof course, in this whole series of debates, but it does not seem to be \npart of this one.\n  Judge Gonzales has been complimented for issuing his opinions based \non the facts, on interpretation of the law rather than his personal \ninterests which, of course, is one of the keys to a successful \njudgeship.\n  As I say, it is perfectly legitimate for people to have a different \npoint of view. However, there is a limit to how long we need to keep \ntalking about it. We have been here all week. I hope now most of us can \ncome to the decision that it is time to move on.\n  I frankly do not know the judge. I have not worked with him, as many \npeople have. But I was impressed listening to those who have, \nparticularly about his Texas experience. He certainly seems to have \nworked on cases diligently and has done a great job. He has not been \ninfluenced outside the courtroom. Those are excellent qualifications \nfor someone in this job.\n\n  Certainly, there has also been the opportunity to serve with the \nPresident as White House Counsel. It is a very important job that has \ngiven him experience in Federal Government so he can move right into \nthis position. He remained steadily at the helm, despite the tough \ntimes we had during 9/11 and following in terms of terrorism in which \nthis Department and these judges and attorneys had the real challenge \nof what to do to deal with terrorism. He was instrumental in \ncoordinating the law enforcement efforts post-9/11 and ensuring the \nrights of Americans at the same time.\n  It is interesting to have reports on what Mr. Gonzales has done with \nhomeland security consistent with the Constitution and the laws. He \ndemonstrated independence as Counsel at the White House, resisting from \ntime to time the Department of Justice.\n  The transition from where he is as White House Counsel to the Justice \nDepartment will be a relatively easy one. The Justice Department is \nvery interesting. A very good friend of mine has been Assistant \nAttorney General for Public Lands, a gentleman who at one time was, in \nfact, my staff director. He has about 700 people who work for him. It \nis a tough job and one that does require a background and knowledge.\n  As I read it--I am not on the committee of jurisdiction but those who \nare from this side have said he demonstrated a will to honor and uphold \nthe Constitution, which, of course, all of us need to do. He is \nindependent enough to make decisions that have to be done \nindependently, and that is excellent.\n  Again, we will have differences of view. That is all right. We have \ndifferences of view on almost everything. It is time to draw the line. \nIt is time to go. It is time to get this job done.\n  I certainly urge support for Judge Gonzales and hope we can go \nforward and give him an opportunity and then give us an opportunity to \nmove forward with what we ought to be doing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today because I want to address \nthe allegation that we have heard in this Chamber over the last several \ndays that the debate around the nomination of Judge Gonzales to be the \nnext U.S. Attorney General is somehow occurring because of the fact \nthat he is Hispanic. I want to let the President, the Members of this \nChamber, and the people of the United States know that in my view, that \nis not at all the case, and it is a notion that we should, in fact, \nreject. We should reject it because it is divisive.\n  Instead, what we ought to be doing in the United States of America is \nmoving forward with a sense of unity and a celebration of diversity \nthat can unite us as a country.\n  The fact is, the debate that has occurred in this Chamber over the \nlast several days concerning Judge Alberto Gonzales is an appropriate \ndebate. We do not have a king in these United States. We have a \nPresident who appoints, subject to the advice and consent of the \nSenate. And for the Senate to have engaged in the debate and dialog, as \nit has over the last several days, is the appropriate constitutional \nrole for this Senate.\n  The questions that have been raised about Judge Gonzales are \nquestions that are very serious about international law and \ninternational accords and the laws of these United States.\n  For my colleagues who have stood up and who have raised questions \nabout Judge Gonzales's role with respect to these issues, they have \nbeen carrying out their constitutional duty. I believe that \nconstitutional duty should be respected.\n  I, for one, after doing my constitutional duty and reviewing the \nrecord and meeting with Judge Gonzales, talking to him about civil \nrights, talking to him about his opposition to torture, concluded that \nI would cast my vote in support of Judge Gonzales's nomination, and I \nwill do so in a few minutes. That vote will not change. But I think it \nis a mistake for this Chamber to allow the race card of being Hispanic \nto be used to destroy or erode the institutions that we have in the \nSenate.\n  As I say that, I say it because I have seen the journey of civil \nrights in America. That journey of civil rights in America is one which \nhas taken us a long time to get to where we are today. When we think \nabout the history of our country, for the first 250 years from the \nfounding of Plymouth Rock and Jamestown to the civil war, we were a \ncountry that divided ourselves by the race of our skin, so that if one \nwas one race, they were able to own as property members who were from \nanother race. It took a very bloody civil war--in fact, the bloodiest \nof all wars that this country has been engaged in--to end that system \nof slavery and to usher in the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments that said \nwe are equal in this Nation.\n  Notwithstanding that bloodiest of wars and notwithstanding the fact \nthat we had amended the Constitution in those ways, it took another 100 \nyears for us to legally end the system of segregation in this country \nbecause it was not until 1954 and the decision written by Justice \nWarren in Brown v. The Board of Education that we said that segregation \nwas wrong and that we would not tolerate it under our system of law.\n  As we have evolved in our relationships within groups over the last \nhalf a\n\n[[Page S952]]\n\ncentury, there have been leaders, both Democrats and Republicans, who \nhave embraced the doctrines of diversity and an inclusive America. In \nthe 1960s, that effort was lead by Democrats, such as John Kennedy, \nRobert Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson. It was the Civil Rights Act of the \n1960s that created opportunities for all of us in America to recognize \nthat we are, in fact, one Nation.\n  But it was not just the Republicans or the Democrats who were in the \nlead in that role. There were also others who were involved, \nRepublicans like President Gerald Ford. A few years ago, President Ford \nwrote an article in the New York Times which was entitled, ``An \nInclusive America.'' In that article in the New York Times, President \nFord talked about the importance of bringing all of our community \ntogether and giving everybody an equal opportunity, regardless of their \nbackground.\n  So as we move forward to making this decision on Judge Gonzales, \nwhich I anticipate and fully expect is going to be a decision to affirm \nhis nomination as the Attorney General of the United States of America, \nlet us not use this moment to divide this country and let us not use \nthis moment to divide this Chamber.\n  My view is that those Democratic colleagues of mine, who are people I \nadmire, are very much champions of diversity and champions of civil \nrights and, in my view, they were exercising their appropriate role and \ntheir duty to make sure that the scrutiny of the Senate of one of the \nPresident's nominees was, in fact, exercised.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in regard to the \nnomination of Judge Gonzales to be the Attorney General of the United \nStates. Since this is about justice, in reviewing the record on Judge \nGonzales and in considering what my own conclusion about it would be, \nparticularly since it was all about justice, I thought I should try to \nreach a result that seemed just to me. Each of us, in the fullness of \nour heads and hearts, has to decide what is appropriate.\n  I was reminded of that famous saying from the Bible: Justice, justice \nshalt thou seek. I remember asking a teacher of mine once why the \nrepeat of the word ``justice,'' and I was told, well, it not only means \nyou should pursue justice but you should pursue it in a just way.\n  I have had that in mind as I have considered this nomination and \nothers over my 16 years in the Senate. Throughout my tenure I have \nvoted on hundreds of Presidential nominations. In each case I have \nadhered to a broadly deferential standard of review. To me, that seems \nto be the just process to follow.\n  As I explained in my very first speech on the Senate floor which, for \nbetter or worse, was in regard to the nomination of John Tower to serve \nas Secretary of Defense, a nomination which I opposed, the history of \nthe debates of the constitutional convention makes clear to me that the \nPresident is entitled to the benefit of the doubt in his appointments \nto his Cabinet. The question I concluded I should ask myself in \nconsidering nominees is not whether I would have chosen the nominee \nbut, rather whether the President's choice is acceptable for the job \nfor which the nominee has been chosen.\n  That, obviously, does not mean the Senate should always confirm a \nPresident's nominees. Were that the case, the Framers would have given \nthe Senate no role in the appointments process, no power to advise and \nconsent. Instead, the Senate's constitutional advice and consent \nmandate obliges us to serve, if you will, as a check, in my opinion, at \nthe margins on the President's power to appoint, a power that a sitting \nPresident wins by virtue of his selection by the people of the country.\n  As I put it in my statement on Senator Tower's nomination, I believe \nthis requires this Senator to consider several things: First, the \nknowledge, experience, and qualifications of the nominee for the \nparticular position for which he or she has been nominated; second, the \nnominee's judgment as well as his personal behavior; third, the \nnominee's ethics.\n  In unusual circumstances Senators can also, it seems to me, consider \nfundamental and potentially irreconcilable differences of policy \nbetween the nominee and the mission of the agency he or she is called \nupon to serve.\n  As a result of that personal process that I follow in nominations, on \na very few occasions--I would guess, although I haven't looked back, \nmaybe just over 5 during my 16 years in the Senate--I have determined \nthat the views of certain nominees, usually on one end of the political \nspectrum or the other, fell sufficiently outside the mainstream to \ncompel me to oppose their nominations. In other words, I give a \npresumption in favor of the nominee unless there is a reason to decide \notherwise.\n  In this case I have met with Judge Gonzales, I have reviewed his \nrecord throughout his career, I am familiar with his life story, I have \nreviewed the proceedings before the Judiciary Committee, the comments \nmade by many on the committee in describing their votes, his testimony \nthere, and I have concluded that this nominee deserves to be confirmed \nand therefore I will vote to confirm the nominee.\n  I need not labor on the details of the first three points--knowledge, \nexperience, qualifications, judgment and personal behavior, and \nnominee's ethics. I believe this nominee, as everyone said, including \nthose who are opposed to the nomination, has a remarkable life story \nthat speaks to his strength, to his balance, to his values. He has \nacted under pressure and gives me the confidence that he would do the \nsame as Attorney General.\n  He has spoken quite eloquently in his testimony before the Judiciary \nCommittee that he understands his accountability, his first \naccountability as Attorney General will be to the Constitution and to \nthe people of this country. I know there are some who question his \nindependence of opinion and judgment because he has had a close \nrelationship with the President of the United States. But, as others \nbefore me in this debate on the Senate floor about this nomination have \nsaid, more often than not a President chooses as Attorney General \nsomeone close to him. President Kennedy obviously chose his brother \nRobert, who was a great Attorney General. President Reagan, if I \nremember correctly, chose his personal lawyer to be his Attorney \nGeneral. President Carter chose Griffin Bell, who was extremely close \nto him, from Atlanta. And so it goes throughout most of our history.\n\n  It seems to me, as I followed the debate in the committee and on the \nfloor, that there are two or three elements that have troubled my \ncolleagues enough to decide to vote against this nomination. I believe \nin fairness I have to consider these seriously, but consider them in \nthe context of Judge Gonzales's entire career. The two most significant \npoints of contention are Judge Gonzales's work as White House Counsel \nearly in 2002, in the memo he wrote and the involvement he had in the \npolicy with regard to the application of the Geneva Conventions; and, \nsecond, what relationship he had with the memo of Mr. Bybee, head of \nthe Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department, with regard to \nthe definition of torture under the Convention Against Torture.\n  In both of these cases, it seems to me, as I listen to my colleagues \nwho are opposed to the nomination, they take Judge Gonzales's work in \nboth of these areas to be indications of perhaps his lack of \nindependence, lack of good judgment which they believe disqualifies him \nfor this position. And some--I am trying to be fair here--raise \nquestions about whether both of these memos, certainly the second one, \nthe Bybee memo, in any way or in some way contributed to the horrific \nbehavior we saw in the prison abuse scandals at Abu Ghraib. I want to \nbriefly speak to both.\n  The first is the work that Judge Gonzales did early in 2002, within \nmonths after the attack against us of September 11 and the initiation \nof our own war against terrorism in Afghanistan. I know people have \nquoted from the memo he wrote with some derision.\n\n[[Page S953]]\n\nI think you have to appreciate the context. As I look back post-\nSeptember 11, it seems to me in Judge Gonzales's memo and the memos \nsubmitted by the State Department, by the Defense Department and \nothers, there is a very serious and classical American debate going on \nabout how to handle al-Qaida and the Taliban, and prisoners taken from \ntheir membership, and what is the relevance of the Geneva Convention to \nthose people. It is an argument by a nation that cares about the rule \nof law. You can agree with Judge Gonzales's position in this matter or \nnot. I happen to agree with the ultimate decision made. And the \ndecision was, in my opinion, a reasonable one and ultimately a \nprogressive one. The decision was that under the terms of the Geneva \nConventions, al-Qaida simply is not a state party to a convention, it \nis a terrorist group, and as such its members were not entitled to \nprisoner-of-war status.\n  There is a sentence in Judge Gonzales's letter that was quoted with \ngreat derision, laughter, as if it were over the edge. ``In my \njudgment, this new paradigm,'' which is the post-September 11 war on \nterrorism, ``renders quaint some of the provisions requiring that \ncaptured enemy''--we are talking here about al-Qaida--``be afforded \nsuch things as commissary privileges, scrip advances of monthly pay, \nathletic uniforms and scientific instruments.''\n  I think, respectfully, Judge Gonzales was being restrained and \ndiplomatic in using the word ``quaint.'' To offer these benefits--\naccess to a canteen to purchase food, soap and tobacco, a monthly \nadvance of pay, and the ability to have and consult personal financial \naccounts, the ability to receive scientific equipment, musical \ninstruments or sports outfits--to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who planned \nthe attacks against us on September 11, would not be quaint, It would \nbe offensive.\n  It would be offensive. It would be ridiculous. It would be ultimately \nunjust.\n  A different conclusion was reached about the Taliban. A summary of \nthe opinion says, although we never recognized the Taliban as a \nlegitimate Afghan government, Afghanistan is a party to the Geneva \nConventions, and therefore the President has determined that the \nTaliban is covered by the conventions.\n  But then they cite that under the terms of the conventions, Taliban \ndetainees do not qualify for prisoner-of-war status.\n  Then the progressive part of this opinion, coming out in February \n2002, says that even though the detainees are not entitled to prisoner-\nof-war privileges, they will be provided many POW privileges as a \nmatter of policy. All detainees in Guantanamo are being provided three \nmeals a day that meet Muslim dietary laws, water, medical care, \nclothing and shoes, shelter, showers, soap and toilet articles, foam \nsleeping pads, blankets, towels, washcloths, the opportunity to \nworship, correspondence materials and a means to send mail, and the \nability to receive packages of food and clothing subject to security \nscreening. Detainees will not be subjected to physical or mental abuse \nor cruel treatment.\n  That is the policy that Judge Gonzales helped them form. That is the \npolicy that our Government issued. To me, it is a remarkably just \npolicy.\n  I see no basis in anything in the record of Judge Gonzales's \nparticipation in this that would lead me to override presumption in his \nfavor.\n  The Bybee memo--the memo from the Office of Legal Counsel in August \nof 2002 interpreting the Convention Against Torture and the American \nstatute implementing the conventions--is a separate matter. It is very \nimportant to say that this memo was written by the independent Office \nof Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice with a proud record of \nindependence of opinion.\n  You may disagree with its conclusions. I disagree with a lot of its \ncontent and conclusions. But it is a lengthy, 50-plus pages, single-\nspaced document, quite scholarly, with over 25 footnotes, as I recall--\nand offered to Judge Gonzales in his role as Counsel to the President.\n  I want to repeat again: This was not Judge Gonzales's memo. It was \nthe Office of Legal Counsel's memo.\n  It is not clear what Judge Gonzales did with this memo. He refused at \nhis hearing before the Judiciary Committee to reveal exactly what he \nadvised the President about the memo. That was frustrating to the \ncommittee members, and I understand that. But I must say as a former \nattorney general, as a lawyer, I respect the right of the Counsel to \nthe President to keep private for reasons of precedent and executive \nprivilege the private counsel he gives to the President of the United \nStates.\n  I repeat that there are parts of that Bybee memo which I find \nprofoundly offensive. But it was not the Gonzales memo. On the record, \nwe do not know what he advised the President as a result of it.\n  In questions and answers before the committee, he said he agreed with \nthe conclusion but not all of the analysis in it. It is hard to know \nwhat that means. What we do know is that in June of last year, \npresumably after the Abu Ghraib scandal broke, the Attorney General and \nWhite House Counsel were asked to reconsider and withdraw the opinion \nof August 2002, and reissued the opinion in December of 2004 with just \nabout all of the objectionable matter--to me objectionable--being taken \nout of it and presumed objectionable to most others. So it is no longer \na prevailing memo.\n\n  Again, Judge Gonzales said repeatedly at the hearing he would not \ncountenance torture--repeated what is the fact; that the administration \nmade very clear, presumably with his counsel, that the rules of the \nGeneva Conventions applied to the Iraq war because Iraq was a duly \nformed government, a sovereign state, and a party to the Geneva \nConventions.\n  What happened at Abu Ghraib was embarrassing, was hurtful to our \ncause in the world, was offensive, and it is being dealt with within \nthe military justice system as we have seen.\n  Questions are raised about the connection, I suppose, between the \nBybee memo and whatever involvement Judge Gonzales had entered in the \nevents of Abu Ghraib. There is simply no evidence to make the \nconnection, certainly between Judge Gonzales and what happened at Abu \nGhraib in any of the independent reviews that have gone on, most \nparticularly Mr. Schlesinger's independent review which said there was \nno connection between so-called higher-ups and what happened at Abu \nGhraib.\n  In the end, I have to ask myself, because of a memo written by \nsomebody else, Mr. Bybee at the Office of Legal Counsel, which has in \nit material that I find, as I said, profoundly offensive, that Judge \nGonzales received and did something with, am I prepared to vote to deny \nhim confirmation as Attorney General of the United States? To me \npersonally that would be an unjust result. That is why I will vote to \nconfirm.\n  I understand the frustration of members of the Judiciary Committee \nabout some of the answers--many of the answers that Judge Gonzales gave \nat the hearing. Some of them were evasive and some were legalistic. But \nthat wouldn't be, would it, the first time the committee had a witness \nbefore it that proceeded in that particular way, particularly one who \nhas privileges that he occupies and lives under as Counsel to the \nPresident of the United States.\n  That is why I am going to vote for Judge Gonzales--to confirm his \nnomination. Nothing that I see in the report rises to a level high \nenough to overcome the presumption in favor of him as a nominee of the \nPresident.\n  He has many outstanding qualities. I don't know if others have \nmentioned this in this debate. He has a certain independence of spirit \nwhich I don't think has been very much commented on.\n  I remember reading in the press a moment ago when his name was \nmentioned as a potential nominee for Supreme Court, some people--I will \nbe explicit--thought he wasn't a likely nominee because there were \npeople in the Republican Party who thought he had too much independence \non some issues that were central. I think that should be remembered as \nwe cast the vote.\n  The final point I wanted to make is this: I would like to believe \nthis. I will state that it has nothing to do with the standard that I \napply to voting on confirmation of a nomination, but to me it is a kind \nof bonus associated with this\n\n[[Page S954]]\n\nnomination. Judge Gonzales, if confirmed, will be the first Hispanic \nAttorney General in the history of the United States. That is a fact. \nIt is not reason, of course, to vote for him, nor is it a reason to \nvote against him. But to me it is both a bonus and an extra measure of \nencouragement about the kind of Attorney General he will be.\n  I have been in positions myself when I have had the chance in the \ntrue spirit of the American dream to break some barriers. I probably \nhave a special sensitivity to others who have had the opportunity to \nbreak barriers. When I had that opportunity myself, somebody said to me \nof another ethnic group--in fact, another racial group--that they were \nthrilled about what had just happened to me because they believed in \nAmerica when a barrier falls for one group, the doors of opportunity \nwould open wider for every other American. I believe that. I think that \nis the bonus that comes with this nomination.\n  I can't help but also note the broad base of support that Judge \nGonzales has received from the Hispanic community, from elected \nofficials, and generally nonpartisan Hispanic organizations. They speak \nto the significance beyond the merits, but build on the merits that \nthis nomination has to a group of Americans who are playing an \nincreasingly important role in the life of this country.\n\n  It encourages me about the kind of job he will do, because I think \nthe experiences he has had, the road he walked to get to where he is, \nthe extraordinary hard work he did to do that, the pride he has in his \nfamily, in his heritage, will quite simply make him sensitive to the \nmost fundamental values of equal opportunity, of the rule of law, of an \nabsence of discrimination of any kind.\n  For all of those reasons, I shall vote yea on the nomination of Judge \nGonzales to be our next Attorney General.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am very fortunate. I did not plan it \nthis way, but I was here for most of what Senator Lieberman had to say. \nI am very glad I had that opportunity. Even though I have never been a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, I am a lawyer, although I have not \npracticed for a long time, but I am very pleased I had a chance to \nlisten to an analysis given by the Senator with reference to the memos \nand what might be taken from them in terms of what it means if we \nnominate, if we accept his nomination or send him signals about what we \nthink about torture.\n  Does that mean because he was involved in all of this activity at a \ntime of turmoil, when there were a lot of things we did not know, a lot \nof legal definitions had not yet been completely determined, that are \nstill out there being litigated and discussed, that he is disqualified \nfrom being a good Attorney General? That is hogwash.\n  As a plain, simple person looking at this, I say: What if I were a \nlawyer and I decided that the law meant A, B, C, D and that was \nlogical, there were legal opinions and a lot of people supporting it, \nbut after the fact things occurred, and D, E, F said that wasn't right. \nDoes that mean whatever you said was right, as a matter of law? Does it \nmean since that is not what the court says, you are not a good lawyer, \nor in some way that disqualifies you from a job?\n  We have lawyers arguing against each other with legal briefs that \nhave innumerable citations supporting a position. Somebody wins, \nsomebody loses, right? And that does not mean that either side did \nanything but research the law as best they could, come up with \nconclusions as best they could.\n  These very narrow arguments on legal niceties totally miss the point. \nNone of those justify saying he has given America a black eye in terms \nof torture, and if he is Attorney General, we approve of this kind of \nperson, that would be part of such activity. That has got to be \nnonsense. I say it different from the Senator. You say it is nonsense \nbut you never say it is nonsense; you just go through and pick it \napart.\n  Of the people who know him, who have known him for longer thin \nanybody on that side of the aisle, who have practiced with him, who \nwere in the State bar with him, who were there when he got great awards \nin the Texas bar for his minority, in terms of his culture, but for his \nexcellence in terms of the law, one is Henry Cisneros. He has known him \nfor years and wrote a letter January 5, a tremendous letter. He knew \nthis man. What did he say? Well, he is not saying he shouldn't be \nAttorney General because he has been reading about what happened with \nregard to prisoners of war. He didn't say that. He said: I know all \nabout him. He is a terrific lawyer, a wonderful man, and a great \nsuccess story, and he is Hispanic like I am. Henry Cisneros said: I am \nproud of him. That is Democratic Henry Cisneros. I think he should \nbecome the first Hispanic to be Attorney General.\n   Other Senators--I hate to say which ones--come down here and argue \nthese legal niceties. I don't want to discredit them. I don't want to \nsay this is an excuse because probably some of them really believe what \nthey have said. I think there is something to the fact that there are a \nlot of Senators who want to forget the fact that George Bush won. They \ncan't believe he is President again, so, wherever they can, they want \nto vent their feelings about this.\n\n  This man should have every vote in the Senate. He is more qualified \nthan most. He is, in a sense, a better example of somebody who should \nget this job, a success in America, because of the signal it tells \nabout the American way of life. And success can be achieved by \nminorities.\n  His experience as a lawyer is as much or better than most who have \nbeen Attorneys General of the United States. Everything you look at, \nhis decisions about this whole business of al-Qaida and whether they \nshould be deemed to be protected by Geneva or not, whether the Taliban \nup there in Afghanistan should be treated as prisoners of war. There is \nno question he is not on the edge of a group of people who do not care \nabout humanity, who want to do anything. He is not on that side. In \nfact, he is pretty much correct, that the ones I just described \nshouldn't be covered by the Geneva Conventions. Maybe the Iraqi \nsoldiers, but there is nothing that says the Taliban terrorists should \nor the terrorists in Iraq should, for sure. There is lots of legal \nopinion. That is not the subject matter of the Geneva Conventions. You \nstill have to have rules about torture. I understand.\n  I thought I would try to answer some of the allegations that have \nbeen made today with reference to the subject matter, but I will not. I \nam absolutely convinced for many people who are active Democrats, \nincluding some in the Senate, they cannot envision that this man, \nHispanic, with his upbringing, should be a Republican nominee for \nAttorney General.\n  I lived through it all. I come from a State with a large population \nof Hispanics, huge numbers of them elected to every office in my State, \npredominantly Democrat. One can almost feel it, a Republican just \nshouldn't be doing that. That should not be a nominee of a Republican \nPresident. They have a lot to learn. He is not the first one. He will \nnot be the last one. And Hispanics are not going to be natural \nconstituents for the Democratic Party or naturally Democratic. It will \njust not happen anymore.\n  I commend the President for doing what he did. I commend this man for \nhis successes, his family for the sacrifices, and the Senate for \nconfirming him by an overwhelming vote today. I look toward to his \nbeing sworn in.\n  I conclude by saying I know him, I have worked with him--not as long \nas former Secretary Cisneros or some others I put in the Record \nyesterday who worked with him in Texas, but when it is all finished, he \nwill be a very good Attorney General.\n  Frankly, for those who think they might have bruised him up so he \ncannot be a nominee for the Supreme Court of the United States, which \nsome might have hoped for, I think they missed it because it comes out \nin the end of being a very frivolous attack. He might be the logical \ncandidate. He might be the kind of person who will clear the Senate. At \nleast when he started a few weeks ago he clearly was in that category. \nI hope they haven't changed it by what they have done on the other \nside.\n  Instead of simply saying we oppose President Bush or we are against \nthe war in Iraq, many of my colleagues on\n\n[[Page S955]]\n\nthe other side of the aisle have chosen to make Judge Alberto Gonzalez \na scapegoat for their own frustrations.\n  We have heard numerous allegations such as not treating al Qaeda \nterrorists like prisoners captured during previous wars means the \nUnited States is not following the rule of law.\n  Since 9/11, Judge Gonzalez and countless other Government lawyers \nhave attempted to respond to war that America had never fought. This is \na ``War Against Terror.''\n  All of these lawyers had to make very difficult decisions to protect \nAmerica from a new and deadly threat while not knowing if more attacks \nwere imminent.\n  This is a case of second guessing at its absolute worst.\n  The allegation is that Judge Gonzalez supports the torture and abuse \nof terrorists during interrogations.\n  Judge Gonzalez has repeatedly stated that it is not the policy of the \nUnited States to condone torture and that he does condone torture.\n  The allegation is that Judge Gonzalez does not believe in the Geneva \nConvention.\n  The Geneva Convention applies when a combatant meets the following \nfour criteria: is commanded by a person responsible for his \nsubordinates; has a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance; \ncarries arms openly; and conducts operations in accordance with the \nlaws and customs of war.\n  Clearly the Geneva Conventions do not apply to Taliban fighters or \nal-Qaida terrorists.\n  Yet there are still those who insist that Judge Gonzales completely \ndisregarded the Geneva Conventions and through his legal memoranda \nencouraged torture and mistreatment.\n  Let me provide just a small sampling of the overwhelming body of \nevidence that completely refutes Judge Gonzales's opponents.\n  The final 9/11 Commission Report stated:\n\n       The United States and some of its allies do not accept the \n     application of the treatment of prisoners of war to captured \n     terrorists. Those conventions establish a minimum set of \n     standards for prisoners in internal conflicts. Since the \n     international struggle against Islamist terrorism is not \n     internal, those provisions do not formally apply . . .\n\n  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in the John Walker \nLindh case stated:\n\n       The President's decision denying Lindh lawful combatant \n     immunity is correct.\n\n  Legal scholars agree. In her treatise on The Law of War, Professor \nIngrid Detter noted that ``[u]nlawful combatants . . . are not, if \ncaptured, entitled to any prisoner of war status.''\n  Professor Gregory M. Travalio has written that ``terrorists would not \nqualify under Article 4 of Geneva Convention III as Prisoners of War.''\n  Moving beyond what can only be described as a smoke and mirrors \nargument, I believe there are other forces at work that have absolutely \nnothing to do with the Geneva Convention.\n  Partisan, political, and personal pretty well sums up the opposition \nto the nomination of Judge Alberto Gonzales to be the next United \nStates Attorney General.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. On behalf of the leader, I ask consent that there be 60 \nminutes remaining for debate on the pending nomination, with the time \ndivided as follows: 15 minutes to the distinguished ranking member, \nSenator Leahy; I, as chairman, the next 15 minutes; then the Democratic \nleader, Senator Reid, 15 minutes; and the majority leader, Senator \nFrist, the final 15 minutes.\n  Finally, I ask consent that after the use or yielding back of time \nthat the Senate proceed to a vote on the nominee as the previous order \nprovides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the most part, this has been a \nsubstantive debate. Actually, it has been a necessary debate. Now, \npartisans on the other side of the aisle at times have tried to smear \nanyone who has voiced concern about this nomination, notwithstanding \nthat anyone who listened to the statements of those of us who oppose \nthis nomination know that each of us has praised the journey Alberto \nGonzales and his family have taken.\n  I am a grandson of immigrants who came to this country not even \nspeaking the language, so I have unbounded respect for all that he and \nhis family have accomplished. In fact, I am the first Leahy to get a \ncollege degree; my sister is the second. So I applaud anybody who takes \nsuch a journey.\n  On Tuesday, the Senate heard from Senators Feinstein, Schumer, \nKennedy, Mikulski, Dayton, and Stabenow. Yesterday, the debate on this \nside of the aisle included eloquent and powerful statements by Senators \nByrd, Durbin, Jack Reed, and Jeffords, all stating their reasons for \nopposing this nomination on the merits. No one should be accusing these \nSenators of doing anything except their constitutional duty. Today, we \nheard as well from Senators Dodd, Obama, Cantwell, Bingaman, Johnson, \nLevin, and Feingold. Each has spoken from conviction. They are voting \ntheir conscience.\n  We have also made time to hear from one of our newer Democratic \nSenators, Mr. Salazar of Colorado, regarding the assurances and \ncommitments he has obtained from the nominee and on which he is relying \nin his vote. I also note that today he returned to the Senate floor to \nmake another important statement that rejected those who have tried to \nplay a divisive ethnic card. He spoke about the true meaning of \ndiversity and our national journey toward equal rights for all. Senator \nSalazar spoke to me before he spoke on the floor. I commend him for \nwhat he has done. I thank him for his remarks. It is what I would have \nexpected from a man of his integrity and quality.\n  Senator Biden observed during the confirmation hearing that none of \nus came to that hearing having determined to vote against the \nnomination. In fact, most of us, I would say, if not all of us on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle in the Judiciary Committee came there \nassuming we were going to vote for him. We listened. We asked \nquestions. We sought answers. We weighed the record.\n  It was not an easy decision for any of us. Each of us would have \nliked to have supported the first Hispanic nominee to be Attorney \nGeneral. We each made a decision on the merits of the nomination. We \ndid not ignore his judgments that contributed to the scandals in the \nwar against terror and the mistreatment of detainees around the world. \nSome have said that some of those positions were embarrassing. They \nwere a lot more than embarrassing; they were a complete scandal.\n  When this nomination was announced last year, many of us were \ninclined to support Judge Gonzales. But as the confirmation process \nunfolded, one by one, members of the Judiciary Committee began to have \ndoubts. Many were troubled by the nominee's refusal to engage with us \nin an open discussion of his views on a wide range of issues.\n  I was particularly concerned because I had actually sent to him and \nto the Republicans in the committee a number of the questions I was \ngoing to ask so he would have plenty of time to prepare to answer. \nInstead, he did not answer.\n  For some, the key question was how Judge Gonzales interprets the \nscope of Executive power and his belief that the President possesses \nauthority to ignore our laws when acting as Commander in Chief. No \nPresident of the United States can ignore our laws, no President of the \nUnited States is above the law any more than any of us are above the \nlaw. For others, the tipping point was the nominee's continued \nadherence to flawed legal reasoning regarding torture, a stubborn \ncommitment betraying seriously poor judgment. Finally, and \ndeeply troubling to many of us, is the nominee's lack of independence \nfrom the President.\n\n  In the end, after serious consideration of the record, each of us \narrived at the same conclusion: In good conscience, we could not vote \nfor this nomination.\n  Now, some have talked about the legal memos he was involved in as \nlegal niceties. Well, Mr. President, torture is not a legal nicety, \nespecially if you are the person being tortured. Those of us who have \nbeen in the military or who have had members of our family in the \nmilitary have always hoped we would hold to the highest standards so we \ncould demand that other countries do the same.\n  It is wrong for partisans to castigate Senators for debating this \nnomination\n\n[[Page S956]]\n\nand for considering the critical role this nominee played in the \ndevelopment of legal policies that were kept hidden for a couple years, \nbut when they were brought forward by the press, not in answer to \nquestions by Members of Congress--the press did our work and brought \nthem forward--those so-called legal niceties could not stand the light \nof day.\n  Consistent with my oath of office, the commitment I have had to the \npeople of Vermont for over 30 years, I will vote my conscience again \ntoday. I urge each and every Senator to do the same. Review the record, \ntruly review the record and the actions of this nominee over the past 4 \nyears and vote accordingly.\n  I do not think I have ever been on the floor of this Senate and \npredicted vote totals. I am not going to today. But I will predict \nthis: Democratic Senators will not vote as a block. Some will vote \nagainst this nomination; some will vote in favor of this nomination. \nThey will do so not on the basis of some party caucus position but as \nindividual Senators. I urge all Senators--Republicans and Democrats and \nIndependent--to approach this vote in that way, on the merits, after \nyou review the record in good conscience. This should not be a party-\nline vote on either side of the aisle but one where each Senator votes \nhis or her best judgment.\n  Many Senators here today no doubt believe that the President is owed \na high degree of deference in his Cabinet choices. I feel that way. But \nthat does not erase our constitutional obligations as Senators. We have \na duty to advise and consent, not to listen and rubberstamp. I take \nthat responsibility very seriously, especially in the case of the \nAttorney General. The Attorney General is unique among Cabinet \nofficers. You can give a lot more flexibility to other Cabinet \nofficials whose main purpose is simply to state the position of the \nPresident of the United States. Whether you agree with the position, \nthat is their duty. So you give a lot more deference, and you say: \nWell, they are going to state the position of the President. We can \nvote for them.\n  But the Attorney General is different. He or she is the top Federal \nlaw enforcement officer in the land. The power and discretion of the \nAttorney General is enormous. The Attorney General has to have \nsufficient independence to uphold the law and enforce the law, even if \ndoing that serves to embarrass or disadvantage the President, even if \nit means taking a position contrary to what the President may want, \nbecause you have to enforce the law.\n  Now, when Judge Gonzales was designated and appeared in the White \nHouse with the President, he offered a very significant insight into \nhow he views the role of the Attorney General. He emphasized how much \nhe looked forward ``to continuing to work with friends and colleagues \nin the White House in a different capacity on behalf of our \nPresident.''\n  During his confirmation hearing, he appeared to continue to serve as \na spokesman for the administration and to be its chief defense lawyer \non a wide variety of important matters. His defenders here on the \nSenate floor have excused his answers by characterizing them as the \nviews of the administration.\n  We are voting on the Attorney General of the United States, not the \nAttorney General of the President. The Attorney General must represent \nthe interests of all Americans and is the nation's chief law \nenforcement officer.\n  One of the key questions raised by this nomination is whether, if \nconfirmed as Attorney General, the nominee will serve not just this \nPresident but all the American people, and whether he will show the \nindependence necessary to enforce the law. We have to know that he is \nthere to represent all of us. We have to know that he can enforce the \nlaw and not be worried about friends, colleagues, or benefactors at the \nWhite House. The Attorney General's duty is to uphold the Constitution \nand the rule of law, not try to find ways to circumvent it to fit the \ndesires of any President.\n  Actually, the President, when you come right down to it, as well as \nthe Nation, are best served by an Attorney General who gives sound \nlegal advice and takes responsible action without regard to political \nconsiderations. Others in the Cabinet are there to just voice the \nopinions of the President. The Attorney General has to be a lot more \nindependent.\n  I raised this matter of independence with Judge Gonzales when he \ntestified, and I reiterated it in a letter I sent to him before his \nhearing. I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 3, 2004.\n     Hon. Alberto R. Gonzales,\n     Counsel to the President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Judge Gonzales: I enjoyed our preliminary meeting and \n     look forward to your confirmation hearings. In following up \n     on our meeting, and to give you and your staff ample \n     opportunity to prepare for the hearings, I write to reiterate \n     several concerns that I have raised in prior discussions and \n     correspondence. When we met on November 17, 2004, I said that \n     these issues will be raised, by myself and other members of \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee, during the upcoming hearings. \n     Based on our conversation, I am encouraged by your \n     willingness to answer questions about your role and your \n     views in these matters.\n       Photographs and reports of prisoner abuse in Iraq and other \n     locations show an interrogation and detention system \n     operating contrary to U.S. law and the Geneva Conventions. In \n     addition to the abhorrent images from the Abu Ghraib prison \n     that were published last spring, actions that have occurred \n     with Administration approval include the forcible rendition \n     of individuals to nations where they may face torture, and \n     the hiding of ``ghost detainees'' from the International \n     Committee of the Red Cross. Reports of abuse continue to \n     emerge. Just this week, The New York Times reported that the \n     Red Cross has charged U.S. military authorities with using \n     physical and psychological coercion ``tantamount to torture'' \n     on prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The Washington Post is \n     reporting that in December 2003 Army generals in Iraq were \n     warned in a confidential report that members of an elite \n     military and CIA task force were abusing detainees. According \n     to The Post, the report concluded that certain arrest and \n     detention practices could be deemed to be ``technically'' \n     illegal.\n       In letters dated May 17 and June 15 of this year, I asked \n     you to describe your role in both the interpretation of the \n     law and the development of policies that led to what I and \n     many others consider to have been a disregard for the rule of \n     law. These letters remain unanswered.\n       My concerns regarding the abuse of prisoners in U.S. \n     custody did not begin with these letters. I have been seeking \n     answers from the Administration for well over a year, before \n     the abuses at Abu Ghraib came to light. In a very few cases \n     my questions were answered, but with information that later \n     proved to be less than accurate. For example, in a news \n     conference on June 22, 2004, you stated, ``In Iraq, it has \n     always been U.S. position that Geneva applies. From the early \n     days of the conflict, both the White House and the \n     Department of Defense have been very public and clear \n     about that.''\n       However, an October 24, 2004, article in The Washington \n     Post revealed yet another Justice Department memo authorizing \n     actions that potentially violate the Geneva Conventions. The \n     draft memo, dated March 19, 2004, apparently was written to \n     authorize the CIA to transfer detainees out of Iraq for \n     interrogation--a practice expressly prohibited by the Geneva \n     Conventions. According to the memo's cover letter, it was \n     drafted at your request.\n       In another example, a June 25, 2003, letter from Department \n     of Defense General Counsel William Haynes stated that the \n     United States was adhering to its international obligations \n     including those under the Convention Against Torture. We \n     later learned of an August 1, 2002, Department of Justice \n     memorandum that twisted the definition of torture in \n     unrecognizable ways. That memo was addressed to you. We also \n     learned months later of the rendition of a Canadian-Syrian \n     citizen to Syria, despite his fear of being tortured there, \n     and despite the Syrian government's well-documented history \n     of torture. Unnamed CIA officials told the press that this \n     man was in fact tortured in Syria.\n       The Committee and the Senate will want to know your role in \n     these situations and your views with regard to the \n     development of the legal justifications that appear to \n     underlie so many of these actions. You will be called upon to \n     explain in detail your role in developing policies related to \n     the interrogation and treatment of foreign prisoners. The \n     American public and the Senate that will be called upon to \n     confirm your appointment deserve to know how a potential \n     Attorney General, the chief law enforcement officer in the \n     nation, will interpret and enforce the laws and how you will \n     develop policy.\n       We want to know what the current policy on torture is, but \n     since the Administration disavowed the August 1, 2002, memo, \n     no public statement of policy has replaced it. Questions \n     remain unanswered on a host of issues. Requests to the White \n     House and the Department of Justice for relevant documents--\n     including my requests to you in May and June of this year--\n     have been ignored or rejected. I\n\n[[Page S957]]\n\n     urge you and the Administration to provide the documents that \n     have been requested by myself and others without further \n     delay so that the hearings will be well informed.\n       Another key concern you will be called upon to discuss is \n     how you view the duties and responsibilities of the Attorney \n     General. As we discussed, I view the White House Counsel \n     position and that of the Attorney General as quite distinct. \n     You may well have viewed this President as your ``client'' \n     while serving him at the White House, although the courts do \n     not recognize an attorney-client privilege in that setting. \n     We will want to know how differently you will act and view \n     your responsibilities as the Attorney General of the United \n     States. finally, I encourage you to commit to cooperating \n     with all members of the Judiciary Committee on issues of \n     oversight and accountability. In the 108th Congress, the \n     Judiciary Committee failed to fulfill its oversight \n     responsibilities. Accountability and improving government \n     performance are sound and long established purposes of \n     congressional oversight, and accountability has been lacking \n     on these and other crucial issues. With a new Congress, and a \n     new Attorney General, I expect a return to the diligent \n     oversight envisioned by our Founders to ensure that the \n     Executive Branch remains accountable to the American people.\n       Our meeting was a constructive beginning at the start of \n     the confirmation process, and I look forward to your hearing \n     early next month. In the meantime, Marcelle and I send our \n     best wishes to you and your family and hope that you have a \n     restful and rewarding holiday season.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n                                        Ranking Democratic Member.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I was not surprised to hear him say that the \nresponsibilities of the Attorney General are different than those as \nWhite House Counsel. But I did not see that during the hearings. He \ndeferred to the official policies of this administration throughout the \nJudiciary Committee proceedings.\n  When asked about the Bybee memo, he said:\n\n       I don't have a disagreement with the conclusions then \n     reached by the Department.\n\n  And he stated a patently false reading of the torture convention that \nwould allow for foreigners captured overseas to be subjected to cruel, \ninhuman, and degrading treatment at the hands of American captors or \nsurrogates. He appeared to accept the notion that the President has the \nauthority to immunize somebody to commit torture under his command.\n  A letter signed by a number of high-ranking former military officers, \nincluding the former head of the Joint Chiefs, GEN John Shalikashvili, \nsaid the interrogation policies that Judge Gonzales helped to define \n``have fostered greater animosity toward the United States, undermined \nour intelligence-gathering efforts, and added to the risks facing our \ntroops serving around the world.''\n  The best evidence we have is that he rejected the advice of Secretary \nPowell and career military officers when he recommended to the \nPresident the Geneva Conventions should not apply to the conflict in \nAfghanistan. Admiral John D. Hutson, the former Judge Advocate General \nof the Navy, testified to the Judiciary Committee that the advice given \nby Judge Gonzales to the President on this point was ``shallow in its \nlegal analysis, short-sighted in its implications, and altogether ill-\nadvised. Frankly, it was just wrong.''\n  These military men are joined in opposition to this nomination by a \nlarge number of organizations, including the Leadership Conference on \nCivil Rights, the La Raza Centro Legal, and the Mexican-American \nPolitical Association. Three leading human rights organizations, Human \nRights Watch, Human Rights First, and Physicians for Human Rights, none \nof which have ever opposed a nomination before, did so for the very \nfirst time. They acknowledge that the struggle to stamp out torture \naround the world ``has been made harder by the legal positions adopted \nby the Bush Administration, including Mr. Gonzales's refusal to state \nthat a President could not lawfully order torture.'' The Congressional \nHispanic Caucus and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational \nFund both issued statements stating that they cannot support this \nnomination. I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a list of \norganizations opposing or not supporting the nomination.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Organizations Opposed to the Confirmation of Alberto R. Gonzales\n\n     Alliance for Justice\n     Americans for Democratic Action\n     Center for American Progress\n     Center for Constitutional Rights\n     Friends Committee on National Legislation\n     Global Rights: Partners for Justice\n     Human Rights First\n     Human Rights Watch\n     International League for Human Rights\n     La Raza Centro Legal\n     Leadership Conference on Civil Rights\n     The Mexican-American Political Association (MAPA)\n     Minnesota Advocates for Human Rights\n     National Alliance for Human Rights\n     People for the American Way\n     Physicians for Human Rights\n     Physicians for Social Responsibility\n     Plainfield Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends \n         (Plainfield, VT)\n     REFUGE (Torture survivors program)\n     RFK Memorial Center for Human Rights\n     The Shalom Center\n     Veterans for Common Sense\n  Mr. LEAHY. While I have heard partisan attacks from the other side of \nthe aisle, I have not heard Republicans offer a strong defense of Judge \nGonzales's actions and judgment. What they come back to again and again \nis his inspirational life story. Having an Hispanic American serve as \nAttorney General is overdue and something to which I look forward. \nHaving an African American serve as Attorney General is, likewise, \noverdue. In his letter to the Judiciary Committee, retired Major \nGeneral Melvyn Montano may have said it best: ``Judge Gonzales should \nbe evaluated on his record, not his ethnicity.''\n  At particular moments in our history, the Senate at its best can be \nthe conscience of the Nation. The history books and our children and \ngrandchildren will look back on these times and make their own \njudgments about how worthily the Senate has served that role as we \nconfront any number of difficult issues in these challenging times. But \nI do believe that, whatever the outcome of this confirmation \nproceeding, it is worthy of the Senate that we at least held this \ndebate. It is worthy of the Senate that these issues were deemed \nimportant enough to discuss for several days on the floor of the United \nStates Senate. To have wished them away or to have just glossed over \nthem would have been a disservice not only to today's generations of \nAmericans, in and out of uniform, but also to tomorrow's generations of \nAmericans. And it would have been a disservice to the Senate that we \nall so deeply respect.\n  I have deeply believed that it should concern the Senate that we have \nseen departures from our country's honorable traditions, practices, and \nestablished law in the use of torture, originating at the top ranks of \nauthority and emerging at the bottom. At the bottom of the chain of \ncommand, we have seen a few courts-martial, but at the top we have seen \nmedal ceremonies, pats on the back, and promotions.\n  At his recent inaugural address, I praised President Bush for his \neloquent words about our country's historic support for freedom. But to \nbe true to that vision, we need a government that leads the way in \nupholding human rights, not one secretly developing legalistic \nrationalizations for circumventing them. We need to climb our way back \nto the high moral ground that has distinguished our great country and \nthat has been an inspiration to the whole world.\n  Members of the Senate have a solemn obligation to uphold the law and \nthe Constitution. Each of us has to decide whether the nominee has the \nsound judgment and the independence required to be Attorney General. I \nwould have been willing to vote for Judge Gonzales in a number of \ndifferent positions of Government, but not in this one. I wish we could \nvote for his life story and not for the actual record. Unfortunately, \nwe are voting on the record. I ask each Senator to consider it.\n  I know that each will consult his or her conscience in reaching a \ndecision, and that is in keeping with the best traditions of the \nSenate.\n  If I have time remaining, I yield it back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it has been a long month for Judge \nGonzales, starting with his hearing on January 6, through today. It has \nbeen a long month for the Senate, as we have considered his testimony, \nheard him, deliberated about him, and now 3 days of\n\n[[Page S958]]\n\nargument on the Senate floor about Judge Gonzales. What is striking to \nme is how little there has been about the 49 years of this man's life \ncontrasted with a few meetings where the contents have been grossly \ndistorted.\n  This is a man who has an extraordinary record, but it has not been \nthe subject of analysis or discussion today as to whether he has the \nqualifications to be Attorney General of the United States.\n  What are those qualifications? A man of intellectual achievement, a \ngraduate of Rice University, a graduate of Harvard Law School, \nprofessional competence demonstrated by practicing law, a distinguished \ncareer as a state supreme court justice in Texas, his work for Governor \nGeorge W. Bush in Texas, his work for 4 years as White House Counsel \nwhere he has come into contact with so many Members of the Senate, and \nquite a few of those Members have spoken out about him before the \nmisrepresentations of what happened in a few meetings, which have led \npeople to inappropriately blame Judge Gonzales for what happened at Abu \nGhraib or Guantanamo.\n  But what have Members of the Senate had to say about Judge Gonzales \non their work with him?\n  Senator Kohl said:\n\n       We have had an opportunity to work together on several \n     different issues over the years, and I have come to respect \n     you also. And I believe if you are confirmed that you will do \n     a good job as Attorney General of the United States.\n\n  Senator Durbin:\n\n       I respect him and his life story very much.\n\n  Senator Leahy:\n\n       . . . I like and respect Judge Gonzales.\n\n  Senator Biden:\n\n       He has overcome great adversity in his life, and I believe \n     he is an intelligent, decent, and honorable man.\n  Senator Schumer, who has had very extensive contact with Judge \nGonzales because the State of New York has a great many Federal judges, \nhad this to say:\n\n       I like Judge Gonzales. I respect him. I think he is a \n     gentleman and I think he is a genuinely good man. We have \n     worked very well together, especially when it comes to \n     filling the vacancies on New York's Federal bench. He has \n     been straightforward with me and he has been open to \n     compromise. Our interactions haven't just been cordial; they \n     have been pleasant. I have enjoyed the give-and-take we have \n     engaged in.\n       I was inclined to support Judge Gonzales. I believed and I \n     stated publicly early on that Judge Gonzales was a less \n     polarizing figure than Senator Ashcroft had been.\n       I still have great respect for Judge Gonzales. He has the \n     kind of Horatio Alger story that makes us all proud to be \n     Americans. It is an amazing country when a man can rise from \n     such humble beginnings to be nominated for Attorney General.\n\n  And what Senator Schumer was referring to was the fact that there \nwere seven siblings, a mother and father, two-room accommodations, no \nhot water, referring to his Horatio Alger story, up from the bootstraps \nwithout even boots.\n  When Senator Lieberman took the floor this afternoon, there was for \nthe first time, except for Senator Salazar, at least as I recollect, \ncomments from the other side of the aisle about the man's character and \nabout the man's background.\n  Well, what happened? There was a memorandum which has been quoted \nagainst Judge Gonzales repeatedly where, referring to the Geneva \nConvention, the words ``quaint'' and ``obsolete'' were used. But what \nwas the context? This is what he said:\n\n       This new paradigm--that is, after 9/11--renders obsolete \n     Geneva's strict limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners \n     and renders quaint some of its provisions requiring that the \n     captured enemy be afforded such things as commissary \n     privileges, scrip--that is, advances of monthly pay--athletic \n     uniforms, and scientific instruments.\n\n  Well, nobody is going to say that al-Qaida or the Taliban would have \nany commissary privileges--not an issue. Whether there would be \nadvances of monthly pay--not an issue. Athletic uniforms--not an issue. \nScientific instruments--not an issue. So there is simply a recognition \nthat it was quaint, that it didn't apply to the situation at hand.\n  The charges against Judge Gonzales have been that he was the \narchitect of what happened at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, which is a \nstretch beyond any conceivable justification from the record in this \ncase. What did Judge Gonzales do? Judge Gonzales asked that the \nDepartment of Justice prepare a legal memorandum on the law. That is \nthe responsibility of the Department of Justice. Then he participated \nin several meetings, and he was candid about what happened in those \nmeetings, as best he or anybody could recall on meetings that happened \nseveral years ago. And then, understandably, he said it was a matter \nfor the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency, \nwhere they had the expert questioners, to decide what questions to \npropound to the detainees. And from that participation, he has been \ncharged with monstrous offenses.\n  The so-called Bybee memorandum of August 2002 has been denounced. It \nwas denounced by Judge Gonzales. I asked him the specific question \nabout the assertion in the Department of Justice memorandum that the \nPresident had as much authority on questioning detainees as he had on \nbattlefield decisions--an absolutely preposterous assertion--and Judge \nGonzales said, no, he disagreed with that. There had been a comment \nthat he respected the authority of the Department of Justice to render \na legal opinion because of the continuing concern not only from this \nPresident, but prior Presidents, that if the White House tried to tell \nthe Justice Department what the words were, or to control it, the White \nHouse could be guilty of politicization. Judge Gonzales understandably \nsteered away from that.\n  In terms of being deferential to the role of the Department of \nJustice, but not to the August 2002 memorandum, which he denounced and \nwhich he said was incorrect when it asserted great powers to the \nPresident, with the suggestion that the President have the power to \nignore the law, or which suggested inferentially, very tenuously about \nthe President having the authority, were explicit on granting immunity, \nwhich, of course, the President doesn't have the authority to do.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains of my 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  The essence of Judge Gonzales's role was summarized by one of his \nstatements, consistent with his entire testimony. It is this:\n\n       Shortly after September 11, 2001, until the present, the \n     administration has been involved in conducting the war on \n     terror by gathering as much information from terrorists as we \n     possibly can within the bounds of the law. During that time, \n     I have participated in several meetings at which the possible \n     use of methods of questioning were discussed. These meetings \n     may have included, from time to time, representatives from \n     the National Security Council, the Department of State, the \n     Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, Central \n     Intelligence Agency, and others. In the meetings I attended, \n     agencies' representatives raised concerns that certain \n     terrorists had information that might save American lives. \n     The participants shared the desire to explore whether there \n     existed methods of questioning these terrorists that might \n     elicit that information. It was always very clear that we \n     would implement such methods only within the bounds of the \n     law. As counsel to the President, my constant interest is and \n     was on the last factor, enduring compliance with the law.\n\n  There you have Judge Gonzales's role. He listened to the Department \nof Justice, which had the responsibility to interpret the law on what \nthe appropriate conduct was. When it was off the wall or over the top, \nhe disagreed with it. It is up to the Department of Defense and CIA--\nthe experts on questioning--to make decisions on those matters.\n\n  Judge Gonzales was explicit in his opening statement. He didn't wait \nfor anybody to ask him any questions about the scope and role of the \nAttorney General--that it was much broader than being Counsel to the \nPresident.\n  On the totality of this record, I suggest to my colleagues that Judge \nGonzales is qualified to be Attorney General of the United States. When \nyou look at his life, some 49 years, and at the values which he \ndemonstrated in many lines, values he demonstrated as a young man \nfacing great adversity and achieving a college education at Rice--that \nis not easy--going to the Harvard Law School--that is not easy--\npracticing law with a prestigious firm and distinguishing himself; \ntaking on a responsibility for the Governor of Texas; being a justice \non the State Supreme Court; and his positions as White House counsel \nwere very progressive and independent. He took a\n\n[[Page S959]]\n\nstand in opposition to the White House, favoring affirmative action on \nthe University of Michigan lawsuit, a very controversial matter. It is \nnot easy for White House Counsel to stand up in the midst of a great \ndeal of polarized contentions and be in favor of affirmative action. \nWhen the Texas statute came up--the so-called bypass--on what a young \nwoman had to do to obtain an abortion with respect to satisfying the \nrequirements for an order of the court allowing a bypass, Judge \nGonzales took a position which was sharply criticized by those on the \nfar right of the party, showing independence, showing values, showing \njudgment. You can contrast that with a few meetings where Judge \nGonzales played an appropriate role, except to the extent that there \nhave been representations and attenuations and inferences that are far \nbeyond any of the testimony or anything that has been said.\n  So if you take the scanty fathoms, scanty ideas, scanty speculation--\nI guess that is the best word--from those meetings, it is totally \nunsubstantiated by the record; and everything on the record shows Judge \nGonzales is worthy of being confirmed as Attorney General of the United \nStates.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor. I am sure the leaders will \nappear shortly to take the remainder of their time. In the absence of a \nSenator seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CHAFEE). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, our great Nation was founded on the idea of \nhuman rights. From the very beginning, we were designed to be a place \nwhere men and women could live free, a place where no man was above the \nlaw, a place where the state would never trample on the rights of \nindividuals.\n  We did not always live up to our ideals. Along the way, we stumbled. \nWe have made mistakes. But we always worked to correct our mistakes. We \nworked to uphold the core values that formed our national soul.\n  Because of our unshakable belief in human rights, we became a ray of \nlight, a beacon for people in other parts of the world. America has \nbeen that beacon because we are a nation governed by laws, not by men.\n  We are a nation where no one, not even the President of the United \nStates, is above the law. We are a nation where our military is bound \nby the uniform Code of Military Justice and the laws of war. And we are \na nation that even at war stands for and upholds the rule of law.\n  There is no question gathering intelligence from suspects in our war \non terror is critical to protecting this great Nation. No one in this \nChamber would argue otherwise, I would think. These are very bad people \nwith whom we are dealing. But when interrogation turns to torture, it \nputs our own soldiers at risk. It undermines the very freedoms \nAmericans are fighting to protect.\n  We are a nation at war--a war in Iraq and a war against terrorism--\nbut this war does not give our civilian leaders the authority to cast \naside the laws of armed conflict, nor does it allow our Commander in \nChief to decide which laws apply and which laws do not apply. To do so \nputs, I repeat, our own soldiers and our Nation at risk.\n  But that is what has occurred under the direction and coordination of \nthe man seeking to be Attorney General of the United States, Alberto \nGonzales, a man I personally like, but whose judgment on these very \nserious matters was flawed and is flawed.\n  I have heard a great deal on this Senate floor about Judge Gonzales's \nbackground over the last few days, how his parents were migrant farm \nworkers, and how he worked his way up from poverty. It is an inspiring \nstory, and it is one that resonates with me.\n  I met with Judge Gonzales after the President sent his nomination to \nthe Senate. We talked about our childhoods, about coming from small \nrural towns, some would say without many advantages. The fact that \nsomeone from a place called Humble, TX, and someone from a place called \nSearchlight, NV, have had an opportunity to achieve their dream is what \nAmerica is all about.\n  But, embodying the American dream is not a sufficient qualification \nto be Attorney General of the United States.\n  The Attorney General is the people's lawyer, not the President's \nlawyer. He is charged with upholding the Constitution and the rule of \nlaw. The Attorney General must be independent, and he must be clear \nthat abuses by our Government will not be tolerated.\n  Judge Gonzales's appearance before the Judiciary Committee raised \nserious questions about his ability to be that force in the Justice \nDepartment. That is why I am going to vote against him.\n  In 2002, Judge Gonzales provided legal advice to the President of the \nUnited States calling parts of the Geneva Conventions obsolete and \nquaint--that is what he said, they were obsolete and quaint--opening \nthe door for confusion and a range of harsh interrogation techniques.\n  What are the Geneva Conventions? At the end of the Civil War, people \nfrom around the world decided there should be some semblance of order \nin how war is conducted. Starting in 1864, there was a convention \nadopted, and there have been four revisions to the Geneva Convention. \nThat is why it is referred to as the Geneva Conventions because it is, \nin effect, four treaties.\n\n  This is basically an agreement concerning the treatment of prisoners \nof war, of the sick, wounded, and dead in battle. These are treaties \nthat relate to what happens to human beings in war. These conventions \nhave been accepted by virtually every nation in the world.\n  A former Navy judge advocate general, RADM John Hutson, said:\n\n       When you say something down the chain of command, like `the \n     Geneva Conventions don't apply,' that sets the stage for the \n     kind of chaos we have seen.\n\n  The President signed an order accepting the reasoning of the Gonzales \nmemo. The Presidential order was the legal basis for the interrogation \ntechniques and other actions, including torture, which simply took as \nfact that the Geneva Conventions did not apply.\n  Can you imagine that, the United States saying the Geneva Conventions \ndo not apply? But that is what took place.\n  Our military lawyers, not people who are retired acting as Monday-\nmorning quarterbacks, but our military lawyers who are working today, \nwho are experts in the field, have said the interrogation techniques \nauthorized as a result of the Presidential order and allowed under the \nGonzales reasoning were in violation of the U.S. military law, the U.S. \ncriminal law, and international law.\n  According to RADM Don Guter, a former Navy judge advocate general:\n\n       If we--we being the uniformed lawyers--that is, the lawyers \n     who are in the U.S. military--had been listened to and what \n     we said put into practice, then these abuses would not have \n     occurred.\n\n  So the people who serve in our military who gave legal advice said \nthis should never have happened.\n  After the scandal at Abu Ghraib and the recent allegations of abuse \nat Guantanamo, I expected at this hearing before the Judiciary \nCommittee to hear Judge Gonzales discuss the error of the \nadministration's policies and the legal advice he provided the \nPresident.\n  When he came before the committee, Judge Gonzales stood by his legal \nreasoning and the policy of his reasoning. Judge Gonzales called the \nPresident's Geneva determination ``absolutely the right decision.''\n  With regard to the legal opinion Judge Gonzales solicited in the \nJustice Department so-called ``torture memo,'' he stated at his \nhearing, ``I don't have a disagreement with the conclusions then \nreached by the Department,'' even though the Department itself has now \ndisavowed this legal reasoning.\n  I heard Senator Kennedy state that the dean of Yale Law School, \nprobably the No. 1 law school in the entire country, has said he has \nnever seen legal reasoning as bad as the Gonzales memo. That is pretty \nbad.\n  For example, military lawyers who are experts in the field have said \nwithout the order issued by the President, at Mr. Gonzales's behest, \nthey would take the position that the interrogation techniques used \nagainst Taliban prisoners and later in Iraq would be violations of U.S. \nmilitary law, U.S. criminal law, and international law.\n\n[[Page S960]]\n\n  So who are we to believe? These people who are dedicated to making \nsure that they, as the legal officers of the U.S. military, do what is \nright? They say we should follow the Geneva Conventions. Gonzales \nsaid--not necessary.\n  I will say a word about the interrogation techniques that were \nauthorized. They included forced nakedness, forced shaving of beards, \nand the use of dogs, just to name a few. Many are specifically designed \nto attack the prisoner's cultural and religious taboos.\n  In describing them, the similarities to what eventually happened at \nAbu Ghraib are obvious. Once you order an 18-year-old, a young man or \nwoman, to strip prisoners naked, to force them into painful positions, \nto shave their beards in violation of their religious beliefs, to lock \nthem alone in the dark and cold, how do you tell him to stop? You \ncannot.\n  We have seen the pictures of naked men stacked on top of each other \nin the so-called pyramid; rapes of men, rapes of women, leading in some \ncases to death. How does one tell an American soldier that torture is a \nvalid treatment as long as the Government says the prisoner is not \ncovered by the Geneva Conventions?\n  Any student of history would know that the North Vietnamese said \ncaptured U.S. pilots were not protected as prisoners of war because \nthere was no declared war. That is what happened in the Vietnam war. \nThey kept our men in solitary confinement for months, sometimes years \nat a time.\n  I will tell my colleagues about one of our men and what that man said \nabout his treatment by the Vietnamese:\n\n       It's an awful thing, solitary. It crushes your spirit and \n     weakens your resistance more effectively than any other form \n     of mistreatment. . . .\n\n  Here, I would make an editorial comment that this man knows about any \nother kind of treatment. He was brutally beaten, limbs broken, limbs \nalready broken rebroken. So he knows what he is talking about. So I \nrepeat, a direct quote:\n\n       It's an awful thing, solitary. It crushes your spirit and \n     weakens your resistance more effectively than any other form \n     of mistreatment. Having no one else to rely on, to share \n     confidences with, to seek counsel from, you begin to doubt \n     your judgment and your courage.\n\n  The man who said these words was a Navy pilot, LCDR John McCain. For \nJohn McCain and all our soldiers serving across the globe, we need to \nstand against torture because of what it does to us as a country, to \nthose serving now, to the future servicemen of our country, and what it \ndoes to us as a nation.\n  If we fail to oppose an evil as obvious as torture--it is an evil and \nit is obvious it is wrong--then as President Thomas Jefferson said, I \nwill ``tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just.''\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Senate is about to vote on the \nnomination of Judge Alberto Gonzales for Attorney General. We have had \n3 days of spirited debate. I am gratified that my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle decided not to block an up-or-down vote on his \nnomination.\n  Judge Gonzales is eminently qualified to serve as our Nation's top \nlaw enforcement officer. He is an outstanding candidate who deserves \nour strong support.\n  Unfortunately, during the course of this process a number of \ngroundless criticisms have been unfairly leveled against Judge \nGonzales, many of them based on exaggeration or quotations taken out of \ncontext. I will take this opportunity to very briefly address them for \nthe record.\n  First, President Bush does not have, nor has his administration ever \nhad, an official Government policy condoning or authorizing torture or \nprisoner abuse.\n  Let me restate for the record an excerpt from a Presidential memo \ndated February 7, 2002:\n\n       Our values as a Nation, values that we share with many \n     nations in the world, call for us to treat detainees \n     humanely, including those who are not legally entitled to \n     such treatment. . . .As a matter of policy, the United States \n     Armed Forces shall continue to treat detainees humanely and, \n     to the extent appropriate and consistent with the military \n     necessity, in a manner consistent with the principles of the \n     Geneva Conventions governing the laws of war.\n\n  Second, neither Judge Gonzales nor the President have condoned, \nadvocated, or authorized torture of prisoners. In fact, on numerous \noccasions both have explicitly condemned torture as an abhorrent \ninterrogation technique.\n  Third, Judge Gonzales was not the author but the recipient of memos \nfocusing on interrogation methods of captured terrorists. The research \nmemos that have been the focus of so much attention and criticism were \nwritten by the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice to \nJudge Gonzales as White House Counsel. The memos explored the legal \ninterpretation of a Federal law. They did not set administration \npolicy. The Department of Justice has since categorically withdrawn \nthis controversial legal analysis, stating unequivocally:\n\n       Torture is abhorrent, both to American law and to \n     international norms.\n\n  These are the facts, straight and simple. Judge Gonzales has acted \nwith total professionalism and high regard for the law. Suggestions to \nthe contrary are baseless and a slur against an honorable man. Judge \nGonzales is highly qualified to be America's next Attorney General. \nJudge Gonzales is a man of keen intellect, high achievement, and \nunwavering respect for the law. He will continue to build on the \nsuccess of the last 4 years in reducing crime, fighting corporate \nfraud, and upholding our civil rights. As our first Hispanic-American \nAttorney General, Judge Gonzales will stand as an inspiration to all \nAmericans. I urge my colleagues to offer their full support to Alberto \nGonzales as our next Attorney General.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Alberto R.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for the affirmative \nvote in support of Judge Gonzales to be the next Attorney General of \nthe United States. The final vote of 60 to 36 reflects a degree of \nbipartisanship.\n  Judge Gonzales takes on this heavy mantle of responsibility as \nAttorney General of the United States being very well qualified to do \nso. He has worked as White House Counsel, as we all know, for 4 years, \nand has worked closely with many, if not most, of the Senators who have \nhad judicial nominations which have come to him. I put into the Record \nmany laudatory, complimentary statements which were made about Judge \nGonzales for his work as White House Counsel.\n  Regrettably, the incidents at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo--particularly \nat Abu Ghraib--are a major blemish. At Guantanamo the problem is still \nunder investigation. Those incidents, realistically viewed, were not \nthe responsibility of Judge Gonzales. His role was a limited one. It is \nup to the Department of Justice to provide legal opinions as to the \nscope of appropriate conduct, up to the experts in the Department of \nDefense, the CIA to formulate the questions. But 60 votes is good, \nsound support for Judge Gonzales. I am pleased to see his confirmation \nhas been approved by the Senate.

Mr. President, we are embarking on a debate with respect \nto the subject of Social Security. Last evening, the President gave a \nState of the Union Address and today is traveling around the country to \ntalk about a very important issue, Social Security.\n  In many ways the issue is about values. There has been a great deal \nof discussion about values in this country, especially as it applies to \npolitical debates. I think the debate about the Social Security system \nis a debate about values.\n  Some months ago, a friend of mine died in a small community in North \nDakota. I sent some flowers and called. He was a man in his eighties. \nHe lived a great life. He was a wonderful person. I got a note from his \nwife. Here is what she said about her husband. She said: Oscar always \nhelped his neighbors and he always looked out for those who did not \nhave it so good. That is all she said. But what a wonderful description \nof someone's value system and of someone's life: He always helped his \nneighbors and always looked out for those who did not have it so good.\n  In many ways that prompted the origin of the Social Security program. \nIn the 1930s, one-half of America's senior citizens were living in \npoverty.\n  When I was a young boy, my father asked me, in the town of 300 people \nwhere we lived, to drive an old fellow to the hospital. The man lived \nalone in a very small shack. He did not have any relatives. He lived \nalone, and he was quite sick. My dad asked if I would drive him to the \nhospital. The nearest hospital was 60 miles away.\n  I went over and picked him up and drove him to the hospital. He never \nmade it back. But this old man, who was then sick and did not have very \nmuch, lived on Social Security. The only thing he had was a small \nSocial Security check, but it was the difference for that man between \nnot having money to buy food, not having money to live, and being able \nto survive.\n  I know--and my colleagues know--how critically important Social \nSecurity has been to so many of America's elderly. Yes, I am talking \nabout the people who built this country. I am talking about the people \nwho built America's schools and roads and worked in America's \nfactories. They are the people who turned this country into the \nstrongest economy in the world, a beacon of hope for all people. Then \nthey grow old and retire, and they reach their declining income years. \nThe question is, what is there for them?\n  The one thing that for 70 years has always been there for them is \nsomething called Social Security. No, it is not an investment program. \nIt is an insurance program. The money that goes into the Social \nSecurity system comes out of paychecks in something called the FICA \ntax. The FICA is not for investment. The ``I'' stands for \n``insurance.'' Social Security has been a core insurance program. It \nprovides insurance with respect to benefits for those who retire. It \nprovides benefits for those who are disabled, and it provides benefits \nfor dependent children. For example, when the breadwinner of the house \nlost their life, dependent children received the benefits. So it is \nmore than a retirement program, but it is also that. It is the risk-\nfree portion of retirement. It is the piece that for 70 years the \nAmerican elderly could count on. They would know it would be there no \nmatter what.\n  Some have never liked it and have always wanted to take it apart. \nThere was a memorandum leaked about 3 weeks ago from the White House \nthat was interesting. It was from the chief strategist who is putting \ntogether this program to privatize a portion of Social Security. That \nmemorandum said toward the end something that was very interesting. It \nsaid: This is the first time in six decades we have a chance to win \nthis fight on Social Security. Of course, the whole implication of that \nis, we have never liked it, but we have had to bear with it. Now we \nhave a chance to deal with it.\n  The administration, as announced by the President last evening, wants \nto make some changes. He says the Social Security system is in crisis. \nHe predicted last night that at a certain time the Social Security \nsystem would be bankrupt. But it is not in crisis, and it will not be \nbankrupt. He is simply wrong.\n  Our colleague, former Senator Pat Moynihan, used to say: Everyone is \nentitled to their opinion, but not everyone is entitled to their own \nset of facts. I hope we can discuss this issue using the same set of \nfacts, at least.\n  Let me begin by saying something most everyone would acknowledge. In \nthe year 1935, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the law that \ncreated Social Security to protect our elderly from what he called \n``poverty-ridden old age,'' one half of the senior citizens in this \ncountry were impoverished. Now it is slightly less than 10 percent.\n  Has the Social Security program worked? Of course, it has. It has \nbeen a remarkable program that has lifted tens of millions of senior \ncitizens out of poverty. It has worked over the years unfailingly.\n  The President says it is in crisis. It is set to be bankrupt at some \npoint. Therefore, let's make some changes. He says: Let's create \nprivate accounts with a portion of the Social Security system and \ninvest it in the stock market.\n  What he didn't say last night was how he would do that. He would be \nrequired to borrow $1 to $3 trillion at a time when we are up to our \nneck in debt with the highest budget deficits in the history of \nAmerica. He would borrow $1 to $3 trillion in additional funding, \ninvest it in private accounts in the stock market, cut Social Security \nbenefits at the same time, and say that somehow this is going to be \nbetter for our elderly. With great respect--and I\n\n[[Page S962]]\n\nhave great respect for this President--he is flat wrong.\n  I know he is telling us what he thinks will happen in the year 2020, \n2040, 2050. Four years ago the President told us what he thought would \nhappen in the next 10 years. He said: We will have the largest budget \nsurpluses in history. Four years later, we have the largest budget \ndeficits in the history of our country. This administration can't see 4 \nyears ahead, let alone 40 years. Economic projections are very \nuncertain under the best of circumstances. You show me great economists \nand I will show you people who can't remember their address or their \ntelephone number, but they can tell us with great certainty projections \nof 40 and 50 years. Of course, that is all nonsense.\n  All of us hope for a future that has robust economic growth. We hope \nthings will be well. But we don't know. That is why 4 years ago, when \nthe President was saying: We are going to have huge budget surpluses \nand let's provide very large tax cuts the bulk of which went to upper-\nincome people let's do that right now, I stood up in the Senate and \nsaid: Maybe we ought to be a little conservative. What if these budget \nsurpluses don't materialize? What if something happens? Never mind, \nthey said. And so they put in place these policies. We now have the \nlargest budget deficits in the history of the country. They say: What, \nus? We didn't do that.\n  Of course, this fiscal policy is way off track.\n  Now the President said last night that Social Security is broken. It \nis going to go bankrupt and somehow it must be fixed. He says it ought \nto be fixed by privatizing a portion of it, by putting it in the stock \nmarket and borrowing a substantial amount of money to accommodate that \nand cut Social Security benefits at the same time.\n  Let me go through a couple of points about that. This is from Paul \nKrugman of the New York Times. He says:\n\n       The actuaries predict that economic growth, which averaged \n     3.4 percent per year over the last 75 years, will average \n     only 1.9 percent over the next 75 years. In the long run, \n     profits grow at the same rate as the economy. . . . Any \n     growth projection that would permit the stock returns the \n     privatizers need to make their schemes work would put Social \n     Security solidly in the black.\n\n  His point is an interesting one and central to the discussion. The \nPresident says there are serious financing problems with Social \nSecurity. He uses language such as ``flat busted'' and ``bankrupt.'' \nThey do that because the Social Security actuaries use a very \nconservative estimate of economic growth, much below the economic \ngrowth of the past 75 years. But then he says: If we put money in the \nstock market, that will have higher investment returns. And they base \nthese higher returns on higher economic growth.\n  The point is, if you have the high economic growth that they use to \nproject these returns, the Social Security system doesn't need fixing \nat all. It doesn't need adjustments at all. It is well and able to be \navailable for the long term. If we get any kind of reasonable economic \ngrowth, the Social Security system is fine for the long term. If we \ndon't get the kind of economic growth we would hope and expect, then \nthe investments in the stock market the President wants to make by \ntaking Social Security funding away are not going to provide the \nreturns he promises.\n  You can't have it both ways. You can't argue both sides of that. It \ndoesn't make any sense. Mr. Krugman is right.\n  Peter Orszag from the Brookings Institute testified last Friday at a \nhearing I chaired:\n\n     . . . young workers today in the middle of the income \n     distribution would experience a reduction in benefits of \n     almost 40 percent, or about $9,000 a year, even including the \n     payout from the individual accounts included in the plan.\n\n  To better illustrate, this is from the Congressional Budget Office, a \nnonpartisan office that we rely on. We fund it and rely on it, \nRepublicans and Democrats, for our estimates. The Congressional Budget \nOffice points out the Bush plan would not only slash guaranteed \nbenefits but private accounts don't nearly make up for the loss.\n  In fact, workers will be worse off than they are now--much worse off, \nas you can see from the graph. The green represents the guaranteed \nbenefit, and the workers would receive the yellow, which is the income \nfrom private accounts. As you see, it falls far short of what they \nwould receive under the current Social Security program.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, which I referenced, said that the \nSocial Security program can pay 100 percent of its benefits from now \nuntil 2052. After 2052, it can pay only 78 percent. That assumes that \nwe have dramatically lower income growth for the next 75 years than we \nhad in the previous 75 years. If we have any reasonable economic \ngrowth, we don't have any kind of a problem here. There is no \nshortfall. In 2052, the Congressional Budget Office says we would be \nabout 22 percent short of paying full benefits. The benefits we would \npay then will still be higher than we pay now in real terms.\n  If all of this happens, we will need to make adjustments in Social \nSecurity. But those adjustments don't represent a major surgery or a \nwholesale operation. They can be reasonably modest adjustments that \nkeep Social Security whole and strengthen Social Security for the long \nterm.\n  Let me show you what is happening with respect to the trust fund. The \nmoney that is taken out of workers' paychecks to put into the Social \nSecurity account is now more than is necessary to fund Social Security. \nThis past year, $151 billion more was collected in Social Security than \nis necessary. That is to be put into a trust fund, not for the purpose \nof spending on other things, not for funding the war against terrorism, \nnot for highways or health care or law enforcement; it is only for the \npurpose of funding Social Security. And so the trust funds are made up \nof Treasury bonds. That is what the money is used to purchase--a \nTreasury bond. That treasury bond then pays interest. This is what \nhappens to those buildups of assets: $1.68 trillion in 2004. It would \nbe more than that in 2005, an annual surplus in Social Security trust \nfunds. You can see what is happening on this graph all the way out to \n2040. That is the taxes that are collected to be put into this account \nas well as the interest that is earned on these trust funds. You can \nsee what is happening. It is not something that justifies someone \ncalling this bankrupt or flat busted as some do.\n  Even Mr. George Will, a columnist who is a rather predictable and \nconsistent conservative and has written for many years as a \nconservative voice, has said that this is not about economics, it is \nabout philosophy. Why did he say that? Because the arguments for the \nPresident's plan don't stand on their own in terms of economics. They \ndon't add up, they don't fit, and they don't square with the facts. It \nis about philosophy. It is about people who have not liked Social \nSecurity and would like to take it apart.\n  If we have any kind of robust growth--this is from the Social \nSecurity trustees' annual report--if we have optimistic economic growth \nassumptions, not the pessimistic ones, on the graph you see what \nhappens: The trust fund assets go up out into the future past 2080. So \nthis notion that somehow that is a crisis, there is an impending \nbankruptcy, the system is flat busted, is just wrong.\n  Once again, I respect very much the President. I understand that he \nhas a right to offer these proposals. Some see this as novel and \naggressive. He would see it as transformational. I happen to think \nthere are some things that represent timeless truths. There are some \nvalues that to embrace is not old-fashioned, or if old-fashioned is \nworthy of credit. If it is old-fashioned to support a program that has \nworked well for 75 years and will work for the next 75 years and \nlonger, which helps lift America's elderly out of poverty, then we \nshould just accept the notion and plead guilty to being hopelessly old-\nfashioned, believing that this is the value that strengthens America.\n  When those who build in this country--the people who go to work every \nday, build the private companies, build the manufacturing plants, build \nthe roads and the schools--when they retire and reach their diminished-\nincome years, we don't want them living in poverty. That is why as a \ncountry we put together this program called Social Security as a basic \ninsurance program.\n  Some say--England has gone to private accounts, and Chile, which \neverybody points to as a country which has\n\n[[Page S963]]\n\ngone to private accounts--that means you can earn more in the \nmarketplace. Let me talk about Chile. In Chile, the only program that \nexists are those private accounts. You don't have company pensions, for \nexample; you have these private accounts. Do you know what happened in \nChile? They are telling old folks: Why don't you delay retirement until \nthe stock market comes back a bit?\n  That is the experience with Chile. In England, what we have \ndiscovered is the companies are charging massive fees, overcharging \npeople. They have had bad experiences with these private accounts. In \nthis country, the Social Security system has been there consistently, \nand it works. So the question is, why would we want to take apart \nsomething that works? There is such an urgency in this Congress to move \ntoward policies that benefit those who are the most affluent. It is \nalways a rush to do that. What about an urgency to support the kind of \nprogram that makes life better for those who have reached their \nretirement years? What about an urgency to support, strengthen, and \npreserve the Social Security system? That represents an important part \nof our value system in the Congress.\n  I know we debate a lot of issues here; some are big, some are little. \nSome treat the serious too lightly; some treat the light too seriously. \nSome people think we are just a bunch of windbags in blue suits. I \nunderstand that. But there are occasions in which we sink our teeth \ninto something important and have a debate that matters. This is a \ndebate that really does matter.\n  If President Bush is able to convince this Congress to begin taking \napart the basic retirement insurance program that has lifted so many \ntens of millions of Americans out of poverty in their retirement years, \nI think this country will have lost ground, not gained ground.\n  I am not suggesting there are no changes that can be made from time \nto time. Most people do not realize that in Social Security, a change \nis being made now. In 1983, when there was a reform package dealing \nwith Social Security, it was decided that people are living longer and \nbetter lives. Because of that, the age of retirement had to be \nincreased. So it was--two months a year going from age 65 to age 67 \nretirement. That is happening. We are on the road, from now until \nanother 20 years from now or so, to take the retirement age to 67. The \nCongress supported that. The President--Ronald Reagan at the time--\nsupported that. That is underway. Adjustments have been made and will \nbe made. But again, that doesn't justify someone claiming that there is \nbankruptcy pending in the Social Security program and that we ought to \nbegin taking it apart.\n  I have told my colleagues previously about my uncle. I will do it \nagain briefly. It describes what is happening in our country. My uncle \nand aunt went to something called the Prairie Rose Games; I think it \nwas probably 12 years ago. The Prairie Rose Games are the games in our \nState, like in many States, that give people of different age brackets \nan opportunity to engage in different sports. My uncle and aunt, I \nbelieve, were 72 at the time. They bowl. As they looked at what was \ngoing on, they saw mixed bowling. They thought, that is something we \ncan do, so they entered bowling. They had driven down to the Prairie \nRose Games in their small RV and pulled up in the campsite and looked \nat this and said: We are going to bowl.\n  My uncle, age 72, saw that they had foot races for people 70 and \nabove and for all different age brackets. That was his age bracket. He \nentered three races. He had never run a race in his life. At age 72, he \nentered the 400, the 800 and the 3K. He won all three of them. He won \nall three easily at age 72. He thought to himself, this is really quite \nextraordinary. I appear to be faster than people my age. So he started \nrunning. He went to Minnesota and ran in the Minnesota games, and he \nwent to South Dakota and ran in the South Dakota games. Then he went to \nArizona and ran there. He also went to California.\n  My aunt thought he had a stroke. She thought it was the dumbest thing \nshe had ever seen--this old man going all over the country engaging in \nraces. My uncle has 43 Gold Medals. He discovered he could run faster \nthan anybody his age. He just had a bout of illness, but up until about \na year ago, he was still running at age 81.\n  That would not have happened 20 years ago or 40 years ago. Now people \nare living longer, healthier, more active lives, and good for them.\n  So all of these issues, to the extent there might be a strain on \nSocial Security, not bankruptcy, but a strain on Social Security--this \nis born of success. People are living longer. It is not rocket science \nto fix these things. Small adjustments can be made if they are needed \nto be made. But given what is happening with our elderly in this \ncountry living longer, needing to rely more on Social Security--no one \nshould decide now is the moment to turn our back on them. That does not \nmake any sense. Or to decide a program that has enriched the lives of \nso many tens of millions of Americans somehow ought to be taken apart. \nWhy? For philosophical reasons.\n  One of the leading conservative voices of the far right said Social \nSecurity is the soft underbelly of the welfare state. That tells you a \nlittle something of what is going on, doesn't it? It is not a worthy \nprogram; it is some sort of welfare. It is not, of course. People pay \nfor their Social Security insurance. They paid for it every month they \nworked out of their paychecks. And when they reach retirement age, they \ndo not know a lot of things, but they know this: That this country, as \ngood as it is, as big as it is, as wealthy as it is, as generous as it \nis, and as consistent as it is in values will continue to maintain a \nSocial Security program that people paid for so that it is there.\n  It is certain to be there. It is not the risk part of retirement. It \nis the guaranteed part of retirement because people paid for it.\n  We have also said, in addition to Social Security, we want everyone \nto save more for retirement. So we have 401(k) plans, IRAs, and we say \nyou get tax incentives for this and that. I support all of that. In \nfact, I believe we ought to have a two-step program instead of the \nPresident's plan as he outlined it last night.\n  The first step is to preserve and strengthen the Social Security \nprogram as it now exists for the long term, and we can do that without \nbreaking a sweat. The most important thing is to preserve, protect, and \nstrengthen Social Security. Don't take it apart. Preserve it and commit \nour country to do that.\n  Second, provide dramatic new incentives for retirement savings \nprograms, IRAs, 401(k)s, and all the other programs we have to try to \nconvince people to save more and invest more. I support that. That \nmakes sense. But we ought not mix the two and decide to take apart \nSocial Security and borrow $1 trillion to $3 trillion, stick it in the \nstock market, and cut Social Security benefits. That is a giant step in \nthe wrong direction. We can do better than that. This Congress can do \nbetter than that, and the American people deserve better than that.\n  As I said before, this is about values and priorities. For example, \nyou can fix whatever adjustments are necessary in Social Security by \ndeciding that the tax cuts given to those whose incomes are half a \nmillion dollars a year or more need not continue.\n  Here is the choice: Tax cuts for people with half a million dollars a \nyear in income or more, or make Social Security whole for 75 years and \nlonger. That is the choice. That is just one of a dozen choices. It is \nan easy choice. It is a values question. What really is our set of \npriorities with respect to our commitment to America's elderly? What \nkind of country do we want to have? What do we think enhances and \npromotes value in this country?\n  Finally, as I have told my colleagues many times, I grew up in a town \nof 300 people. It is a town that had its own programs without \nGovernment, people taking care of people. It would be nice if that were \nthe case all across the country, but we know that is not the case. So \nwe put together certain efforts to incentivize people to take care of \nthemselves, to invest for the future, to save for the future.\n\n  One part of that is Social Security. From 1935 until the year 2005, \nwe can be proud of what this important Social Security program has done \nfor our country. We ought to, in the spirit of Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt and in the\n\n[[Page S964]]\n\nspirit of tens of millions of lives that have been enriched and pulled \nout of poverty because of this program, be dedicating ourselves to \npreserving and strengthening Social Security, not taking it apart, not \nborrowing money, not sticking Social Security money in the stock \nmarket, and not continuing to spend Social Security trust fund revenue \non something for which it was not intended. But instead we should be \nputting our shoulder to the wheel and doing the right thing for this \ncountry.\n  We will have a great debate about this. A lot will be said about it. \nI do not attempt to tarnish anyone else who feels differently. I have \nrespect for the President. We have a disagreement. I will not denigrate \nthose who have a different feeling or who oppose my position, but I \nmust say I feel very strongly about this issue because I think it is \npart of the core value system of this country.\n  This is a great, big, strong, wonderful, generous country, and doing \nthe right thing is not very hard for this Congress in this \ncircumstance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S964-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TAX BREAK FOR COMPANIES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will take just another minute. I \nunderstand none of my colleagues wish to speak. I was speaking without \nnotes, so I did not mention something I intended to mention. Most \nAmericans do not know that at the moment there is a flurry of activity \ngoing on that also relates to values.\n  This Congress, last year, passed legislation that contained a \nprovision that is just Byzantine. It provides a tax break to companies \nthat have, in many cases, moved their U.S. jobs overseas, earned income \noverseas, kept the income over there, and, under what is called a \ndeferral, are not having to pay taxes on it in this country.\n  We have a tax break for companies that shut down their American \nplant, move their plant overseas, earn income overseas, do not bring \nthe income back, and they get what is called a deferral. They do not \npay taxes.\n  At some point, however, when they want to bring their income back to \nthis country, they have to pay income taxes just as Americans do, and \nthe companies that stayed here do, and the people who work for those \ncompanies do. Except last year, this Congress decided to give a big \nbreak to those who would repatriate their income from overseas profits.\n  There is some $600 billion in income earned overseas that has not \nbeen repatriated and on which income taxes have not been paid. So guess \nwhat. This Congress said to all those big companies that made all this \nincome overseas, some of which was made by shutting down their American \nplant and moving the jobs overseas: If you bring that money back, we \nwill give you a deal. You get to pay income tax at the rate of 5.25 \npercent--5.25.\n  Do you know of anybody else working in this country who gets to pay a \n5.25-percent income tax. How about the people working at the 7-Eleven \nat the counter, a person who is changing oil in a car, a person who is \nworking on a road crew, do you think any of those people are paying \n5.25-percent income tax on their earnings? No, they are not. The lowest \nbracket in the income system in this country is 10 percent, and it goes \nup to 35 percent. But now we have a new low bracket, and it is a \nspecial bracket. For those who earned income overseas and now \nrepatriate the income to this country, some of which came as a result \nof moving American jobs overseas, they get to pay income taxes at 5.25 \npercent.\n  It reminded me of that great old song by Tom Paxton, ``I Am Changing \nMy Name to Chrysler.'' This country gave a big loan to Chrysler many \nyears ago when Mr. Iacocca was with Chrysler. It was very \ncontroversial. Tom Paxton wrote a song. He says:\n\n       Oh the price of gold is rising out of sight\n       And the dollar is in sorry shape tonight.\n       What a dollar used to get us\n       Now won't get a head of lettuce\n       No the economic forecast is not bright.\n\n  Then he goes on to talk about who gets the benefits and who pays the \nbills. At some point, I will read the entire lyrics to this song.\n  It is a little like my colleague from Texas who knows about Bob Wills \nand his Texas Playboys, a lyric from a song of the 1930s that goes: The \nlittle bee sucks the blossom but the big bee gets the honey. The little \nguy picks the cotton and the big guy gets the money.\n  Guess what. There is a lot of that spirit in the breasts of those who \nserve in this Congress who believe we ought to offer a 5.25-percent \nincome tax rate to just a special group of people, those who have some \n$600 billion parked overseas.\n  What about a 5.25-percent income tax rate for all Americans? Or what \nabout charging those who repatriate that income the regular income tax \nrate and put that money into the Social Security system? Once again, it \nis a question of priorities and values and this Congress came up short \non this issue.\n  Very few people know that at the moment there are lawyers, \naccountants, and business executives scurrying around trying to figure \nout how they are going to take advantage of a special income tax rate \nthat only they get, and the folks who work hard in this country and \ntake a shower at night because they worked in tough conditions all day, \nthey get to pay 10, 15, 25 or 30 percent income taxes. Maybe, as Tom \nPaxton said in ``I Am Changing My Name to Chrysler,'' we need to change \nour name so we get some of that 5.25-percent income tax rate. Maybe \nordinary Americans ought to get some of that. Again, it is about values \nand about priorities.\n  I am going to talk more about this subject because the American \npeople need to understand what this Congress did. It is about cotton \nand honey and big guys and big bees, and I will talk more about it in \nthe future. I was thinking about it while I was talking about Social \nSecurity and priorities and values. It is something the American people \nought to understand. There is a special deal out there and it is not \nfor them, regrettably, because this Congress decided they are not \nworthy. It is just the big interests that are worthy of the 5.25-\npercent income tax rate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S964-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S964-S965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HONORING THE 94TH ANNIVERSARY OF PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN'S BIRTH\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an American success \nstory. It is one that ended, at least his life on Earth, in June of \nlast year. It is to the story of a man who rose from humble beginnings \nand surroundings to become a leader. In fact, he became one of, if not \nthe greatest leaders, in the 20th century, and I am talking about \nPresident Ronald Reagan.\n  This coming Sunday, February 6, would have been President Reagan's \n94th birthday. I hope this weekend, when so many people in America will \nbe watching the Super Bowl and all the festivities surrounding it, they \nwill take a moment to remember not only Ronald Reagan's birth but to \nreflect on the positive impacts his life has had on so many people in \nAmerica and around the world.\n  He was a man who stood strong for enduring foundational principles in \nthe face of conflict and adversity at home and who faced down the \nCommunist menace abroad. Through it all, he never lost touch with the \ndecency and the morality of America that we aspire for in our leaders \nand indeed all of our citizens.\n  A few weeks ago, I took what I called a Ronald Reagan pilgrimage with \nmy wife Susan and our three young kids to southern California. We went \nto the gravesite of the Reagan Presidential Library. There is also a \nmuseum, which is wonderful, and tells his whole life story.\n  We also trekked up through all the rains and floods and fog, up to \nRancho del Cielo, the Reagan ranch. There, at that ranch, you see the \ncore of Ronald Reagan, the substance of him. He spent 1 out of 8 days \nas President up at this ranch, which is 600 acres. It is a very humble \nplace--small, as far as the housing. It had a small shower. He must \nhave been elbowing that shower all the time, trying to take a shower \nthere. That is where he rode his horses, cut wood, trimmed trees. You \ncould see\n\n[[Page S965]]\n\nthis is how Ronald Reagan kept his common sense. This is where you see \nthe essence of the man, why he was so well grounded so that he could \nsomehow see the future and keep the inspiration and appreciation of the \ngrandeur of God's creation with the beauty of the trees and the rocks \nand mountains and the animals, but also recognizing what is great about \nthis country, and the hard work and the personal strength it takes to \ndo various things.\n  Ronald Reagan was a modern-day hero who embodied all that was great \nabout George Washington and the spirits enunciated by Thomas Jefferson. \nHis perseverance, his strength, his commitment to principle are lessons \nthat taught me and taught many others. He was the person who inspired \nme and many others to get involved in organized politics and into \npublic service. Today, thanks to Ronald Reagan, as I saw Ambassadors on \nthe House floor from Lithuania, from Romania, throughout Central \nEurope--those were hundreds of millions of people who were behind the \nIron Curtain. But, thanks to Ronald Reagan's perseverance, for his \nbelief in the dignity of all human beings, that all people do yearn to \nbe free, to exercise their God-given rights, those people who were \nbehind that Iron Curtain, who were enemies, are now tasting that sweet \nnectar of liberty. They are our friends. They are our allies in this \nwar on terror. Their numbers are growing, with greater hope and \nprosperity. Ronald Reagan helped make sure this century is the century \nof liberty.\n  While President Reagan's life here on Earth is over, his legacy \ncontinues to endure, motivate, and inspire me and others here in \nAmerica and around the world. I hope on this weekend we will think of \nNancy Reagan, say a prayer for her, remember and also thank God for one \nof the greatest blessings He has provided to us and that is the birth \nof Ronald Wilson Reagan.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see my wonderful partner and \ncolleague from Virginia, Senator Warner, has joined us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague for his thoughts \nabout Ronald Reagan. With a great sense of humility and modesty, I \nrecount one story of an experience I had with him. He loved our State \nof Virginia, by the way. So often on the weekends he would come down \ninto the vicinity of where I, in those days, had a farm. He would call \nup and say: Hey, let's go riding.\n  He was the President of the United States. I said: Fine, Mr. \nPresident, where and when?\n  He said: Right there, on your place, just set it up.\n  Just as you said, Senator Allen, he loved the outdoors. But I \nremember one day we brought the horses in and were getting them ready--\nI had a wonderful man who used to be working for me, and my man was \nputting the saddle on my horse and cinching him up. Along came the \nPresident's horse. I said to my man: Let's go over there and help the \nPresident put his saddle on the horse. We walked over there and the \nPresident said: I do my own saddle. No one touches my tack. I am going \nto do it.\n  He grabbed that big old western saddle he had, put it on the horse, \ncinched him down, and then he went over to help Nancy put her gear on, \nand off we rode, across the hills of Virginia. Eventually, we stopped \nup on a hill. It was a hot day in August and the flies were bothering \nthe horses, and the Secret Service guys were having a dickens of a time \nstaying on the horses.\n  He checked the horse and looked down in the valley. Senator Allen, he \nrecounted to me with great specificity every step of the valley \ncampaign. How the northerners marched down the valley and then the \nsouthern troops, Confederates, would drive them back up, and Stonewall \nJackson, and on and on.\n  Frankly, as much time as I have spent in that valley--I went to \nschool at Washington & Lee University--I learned facts from our \nPresident at that time about the history of Virginia.\n  He loved America. He loved the outdoors. He loved his history and he \nloved his people. You captured him beautifully in your remarks. I \ncongratulate you, my friend.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank my colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S965-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S965-S966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE IRAQI ELECTIONS AND U.S. POLICY IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak of the historic Iraqi \nelections and the President's message last night.\n  This past Sunday, the world watched as millions of Iraqi people \nheaded to the polls to participate in their first free election in more \nthan 50 years.\n  In doing so, the Iraqis defied the terrorists and they risked their \nlives for what was, for most, the first exercise of democracy in their \nlifetimes.\n  Not only did the Iraqi people defy the terrorists, but they defied \nthe skeptics--some of whom could be found in Iraq itself, many others \nthroughout the international community, and, disappointingly, even here \nat home. Many said that the elections were too soon, that the Iraqi \npeople wouldn't dare come out of their homes to vote, and worse, that \nthe Iraqi people weren't ready and didn't desire freedom.\n  Though the votes have yet to be tallied, the millions of Iraqi voters \nthat turned out on Sunday underscore the truism that people desire to \nbe free.\n  And one of the most fundamental political freedoms is the freedom to \nchoose your government. What we saw on Sunday should not surprise \nAmericans: When given the opportunity to be in charge of their own \ndestiny, citizens of all nations will not only turn out in great \nnumbers, but they are willing to sacrifice their own lives for the \nopportunity to live in a free society.\n  I agree with one of America's most perceptive analysts on the region, \nFouad Ajami, who said that on Sunday we bonded with the Iraqi people, \nbecause they were doing the most American act: voting.\n  As a strong supporter of our President and his policy in Iraq, I am \nalways encouraged by my fellow Utahns who believe America should stay \nthe course, fight on, and finish what we started. Utahns appreciate the \nsacrifice and courage of our troops, and those of the Iraqis who deeply \nappreciate our commitment.\n  Earlier this week, I read that the mayor of Baghdad even wants to \nerect a statue to President Bush, calling him the ``symbol of \nfreedom.'' When asked if he was concerned about the many threats on his \nlife, Mayor Ali Fadel said, ``My life is cheap, everything is cheap for \nmy country.''\n  He also said, ``We have a lot of work and we are especially grateful \nto the soldiers of the USA for freeing our country of tyranny.''\n  We saw this gratitude again last night when the daughter of a man \nkilled by Saddam Hussein's thugs was hugged by the mother of a Marine \nwho gave his life in Fallujah.\n  Some may erroneously dismiss that as crafted drama. For me, that \nmoment in the State of the Union will forever capture America's mission \nof spreading freedom in this world.\n  I have tears in my eyes because I remember many years ago receiving \nnotice that my brother had been killed in the Second World War fighting \nfor the freedom that Sergeant Norwood fought for over in Iraq--fighting \nfor the freedoms for Europe and the world.\n  Many of our soldiers risking their lives in Iraq are my fellow \nUtahans. I am both proud and impressed with their willingness to serve \ntheir country and help the Iraqi people establish a free and democratic \ngovernment.\n  Just yesterday, a group of 100 Utah National Guard men and women, in \naddition to the 500 that left just a week before, were deployed to \nbases in the U.S. for training, after which they will move to Iraq, \nwhere they will continue to serve for 1 year.\n  We have had Utahans over there serving beyond the term they were \nsupposed to serve.\n  We have had Utahans over there serving beyond the term they were \nsupposed to serve. I know they will serve well and, I pray for their \nsafe return home to their loved ones and families.\n  We all understand that this election was just one more step on the \npath to a free and democratic Iraq. But, it was an enormously important \nstep.\n  I commend our President, our brave men and women in uniform, and \nespecially, the freedom-loving people of Iraq.\n  President Bush began his speech last night recognizing that he serves \nat the privilege of the voters, and that, today,\n\n[[Page S966]]\n\nan Iraqi government is forming based on the voters' selections, as a \nnew government is in place in the Palestinian Authority, and in \nAfghanistan.\n  One of the President's greatest virtues, in my opinion, is his \nhumility, and the recognition that we serve at the voters' behest is \nthe fundamental virtue of leadership in a democracy.\n  To recognize that humility is to accept the responsibility that \ndemocratic leadership must always be open and transparent and \ncompelling to the electorate.\n  Over the past 4 years, President Bush has often spoken directly and \nhonestly to the American people, about the uncertain threats before us, \nand about the responsibilities we need to shoulder to defend our \nfreedoms.\n  At the beginning of my remarks I said that one of the most \nfundamental political freedoms is the freedom to choose your \ngovernment.\n  An even more basic political freedom is the freedom from tyranny or \nterror.\n  To be secure from the carbombers, from the dreaded knock on the door \nin the middle of the night, from the capricious order of the dictator, \nare necessary for freedom to be sustained.\n  Last night the President again stated his vision of how our security \nis dependent on expanding the zone of freedom to regions of the world \nwhere for too long threats to our security incubated.\n  Iraq will never be fully free until the Iraqi people can provide for \ntheir own security, and the President made it plainly clear again last \nnight that our mission will not be finished until we have trained an \neffective Iraqi force to assume their security. To leave before then, \nor to announce a departure before we know we have achieved this goal, \nis to undermine our mission and devalue our sacrifices.\n  Those who call for an exit date before knowing we have succeeded care \nnot for our success nor our security.\n  We know there remains much work to be done. No one called for an exit \ndate before we had victory in World War II, a war where America made \nenormous sacrifices, including my only brother.\n  No one called for an exit strategy during the twilight years of the \nCold War.\n  No one, after the collapse of the Soviet Empire, set an exit date for \nour efforts to support democratic transition in central and eastern \nEurope. We build our policies on victory, magnanimity, democracy and \nfreedom\n  While we will not set an exit date, we do have an exit strategy; that \nis, once we have trained enough security people and police people to \ntake over and to protect and care for their own country, once we have \nhelped to bring up their structure, witnessing that there is a degree \nof security, peace, and freedom in Iraq beyond where it is now, we are \ngoing to pull our young men and women out of there. Let us hope that \nhappens sooner rather than later.\n  Listening to President Bush's speech last night, I know he \nunderstands how to protect America's security. Even more, he \nunderstands America's role in a challenging world. President Bush has \ncharted a course as bold as he is, and it is incumbent upon the \nCongress and the American people to support him in this most important \neffort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S966-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BLACK DAY IN CAMBODIA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today was yet another black day in \nCambodia's history and for freedom. However, given the nature of the \ncurrent regime nobody should be surprised by this latest assault on \nliberty.\n  Behind closed doors, the country's rubber-stamp National Assembly \nexecuted the devious plan of FUNCINPEC Party head Norodom Ranariddh and \nCPP hardline Prime Minister Hun Sen to undermine the democratic \nopposition led by Sam Rainsy.\n  In a series of secret votes, Rainsy and SRP parliamentarians Chea \nPoch and Cheam Channy were stripped of their parliamentary immunity. \nThe three now face trumped up charges that place their fates in the \nhands of a corrupt government that is infamous for its human rights \nabuses and injustices against the Cambodian people.\n  This is outrageous and unacceptable.\n  It should now be clear to everyone that Norodom Ranariddh has cast \nhis lot with CPP hardliners. This is a slight against all FUNCINPEC \nmembers who continue to support democracy and justice in Cambodia, and \na grave dishonor to those who have given their lives in the struggle \nfor freedom.\n  The State Department has been following the situation closely, and I \ncommend the efforts of Ambassador Charles Ray and his staff for \npromoting reason and the rule of law during this latest charade. I \nencourage the State Department to respond in a forceful and appropriate \nmanner, including compiling a list of those individuals who voted to \nstrip the immunity of SRP members. They and their family members should \nbe prohibited from entering the United States. Such action is \nconsistent with the President's Proclamation of January 12, 2004.\n  I encourage other donors to publicly condemn the actions of the \nNational Assembly, and to consider sanctions against the Cambodian \ngovernment. Any activities with the National Assembly should be \nimmediately and indefinitely suspended.\n  Donors should know by now that there is no progress or development in \nCambodia without democracy--and what little democracy existed prior to \nthe votes has been stripped away. An opportunity exists for the tough \ntalk of donors during the last consultative group meeting to be \nfollowed by concrete actions. They must not miss it.\n  I strongly advise all international financial institutions--\nparticularly the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank--to add \ntheir voice to their chorus of concern and to consider a suspension of \noperations in Cambodia until the corrupt leaders get the message that \ntyranny will not be tolerated.\n  Those who have pledged resources for the Khmer Rouge tribunal may now \nwant to reconsider--the actions of the National Assembly underscore \nthat there is no justice in Cambodia today. It is ludicrous to believe \nthat the country's legal system, even with outside participation, will \nfunction in a professional and independent manner. Let me be clear that \njustice is unquestionably needed for the millions of victims of the \nKhmer Rouge genocide in the 1970s, but justice is also needed for more \nrecent crimes in Cambodia, including the 1997 grenade attack against \nSam Rainsy and his supporters and the murders of Om Radsady and Chea \nVichea.\n  Finally, I encourage King Norodom Sihamoni to find his voice during \nthis political crisis. The world awaits an indication of the character \nand priorities of the new monarch.\n  Hun Sen and Ranariddh underestimate the resolve of the United States, \nas articulated by President Bush in his inaugural address and again \nlast night, to stand by those championing freedom and liberty. Today, \nwe stand with Sam Rainsy, Chea Poch and Cheam Channy and add our voices \nto their demands for democracy and justice. I hold Hun Sen and \nRanariddh responsible for the security and the safety of these \nindividuals--now and in the future.\n  As Chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I would remind \nCambodian officials that my staff and I will be putting together the \nfiscal year 2006 foreign aid bill over the coming weeks and months. Hun \nSen and Ranariddh should know that Washington--and the world--are \nwatching.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S966-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S966-S967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DEATH OF GEORGIAN PRIME MINISTER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a world \ntraveler who always comes home to his beloved Hazard, KY, Vernon \nCooper, Jr.\n  Mr. Cooper has fought in Asia in World War II, skinned seals with \nEskimos in the Arctic, and climbed mountains in the Andes. But after \nall those vast experiences, his Perry County home in eastern Kentucky \nholds a prime place in his heart, and he expresses this through great \ngenerosity.\n  Mr. Cooper, 81 and the former president of Hazard's People's Bank and \nTrust Co., is happy to give back to his community. A year ago, he \nlearned that the sheriff of Perry County planned to lay off all of his \ndeputies at Christmastime because of a strained budget. Mr. Cooper \ndonated $20,000 to the county to keep the deputies in uniform over the \nholidays.\n  A 1941 graduate of Hazard High School, Mr. Cooper donated $120,000 to \ninstall lights on the school's baseball fields. Parents are thrilled \nthey can now watch their children's night games. And if they ever want \nto thank their patron, they don't have far to look--Mr. Cooper still \nattends games, wearing his Hazard High School jersey with the name \n``Bruiser''--his World War II nickname across the back.\n  Mr. Cooper has also filled in as a guest host at WLJC, a Beattyville, \nKY, Christian radio station. When he learned of their hopes to reach a \nlarger audience, he donated $50,000 for a new transmitter. Now three \ntimes as many homes as before receive WLJC's signal.\n  Perhaps Mr. Cooper's largest gift of all was the gift of life. He \ndonated over $200,000 to the Appalachian Regional Healthcare Regional \nMedical Center in Hazard to build an open-heart surgery unit.\n  Before Mr. Cooper's gift, Hazard-area residents had to travel over 60 \nmiles for an open-heart procedure. The new unit admitted its first \npatient this month, and its director hopes to perform around 100 open-\nheart surgeries this year.\n  Kentucky's greatest resource has always been its compassionate, \nfriendly people. To any who doubt this, I direct them to look at Vernon \nCooper, Jr., as a model for all of us to follow. I ask the Senate to \njoin me in recognizing a man who generously wants to give as much back \nto Kentucky as it has given to him.\n  Mr. President, recently the Courier-Journal published a story about \nMr. Cooper, ``Hazard Man, 81, shares his millions with others.'' I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be included in the \nCongressional Record.\n\nThere being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the \n                          Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Courier-Journal, Jan. 22, 2005]\n\n  Hazard Man, 81, Shares his Millions With Others; Deputies, Schools, \n                           Hospital Get Gifts\n\n                            (By Alan Maimon)\n\n       Hazard, KY--When Vernon Cooper Jr. takes interest in a \n     cause, he lets his checkbook do the talking.\n       Because of Cooper's largess, eight Perry County sheriff's \n     deputies kept their jobs during Christmas 2003, a Beattyville \n     television station tripled its potential viewership, and \n     school baseball and softball teams in Hazard now play under \n     the lights.\n       His latest gift--of more than $200,000--helped build an \n     open-heart surgery unit at a Hazard hospital.\n       Cooper, who is 81 and former president of People's Bank and \n     Trust Co. in Hazard, said he is a multimillionaire who has \n     made a hobby out of giving back to his community.\n       ``I've been around the world, but this is the most special \n     place in the world to me,'' Cooper said at his mountaintop \n     home.\n       ``Hazard is my home, and where's there a need I like to \n     help.''\n       Just over a year ago, Perry County Sheriff Pat Wooton was \n     facing a blue Christmas as he prepared to lay off all his \n     deputies because of a tight budget.\n       Cooper heard about the situation and pledged $20,000 to \n     Perry Fiscal Court to keep the officers on the job until \n     officials could allocate more money to the department.\n       ``He's a very civic-minded individual and has been for a \n     long time,'' Wooton said. ``He has made significant \n     contributions to so many areas in Perry County.''\n       Cooper said he has given hundreds of such gifts over the \n     years.\n\n\n                             Bruiser's gift\n\n       A deep-rooted sense of school spirit led him to make the \n     largest contribution in the 92-year history of the Hazard \n     Independent School District.\n       Cooper, a 1941 graduate of Hazard High School and a former \n     school board member, wrote a $120,000 check in 2003 for the \n     installation of lights at the high school's baseball and \n     softball fields.\n       District Superintendent James Francis said the lights have \n     helped Hazard attract regional tournaments and allowed \n     working parents to see more of their children's games.\n       ``No one has been more instrumental in the progress the \n     school district has made,'' Francis said.\n       Cooper still prowls the sidelines of Hazard football games \n     wearing a jersey with ``Bruiser''--his World War II \n     nickname--across the back.\n\n\n                              UK donation\n\n       In 1999, Cooper's generosity had unintended consequences \n     when he mailed a $500 check to the University of Kentucky to \n     help pay for a summer football camp.\n       An internal investigation of the football program showed \n     the check was endorsed by former UK football recruiting \n     coordinator Claude Bassett and sent to a high school football \n     coach in Memphis, Tenn.\n       University officials said any gifts to UK should pass \n     through its Office of Development and be deposited in \n     university accounts. Cooper was not accused of any \n     wrongdoing.\n       Bassett was fired, but Cooper did not let the incident \n     dampen his generous spirit.\n       ``I learned a lesson that not everybody can be trusted, but \n     most people can,'' he said.\n       The incident also reaffirmed for Cooper the importance of \n     getting receipts for his donations.\n       ``That's all I ask for in return,'' he said. ``I need a \n     receipt, so I won't have problems with the government.''\n       Cooper, a 1949 UK graduate, said he now opts to build \n     strong relationships with organizations before parting with \n     his money.\n       Cooper recently gave $50,000 to WLJC, a television and \n     radio station in Beattyville whose call letters stand for \n     Wonderful Lord Jesus Christ.\n       Jonathan Drake, manager of WLJC, said the money helped buy \n     a transmitter that nearly tripled the number of homes the \n     station reaches.\n       ``He is a man with a very large heart,'' Drake said. ``He \n     got to know us, was a guest host for us and then really \n     helped out.''\n\n\n                             Hospital gift\n\n       One of Cooper's largest gifts to date arrived in several \n     installments to the Appalachian Regional Healthcare Regional \n     Medical Center in Hazard.\n       Charles Housley, the hospital chain's executive director of \n     development, said the gift went toward building an open-heart \n     surgery unit in an area that has lacked such a facility. \n     Cooper said the amount was $200,000, but Housley said it was \n     more, declining to be specific.\n       Ashland, Pikeville, and London--each more than 60 miles \n     from Hazard--had been the only Eastern Kentucky towns to \n     offer the open-heart procedure.\n       ``We hope to give him some recognition for that,'' Housley \n     said.\n       The Hazard hospital admitted its first open-heart patient \n     earlier this month and expects to perform around 100 \n     surgeries this year, Housley said.\n\n\n                              What's next?\n\n       Cooper said his fondness for philanthropy stems from a love \n     of the mountains of Eastern Kentucky, something he first \n     recognized during a four-day train trip to a California naval \n     base in 1943.\n       When the then 22-year-old sailor returned from World War II \n     service in Asia, he dreamed of seeing the world but vowed \n     always to return to the Appalachian communities he held dear.\n       A blind date in 1945 led to marriage. Cooper said he and \n     his wife separated about 25 years ago but remain married. His \n     wife could not be reached for comment.\n       In his home, Cooper has pictures of himself climbing some \n     of the world's largest mountains. He said he has skinned \n     seals with Eskimos, and he has a jacket identifying him as an \n     honorary colonel in the Argentine army.\n       But during his travels from the Arctic to the Andes and the \n     Alps, he said he has always had Kentucky on his mind.\n       Standing beneath the observatory above his home on a recent \n     afternoon, Cooper contemplated his next act of good will.\n       ``I have some things in mind,'' he said. ``There are a lot \n     of worthwhile places out there.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S967-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S967-S968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WORDS OF WISDOM\n\n  Mr. REID. Our friend and colleague, Senator Ernest Hollings of South \nCarolina, left us last year to enjoy a well-earned retirement. However, \nhe still has a few words of wisdom, and just a little vitriol, that he \nwould like to share.\n  Senator Hollings was one of the most fascinating speakers ever to \ntake the Senate floor. His comments were sometimes controversial, but \nalways thought-provoking and delivered in a way only Fritz Hollings \ncould orate. We miss him.\n\n[[Page S968]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the statement of Senator Hollings be \nprinted in the Congressional Record. I may not agree with all his \nstatements, but as usual I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I hope all \nAmericans will enjoy it as well.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           State of the Union\n\n  On leaving the Senate after 38 years, I am constantly asked ``what is \nyour legacy?'' Answer--a mess! While the country is going broke and \njobs are hemorrhaging, G.I's are getting killed in an unwinnable war, \nand nobody cares. At least there is no sacrifice. In Washington \nRepublicans and Democrats are in a Mexican standoff. Amid shouts that \nSocial Security is ``flat broke'', the nation's security is being \nundermined.\n  Our security rests as on a three legged stool. The first leg--\nvalues--has always been the strongest. The United States has always \nbeen admired for its sacrifice for human rights and freedom. But our \ninvasion of Iraq has created a training ground for terrorists and given \nIslamic television Al Jazeera a daily drumbeat of U.S. ``atrocities.'' \nThe second leg--economic--enjoyed its strongest era in the 1990's with \nlow inflation, record growth and a strong dollar. The budget was \nbalanced in 2001 with the recession lasting less than 9 months. But the \ntax cuts of the last four years caused deficits of $141.1 billion, \n$428.5 billion, $562 billion, and $593 billion. These fiscal deficits \ntogether with a trade deficit of 600 billion have the dollar in a dive. \nWith our outsourcing of jobs policy the United States is fast losing \nits productive capacity. Finally, the third leg--military--has us \nagain, as in Vietnam, losing. For the first time regulars in the Army \nare suing against extended duty and Americans are refusing to join the \nGuard and Reserves.\n  The need is to rebuild America. To get Congress to lead the \nrebuilding we must excise the cancer of money on the body politic and \nadopt a constitutional amendment: ``The Congress of the United States \nis hereby empowered to regulate and control spending in federal \nelections.'' This will immediately limit campaigns, and cut the time \nraising money. Next, limit each senator to two committees--no \nexceptions. Then cut the staffs. Now the Senators will have time to \nwork on the people's business rather than the campaign.\n  The first order of business is to get on top of health costs and \nprovide healthcare for all of America. Next, instead of tax cuts enact \na 2 percent VAT tax to pay for Iraq, Afghanistan and to eliminate the \ndeficit. This will limit our disadvantage with global trade and \nstrengthen the economy. Then resume Cordell Hull's reciprocal free \ntrade policy by: instituting a Department of Trade and Commerce \nbringing the Special Trade Representative and other trade entities \nunder one roof; abolishing the International Trade Commission \ntransferring it's duties to the International Trade Administration; \neliminating the tax benefit for jobs going offshore and giving the \nbreak to businesses producing onshore; appointing an Assistant U.S. \nAttorney General to enforce trade laws; employing the necessary customs \nagents to stop transshipments; enlarging rather than eliminating the \nAdvanced Technology Program; and reviewing our membership in the World \nTrade Organization.\n\n  Then provide the needs of air, rail and port security. Adopt an \nenergy bill, a highway bill and begin to control the immigration and \ndrug problem by adopting a Marshall plan for Mexico.\n  Finally confront the terror that confronts us. It's not the terror of \nNorthern Ireland or Spain. It's not because of who we are or our \nvalues. It's because of our Israel-Palestine policy that appears one-\nsided. We confirmed this appearance with our invasion of Iraq. \nTerrorism got organized and spread. Now our problem is we are neither \nin nor out. It's too late to get in with the necessary troops so the \nbest way to support the Iraq election is to remove ourselves as \n``occupiers.'' As former Senator George Aiken of Vermont said ``declare \nvictory and withdraw.'' Then have the Commander in Chief go to the \nfront line of terrorism and instead of proclaiming ``road maps'' on \nhigh, have him get down in the traffic for peace.\n  None of this will happen unless the media gets out of politics. Of \ncourse they make more money taking polls and exciting controversy. But \nnow the free press has abandoned its important role of maintaining a \nstrong democracy. Thomas Jefferson signaled this responsibility when he \nobserved; ``between a government without newspapers or newspapers with \nout a government'' he would chose the latter. The press used to report \nthe truth to the American people and keep the Congress honest. Instead \nthe press is downfield starting the fight instead of reporting the \nfacts. The fact is that Social Security has a surplus of $1.7 trillion \nand is in good shape until 2042. The fact is that the states readily \nregulate tort reform. The fact is that while the IRS can always stand \nsome reform we can't afford a tax cut at this time. Rather than playing \npolitics with these issues the press should be reporting the State of \nthe Union.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S968-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S968-S969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF TONY ARMSTRONG\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today, to honor the memory of a great \nNevadan, Tony Armstrong, who passed away last Saturday morning.\n  Tony was the mayor of the town of Sparks, NV, and I had the privilege \nof working with him in that capacity.\n  But I rise today not to praise Tony Armstrong the mayor, even though \nhe was a great mayor.\n  I want to praise Tony Armstrong the husband, the father, the friend, \nthe neighbor.\n  I rise to praise Tony Armstrong the man who made a positive \nimpression on everyone he met, through the force of an engaging \npersonality that reflected his basic love of people.\n  Tony spent most of his life in Sparks. He was born in Philadelphia, \nbut his family moved to northern California when he was a toddler, and \nsettled in Sparks when Tony was 4 years old.\n  Tony attended school in Sparks, and when he graduated high school he \njoined the Nevada Air National Guard. After serving on active duty for \nseveral years, he returned to Washoe County in 1973 and got a job as a \nbuilding inspector.\n  In 1983 he married Debbie Rimby, and a couple of years later he \nstarted his own contracting company, which later became a private \ninspection firm.\n  He first ran for public office in 1987, when he failed to win \nelection to the Sparks City Council. But like many of us who have lost \nelections, he learned from that experience and it strengthened his \ndeterminaton. He came back 2 years later and won a seat on the city \ncouncil. Ten years after that, in 1999, the people of Sparks elected \nhim as their mayor.\n  He was a popular mayor, guided always by his love of Sparks, his \nappreciation of the city's history, and his vision for the future.\n  Tony worked to preserve the best aspects of Sparks, the friendly \natmosphere that make it such a wonderful place to raise a family, and \nat the same time, improve the services and amenities.\n  He realized that the great quality of life in northern Nevada meant \nthat Sparks would continue to grow, and he worked to manage that growth \nso it would benefit the citizens of the city.\n  During the 14 years that he served as a city councilman and mayor, \nSparks grew from a sleepy little railroad town to a city that is home \nto about 80,000 people.\n  He oversaw the development of a project called Victorian Square, \nwhich preserves and revitalizes a historic area, and the Sparks Marina. \nI had the privilege of working with him on that marina project.\n  He was a tireless champion for his city. Sparks and Reno share a \nconvention center and airport, and Tony Armstrong was constantly \nworking to make sure Sparks wasn't overshadowed by its larger neighbor.\n  Tony also spearheaded the Sparks Centennial Commission, which is \ncelebrating the city's 100th birthday this year.\n  There is no question that the city will miss his leadership. And the \npeople of Sparks will miss Tony's warm smile and his friendly \nconversation.\n  The man who preceded him as mayor, Bruce Breslow, put it simply. ``He \nmade everyone around him feel important,'' he said of Tony.\n  Another friend, Mary Henderson, said, ``His smile was as bright as a \nnorthern Nevada sunrise.''\n\n[[Page S969]]\n\n  Mary Humphries met Tony last spring, when they both welcomed \nattendees to a Sertoma convention in Sparks. After sitting with him for \nhalf an hour, she felt as if they had been friends for years.\n  Tony's daughter has multiple sclerosis, and 2 years ago at an MS \nwalk, he struck up a conversation with Steve Mattos, a Reno man whose \nwife also has the disease. Tony told Steve that he was taking his \ndaughter to Stanford Medical Center for some experimental tests, and \nSteve asked him to pass along any information that might be helpful. \nFrom that day forward, Tony regularly sent e-mail updates to a man he \nhad met in person only that one time.\n  Another person who will never forget Tony is Tina Cline. Her husband, \nMarine LCpl Donald Cline, was killed in Iraq in 2003. At his memorial \nservice, a tearful Tony introduced himself to Tina, hugged her and gave \nher his home phone number. After Tony's death last weekend, Mrs. Cline \nposted a message on the web site of the Reno Gazette Journal. ``He has \nbeen one of the most helpful men I have ever known,'' she said.\n  Those are just some of the ways the people of Sparks will remember \nTony Armstrong. He was only 59, and his death from complications after \nsurgery was a blow to everyone who knew him.\n  Tony is survived by Debby, his wife of 21 years; his sons Richard and \nKeith; his daughter Misti Franco; four grandchildren, and three \nbrothers. Please join me in offering condolences to them on the loss of \ntheir loved one.\n  Tony Armstrong will be missed by many people in many ways, but our \nmemories of him will never be extinguished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S969-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      corporal nathan A. Schubert\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of an Iowa Marine \nwho has fallen in service to his country in Iraq. Marine Corporal \nNathan A. Schubert, of the 1st Battalion 3rd Marine Regiment, was \nkilled on January 26, 2005 when his helicopter crashed during a \nsandstorm near Ar Rutbah, Iraq. The helicopter carried Corporal \nSchubert and thirty other Marines who were part of a security mission \nto aid in the safe conduct of the national democratic elections last \nSunday. He is survived by his mother, Cheryl Winklepeck, a sister, \nElizabeth Householder, and a brother, Matt. Corporal Schubert died one \nday before his 23rd birthday.\n  A native of Cherokee, IA, Cpl. Schubert attended Washington High \nSchool and went on to continue his studies at Kirkwood Community \nCollege in the fall of 2001. Just weeks after the terrorist attacks on \nSeptember 11, Nathan Schubert enlisted in the Marines to fulfill what \nhe saw as his patriotic duty. Describing Corporal Schubert as a \nfriendly, likable, and patriotic young man, his brother noted that he \n``lived life to the fullest.''\n  I ask all of my colleagues in this body and all Americans to remember \nwith respect, admiration, and gratitude this courageous Marine who made \nthe ultimate sacrifice in the name of the principles we value most as \nAmericans: freedom, democracy, and justice. Corporal Schubert died \nhonorably while supporting and defending these values by aiding the \nbirth and development of democracy in Iraq. He is to be commended for \nhis bravery as he joins the honorable ranks of those Americans who have \ngone before him in service of their country. My prayers go out to \nNathan's family and friends and my greatest respect and appreciation go \nto Cpl Nathan A.

Mr. President, earlier this week, for the second time in \nless than 3 years, King Gyanendra of Nepal dismissed the multiparty \ngovernment and declared a state of emergency suspending fundamental \nconstitutional rights. Apparently, he will assume the duties of the \ndeposed Prime Minister and appoint a new cabinet.\n  Throughout its troubled past, Nepal has suffered from the neglect and \noften violent and corrupt misrule of many monarchs. For that reason, \nthose familiar with its history may not be completely surprised by this \nunfortunate development.\n  Yet one would have thought that in the 21st century, this type of \nthing would, by now, be a distant memory. At a time when a vicious \nMaoist insurgency is gaining ground in Nepal, it would be hard to \nconceive of a worse time for the King to repeat his past mistake.\n  There is no military solution to this conflict. Nepal is a place \nwhere, not unlike Afghanistan, a handful of extremists with rifles and \nexplosives can wreak havoc and easily disappear into the rugged \ncountryside. By terrorizing rural villagers and exploiting the \nGovernment's neglect of them, the Maoists have steadily extended their \nreach to large areas of the country.\n  The Nepalese army, while somewhat more effective than a few years ago \nwhen it performed little more than ceremonial duties, has likewise \nalienated much of the rural population by arbitrarily arresting, \ndisappearing and killing civilians suspected of sympathizing with the \nMaoists. Today, the army, rather than defending democracy, is defending \nthe King. It is clear that the King and the army concocted this \ntogether, despite having assured the UN High Commissioner for Human \nRights last week that concerns about violations of human rights would \nbe addressed.\n  This year, the United States plans to provide some $40 million in \neconomic aid to Nepal. Much of this is channeled by USAID through \nnongovernmental organizations. But we are also providing support to the \nNepalese government, as well as training and equipment to the Army. In \nfact, several months ago we approved the transfer of $1 million in \nfiscal year 2004 military equipment that had not initially been \nappropriated for Nepal.\n  The Indian government, to its credit, issued a strong statement \ncritical of the King's actions. The State Department has also called \nfor the immediate restoration of multiparty democracy. King Gyanendra \nis on notice that he will be held responsible for infringement of the \nrights of free speech and assembly, or abuses of citizens who have \ndefended human rights and democracy.\n  The State Department should also make clear that unless democratic \ngovernment and fundamental rights are promptly restored, the United \nStates will cut off aid to the government and the army under Section \n508 of the Foreign Operations Act which was designed to deter and \npunish this type of act. Regardless of whether or not the King may have \nacted within his authority under Nepal's constitution, and I do not \nknow if he did or not, that is not the issue. The intent of our law to \nsafeguard democracy is clear. The price is losing U.S. aid. \nFurthermore, if the $1 million in military equipment previously \ntransferred has not yet been delivered, it should be withheld.\n  Everyone who has followed Nepal's recent history would agree that its \n10 year ``experiment'' with democracy has not been easy. Democracy is \nnever easy, and no one should minimize the threat the Maoists pose. But \nthe answer is not to undermine democracy. The answer, as President Bush \nexpressed in his Inaugural Address, is to work, with help from the \ninternational community, to strengthen democracy. The United States \nCongress would welcome that opportunity.\n  King Gyanendra has made a tragic blunder. He still has time to \nprevent a momentary crisis from becoming a disaster for his country and \nperhaps for the monarchy itself.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S969-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S969-S970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I call the attention of my colleagues to a \nwarning from several major police organizations that a new high powered \nand easily concealable handgun, known as the Five-Seven, is easily \navailable to potential criminals and poses a significant threat to our \nNation's law enforcement officers. The International Association of \nChiefs of Police, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, and \nthe National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives issued \nthe warning late last week.\n  Belgian firearm manufacturer FN Herstal specializes in military and \nlaw enforcement weaponry but has also made its Five-Seven handgun \navailable to private buyers in the United States. The Five-Seven \nincludes a 20-round clip and is capable of firing ammunition that \npenetrates the body armor commonly worn by law enforcement officials. \nThe FN Herstal Web site boasts that with the Five-Seven handgun, \n``Enemy personnel, even wearing body armor can be effectively engaged \nup to 200 meters. Kevlar helmets and vests as well as the CRISAT \nprotection will be penetrated.''\n  These new guns clearly have no sporting purpose and no place on our \nstreets. We should not ignore the concerns of our law enforcement \nofficers with regard to these dangerous weapons.\n  The law enforcement community is most concerned about the Five-\nSeven's ability to kill police officers, even while wearing protective \nbody armor. Bernard Thompson, director of the National Organization of \nBlack Law Enforcement Executives, commented on the Five-Seven, ``No one \nis safe from a weapon like this. Police body armor won't offer \nprotection if a criminal has this pistol.''\n  The legislative director of the International Brotherhood of Police \nOfficers Steve Lenkhart called the Five-Seven ``an assault rifle that \nfits in your pocket.'' A recent memo by the Florida Department of Law \nEnforcement supports this assertion. The memo reportedly states that \nthe Five-Seven has the capabilities of a carbine or rifle but weighs \nless than 2 pounds when fully loaded. The FN Herstal Web site lists the \noverall length of the handgun as only 8.2 inches, making it small \nenough and light enough to be easily concealed by criminals.\n  Common sense should tell us that there is no reason for civilians to \nhave access to easily concealable handguns with the capability to shoot \nthrough body armor. It is important for our elected officials to listen \nto the warnings of those who put their lives on the line to help keep \nviolent criminals off of our streets. Unfortunately, the Congress also \ncontinues its failure to pass commonsense gun safety legislation that, \namong other things, would reauthorize the 1994 assault weapons ban, \nclose the gun show loophole, and regulate high-powered .50 caliber \nsniper rifles. I again urge my colleagues to work to pass sensible gun-\nsafety legislation that will help protect our law enforcement officers, \nfamilies, and communities from military style firearms like the Five-\nSeven handgun.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S970-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO PRIME MINISTER OF THE REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my condolences to the \nfamily of Mr. Zurab Zhvanai, the Prime Minister of Georgia, who died \nearly today in what appeared to have been a tragic accident. My prayers \ngo out to his wife and his three children that he leaves behind.\n  Prime Minister Zhvania was one of the leading figures that peacefully \nbrought about democratic change in Georgia following the country's \nfraudulent November 2003 elections. The prime minister, along with \nMikail Saakashvili, the current president of Georgia, spearheaded the \n``Rose Revolution'' that toppled the government of Eduard Shevardnadze \nand ushered in a new era in Georgian history, one that has set Georgia \non a pro-Western reform path.\n  Prime Minister Zhvania was a dynamic young man who became an \ninspiration to millions of Georgians, became a close personal friend of \nmany in the Bush Administration, in Congress, and in Washington, DC, \nand was viewed throughout the world as a positive force for democratic \nreform in Georgia. His energy, courage, and humility will be missed, \nand his contributions to democracy and liberty will not be forgotten.\n  The death of Prime Minister Zhvania, while tragic, does not spell the \nend of democratic reforms in Georgia. In fact, his contributions to \nGeorgian democracy will be long lasting. In the short time Prime \nMinister Zhvania was in power, he and his team began a process of \nsignificant institutional reconstruction and orientation that will one \nday, in the not-so-distant future, firmly entrench Georgia into the \nwestern institutions of the European Union and NATO.\n  Tomorrow, in Tbilisi, a large international conference will convene \nto discuss Georgia and the Caucasus region integration with the West. \nAnd, in less than two weeks, the Community of Democracies will hold a \nworkshop with representatives from more than 17 countries to discuss \nand develop action plans for further democratic and institutional \nreform in Georgia. Neither would have occurred had it not been for the \ncourage and dedication to democracy and freedom exhibited by President \nSaakashvili and his trusted advisor and ally, Zurab Zhvania, which led \nthe Rose Revolution to victory and brought hope to the Georgian people.\n  I believe that one of the finest tributes to the Prime Minister's \nmemory will be for all of us, in Georgia and in the West, to redouble \nour efforts to ensure that Zurab Zhvania's aspirations for democracy in \nGeorgia are fully realized in the critical months ahead. Let me say \nthat America will continue to work with the people of Georgia, \nPresident Saakashvili, and other Georgian leaders to ensure that their \naspiration to become fully integrated into the world's community of \nnations is met, as expeditiously and irreversibly as possible.\n  The United States mourns the loss of such an intelligent and vibrant \ndemocratic leader as was found in Prime Minister Zhvania. As President \nSaakashvili was quoted as saying earlier today, ``I have lost my \nclosest friend, my most loyal adviser, my biggest ally.'' Let me say to \nPresident Saakashyili and the Georgian people, America shares your loss \nand honors the accomplishments and memory of Prime Minister Zurab \nZhvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S970-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S970-S972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PROCEDURE--RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Failure to obtain counsel will not \n     excuse the witness from appearing and testifying.\n       (e) Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses or the \n     production of memoranda, documents, records, and other \n     materials may be issued by the Chairman with the consent of \n     the Ranking Minority Member or by the consent of a majority \n     of the Members of the Committee. Such consent may be given \n     informally, without a meeting, but must be in writing.

Mr. President, as small businesses in the State of \nWashington continue to struggle with the extraordinarily high costs of \nelectricity following the Western Energy Crisis of 2000-2001 and \nsignificant increases in the costs of other petroleum fuels, I wanted \nto make a statement in support of the Small Business and Farm Energy \nEmergency Relief Act of 2005, S. 269, introduced yesterday by the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry. This legislation establishes a \ncritically important safety net for small businesses and family farms \nthat suffer direct economic injury due to exorbitant and immediate \nincreases in energy costs, and I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor.\n  During the 107th Congress, I was proud to cosponsor the Small \nBusiness and Farm Energy Emergency Relief Act of 2001, which contained \nmany of the same provisions that are included in this legislation.\n  The Small Business and Farm Energy Emergency Relief Act of 2005 would \nprovide small businesses and farms economic relief in the form of low-\ninterest emergency loans to help mitigate the effects of significant \nspikes in the prices of heating oil, propane, natural gas, and \nkerosene. To be eligible, an applicant must be a small-business owner \nor agriculture producer, must have used all reasonably available funds \nit may have, and must be unable to obtain credit elsewhere. The U.S. \nSmall Business Administration would provide loans to small-businesses \nand farms would apply for loans through the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture.\n  As my colleagues know, small businesses and farms typically operate \non narrow margins. They depend on affordable and stable cost inputs--\nsuch as fuel--to maintain their productivity. However, the recent \nvolatility of energy prices has levied a considerable strain on the \noperating budgets of many American small businesses and family farms \nand ultimately threatened their sustainability. Without this emergency \nassistance, the viability of some Washington State small businesses and \nfarms would be compromised during times when energy prices spike. This \nemergency relief program is vital to protecting small businesses from \nthe considerable economic impact of surging energy costs and we must do \nall that is possible to help them overcome these challenges.\n  Mr. President, the Small Business and Farm Energy Emergency Relief \nAct provides critical assistance for our small businesses and farms \nthrough trying economic conditions. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to \ngive it their full support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S973-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S973-S974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         527 REFORM ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD: Mr. President, I am pleased once again to be working \nwith my partner in reform, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, on the \n527 Reform Act. And it is an honor to again have Senator Lieberman and \nSenator Schumer as original cosponsors of our bill. This year, there is \na very significant new addition to our effort, the Chairman of the \nRules Committee, Senator Lott. Senators Snowe and Collins from the \ngreat State of Maine, who were both exceptional partners in the fight \nfor campaign finance reform a few years ago, are original cosponsors as \nwell. It is also gratifying to have a new Member of the Senate, the \njunior Senator from Colorado, Mr. Salazar, on board. This is a very \nstrong bipartisan group and I look forward to working with all of them.\n  Our purpose is simple--to pass legislation that will do what the FEC \ncould and should do under current law, but, once again, has failed to \ndo. It sometimes seems like our mission in life is to clean up the mess \nthat the FEC has mad. We had to that with BCRA, the Bipartisan Campaign \nReform Act, which passed in 2002, closing the soft money loophole that \nthe FEC created in the late '70s and expanded in the '90s. We are doing \nit again with the regulations that the FEC put in place after BCRA \npassed.\n  I am pleased to announce the introduction of legislation that will \nmake absolutely clear that the Federal election laws apply to 527 \norganizations. Let me emphasize one thing--current Federal election law \nrequires these groups to register as political committees and stop \nraising and spending soft money. But the FEC has failed to enforce the \nlaw, so we must act in the Congress.\n  This bill will require all 527s to register as political committees \nunless they fall into a number of narrow exceptions. The exceptions are \nbasically for groups that Congress exempted from disclosure \nrequirements because they are so small or for groups that are involved \nexclusively in state election activity.\n  Once a group registers as a political committee, certain activities \nsuch as ads that mention only Federal candidates will have to be paid \nfor solely with hard money. But the FEC permits Federal political \ncommittees to maintain a non-federal account to pay a portion of the \nexpenses of activities that affect both Federal and non-federal \nelections. Our bill sets new allocation rules that will make sure that \nthese allocable activities are paid for with at least 50 percent hard \nmoney.\n  Finally, the bill makes an important change with respect to the non-\nfederal portion of the allocable activities. We put a limit of $25,000 \nper year on the contributions that can be accepted for that non-federal \naccount. So no more million dollar soft money contributions to pay for \nget-out-the-vote efforts in the presidential campaign.\n  Nothing in this bill will affect legitimate 501(c) advocacy groups. \nThe bill only applies to groups that claim a tax exemption under \nsection 527.\n  In closing, I want to make one final point. The soft money loophole \nwas opened by FEC rulings in the late '70s. By the time we started work \non BCRA, the problem had mushroomed and led to the scandals we saw in \nthe 1996 campaign. When we passed BCRA, I said we would have to be \nvigilant to make sure that the FEC enforced the law and that similar \nloopholes did not develop. That is what we have been doing for the past \nthree years, and what are again doing today.\n  I have no doubt that if we don't act on this 527 problem now, we will \nsee the problem explode into scandals over the next few election \ncycles. In the 2004 cycle, Federal-oriented 527s spend $423 million. \nTen donors gave at least $ million each to 527s involved in the 2004 \nFederal elections and two donors each contributed over $20 million. \nThis time we cannot afford to wait for a problem to grow into a \ndisaster that undermines the scheme of the Federal election laws.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill's \nprovisions be printed in the Record.\n\n                           The 527 Reform Act\n\n       Under the Internal Revenue Code, a 527 group is defined as \n     an organization ``organized and operated primarily'' to \n     influence elections (or the appointment of individuals to \n     non-elective office). The Federal Election Commission \n     (``FEC''), however, has failed to apply existing Federal \n     campaign finance laws to require that 527 groups spending \n     money to influence federal elections register as federal \n     political committees and comply with federal campaign finance \n     laws, including the limits on the contribution they may \n     receive.\n       As a result, both Democratic-leaning and Republican-leaning \n     527 groups spent tens of millions of dollars in soft money to \n     influence the 2004 federal elections. A number of 527 groups \n     did not register as federal political committees and spent \n     soft money on ads attacking and promoting federal candidates. \n     Other 527 groups did register as federal political committees \n     but claimed that under FEC rules they could spend as much as \n     98 percent soft money on partisan voter drive activities for \n     the purpose of influencing the 2004 federal elections.\n\n[[Page S974]]\n\n       The 527 Reform Act is designed to clarify and reaffirm that \n     such 527 groups are required to comply with federal campaign \n     finance laws. The bill would:\n       Require 527s groups to register as political committees \n     with the FEC and comply with federal campaign finance laws, \n     unless they raise and spend money exclusively in connection \n     with non-federal candidate elections, or state or local \n     ballot initiatives, or the nomination or confirmation of \n     individuals to non-elected offices, such as judicial \n     positions.\n       Under this requirement, 527 groups registered as political \n     committees and subject to federal campaign finance laws can \n     use only federal hard money contributions to finance ads that \n     promote or attack federal candidates, regardless of whether \n     the ads expressly advocate the election or defeat of the \n     candidate.\n       Any 527 group with annual receipts of less than $25,000 is \n     exempt from the requirement to register as a political \n     committee and comply with federal campaign finance laws.\n       Establish that when a 527 group registered as a federal \n     political committee makes expenditures for voter mobilization \n     activities or public communications that affect both federal \n     and non-federal elections, at least 50 percent of the costs \n     of such activities would have to be paid for with federal \n     hard money contributions.\n       Provide that with regard to the non-federal funds that can \n     be used to finance a portion of voter mobilization activities \n     and public communications that affect both federal and non-\n     federal elections, such funds must come from individuals only \n     and must be in amounts of not more than $25,000 per year per \n     individual donor.\n       This is similar to the provision in the Bipartisan Campaign \n     Reform Act of 2002 that places a limit on the size of a \n     nonfederal contribution that can be spent by state parties on \n     activities affecting both federal and non-federal elections. \n     $25,000 is the same amount that an individual can contribute \n     to a national political party. An individual can give only \n     $5,000 per year to a federal political committee to influence \n     federal elections.\n       The 527 Reform Act provides that it applies only to 527 \n     groups and that nothing in the Act will have any effect on \n     determining whether 501(c) groups are subject to federal \n     campaign finance laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S974-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PRESERVING CALIFORNIA'S MISSION HERITAGE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last week I had the pleasure of joining \nmembers of the California Missions Foundation at Mission San Diego to \ncelebrate the passage of the California Missions Preservation Act, \nwhich became law in 2004.\n  In opening the celebration, Missions Foundation Executive Director \nKnox Mellon expressed his gratitude to the Senate and House for passing \nthe Missions Preservation Act, which will help my State preserve a \npriceless element of our historical and cultural heritage.\n  By way of expressing my own gratitude to you and our colleagues, I \nwant to share some of Mr. Mellon's remarks with you:\n\n       There is a tendency for me to believe the primary \n     beneficiary of the legislation Senator Boxer both carried and \n     succeeded in getting signed by the President would be the \n     California Missions Foundation because it acts as a conduit, \n     a pass-through for directing monies to each of the twenty-one \n     historic missions. But the real beneficiaries are the people \n     not only of California but the nation. The missions are \n     California's Pyramids. They are a part of our past. They help \n     symbolize the nation's western beginnings.\n       Of all the institutions that define California's heritage, \n     none has the historic significance and emotional impact of \n     the chain of Spanish missions that stretch from San Diego to \n     Sonoma. The missions are an important part of the state's \n     cultural fabric and must be preserved as priceless historic \n     monuments.\n\n  I thank our colleagues in Congress, particularly Senator Dianne \nFeinstein and Representatives Sam Farr and David Dreier, who worked \ndiligently to see this bill signed into law. I also thank Governor \nArnold Schwarzenegger for his support.\n  And finally, I thank Knox Mellon and the California Missions \nFoundation Board for their strong dedication to this cause. Through the \ncollaboration of Federal, State, and private efforts, our missions have \nhope for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S974-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             KAREN SHAPIRA\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I would like to reflect on the \nloss of a dear family friend, Karen Shapira. Karen recently passed away \nafter a battle with breast cancer. The Shapira family has suffered a \ntremendous loss, and I offer them my condolences and deepest sympathy \nduring this difficult time.\n  Karen always called herself a ``professional volunteer'' and that is \nwhat she was. She was an extremely caring and selfless individual. For \nmore than 20 years, she served the Jewish community, both in Pittsburgh \nand abroad. Most notably, she chaired the United Jewish Federation of \nPittsburgh, which is responsible for delivering grants for educational, \ncultural, and human service programs.\n  Her deep involvement in the Jewish community led her to Israel, where \nshe met with Prime Ministers Ehud Barak and Ariel Sharon. Through her \ncapacity as chair of Partnership 2000 at the United Jewish Federation, \nKaren worked on projects with several schools, camps, women's health \ncenters, and job training facilities in Israel. She also chaired a \nrevolving loan fund of the Israel Emergency Appeal, which supports \nIsraeli small businesses.\n  Karen could also be found serving her local community in Pittsburgh. \nShe had a major leadership role at the United Way of Allegheny County, \ncochairing the Early Childhood Initiative, and she served on the boards \nof the Pittsburgh Symphony, the Jewish Healthcare Foundation in \nPittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and Shady Side \nAcademy. Karen was also appointed by Governor Ridge to the Pennsylvania \nCommission for Women.\n  It is obvious from the several awards that Karen received that her \ndedication to the Jewish community did not go unnoticed. Specifically, \nKaren received the 2002 Emanuel Specter Award and the Sonia and Aaron \nLevinson Award for the pursuit of social justice, both from the United \nJewish Federation.\n  Karen was also devoted to her family. She was married to David \nShapira for 41 years and raised three children, Laura Karet, Debbie, \nand Jeremy. Karen leaves behind a wonderful family, and a legacy of \ncommunity service and outreach. My thoughts and prayers are with the \nShapira family in the days and months ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S974-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S974-S975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  IN CELEBRATION OF SHERIFF MARK TRACY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize Santa Cruz County Sheriff Mark Tracy, who retired after 32 \nyears of dedicated service.\n  Sheriff Tracy is a Santa Cruz County native who was educated in the \ncounty's public schools. In 1972, he received his bachelor of science \ndegree in criminology from California State University at Fresno. Upon \nreceiving his degree, Sheriff Tracy immediately returned to his home in \nSanta Cruz County, where he began his law enforcement career with the \nSanta Cruz County Sheriff's Office.\n  Sheriff Tracy has held many positions within the Santa Cruz County \nSheriff's Office. As a deputy, he worked in the Patrol Division, the \nCoroner's Unit, and the Detention Bureau. He quickly rose through the \nranks, and was soon promoted to sergeant, and then to lieutenant. In \nthose positions, Sheriff Tracy managed the Street Narcotics and Gang \nunits, served as the watch commander of the county jail, and supervised \ndeputies in the Patrol Division, among other duties. Because of his \nexpertise, Sheriff Tracy also served as the coordinator of the Search \nand Rescue Team, was a founding member of the Hostage Negotiating Team, \nand was instrumental in the planning and construction of the Roundtree \nMedium Security Detention Facility. In 1994, Sheriff Tracy was \noverwhelmingly elected by the residents of Santa Cruz County to serve \nas the sheriff-coroner. In 2002, he was successfully reelected, and \nserved in the capacity of sheriff-coroner until his retirement in \nDecember 2004.\n  Among his many accomplishments, Sheriff Tracy has also served as \nchair of the Santa Cruz County Criminal Justice Council and the Santa \nCruz County Commission on Domestic Violence. He has been an active \nmember of the California State Sheriffs' Association and the California \nState Coroners' Association. Sheriff Tracy has worked tirelessly with \nlocal elected officials, schools, and community organizations to foster \na strong sense of community in Santa Cruz County. I have collaborated \nwith Sheriff Tracy in the past,\n\n[[Page S975]]\n\nand I can attest to his commitment to the community he served.\n  Sheriff Tracy's service to the State of California and dedication to \npublic safety is inspiring. I am confident that, even in retirement, \nSheriff Tracy will continue to touch lives with his good will and \ncompassion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S975-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               LOYOLA SACRED HEART SPEECH AND DEBATE TEAM\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nachievements of a remarkable group of young people from my beautiful \nstate of Montana. On January 29, 2005 the Loyola Sacred Heart High \nSchool speech and debate team won its 22nd state championship in a row \nfor Class B competition. This victory extends the longest series of \nstate championships ever in Montana.\n  Early on a crisp Saturday morning, while other kids their age were \nsleeping, students from 72 high schools from every corner of Montana \nmet in Corvallis to compete in the A-B-C State Tournament. They \ncompeted in 7 speech events--Memorized Public Address, Original \nOratory, Expository Speaking, Impromptu Speaking, Extemporaneous \nSpeaking, Serious Oral Interpretation of Literature, and Humorous Oral \nInterpretation of Literature--and 2 debate events--Policy Debate and \nLincoln-Douglas Debate.\n  This year, Loyola earned its 22nd consecutive state title by a margin \nof 80 points. Two students, Sarah Stergios and Rebecca Natelson were \nindividual State champions, and they were well supported by 13 other \nindividual medalists. Such success is not a new thing for Head Coach \nMatt Stergios, who has been with the team since 1981, when the team had \nonly four members.\n  Since that time, over one thousand students have competed for the \nteam; in fact, in 2004, one out of four students at Loyola competed at \none or more tournaments. The team has generated 31 individual state \nchampions, and over 200 medalists. Since the streak began, Loyola has \nwon over 200 individual tournament titles. The building that the \nstudents attend classes in is not large enough to hold all of the \ntrophies, so some of them have to be stored next door.\n  But Loyola Sacred Heart High School is not just known for its speech \nand debate team. While I was in the Marines I learned that it's \nimportant to hone the mind as well as the body. Well, every year, \nstudents from Loyola rank at the top of the state in test scores. \nNinety percent of students who graduate from Loyola go to college. On \nAdvanced Placement exams Loyola students score 25 percent higher than \nthe national average. Loyola boasts 13 Hearst Foundation Senate Youth \nAwards, and a Senate Page. And Loyola is as successful with feats of \nthe body as it is with feats of the mind. The boys cross country team \nhas won six straight State titles, and the girls cross country team has \nwon state titles in the last 2 years. The Loyola Fighting Ram football \nteam made state quarterfinals this year, and both the girls basketball \nand volleyball teams won their Division. The girls track team was \nsecond in the State last year after both the boys and girls teams swept \nDistrict and Divisional competition. Two years ago, the girls softball \nteam won the state title and placed fourth this year. Now all of this \nis already quite impressive.

A bill to designate certain National Forest System land in \nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as components of the National \nWilderness Preservation System; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Caribbean \nNational Forest Act of 2005 along with Senator Schumer.\n  The Caribbean National Forest Act designates approximately 10,000 \nacres of the Caribbean National Forest, CNF, as the El Toro Wilderness. \nThe El Toro Wilderness would be the only tropical forest wilderness in \nthe U.S. National Forest system.\n  The CNF has long been recognized as a special area, worthy of \nprotection. The Spanish Crown proclaimed much of the current CNF as a \nforest reserve in 1824. Just over 100 years ago, President Theodore \nRoosevelt reasserted the protection of the CNF by designating the area \nas a forest reserve.\n  Located 25 miles east of San Juan, the CNF is a biologically diverse \narea. Although it is the smallest forest in the national forest system, \nthe CNF ranks number one in the number of species of native trees with \n240. In addition, the CNF has 50 varieties of orchids and over 150 \nspecies of ferns. The area is also rich in wildlife with over 100 \nspecies of vertebrates, including the endangered Puerto Rican parrot. \nThe only native parrot in Puerto Rico, they numbered nearly one million \nat the time that Columbus set sail for the New World. Today there are \nfewer than 100 of these parrots. The Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service and Puerto Rico's Department of Natural Resources and \nthe Environment have initiated a recovery program for the Puerto Rican \nParrot. Wilderness designation will ensure that the forest home to the \nparrot will remain protected and the ongoing recovery efforts, \nconsistent with the Wilderness Act, will continue.\n  The CNF also provides valuable water to the people of Puerto Rico. \nThe CNF receives over 10 feet of rain each year. As a result, the major \nwatersheds in the CNF are able to provide water to over 800,000 \nresidents. In addition, the CNF provides a variety of recreational \nopportunities to almost one million Puerto Ricans and tourists each \nyear. Families, friends and school groups come to the forest to hike, \nbird watch, picnic, swim and enjoy the scenic vistas.\n  Wilderness designation of the El Toro will protect approximately one \nthird of the forest. During a House hearing on this measure in 2003 the \nU.S. Forest Service stated its support for the designation of the El \nToro Wilderness Area. Those views were reconfirmed last July, when Mark \nRey, the Department of Agriculture's Under Secretary for Natural \nResources and Environment, supported my legislation during his \ntestimony before the Senate Energy and National Resources Subcommittee \non Public Lands and Forests.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 272\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of \n2002 to extend and improve national dairy market loss payments; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my \nlegislation, which I introduce today, to extend the Milk Income Loss \nCompensation (MILC) program be printed in the Record.\n  I am pleased to be joined by 26 of my colleagues--over a quarter of \nthe United States Senate. This is a bipartisan piece of legislation \nthat has nation-wide support including in the Midwest, Northeast, Mid-\nAtlantic, South, and West. This is not only rare for legislative \nefforts generally but extremely rare in the world of dairy.\n  MILC is important because it provides a critical safety net for dairy \nfarmers that is equitable to all farmers across the country--also a \ndeparture from traditional federal dairy policy.\n\n[[Page S981]]\n\n  When milk prices fell to a 25 year low not long ago, MILC was vital \nin preventing a mass exodus of dairy farm families in my State. \nFortunately, prices have recovered more recently. But should prices \nfall again, my dairy farm families need the kind of safety net provided \nby MILC.\n  MILC is important in that it provides a strong safety net to all the \nNation's dairy farmers in a market-oriented way that does not increase \nmilk prices on the grocery shelf.\n  For these and other reasons President Bush did the right thing and \nendorsed the extension of MILC. I am pleased to have the support of the \nPresident in this important endeavor and I hope my colleagues will join \nme in our effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 273\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. NATIONAL DAIRY MARKET LOSS PAYMENTS.\n\n       Section 1502 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act \n     of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 7982) is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence of subsection (d)(2), by striking \n     ``2,400,000'' and inserting ``4,800,000''; and\n       (2) in subsections (f) and (g)(1), by striking ``2005'' \n     each place it appears and inserting ``2007''.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with a long list of \ncolleagues in introducing a bill to extend the MILC program. This \nmeasure is supported by members from different regions of the country \nand both political parties. This broad base of support is a clear \nindication of this issue's importance.\n  MILC, as most of my colleagues know, is the program created in the \n2002 Farm Bill after a very painful battle over the Northeast Dairy \nCompact. Many recall what a difficult time that was, with one group of \ndairymen pitted against another. I don't want to revisit that time. The \nMILC program bridged a bitter regional divide by providing a critical \nsafety net when prices are low. And when prices rebound, the MILC \nprogram becomes dormant and costs nothing. The problem with MILC is \nthat it expires on September 30 of this year--two years before the rest \nof the Farm Bill.\n  In addition to the cosponsors, MILC extension is supported by sixteen \ngovernors, including the governors of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Virginia, \nVermont, Missouri, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Idaho, Maine, Iowa, \nMichigan, New York, South Dakota, Ohio, Louisiana, and North Dakota. \nMoreover, the President of the United States committed himself to MILC \nextension during the presidential campaign.\n  I am hopeful the President's budget will include MILC extension when \nwe receive it next Monday. That would be a helpful next step. But the \nfact of the matter is that budget resolutions never get signed into law \nin and of themselves. They are merely a framework for further \ndiscussion and work. And it will take effort both from Congress and the \nadministration to see this extension translated into law. I look \nforward to working with the President and his new Secretary of \nAgriculture to make sure that happens.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeMINT:\n  S. 274. A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \ninclude additional information in Social Security account statements; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, in 1999, the Social Security \nAdministration began mailing the new Your Social Security Statement to \nall Americans over the age of 25 but not retired.\n  These statements include an accounting of Social Security taxes the \nindividual worker has paid to date, the worker's eligibility status for \nbenefits, and an estimate of the benefits the worker could receive.\n  For most Americans, this personal statement will be the sole source \nof official information on Social Security; yet it downplays or omits \nimportant information about the program.\n  The bill I am introducing today is called the Social Security Right \nto Know Act and would correct this problem at no cost by simply \nchanging the statement to include information available in official \nreports.\n  The improved statement would inform workers, using information in the \nSocial Security Trustees' Report, that the taxes paid into the program \nmay not be sufficient to fund all of their benefits in retirement.\n  It would also inform workers, using information from the Office of \nManagement and Budget, that the Social Security Trust Fund does not \nconsist of real economic assets that can be drawn down in the future to \nfund benefits.\n  The new statement would inform workers that they pay 6.2 percent of \ntheir earnings and their employer pays 6.2 percent on their behalf, for \na total Social Security payroll tax of 12.4 percent.\n  It would also illustrate and explain to workers using information \nfrom the Government Accounting Office that while Social Security has \nperformed well in the past, its average rate of return is expected to \ndecline in the future.\n  While we may not agree on specific changes to Social Security, we \nshould all agree that Americans have a right to know the true financial \nstatus of the program and how it will affect their retirement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 274\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to revise the boundary of the Wind Cave National Park \nin the State of South Dakota; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce legislation \nfrom the previous Congress that will revise and expand the boundary to \nthe Wind Cave National Park in Custer and Fall River County South \nDakota. I am pleased that my colleague, Senator John Thune, has joined \nme today in introducing this important bill.\n  Wind Cave National Park is one of the Nation's first national parks, \ncontaining in its boundaries one of the greatest expanses of \nunderground cave complexes in North America. Established in 1903, Wind \nCave National Park protects one of the world's oldest known cave \nformations with hundreds of miles of underground compartments. \nAmazingly, scientific measurements indicate that only five percent of \nthe total cave has been discovered.\n  With the option to acquire approximately 5,500 acres of land from \nwilling sellers, Wind Cave National Park has a once-in-a-generation \nopportunity to significantly enhance one of the last remaining mixed-\ngrass prairie ecosystems in the world. The acquisition of this land \nadjacent to the southern boundary of the park will preserve a key \narchaeological site described as one of the only existing buffalo jumps \nused by Native Americans as they hunted the giant animal.\n  I believe that the local park officials and the willing-seller \nlandowner have done a good job in reaching out to the community and \nworking to modify their original proposal to conform to the interests \nof adjacent landowners and the State of South Dakota. As with any land \nacquisition initiative the question of compensating local government's \nfor the lost tax revenue is extremely important. The matter is \nparticularly acute in western South Dakota, where large tracts of \nfederal land result in particular challenges. To that end, I call on \nCongress to fully fund the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program and provide \na dedicated revenue source to compensate local communities that have \nsignificant amounts of federal lands in the counties.\n  The Wind Cave National Park is a South Dakota treasure shared with \nthe entire world through the stewardship of the National Park Service. \nSome four million visitors come to the Black Hills each year and \ntourism is one of South Dakota's leading economic engines. It is my \nstrong desire that the Congress will quickly take the appropriate steps \nnecessary and demonstrate positive action in the consideration of this \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 276\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for direct access to audiologists for Medicare beneficiaries, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Hearing \nHealth Acessibility Act with our colleagues Senator DeWine and Senator \nHarkin. This legislation is the companion bill to legislation that was \nintroduced in the House by Representative Jim Ryun, with a number of \ncosponsors.\n  This legislation will, in short, provide Medicare beneficiaries with \nthe option of direct access to audiology services, as is the case for \nthe health care programs administered by the Department of Veterans \nAffairs and the Office of Personnel Management. Direct access works \nwell for our veterans and for Federal employees, including Members of \nCongress, and should be available to senior citizens in the Medicare \nprogram.\n  In 2003, the Congress in the Appropriations Conference Report number \n108-10 recommended that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nmake this change. We have since learned from Mr. Joel Kaplan, Deputy \nDirector, Office of Management and Budget, that CMS does not have the \nauthority to do so under current law. Therefore, I hope that we can all \nagree that this is a common sense idea whose time has come, and move \nthis legislation forward to enactment.\n  Direct access would facilitate access to hearing care without \nexpanding the scope of practice for audiologists. This legislation will \nmake it easier for Medicare beneficiaries, particularly in rural \nAmerica, to have the same high quality hearing care provided by the VA \nand OPM. It is also important to point out that both the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs now recognize State licensure as the appropriate \nstandard for determining who is a qualified audiologist.\n  This legislation enjoys the support the American Academy of \nAudiology, the American Speech-Language and Hearing Association, and \nthe Academy of Dispensing Audiologists. I commend this legislation to \nthe attention of my colleagues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 278. A bill to revise certain requirements for H-2B employers and \nrequire submission of information regarding H-2B non-immigrants, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the recent shortage of H-2B nonimmigrant \nvisas for temporary or seasonal non-agricultural foreign workers is a \nmatter of great concern to many small businesses in my home State of \nMaine, particularly those in the hospitality sector that rely on these \nseasonal workers to supplement their local employees during the height \nof the tourism season.\n  On January 4, a mere 3 months into fiscal year 2005, the U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services, CIS, announced that it would \nimmediately\n\n[[Page S983]]\n\nstop accepting applications for H-2B visas because the annual statutory \ncap of 66,000 visas had been met. In other words, many employers who \nrequire temporary workers in the spring, summer, or fall will be unable \nto hire such workers because all 66,000 H-2B visas will already have \nbeen issued within the first few months of the fiscal year. Once again, \nMaine's employers will be left out in the cold, disadvantaged by their \nlater tourism season.\n  Without these visas, employers will be unable to hire enough workers \nto keep their businesses running at normal levels. Last year, unable to \nlocate enough American workers willing and able to take these jobs, and \nwithout temporary foreign workers to fill the gap, many business owners \nwere forced to initiate stop-gap measures that were neither ideal nor \nsustainable in the long term. Many of these businesses fear that, this \nyear, they will have to decrease their hours of operation during what \nis their busiest time of year. This would translate into lost jobs for \nAmerican workers, lost income for American businesses, and lost tax \nrevenue from those businesses. These losses will be significant, and \nthey can be avoided.\n  This is why I am today introducing the Summer Operations and Seasonal \nEquity Act of 2005. Similar to legislation that I cosponsored last \nyear, this bill would exclude from the cap returning workers who were \ncounted against the cap within the past 3 years. Ths legislation also \nseeks to address the inequities in the current system by requiring that \nno fewer than 12,000 visas be made available in each quarter of the \nfiscal year. By holding back a limited number of visas for use in each \nquarter, we will ensure that employers across the country, operating in \nall four seasons, have a fair and equal opportunity to hire these much-\nneeded workers.\n  We must act quickly on this legislation, however, or we will be too \nlate to help thousands of American businesses that need our help now. \nWe cannot be content to say: ``It's too late for this year; maybe next \nyear.'' It is true that comprehensive, long-term solutions may be \nnecessary, but we have immediate needs as well. This problem demands \nimmediate solutions.\n  In my home State of Maine, the economic impact of this visa shortage \nwill be harmful and widespread. When people think of Maine, what often \ncomes to mind is its rugged coastline, picturesque towns and villages, \nand its abundant lakes and forests. Not surprisingly, tourism is the \nState's largest industry. Temporary and seasonal workers play an \nimportant role in this very important industry.\n\n  This is because, unfortunately, there are not enough American workers \nwilling and able to fill the thousands of jobs necessary to provide the \nlevel of service that Maine's visitors have come to expect. Over the \nyears, seasonal workers have filled this gap, becoming an integral part \nof Maine's tourism and hospitality industry. In fiscal year 2003, the \nlast time Maine's employers were able to fully utilize the H-2B \nprogram, Maine employed more than 3,000 seasonal workers. The majority \nof these individuals worked in the State's resorts, inns, hotels, and \nrestaurants. Many are people who have returned to the same employer \nsummer after summer.\n  Let me emphasize that employers are not permitted to hire these \nforeign workers unless they can prove that they have tried, and failed, \nto locate available and qualified American workers through advertising \nand other means. As a safeguard, current regulations require the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor to certify that such efforts have occurred before \nCIS will process the visa applications. Therefore, unless and until \nmore H-2B visas are made available, many of these jobs will remain \nunfilled and American businesses will suffer.\n  A similar situation faces Maine's forest products industry, which \ncontributes approximately $5.6 billion annually to Maine's economy. In \n2003, more than 600 temporary workers--mostly from Canada--were \nemployed as forestry workers in Maine. Many work in remote areas of the \nState where there are not enough Americans able to take these jobs. By \nsome estimates, these foreign workers account for as much as 30-40 \npercent of the wood fiber that supplies paper and saw mills throughout \nMaine and the Northeast. This number represents roughly 4.8 million \ntons of wood annually. With an already significant shortage in the wood \nsupply, the loss of these temporary workers poses a serious threat to \nthe industry and to Maine's economy. With fewer workers available to \nbring wood out of the forest and into mills, supplies will dwindle, \nprices will continue to rise, and mills may be forced to curtail \nproduction, or even temporarily discontinue operations. If this \nhappens, it is American workers who may lose their jobs.\n  The effects of the H-2B visa shortage are not limited to the tourism \nand forest products industries, however. It will also be felt by \nfisheries and lobstermen, junior league hockey and minor league \nbaseball teams. It will affect small businesses and large, visitors and \nlocals, young and old, from Maine to Maryland, to Wyoming and Alaska.\n  The shortage of nonimmigrant temporary or seasonal worker visas is a \nproblem that must be addressed, and soon. I believe that this \nlegislation offers a workable short-term solution, and I urge us to \nmove forward with this solution. We must resist the tendency to let \nthis problem, and the people who are affected by it, become entangled \nin the larger debate about our Nation's immigration policies. This is \nnot about the number of immigrants we should allow to come to the \nUnited States each year, or what to do with those who violate our \nimmigration laws. It is about temporary workers who, for the most part, \nrespect our laws, go home at the end of their authorized stay, and in \nmany cases, return again next year to provide services that benefit our \nnation's economy. It is about American businesses that rely on these \nworkers to take jobs that many Americans do not want. It is about the \neconomic impact that will be felt across the Nation if these businesses \nare unable to hire temporary workers. We need to solve this problem \nnow, before it is too late and our economy is harmed and jobs lost.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 279. A bill to amend the Act of June 7, 1924, to provide for the \nexercise of criminal jurisdiction; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nBingaman, to introduce legislation to address a serious problem in the \nState of New Mexico. State case law currently holds that the State of \nNew Mexico does not have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes that occur on \nprivately held land within the exterior boundaries of a Pueblo. Federal \ncase law holds that the Federal Government does not have jurisdiction \nto prosecute crimes that occur on these lands. Read in tandem, these \ncourt decisions lead to the result that neither Federal, State nor \ntribal law-enforcement officials have jurisdiction on thousands of \nacres of privately owned lands within the boundaries of Indian pueblos. \nAs a result, in recent years there have been stabbings, criminal \nsexual-contact cases, and aggravated battery charges that have stalled \nin court over jurisdiction questions.\n  The prospect of having lands in my State where anyone can commit any \ncrime and not be prosecuted for it is untenable and something that \nneeds to be fixed. The legislation I am introducing today clearly \noutlines who is responsible for trying these cases by clarifying when a \ncrime should be prosecuted in Federal, tribal, or State court. At the \nsame time, the bill honors tribal sovereignty.\n  If we do not address this problem, it will only worsen. This \nlegislation culminates a lot of work among the New Mexico delegation, \nthe pueblos, and the State. It is a necessary bill. It is a good bill. \nAnd I hope that my colleagues will act quickly to clarify jurisdiction \nover these lands.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 279\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CRIMINAL JURISDICTION.\n\n       The Act of June 7, 1924 (43 Stat. 636, chapter 331) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n[[Page S984]]\n\n     ``SEC. 20. CRIMINAL JURISDICTION.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Except as otherwise provided by \n     Congress, jurisdiction over offenses committed anywhere \n     within the exterior boundaries of any grant from a prior \n     sovereign, as confirmed by Congress or the Court of Private \n     Land Claims to a Pueblo Indian tribe of New Mexico, shall be \n     as provided in this section.\n       ``(b) Jurisdiction of the Pueblo.--The Pueblo shall have \n     jurisdiction, as an act of the inherent power of the Pueblo \n     as an Indian tribe, over any offense committed by a member of \n     the Pueblo or of another federally recognized Indian tribe, \n     or by any other Indian-owned entity.\n       ``(c) Jurisdiction of the United States.--The United States \n     shall have jurisdiction over any offense described in chapter \n     53 of title 18, United States Code, committed by or against a \n     member of any federally recognized Indian tribe or any \n     Indian-owned entity, or that involves any Indian property or \n     interest.\n       ``(d) Jurisdiction of the State of New Mexico.--The State \n     of New Mexico shall have jurisdiction over any offense \n     committed by a person who is not a member of a federally \n     recognized Indian tribe, which offense is not subject to the \n     jurisdiction of the United States.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 280. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the amortization of delay rental payments and geological and \ngeophysical expenditures; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill that will \nbolster our energy independence by clarifying current tax law regarding \ndomestic oil and gas production.\n  We need to promote domestic energy supplies because we are \nincreasingly dependent on foreign oil to meet our energy needs. We \ncurrently import almost 60 percent from foreign countries. Promoting \ndomestic production is both an economic and national security issue.\n  The rational treatment of costs associated with exploration and \nproduction of energy resources is vital to attracting and retaining \nfinancing in an inherently capital-intensive industry. The bill I am \nintroducing helps in this regard by allowing accelerated deduction of \ngeological and geophysical (G) costs and delay rental payments. \nSpecifically, this legislation will allow these expenses to be \namortized over a 2 year period. This will encourage further development \nof the United States oil and gas industry.\n  There is no reason G expenditures should be considered capital \nexpenditures with a long amortization period rather than treating them \nmore like research and development costs. Our current tax code \nneedlessly limits the ability of domestic producers to develop our \nnational petroleum reserves.\n  Congress also needs to clarify that delay rental payments are \ndeductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses. This is \nimportant for developers who cannot afford to run continuous operations \non the properties they hold. The current uncertainty of how these costs \nare to be treated has led to costly litigation; prompt clarification \nwill eliminate needless administrative burdens on taxpayers and the \nInternal Revenue Service.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill as an important step in \ndeveloping energy independence. I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 280\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Family and Medical leave Act of 1993 to \nexpand the scope of the Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Mikulski, Senator Murray, Senator Clinton, \nSenator Durbin, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Leahy, Senator Akaka, \nSenator Boxer, and Senator Corzine, to introduce the ``Family and \nMedical Leave Expansion Act.'' Today marks the 12th anniversary of the \nenactment of the Family and Medical Leave Act. This landmark \nlegislation was nearly a decade in the making, but today, more than 50 \nmillion Americans have taken leave under FMLA.\n  Despite the many Americans the Family and Medical Leave Act has \nhelped, too many continue to be left behind. Too many continue to have \nto choose between job and family. The facts are clear: millions of \nAmericans remain uncovered by the Family and Medical Leave Act. And too \nmany who are eligible for the Family and Medical Leave Act cannot \nafford to take unpaid leave from work. The ``Family and Medical Leave \nExpansion Act'', which we are introducing today addresses both these \nproblems.\n  The ``Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act'' would expand the scope \nand coverage of FMLA. It would fund pilot programs at the state level \nto offer partial or full wage replacement programs to ensure that \nemployees do not have to choose between job and family.\n  Times have changed over the years. More and more mothers are working. \nWhile decades ago only a tiny fraction of mothers with infants under \none year of age were working, in 2004 about 55 percent of mothers with \ninfants were working. Even as employment rates within this group rises, \nfamily responsibilities remain constant, a reality that lies at the \ncore of the FMLA. According to an employee survey by the Department of \nLabor, about one-fifth of U.S. workers have a need for some form of \nleave covered under the FMLA, and about 40 percent of all employees \nthink they will need FMLA-covered leave within the next 5 years.\n  According to a Department of Labor study in 2000, leave to care for \none's own health or for the health of a seriously ill child, spouse or \nparent, together account for almost 80 percent of all FMLA leave. \nApproximately 52 percent of the leave taken is due to employees' own \nserious health problems, while 26 percent of the leave is taken by \nyoung parents caring for their children at birth or adoption.\n\n[[Page S985]]\n\n  The FMLA requires that all public sector employers and private \nemployers of 50 or more employees provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid \nleave for medical and family care reasons for eligible employees. About \n77 percent of employees in the private and public sector currently work \nin FMLA-covered sites, although only 62 percent of employees are \nactually eligible for leave.\n  However, only 11 percent of private sector work sites are covered \nunder FMLA. Individuals working for smaller private employers deserve \nthe same work protections afforded to other employees. As a step toward \nexpanding protection to more hard-working Americans, this bill would \nextend FMLA coverage to all private sector worksites with 25 or more \nemployees within a 75-mile radius. This would mean that an additional \n13 million Americans would be eligible for leave under the Act--roughly \n240,000 in my own State of Connecticut.\n  Mothers and fathers, adult sons and daughters have the same family \nresponsibilities and personal health problems, regardless of whether \nthey work for the government, a large private enterprise, or a medium-\nsized private business. Expanding the FMLA to businesses with 25 or \nmore employees is a crucial acknowledgment of this reality.\n  The bill recognizes the enormous physical and emotional toll domestic \nviolence takes on victims. The bill expands the scope of FMLA to \ninclude leave for individuals to care for themselves or to care for a \ndaughter, son, or parent suffering from domestic violence.\n  Expanding the scope and coverage of FMLA is a positive step for many \nAmericans. But, alone, it is not enough. According to a Department of \nLabor study, 3.5 million covered Americans needed leave but--without \nwage replacement--could not afford to take leave. Over four-fifths of \nthose who needed leave but did not take it said they could not afford \nunpaid leave.\n  Others cut their leave short, with the average duration of FMLA leave \nbeing 10 days. Of those individuals taking leave under the Family and \nMedical Leave Act, nearly three-quarters had incomes above $30,000.\n  While the financial sacrifice is often enormous, the need for leave \ncan be even more so. Every year, many Americans bite the bullet and \naccept unpaid leave. As a result, nine percent of leave takers go on \npublic assistance to cover their lost wages. Almost twelve percent of \nfemale leave takers use public assistance for this reason. These \nindividuals are far from being unwilling to work. Instead, they are \ntrying to balance work with family--often during a crisis, too often \nwith inadequate means to get by.\n  Other major industrialized nations have implemented policies far more \nfamily-friendly to promote early childhood development and family \ncaregiving. At least 128 countries provide paid and job-protected \nmaternity leave, with an average of sixteen weeks of basic paid leave. \nIn 1992, before we enacted the Family and Medical Leave Act, the \nEuropean Union mandated a paid fourteen-week maternity leave as a \nhealth and safety measure. Among the 29 Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development (OECD) countries, the average childbirth-\nrelated leave is 44 weeks, while the average duration of paid leave is \n36 weeks.\n  Compared to these other developed nations, the United States is far \nbehind in efforts to promote stronger families and worker productivity. \nThe ``Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act'' builds on current law to \nprovide pilot programs for States and the federal government to provide \nfor partial or full wage replacement for at least 6 weeks. At a \nminimum, this will ensure that parents can continue to make ends meet \nwhile taking family and medical leave.\n  When we talk about a more compassionate America, nowhere is that more \nevident than in our caregiving leave policies. No one should have to \nchoose between work and family. Women and men deserve to take leave \nwhen family or health conditions require it without fear of losing \ntheir job or livelihood. We must not simply pay lip service to family \nintegrity and the promotion of a healthy workplace.\n  We talk often of our need to strengthen family values. We cite \nstudies about the importance of the first few months of a newborn's \nlife. This bill offers more parents the opportunity to spend time with \ntheir families when their families most need them.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the ``Family and Medical Leave \nExpansion Act'' to promote our family values and to ensure the welfare \nand health of hard-working Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a brief summary of the Family \nand Medical Leave Expansion Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               The Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act\n\n\n                             Brief Summary\n\n       Background: Since enactment in 1993, more than 50 million \n     employees have taken leave under the Family and Medical Leave \n     Act. The Act guarantees eligible employees working for \n     covered employers access to up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-\n     protected leave within any 12-month period to care for their \n     health or the health of their families without putting their \n     jobs or health insurance at risk. About 11 percent of private \n     sector businesses are covered under FMLA; 77 percent of \n     employees work in these covered businesses (although about 62 \n     percent of employees are eligible for FMLA).\n       According to data from a 2001 Department of Labor study, 52 \n     percent of leave-takers have taken time off to care for their \n     own serious illness; 26 percent have taken time off to care \n     for a new child or for maternity disability reasons; 13 \n     percent have taken time off to care for a seriously ill \n     parent; 12 percent have taken time off to care for a \n     seriously ill child; and 6 percent have taken time off to \n     care for a seriously ill spouse. About 42 percent of leave \n     takers are men; about 58 percent of leave-takers are women. \n     The median length of leave is 10 days; 80 percent of leaves \n     are for 40 days or fewer. About 73 percent of leave-takers \n     earn $30,000 or more.\n       While the Family and Medical Leave Act has proven \n     invaluable to many Americans, too many are still not covered \n     by the law and others cannot afford to take leave under the \n     Act because leave is unpaid. Many women and men are unable to \n     take time off to care for their families, whether due to the \n     arrival of a new child or when a medical crisis strikes. More \n     than three in four (78 percent) employees who have needed but \n     who have not taken leave report that they simply could not \n     afford it.\n       The Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act would expand the \n     scope and coverage of FMLA to ensure that even more American \n     workers do not have to choose between job and family. Too \n     many eligible individuals simply cannot afford unpaid leave. \n     Many forgo leave or take the shortest amount of time possible \n     because the current FMLA law requires only unpaid leave. The \n     Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act would:\n       Establish a pilot program to allocate grants to states to \n     provide paid leave for at least 6 weeks to eligible employees \n     responding to caregiving needs resulting from the birth or \n     adoption of a child or family illness. States may provide for \n     wage replacement directly or through an insurance program, \n     such as a state temporary disability program or a state \n     unemployment compensation program, or other mechanism. Such \n     paid leave shall count toward an eligible employee's 12 weeks \n     of leave under FMLA.\n       Expand the number of individuals eligible for FMLA by \n     covering employers with 25 or more employees (to enable 13 \n     million more Americans to take FMLA).\n       Expand the reasons for leave to include eligible employees \n     addressing domestic violence and its effects, which make the \n     employee unable to perform the functions of the position of \n     such employee or, to care for the son, daughter, or parent of \n     the employee, if such individual is addressing domestic \n     violence and its effects.\n       Establish a pilot program within the federal government for \n     the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to administer a \n     partial or full wage replacement for at least 6 weeks to \n     eligible employees responding to caregiving needs resulting \n     from the birth or adoption of a child or other family \n     caregiving needs. Such paid leave shall count toward an \n     eligible employee's 12 weeks of leave under FMLA.\n       Allows employees to use a total of 24 hours during any 12 \n     month period to participate in a school activity of a son or \n     daughter, such as a parent-teacher conference, or to \n     participate in literacy training under a family literacy \n     program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Allen, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \nMcCain, Mr. Levin, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \nColeman, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \nGrassley, Mr. Craig, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 284. A bill to distribute universal service support equitability \nthroughout rural America, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. SMITH. President, I rise today to shine a spotlight on one of the \nmost\n\n[[Page S986]]\n\nlopsided and unfair programs in the Federal Government, and to \nreintroduce legislation to correct it.\n  Every year, the Federal Government collects millions of dollars in \n``universal service'' surcharges on telephone bills. In part, this \nmoney is intended to be used to provide, affordable telephone service \nin isolated, rural areas--a goal we all support.\n  Unfortunately, instead of sending these funds equitably to rural \nareas throughout the United States, many residents in 40 States--\nincluding some of the most rural States in the country--receive no \nsupport from this program, while a few States receive enormous \nwindfalls. In 2005, about 75 percent of a key universal service fund \naccount is projected to go to just three States and a single State will \nreceive more than half of the funding provided by this program. All of \nthis continues the pattern of lopsided funding distribution seen in \nrecent years.\n  I am referring to the Federal Universal Service Fund program for so-\ncalled ``non-rural carriers.'' This is a ridiculous misnomer because \nmore than 70 percent of all rural Americans are served by one of 30 so-\ncalled ``non-rural'' carriers. If you live in a small, isolated town or \nrural area, you are likely served by one these carriers, and chances \nare your community is receiving none of the benefits of this program.\n  The calls to fix this program have been growing louder and louder. In \nthe 108th Congress, more than 80 independent organizations and state \nand local officials called on us to fix this unfair, broken program, \nincluding 21 governors, 38 State utility commissioners, the American \nFarm Bureau Federation, the National Grange, and groups representing \nbusiness, labor, consumers, minorities, and the rural poor.\n  Responding to that broad support, more than 30 Senators and 80 \nRepresentatives cosponsored my bill or the House companion measure \noffered by Mr. Terry of Nebraska and Mr. Stupak of Michigan last \nCongress. And the Senate Commerce Committee approved my bill on a \nstrong bipartisan vote.\n  Today, I am reintroducing the Rural Universal Service Equity Act, \nalong with 19 of my colleagues. This legislation would guarantee a \nfairer, more targeted distribution of the non-rural-carrier account by \nrequiring allocations to be based on actual community needs, not an \narbitrary mathematical formula.\n  Beyond basic fairness for the majority of rural America, there are at \nleast two additional reasons to enact this legislation.\n  First, it will help overcome the ``digital divide'' between urban and \nrural America, and prevent it from growing worse. As long as the \ncurrent rules remain in place, the majority of rural communities and \nthe telephone companies that serve them will suffer a significant \ncompetitive disadvantage in today's digital economy.\n  Second, the bill will fix this program while keeping a tight rein on \nUSF expenditures. My legislation would redistribute existing funds more \nfairly, without imposing any additional burdens on the USF or requiring \nincreased federal spending or revenues.\n  Finally, my bill would not interfere with important efforts to fix \nother serious problems in the Universal Service Fund. We all know the \nUSF must be modernized and reformed to reflect the challenges and \ntechnologies of the 21st Century.\n  But the broader USF reform debate is likely to be contentious and \nprotracted. In the meantime, we should be able to correct a shameful \ninequity in a program that is intended to benefit the majority of rural \nAmericans. And we should do it as soon as possible.\n  Once again I thank my colleagues and friends across America who have \nhelped in this effort to date, and I call upon all members of the \nSenate to become cosponsors of the Rural Universal Service Equity Act. \nI ask unanimous consent that the text of legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 284\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Universal Service \n     Equity Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Federal Communications Commission's high-cost model \n     support program for certain carriers provides no Federal \n     support to 40 States.\n       (2) Federal universal service support should be calculated \n     and targeted to small geographic regions within a State to \n     provide greater assistance to the rural consumers most in \n     need of support.\n       (3) Local telephone competition and emerging technologies \n     are threatening the viability of Federal universal service \n     support.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To begin consideration of universal service reform.\n       (2) To spread the benefits of the existing Federal high-\n     cost model support mechanism more equitably across the \n     nation.\n\n     SEC. 3. COMPTROLLER GENERAL REPORT ON NEED TO REFORM HIGH-\n                   COST SUPPORT MECHANISM.\n\n       Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit to Congress a \n     report on the need to reform the high-cost support mechanism \n     for rural, insular, and high-cost areas. As part of the \n     report, the Comptroller General shall provide an overview and \n     discuss whether--\n       (1) existing Federal and State high-cost support mechanisms \n     ensure rate comparability between urban and rural areas;\n       (2) the Federal Communications Commission and the States \n     have taken the necessary steps to remove implicit support;\n       (3) the existing high-cost support mechanism has affected \n     the development of local competition in urban and rural \n     areas; and\n       (4) amendments to section 254 of the Communications Act of \n     1934 (47 U.S.C. 254) are necessary to preserve and advance \n     universal service.\n\n     SEC. 4. ELIGIBILITY FOR UNIVERSAL SERVICE SUPPORT FOR HIGH-\n                   COST AREAS.\n\n       Section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     254) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(m) Universal Service Support for High-cost Areas.--\n       ``(1) Calculating support.--In calculating Federal \n     universal service support for eligible telecommunications \n     carriers that serve rural, insular, and high-cost areas, the \n     Commission shall, subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), revise \n     the Commission's support mechanism for high-cost areas to \n     provide support to each wire center in which the incumbent \n     local exchange carrier's average cost per line for such wire \n     center exceeds the national average cost per line by such \n     amount as the Commission determines appropriate for the \n     purpose of ensuring the equitable distribution of universal \n     service support throughout the United States.\n       ``(2) Hold harmless support.--In implementing this \n     subsection, the Commission shall ensure that no State \n     receives less Federal support calculated under paragraph (1) \n     than the State would have received, up to 10 percent of the \n     total support distributed, under the Commission's support \n     mechanism for high-cost areas as in effect on the date of the \n     enactment of this subsection.\n       ``(3) Limitation on total support to be provided.--The \n     total amount of support for all States, as calculated under \n     paragraphs (1) and (2), shall be equivalent to the total \n     support calculated under the Commission's support mechanism \n     for high-cost areas as in effect on the date of the enactment \n     of this subsection.\n       ``(4) Construction of limitation.--The limitation in \n     paragraph (3) shall not be construed to preclude fluctuations \n     in support on the basis of changes in the data used to make \n     such calculations.\n       ``(5) Implementation.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this subsection, the Commission \n     shall complete the actions (including prescribing or amending \n     regulations) necessary to implement the requirements of this \n     subsection.\n       ``(6) Definition.--In this subsection, the term \n     `Commission's support mechanism for high-cost areas' means \n     section 54.309 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations and \n     the regulations referred to in such section.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. NO EFFECT ON RURAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect the \n     support provided to an eligible telecommunications carrier \n     under section 214(e) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 214(e)) that is a rural telephone company (as defined \n     in section 3 of such Act (47 U.S.C. 153)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Sarbanes, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Dayton, \n        Mr. Levin, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Durbin, \n        and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 286. A bill to amend section 401(b)(2) of the Higher Education Act \nof 1965 regarding the Federal Pell Grant maximum amount; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise and am joined by my colleagues \nSenators Mikulski, Jeffords, Murray, Lieberman, Sarbanes, Landrieu, \nDayton, Levin, Lautenberg, Inouye,\n\n[[Page S987]]\n\nCorzine, Durbin and Akaka to introduce legislation to amend the Higher \nEducation Act to improve access to higher education for low- and \nmiddle-income students by raising the authorized maximum Pell Grant to \n$11,600 within five years. This bill has the strong support of the \nStudent Aid Alliance, whose 60 organizations represent students, \ncolleges, parents, and others who care about higher education.\n  Pell Grants were established in the early 1970s by our former \ncolleague, I Claiborne Pell, of Rhode Island. They are the largest \nsource of Federal grant aid for college students. For millions of low- \nand middle-income students they are the difference between attending or \nnot attending college. But, unfortunately, they don't make as much of a \ndifference as they used to.\n  In 1975, the maximum appropriated Pell Grant covered all of the \naverage student's tuition, fees, room, and board at community colleges. \nIt covered about 80 percent of those costs at public universities and \nabout 40 percent at private universities. In 2003, the average Pell \nGrant covered 32 percent of tuition, room and board at community \ncolleges, 23 percent of the total charges at public universities, and 9 \npercent of total charges at private universities. That's not just a \ndrop, it's a free-fall.\n  For low- and middle-income families, the cost of college also has \nincreased significantly as a percentage of income. College is getting \nfarther and farther out of reach for an entire generation of students.\n  As a result of all this, low- and middle-income students who want to \nattend college are forced to finance their education with an ever-\nincreasing percentage of loans as opposed to grants. This increases the \ncost of attendance for these students even more, and in many cases, \nkeeps them from going to college at all.\n  For four years now, the Administration has not raised the maximum \nPell Grant. On top of leaving millions of children behind by failing to \nmeet the bipartisan promises of the No Child Left Behind Act, they have \nleft even more children behind who work hard and do well in school and \nwant to go on to college. If we're serious about leaving no child \nbehind, if we're serious about having a society where equal opportunity \nfor all is more than just rhetoric, then we need to reinvigorate the \nPell program.\n  It has been said that investing in a student's future is investing in \nour Nation's future. We can start investing in our Nation's future by \nsupporting this bill to increase the maximum appropriated Pell Grant to \n$11,600. This bill won't bring the Pell Grant's purchasing power back \nto where it was in 1975, but it is a critical first step, and I intend \nto continue my efforts on this matter throughout this Congress. I hope \nthat my colleagues will join me.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 286\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FEDERAL PELL GRANT MAXIMUM AMOUNT.\n\n       Section 401(b)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 \n     U.S.C. 1070a(b)(2)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraph (B) as subparagraph (C);\n       (2) by striking subparagraph (A) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount of \n     the Federal Pell Grant for a student eligible under this part \n     shall be--\n       ``(i) $7,600 for academic year 2005-2006;\n       ``(ii) $8,600 for academic year 2006-2007;\n       ``(iii) $9,600 for academic year 2007-2008;\n       ``(iv) $10,600 for academic year 2008-2009; and\n       ``(v) $11,600 for academic year 2009-2010,\n\n     less an amount equal to the amount determined to be the \n     expected family contribution with respect to that student for \n     that year.''; and\n       (3) by inserting after subparagraph (A) (as amended by \n     paragraph (2)) the following:\n       ``(B) If the Secretary determines that the increase from \n     one academic year to the next in the amount of the maximum \n     Federal Pell Grant authorized under subparagraph (A) does not \n     increase students' purchasing power (relative to the cost of \n     attendance at an institution of higher education) by not less \n     than 5 percentage points, then the amount of the maximum \n     Federal Pell Grant authorized under subparagraph (A) for the \n     academic year for which the determination is made shall be \n     increased by an amount sufficient to achieve such a 5 \n     percentage point increase.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. ENSIGN (for himself, Mr. Kyl, and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 287. A bill to require the Congressional Budget Office and the \nJoint Committee on Taxation to use dynamic economic modeling in the \npreparation of budgetary estimates of proposed changes in Federal \nrevenue law; to the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nrequire the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget \nOffice to use dynamic scoring, in addition to traditional static \nscoring, when estimating the effects of tax policy changes.\n  For too long, Congress has debated changes to the tax code without \nthe benefit of knowing how those changes might affect the Federal \nGovernment's revenue and the overall economy. I have believed that \nWashington, DC should consider the dynamic effect of tax cuts ever \nsince I was first elected to Congress. This is why I am introducing \nthis legislation today and why I first introduced this bill back in \n2003.\n  On January 24, 2005, The Wall Street Journal published an article \nthat explained the need for dynamic scoring. I agree with the article: \ncertain tax cuts can stimulate our Nation's economy, and in turn, \nincrease the Federal Government's revenue. What the article explains is \nthat a dollar in tax cuts does not necessarily result in a dollar of \nlost revenue. The right type of tax cut will encourage growth and job \ncreation and will expand the economy. This expansion will in turn \nincrease tax revenue. I would ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthat article be reprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 24, 2005]\n\n                            Gaining Capital\n\n       Some people continue to believe, or at least still assert, \n     that tax rates don't influence taxpayer behavior all that \n     much. We therefore direct their attention to the Treasury \n     Department's latest historical data on revenues from taxes on \n     capital gains.\n       The numbers look like a 25-year demonstration of the Laffer \n     Curve in action. Taxes paid on capital gains have been highly \n     responsive to the maximum capital gains tax rate. Especially \n     notable is how, over the years, capital gains realizations \n     and the taxes paid on those gains have tended to increase in \n     the years following a cut in the capital gains tax rate.\n       The reductions highlighted in the chart include the famous \n     William Steiger tax rate cut that passed Congress in late \n     1978 over Jimmy Carter's objections, the Reagan tax cut \n     passed in 1981, and the cut that was part of the Clinton-\n     Gingrich balanced budget deal of 1997. All of those \n     reductions caused taxpayers to cash in more of their gains \n     and thus yielded revenue windfalls for the federal Treasury \n     in succeeding years.\n       On the other hand, the capital gains tax increase of 1986--\n     which moved the rate back up to 28% from 20%--proved to be a \n     revenue disaster. Taxes paid on long-term capital gains \n     (those typically held longer than one year) fell off a cliff \n     to $33.7 billion in 1987 from $52.9 billion a year earlier. \n     And they stayed at close to that mediocre lower level for \n     nearly another decade. In other words, higher rates didn't do \n     anyone any good, not even the politicians who thought they'd \n     be getting more tax revenue to spend.\n       We aren't asserting that tax-rate changes have been the \n     only factors influencing revenue changes. The performance of \n     the broader economy and the stock market have also mattered a \n     great deal. Capital gains revenues boomed in the late 1990s \n     after the 1997 rate cut, but they fell abruptly with the \n     bursting of the dot-com and tech bubbles in 2001.\n       The evidence is overwhelming, however, that lower rates \n     induced more taxpayers to realize their capital gains, and \n     thus produced more tax revenue despite the lower rates. The \n     top capital gains rate was cut again in 2003, to 15%, and it \n     is likely that Treasury will also report an increase in \n     revenues in that year and in 2004 as the stock-market \n     rebounded smartly.\n       In each of these episodes, we should add, Congress's Joint \n     Tax Committee predicted more or less the opposite. Wedded to \n     its static models that underestimate the impact of behavioral \n     incentives, Joint Tax predicted revenue losses from tax-rate \n     cuts and revenue gains from tax-rate increases. In recent \n     years Joint Tax has finally acknowledged some ``unlocking'' \n     effect on capital gains realizations from lower rates, but it \n     still refuses to recognize any revenue impact from faster \n     economic growth or from a stronger stock-market that tax \n     reductions on capital help to promote.\n       The refusal to take control of Joint Tax has been a major \n     failure of the GOP Congress, and should be a priority as it \n     contemplates tax reform that President Bush has said must be \n     ``revenue neutral.'' Republicans will have a much better \n     chance of\n\n[[Page S988]]\n\n     passing a pro-growth tax reform with lower rates if they have \n     a revenue-estimating bureaucracy that is pledged to accuracy \n     instead of to its old habits. Ways and Means Chairman Bill \n     Thomas, take note.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. The current method of assessing proposed changes in tax \npolicy, static scoring, assumes tax cuts or tax hikes have no effect on \nhow taxpayers work, save, and invest their money. This model implies \nthat tax policy changes have no effect on our economy, never produce \nhigher or lower revenues, and never cause resources to shift within our \nfederal budget. This is simply incorrect. Tax policy changes can have a \nhuge impact on our economy.\n  The idea that tax relief and investment incentives will strengthen \nour economy is not a new one. On April 15, 1986, President Reagan spoke \nabout the positive effects tax relief can have on economic growth. He \nstated: ``whatever you want to call it, supply side economics or \nincentive economics . . . it's launching the American economy into a \nnew era of growth and opportunity. . . .''\n  What President Reagan stated so eloquently in 1986 holds true today. \nEconomic growth is more easily achieved in an atmosphere where more \nAmericans are able to save and invest their money. Tax relief provides \neconomic growth. When we draft legislation, we should understand not \nonly the cost of tax relief to the federal budget but also the benefits \nthat tax relief provides to the economy. To create jobs. And to \nultimately increase tax revenue for the federal government in the long \nrun.\n  Tax relief provides jobs and profits, no matter who is in the White \nHouse and no matter who holds the majority in Congress. It is time for \nCongress to make choices with a better understanding of the real-world \nimplications of those choices. This will better enable us to determine \nhow much relief we can afford to give to American families.\n  The debate on dynamic versus static scoring may sound like an inside-\nthe-Beltway squabble but as I have said today, the decision on how to \nestimate revenues does have important real-world implications. For \nexample, better revenue estimating methods would make it easier to \nimplement tax rate reductions. This would put more money into the \npockets of taxpayers, which would have a very real positive effect on \nour economy.\n  Today, American families face the challenge of providing food, \nclothing, and shelter for their children; saving for their children's \neducation; and paying for health care. When government raises taxes, we \nforce parents to work even harder so that they can meet these \nobligations and have money left over to enjoy a family vacation or put \nmoney away for their retirement. I believe in the American family \nbecause it is these families that make America great. I trust the \nAmerican family and believe that they can far better take care of their \nneeds when Congress demands less of what they earn.\n  I should clarify that this legislation does not negate Congress' use \nof the currently used static scoring model. This bill simply directs \nCBO and the Joint Tax Committee to develop both static and dynamic \nscoring estimates for Congress to consider. This will create a system \nthat will allow Congress a side-by-side analysis of both scoring \nmethods so that Congress can better make decisions regarding tax policy \nthat will grow our economy and create jobs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 287\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that it is necessary to ensure \n     that Congress is presented with reliable information from the \n     Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation as to the dynamic macroeconomic feedback effects to \n     changes in Federal law and the probable behavioral responses \n     of taxpayers, businesses, and other parties to such changes. \n     Specifically, the Congress intends that, while not excluding \n     any other estimating method, dynamic estimating techniques \n     shall also be used in estimating the fiscal impact of \n     proposals to change Federal laws, to the extent that data are \n     available to permit estimates to be made in such a manner.\n\n     SEC. 2. ESTIMATES OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON TAXATION.\n\n       In addition to any other estimates it may prepare of any \n     proposed change in Federal revenue law, a fiscal estimate \n     shall be prepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation of each \n     such proposed change on the basis of assumptions that \n     estimate the probable behavioral responses of personal and \n     business taxpayers and other relevant entities to that \n     proposed change and the dynamic macroeconomic feedback \n     effects of that proposed change. The preceding sentence shall \n     apply only to a proposed change that the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation determines, pursuant to a static fiscal estimate, \n     has a fiscal impact in excess of $250,000,000 in any fiscal \n     year.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTIMATES OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE.\n\n       In addition to any other estimates it may prepare of any \n     proposed change in Federal revenue law, a fiscal estimate \n     shall be prepared by the Congressional Budget Office of each \n     such proposed change on the basis of assumptions that \n     estimate the probable behavioral responses of personal and \n     business taxpayers and other relevant entities to that \n     proposed change and the dynamic macroeconomic feedback \n     effects of that proposed change. The preceding sentence shall \n     apply only to a proposed change that the Congressional Budget \n     Office determines, pursuant to a static fiscal estimate, has \n     a fiscal impact in excess of $250,000,000 in any fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 4. DISCLOSURE OF ASSUMPTIONS.\n\n       Any report to Congress or the public made by the Joint \n     Committee on Taxation or the Congressional Budget Office that \n     contains an estimate made under this Act of the effect that \n     any legislation will have on revenues shall be accompanied \n     by--\n       (1) a written statement fully disclosing the economic, \n     technical, and behavioral assumptions that were made in \n     producing that estimate, and\n       (2) the static fiscal estimate made with respect to the \n     same legislation and a written statement of the economic, \n     technical, and behavioral assumptions that were made in \n     producing that estimate.\n\n     SEC. 5. CONTRACTING AUTHORITY.\n\n       In performing the tasks specified in this Act, the Joint \n     Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office \n     may, subject to the availability of appropriations, enter \n     into contracts with universities or other private or public \n     organizations to perform such estimations or to develop \n     protocols and models for making such estimates.\n\n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 289. A bill to authorize an annual appropriation of $10,000,000 \nfor mental health courts through fiscal year 2011; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators Leahy \nand Domenici, to introduce a bill that would reauthorize ``America's \nLaw Enforcement and Mental Health Project Act.'' This program addresses \nthe impact that mentally ill offenders have had on our criminal justice \nsystem and the impact the system has had on the offenders and their \nspecial needs.\n  My interest in, and experience with this issue began over 30 years \nago, when I was working as Assistant County Prosecuting Attorney in \nGreene County, OH, and then as County Prosecutor. What I learned then--\nand what I have continued to encounter throughout my career in public \nservice--is that our State and local correctional facilities have \nbecome way stations for far too many mentally ill individuals in our \nNation.\n  A recent Justice Department study revealed that 16 percent of all \ninmates in America's State prisons and local jails today are mentally \nill. The American Jails Association estimates that 600,000 to 700,000 \nseriously mentally ill persons each year are booked into local jails, \nalone. In Ohio, nearly one in five prisoners need psychiatric services \nor special accommodations. As these statistics make clear, far too many \nof our Nation's mentally ill persons have ended up in our prisons and \njails. In fact, on any given day, the Los Angeles County Jail is home \nto more mentally ill inmates than the largest mental health care \ninstitution in our country.\n  How did we wind up in this situation? What happens is that all too \noften, the mentally ill act out their symptoms on the streets. They are \narrested for minor offenses and wind up in jail. They serve their \nsentences or are paroled, but do not receive any treatment for their \nunderlying mental illness. Not surprisingly, they often find themselves \nright back in the system only a short time later after committing \nadditional--often more serious--crimes.\n  Throughout this destructive cycle, law enforcement and corrections \nspend time and money trying to cope with the unique problems posed by \nthese individuals. Certainly, many mentally ill\n\n[[Page S989]]\n\noffenders must be incarcerated because of the severity of their crimes. \nHowever, those who commit very minor, non-violent offenses don't \nnecessarily need to be incarcerated; instead, if given appropriate \ntreatment early, their illnesses could be addressed, helping the \noffenders, while reducing recidivism and decreasing the burdens on our \npolice and corrections officials.\n  That is why, six years ago Senator Domenici and I introduced \nAmerica's Law Enforcement and Mental Health Project, to begin to \nidentify--early in the process--mentally ill offenders within our \njustice system and to use the power of the courts to assist them in \nobtaining the treatment they need.\n  This program has been a success. In pilot programs around the \ncountry, mental health courts have begun to help local communities take \nsteps toward effectively addressing the issues raised by the mentally \nill in our justice system, and these steps must continue. The \nlegislation that we are introducing today will help do that. Our bill \nwould establish a Federal grant program to help States and localities \ndevelop mental health courts in their jurisdictions. These courts are \nspecialized courts with separate dockets. They hear cases exclusively \ninvolving nonviolent offenses committed by individuals with a mental \nillness. Fundamentally, mental health courts enable State and local \ncourts to offer alternative sentences or alternatives to prosecution \nfor those offenders who could be served best by mental health services. \nThese courts are designed to address the historic lack of coordination \nbetween local law enforcement and social service systems and bring them \ntogether to work within the criminal justice system.\n  To deal with the separate needs of mentally ill offenders, these \nmental health courts are staffed by a core group of specialized \nprofessionals, including a dedicated judge, prosecutor, public \ndefender, and court liaison to the mental health services community. \nThe courts promote efficiency and consistency by centrally managing all \noutstanding cases involving a mentally ill defendant referred to the \nmental health court.\n  Mental health court judges decide whether or not to hear each case \nreferred to them. The courts only deal with defendants deemed mentally \nill by qualified mental health professionals or the mental health court \njudge. Similarly, participation in the court by the mentally ill is \nvoluntary; however, once the defendant volunteers for the Mental Health \nCourt, he or she is expected to follow the decision of the court.\n\n  For instance, in any given case, the mental health court judge, \nattorneys, and health services liaison may all agree on a plan of \ntreatment as an alternative sentence or in lieu of prosecution. The \ndefendant must adhere strictly to this court-imposed treatment plan. \nThe court must then provide supervision, and quickly deal with any \nfailure. This way, the court can quickly deal with any failure of the \ndefendant to fulfill the treatment plan obligations. The mental health \ncourts provide supervision of participants that is more intensive than \nmight otherwise be available, with an emphasis on accountability and \nmonitoring the participant's performance. In this sense, the mental \nheath courts function similarly to drug courts.\n  Offenders with a mental illness who choose to have their cases heard \nin a mental health court often do so because that is the first real \nopportunity that many of these people have to seek treatment. A \njudicial program offering the possibility of effective treatment--\nrather than jail time--gives a measure of hope and a chance for \nrehabilitation to these defendants.\n  The successes of mental health courts are encouraging and show that \nwe can improve the health and safety of our communities through these \nprograms. In Ohio, the Alcohol, Drug and Mental Health Services Board \nwhich serves Athens, Hocking and Vinton Counties, began operating its \nprogram on August 2003 after receiving a mental health court grant \nunder the original America's Law Enforcement and Mental Health Project \nAct. Success stories from this program are numerous, but let me focus \non one individual here. D.L. is a 53 year old man who struggled with \nBipolar Disorder for years. Arrested for trespassing in 2003, D.L. was \nthe ideal candidate for the Mental Health Court. Having completed \nindividual counseling, and never missing a single psychiatric \nappointment, D.L. completed the program last May. He is now viewed as a \npotential mentor for other program participants.\n  Many jurisdictions across America have established mental health \ncourts as a result of the program that we established four years ago. \nOur Nation's communities are trying desperately to find the best way to \ncope with the problems associated with mental illness. Law enforcement \nagencies and correctional facilities remain challenged by difficulties \nposed by mental illnesses.\n  Mental health courts offer a solution.\n  Mental health courts have shown great success, and we must ensure \ntheir continuation. Our Nation has long been enriched by the dual \nideals of compassion and justice, and these programs are a wonderful \nembodiment of both ideals. I urge my colleagues to join in support of \nthis important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 289\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       Section 1001(a)(20) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control \n     and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3793(a)(20)) is \n     amended by striking ``fiscal years 2001 through 2004'' and \n     inserting ``fiscal years 2006 through 2011''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Talent, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Vitter, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Nelson of Florida, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 290. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom gross income certain hazard mitigation assistance; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nconcerning a critical issue that affects many States--disaster \nassistance. Last year was one of the worst hurricane seasons that \nFlorida had seen in recent years. The Sunshine State was battered by \nfour hurricanes in a six week period. Many residents of Florida had to \nevacuate more than three times during last year's hurricane season only \nto return home and find their homes leveled, their crops uprooted, \ntheir neighborhoods flooded, and their dreams shattered.\n  In my home State of Missouri, we are no strangers to natural \ndisasters. Located smack in the middle of Tornado Alley, Missouri has \nbeen hit by some of the largest storms in U.S. history. In May of 2003, \na string of tornadoes ripped through the western part of the state \ncausing major damage and devastation.\n  With two big rivers--the Mississippi and the Missouri--we have also \nseen our fair share of flooding through the years, including flash \nflooding. I will never forget when the Mississippi River breached its \nbanks in 1993--one of the most devastating floods in U.S. history. Of \nthe nine Midwestern States affected, the State of Missouri was the \nhardest hit and State officials estimate that damages totaled $3 \nbillion.\n  One specific example of the benefits of disaster mitigation in flash-\nflood situations comes to mind when I think of the City of Union, \nlocated about 45 minutes from St. Louis, where many of the residents \nsuffered tremendous damage from a severe flash flood in May of 2000. \nAfter the flood, the City of Union applied to the State of Missouri \nEmergency Management Agency to seek help in a demolition and \nacquisition project. With the mitigation grant money, 17 properties \nwere acquired in residential areas with substantial damage. These \nproperties are now deed restricted for ``open space,'' which will \nprevent future development and the potential for flash flood related \ndeaths in that area because many of the homes and people will no longer \nbe in harm's way. This is an excellent example of the value of disaster \nand mitigation money invested by the Federal, State and local \ngovernments.\n  The disaster mitigation program has also been used to provide grant \nmoney to an individual, as opposed to a municipality. In some \ninstances, these homeowners may be located in areas highly susceptible \nto tornadoes. Often\n\n[[Page S990]]\n\ntimes, disaster mitigation grants have been issued to individual \nhomeowners enabling them to build storm shelters underneath their \nhomes, ultimately saving lives.\n  Over the years, the State of Missouri has worked with the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency (FEMA) to build structures that prevent \nflooding and other damage from occurring when natural disasters strike. \nTime and time again, FEMA has come to the rescue by establishing \nfunding for disaster relief and mitigation activities within the State \nof Missouri and in other states across the country.\n  Having served as the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nSubcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies, which until recently \noversaw FEMA, I know first hand the value of the agency's disaster \nmitigation grant programs--the Hazards Mitigation Grant Program (HGMP), \nthe Pre-Disaster Mitigation program (PDM), and the Flood Mitigation \nAssistance (FMA) program. Designed to manage future emergencies, these \nprograms have been essential to countless communities, and without \nthem, thousands of lives would be in jeopardy.\n  Last Congress, some very disturbing news was brought to my attention. \nAccording to a June 2004 legal memorandum issued by the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS), FEMA mitigation grants may be subject to income \ntaxation. While some may argue that this is merely the IRS's \ninterpretation of the statute, it is clearly the position the IRS \nintends to take against American taxpayers whose only recourse will be \nto fight the agency in court.\n  Let me tell you what this means for the American taxpayer. In my \nexample of Union, Missouri, it is the individuals whose homes have been \npurchased by the city who ultimately will be forced to pay taxes on the \nproceeds of the buyout. For the homeowner building a storm shelter with \ngrant money, he or she might be taxed upon receipt of the grant.\n  I must say that I am absolutely stunned by this determination by the \nIRS!! How in the world could the IRS possibly think that Congress \nintended to tax these types of grants to prevent natural disasters, \nespecially when we went out of our way to ensure that disaster-relief \npayments to individuals recovering from a hurricane, flood, tornado or \nother natural disaster are not subject to income taxes?\n  Today, I am offering a bill that will stop the IRS in its tracks and \nprevent the taxation of disaster mitigation grants. This language will \nensure that any federal grants to construct or modify property to \nmitigate future disaster damage will not be deemed to be income by the \nIRS's tortured reasoning. This bill will ensure that any grants \ncurrently out there, especially in light of the current hurricanes that \nhave happened, are not subject to tax. In addition, there should be no \ninference by this legislation that Congress intended such grants to be \ntaxable prior to the effective date of this legislation.\n  Why is this important? Why am I out here today? Because the Missouri \nand Mississippi Rivers rise, because tornadoes will ravage through the \nstate once again, and because flash flooding can decimate an entire \ncommunity. The last thing Americans who are working to prevent such \npotential destruction need is for government-grant funding to be \nsubject to tax. My bill ensures that such taxes do not see the light of \nday.\n  I thank the original cosponsors of this bill, Senators Talent, \nInhofe, Vitter, Conrad, Landrieu, and Nelson, for their support, and I \nurge my other colleagues to join us. Finally, Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the bill and a letter from the Stafford Act \nCoalition be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 290\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXCLUSION FROM GROSS INCOME FOR CERTAIN DISASTER \n                   MITIGATION PAYMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 139 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to disaster relief payments) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(g) Certain Disaster Mitigation Payments.--Gross income \n     shall not include the value of any amount received directly \n     or indirectly as payment or benefit by the owner of any \n     property for hazard mitigation with respect to the property \n     pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \n     Emergency Assistance Act or the National Flood Insurance \n     Act.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years ending on or after December 31, \n     2004.\n                                  ____\n\n     Hon. Christopher ``Kit'' Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: The undersigned organizations are \n     writing to you as members of the Stafford Act Coalition to \n     support your legislation to prevent taxation of federal \n     assistance given to disaster victims for mitigation of future \n     disasters. The Stafford Act Coalition represents a wide \n     variety of groups interested in mitigation activities and has \n     been the leading coalition working with Congress on issues \n     related to disaster mitigation for over five years. This bill \n     would make clear that federal disaster mitigation funds \n     should not be taxable. Additionally, this legislation has \n     implications for upcoming hazard mitigation deadlines \n     associated with the disaster aid packages for recent \n     hurricanes and also for tax returns for 2004 that taxpayers \n     will begin filing in January 2005. We believe urgent action \n     must be taken on this bill as soon as possible, especially \n     given the dramatic disasters that the nation has faced in the \n     last year.\n       The Internal Revenue Service issued a ruling on June 29, \n     2004 finding that disaster mitigation funds are taxable as \n     income when used to reduce private property damage. Up until \n     this ruling, disaster victims who took advantage of \n     mitigation opportunities to prevent future losses were not \n     taxed by the federal government. This recent ruling will \n     create a disincentive that will discourage disaster victims \n     from taking advantage of steps to reduce the costs of future \n     disasters, protect property and prevent the loss of lives. \n     With so many open presidentially declared disasters, the \n     matter requires immediate reversal and clarification by \n     Congress.\n       Your legislation would resolve the problems created by \n     taxing mitigation assistance. According to the Department of \n     the Treasury, some state and local governments are already \n     reporting that disaster victims are declining assistance \n     because the assistance will be taxable. As a result, the \n     National Flood Insurance Fund and the Disaster Relief Fund \n     will continue to be burdened by losses that may have been \n     preventable with appropriate mitigation.\n       The active, on-going mitigation programs involved are all \n     administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     (FEMA), now part of the Department of Homeland Security \n     (DHS). These programs include the Flood Mitigation Assistance \n     Program (FMA), the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program (PDM) and \n     the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). The long term \n     benefits of mitigation include avoidance or minimization of \n     public expenditures for recovery. The federal government's \n     disaster mitigation programs were established as well-\n     conceived public policy to promote public safety, reduce loss \n     of life and reduce the costs to the taxpayers of disaster \n     response, especially repetitive disaster response. While \n     individual property owners may end up less vulnerable to \n     future damage, which the IRS determined to be equivalent to \n     income, projects are by regulation or statute required to be \n     cost-effective to the federal interest. Reducing damage to \n     private property will reduce use of the casualty loss \n     deduction which is a direct loss to the federal treasury. \n     Mitigation lessens the economic impact of disasters by \n     keeping businesses functioning and diminishing the effects on \n     local economies and jobs.\n       Disaster mitigation programs assist citizens, businesses, \n     and communities to take such steps as elevating buildings in \n     floodplains, flood proofing, seismic reinforcement, \n     acquisitions or relocations, wind protections for roofs and \n     strengthening of window protections. It is contradictory to \n     put in place such programs which not only protect individual \n     properties, but surrounding properties and infrastructure and \n     then tax the individual property owner on this ``benefit'' \n     which extends well beyond that individual property owner. \n     Generally, what is taxable income for federal purposes is \n     also considered taxable income for state tax purposes, \n     increasing the adverse impact of the IRS ruling.\n       If the federal government wishes its disaster mitigation \n     programs to truly reduce future losses, it must act to ensure \n     that mitigation funds are not taxed as income. The \n     undersigned groups understand that any mention of claiming \n     mitigation grant funds as income is certain to discourage \n     property owners and local governments from considering the \n     mitigation opportunities provided through the FMA, PDM and \n     HMGP programs. We urge you to find the earliest possible \n     opportunity to clarify the law. We hope to work with you to \n     ensure the immediate passage of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n       The Stafford Act Coalition, American Planning Association, \n     American Public Works Association, Association of State Flood \n     Plain Managers, Council of State Governments, International \n     Association of Emergency Managers, National Association of \n     Development Organizations, National Association of Flood and \n     Stormwater Agencies, National Emergency Management \n     Association, National League of Cities, National\n\n[[Page S991]]\n\n     Rural Electric Cooperative Association, National Wildlife \n     Federation.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, in Louisiana, hurricanes and floods are \nas much a part of life as crawfish boils and Mardi Gras. Twenty percent \nof the coastal zone of my State lies below sea level, including 80 \npercent of our largest city New Orleans. Because of this our State has \none of the finest and extensive levee systems in the world. Our \ncommunities have well developed flood plain management plans. We have \nbuilt flood walls to protect neighborhoods from rising waters and \nhomeowners in flood zones have built their houses on stilts.\n  Even with all of this preparation, flood damage does occur. It is \nestimated that Louisiana suffered more than $47 million in losses from \nflooding in 2003. To address this, 377,000 property owners participate \nin the National Flood Insurance Program--a program that is a real \ngodsend to the people of my State. This program is fully financed by \ninsurance premiums paid by property owners to cover damage to their \nhomes and businesses as a result of flooding. The program also provides \nfunding for property owners to flood-proof their homes under the \nmitigation grant program. They can use these grants to put their homes \non stilts, improve drainage, and obtain waterproofing materials.\n  All the people in my state ask for is a warning and an opportunity to \nprotect themselves, their homes, and their loved ones from these \ndisasters. Through the state-of-the-art systems developed by the \nNational Weather Service, we can get a warning about a hurricane. We \nhave sophisticated radar to track these storms as they move through the \nGulf of Mexico, or up the East Coast. When a Category 4 is coming we \ncan prepare and pray.\n  But they did not have any warning that the Federal government--more \nspecifically the IRS--would begin to tax the money they received to \nprevent damages to their property from hurricanes and floods. Yet that \nhas not stopped the IRS from making and implementing one of the most \nmisguided and unfair decisions.\n  Let me be clear about what this has meant for people in my State. I \nheard from one man who told me that he was going to be liable for tax \non an additional $218,000 in income for grant money used to do \nmitigation work on his home. He said he would have to work until he was \n90 years old in order to pay off the tax bill.\n  What is worse, is that this misguided decision by the IRS will hit \nall natural disaster mitigation assistance covered by the Pre-Disaster \nMitigation Program, the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, and the \nNational Flood Insurance Programs. Instead of protecting their \nproperties, the IRS decision will force people to take risks that they \nwill not be hit by a disaster.\n  I applaud my colleague from Missouri for introducing this legislation \nto fix this problem and I am proud to be an original cosponsor. This is \nnot a regional, special-interest bill. Natural disasters can strike \nalmost anywhere at any time. If your citizens have used a federal \nprogram to help make their property safer, the tax man will come for \nthem too. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 296. A bill to authorize appropriations for the Hollings \nManufacturing Extension Partnership Program, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today with \nSenator Snowe to reauthorize funding for the Hollings Manufacturing \nExtension Partnership. This successful Commerce Department program, \nbased in the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is a \nnationwide network of Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership \nCenters working with small- and medium-sized manufacturers in all 50 \nStates. These local centers have played a critical role in helping our \nmanufacturers turn out the most advanced products, using cutting edge \ntechnology and processes, to prevent these firms from being forced out \nof the global marketplace.\n  My State of Wisconsin is a great manufacturing State. Small- and \nmedium-sized manufacturers and a few larger concerns make us the State \neconomy most dependent on manufacturing--save Indiana. Thus, I am \nkeenly aware of the devastating job losses experienced by American \nmanufacturers. In Wisconsin alone, we lost more than 90,000 \nmanufacturing jobs over the last four years.\n  While 2004 brought encouraging news in which we saw a net gain of 3.1 \npercent or 15,400 manufacturing jobs in my State, this pace of economic \ngrowth will never bring us back to where we were before.\n  That is why I am committed to doing all I can to help our \nmanufacturers. And that is why I am such a strong supporter of the MEP \nprogram, one of the only Federal programs which has provided tangible \nassistance to the manufacturing sector to help companies stay in \nbusiness and retain jobs. The MEP program served 18,422 manufacturers \nin fiscal year 2003 alone, and over the life of the program has \nassisted more than 184,000 firms across the Nation.\n  MEP's top areas of assistance are process improvement, quality \ninspection, business system and management, human resources, plant \nlayout and manufacturing cells and product development. MEP streamlines \noperations, integrates new technologies, shortens production times and \nlowers costs, leading to improved efficiency by offering resources to \nmanufacturers, including organized workshops and consulting projects. \nMEP removes the drag on profits and maximizes the potential of our \nmanufacturing firms.\n  Wisconsin is the home to two MEP centers which have both had a \nsignificant impact on the productivity of companies throughout the \nState. Since 1996, Wisconsin MEP has helped over 1,300 Wisconsin \nmanufacturers improve their productivity and profitability. Over that \ntime WMEP customers have reported a positive impact of nearly $400 \nmillion in improvements attributable to the assistance provided by MEP. \nAnd, since 1994, the Northwest Wisconsin Manufacturing Outreach Center, \ntargeting the more rural northwestern part of the State, has provided \nover 3,189 technical assistance activities to over 942 companies, \ncreated or retained 1,979 jobs, and achieved client-reported impacts of \nover $132 million.\n  One of the novel aspects of the MEP program is that it is a Federal-\nState-private partnership. Federal funding leverages State and private \nfunding. Manufacturers pay reduced fees for the services and States \nmatch the Federal funding. In many cases, the Federal component is only \none-third of the funding for the program.\n  Although the MEP program has broad bipartisan support, with 55 \nsenators writing a letter in support of the program last year, we have \nhad to struggle in recent years to ensure that MEP centers receive the \nfunding they deserve. In the last two years, the Administration has \nproposed deep reductions in the program that would have forced MEP \ncenters around the country to close. In fiscal year 2004, despite \nSenate support for full funding for the MEP Program, funding was \nreduced by 60 percent from $106 million to $39.6 million. As a result, \n58 MEP centers closed and staff was reduced by 15 percent. Working with \nseveral other Senators, we succeeded in having amendments adopted on \nthe fiscal year 2005 Defense authorization and appropriations bills to \npermit and direct the Commerce Department to reprogram unobligated \nfunds to the MEP program in fiscal year 2004 to keep the MEP network \nintact. Fortunately, in the fiscal year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations \nbill, MEP received $109 million and was renamed the Hollings MEP \nprogram, in recognition of the strong support Senator Hollings gave \nthis program during his tenure in the Senate.\n  Next week the President will be sending us his proposed budget for \nfiscal year 2006. I am deeply concerned at reports that indicate that \nthe Administration intends to propose yet again to cut this vital \nprogram. We have introduced this legislation today as a sign that there \ncontinues to be bipartisan support for the Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership. I hope that these reports were incorrect and that the \nAdministration recognizes that we cannot abandon our small- and medium-\nsized manufacturers. They are the key to economic growth, good paying \njobs, and a healthy balance of trade.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S992]]\n\n                                 S. 296\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, after the first complete week that we have \nbeen in session, looking back over the last several days, we have had a \nproductive week. Today, we confirmed Judge Alberto Gonzales as U.S. \nAttorney General. I talked to him a few moments ago. As we heard from \nso many, Judge Gonzales is an outstanding choice to lead the Justice \nDepartment. In that phone call, I had the opportunity to congratulate \nhim and to express my optimistic anticipation of working with him in \nwhat I know will be a very productive and important several years.\n  From very humble beginnings in Humble, TX, he has climbed to those \nhighest peaks, in Government and law. As friend and fellow Texan Henry \nCisneros attests, Judge Gonzales has a personal story that allows him \nto understand the realities so many Americans face in their everyday \nlives.\n  A former Texas Supreme Court Justice, over the last 4 years as White \nHouse Counsel to the President, Judge Gonzales is eminently qualified \nto be our Nation's top law enforcement officer.\n  Candid and thoughtful and always a straight shooter, for him the law \nis the law--exactly what is needed for this high post. I am confident \nhe will serve with distinction and with honor. I applaud his \nconfirmation.\n  In addition to confirming Judge Gonzales, we passed the Family \nEntertainment and Copyright Act of 2005 this week. It didn't get a lot \nof fanfare, but this new legislation is another very important tool to \nhelp families protect their children from violent and explicit movie \ncontent. We have the V-chip, and we have television ratings. Now \nparents will have even more ways to stop inappropriate images from \ncoming into and flooding their homes.\n  As Senator Hatch, the lead sponsor of this bill, says, parents, not \nHollywood, should decide what kids see today.\n  The bill also provides a uniform Federal law to help crack down on \ninternational piracy, which is a huge problem in a creative industry.\n  I mention that, in part, because I am from a part of the country in \nTennessee that has a rich music tradition, extending from the Grand Ole \nOpry to the Country Music Hall of Fame. From Elvis Presley to Johnny \nCash, throughout Tennessee, artists and musicians have shaped popular \nmusic the world over.\n  Their contributions deserve to be celebrated. But they also deserve \nto be protected. That is what this legislation does. The legislation \nwill help stop the Internet theft that threatens this creative industry \nand, indeed, the creative arts more broadly.\n  I thank Senator Orrin Hatch, Senator Patrick Leahy, Senator John \nCornyn, who is occupying the Chair, and Senator Dianne Feinstein for \ntheir hard work on this important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S993-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL WEAR RED DAY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a final note, tomorrow, February 4--I \nmention this because we will not be in session tomorrow--is called \nNational Wear Red Day. So I put my red tie on a little bit earlier, and \nI will be wearing it tomorrow because tomorrow all across the country \nmen and women will be wearing this red color of dress, or pant suit, or \ntie, or maybe jackets, all to raise awareness for heart disease in \nwomen.\n  A lot of people do not realize that this year more women will die of \nheart disease than men. People think heart disease, unfortunately, is a \nmen's disease. More women will die of heart disease than men. It is \ntrue this year, last year, the year before that--all the way back to \n1984. It is a fact.\n  Last week, I had the pleasure of joining WomenHeart, which is the \nNation's only patient advocacy organization for women with heart \ndisease. I shared my experiences with them as a heart surgeon, as a \nheart and lung transplant surgeon, and the importance of awareness of \nearly detection and prevention and treatment.\n  It is not a ``man's disease'' and it is not an ``elderly disease.'' \nIt is a disease that affects all people. There are over 8 million women \nnationwide who have heart disease right this very second. That is more \nthan the number of women--if you added them together--in New York, Los \nAngeles, and Chicago.\n  Women who experience heart problems--it is interesting--die at a \nhigher rate after their first heart attack than men. So you have a man \nand woman, they both have a heart attack, but the woman is more likely \nto die of a heart attack. We don't know exactly why that is the case, \nwhich is one of the things we need to continue to investigate.\n  In my own State of Tennessee, the death rate for women with heart \ndisease is 70 percent higher than men.\n  These are the sorts of observations of phenomena that need to be even \nmore aggressively investigated. And part of wearing red tomorrow is \nthis awareness--the necessity of research, the focus on prevention and \ndiagnosis of heart disease in women.\n  We have made huge strides in treating heart disease in women.\n  In January, the American Cancer Society released its annual \nstatistical report, citing that mortality rates for heart disease are \ndropping dramatically. I am encouraged by this news. But we can't be \ncomplacent. Heart disease is still the second leading cause of death in \nthe United States.\n  While we can't control our genes--which is a large predeterminant--we \ncan eat a healthy diet, get active, stay in shape, absolutely stop \nsmoking, and reduce stress in our daily lives.\n  Those are all the controllable variables which we know can have a \ndramatic impact on improving quality of life, if you have heart \ndisease, or avoiding heart disease altogether. If we live by these very \nsimple principles, we can live a healthier life and have a more \noptimistic outlook on life.\n  In celebration of National Wear Red Day, in the spirit of the Heart \nTruth Campaign, I call upon each and every American to take action--\ntake charge of your health and this Friday wear red.\n  I actually have a little pin on as well that has a red dress. You \nwill see a lot of women wearing red dresses tomorrow.\n  By encouraging awareness, you will help women across the country--\nmothers, daughters, sisters, and friends--to learn the facts about this \ndeadly disease.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S994-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S994]]\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair, on behalf of the Democratic leader, \nafter consultation with the members of the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions, and the Committee on Aging, pursuant to \nPublic Law 100-175, as amended by Public Laws 102-375, 103-171, and \n106-501, appoints the following individual as a member of the Policy \nCommittee to the White House Conference on Aging: the Honorable Harry \nReid of Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Every 10 years, the President convenes a White House \nConference on Aging--WHCoA. It conducts extensive work to understand \nand develop policy recommendations on issues of critical importance to \nour seniors.\n  The WHCoA is made up of a Policy Committee recommended by Congress \nand the President from the public and private sector. The work of the \ncommittee culminates in the October WHCoA which will be attended by \n12,000 delegates and other officials. The theme of this year's \nconference, ``The Booming Dynamics of Aging: From Awareness to Action'' \nwill deal with a broad range of issues from workplace opportunities for \nolder workers to health care and access to affordable prescription \ndrugs.\n  Following the October meeting, WHCoA formulates a series of policy \nrecommendations for Congress and the President.\n  Senator Daschle was gracious enough to place me on the policy \ncommittee because of my strong interest in the topics it would \nconsider. Many of those issues are of critical importance to Nevadans. \nIn particular, I assumed a position on the Health and Long Living \nSubcommittee because its work will focus on access to care and \naffordable prescription drugs, disease prevention and quality of care.\n  Today, I have decided to pass the torch of this important post to my \nfriend and colleague, Thomas E. Gallagher. These issues are near to his \nheart. Tom will be an important voice on the WHCoA for Nevadans and all \nAmericans.\n  Tom's extensive private sector experience will be a great asset to \nthe conference as it works to formulate recommendations to Congress. \nThrough his work as chief executive officer--CEO--chief administrative \nofficer and general counsel of several Fortune 500 Companies, Tom \nbecame intimately familiar with the health care challenges facing the \nbusiness community.\n  For example, as President and CEO of Park Place Entertainment--now \nCaesars Entertainment--Mr. Gallagher reached a historic contract with \nNevada's Culinary Union resulting in fully paid health care and free \nprescription drugs for employees, as well as retiree benefits for \nseniors.\n  Prior to his corporate management work, Tom was a partner in Gibson, \nDunn & Crutcher, specializing in corporate finance, mergers and \nacquisitions. He graduated magna cum laude from the College of Holy \nCross in Worchester, MA in 1966. He graduated from Harvard Law School \nwith honors in 1969 and was the Editor-in-Chief of the Harvard Journal \non Legislation.\n  I plan to work closely with Tom as he works on the WHCoA on meetings \nto help ensure that the issues and view of Nevadans are explored in the \nlistening sessions, solution meetings and other WHCoA events.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/03/senate-section/article/S994-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
