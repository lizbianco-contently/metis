Mr. President, I rise this morning to clear up the \napparent confusion and misinformation surrounding the confirmation of \njudicial nominations.\n  I hope to shed some light on one of our most important obligations \nand express to the American people the truth about the partisan \nobstruction of our constitutional duties.\n  Article II of the Constitution, known as the advice and consent \nclause, requires Senate approval of judicial nominations. This \nobligation is only\n\n[[Page S4140]]\n\nfulfilled when the Senate allows an up or down vote on a nominee.\n  The vote acts as an expression of the body's ``advice and consent,'' \nbut this expression simply cannot occur if it is blocked by a \nfilibuster.\n  I strongly believe that the use of a filibuster to block judicial \nnominations is not only unprecedented minority obstruction but an \nattack on the Constitution itself.\n  The decision to vote on a judicial nomination or to obstruct the \nnominee pits the Constitution against a mere tool of parliamentary \nprocedure; that is the Constitution versus a Senate rule called the \nfilibuster.\n  I urge my colleagues to put our faith in the founding document, not a \nfilibuster rule. To do otherwise degrades the Constitution and \nrelegates it to the level of an arbitrary rule of procedure. Let me \nmake it clear.\n  I am not going to stand idly by as parliamentary maneuvers run \nroughshod over the Constitution and centuries of Senate practices.\n  The Republican majority is not establishing new precedent. We are \nsimply trying to restore the rights of the Constitution and the \npractices that this body has observed for over 200 years.\n  If the Senate allows the filibusters of judicial nominations to \ncontinue, it will be acquiescing in a minority's unilateral change to \nSenate procedure and practices; requiring 60 votes for the confirmation \nof judges through the rules, undermining the Constitution's requirement \nfor a 50-vote majority.\n  The practical effect is an amendment to the Constitution without the \napproval of the American people.\n  My colleagues on the other side would have everyone believe that the \nfilibuster is being eliminated. But that simply is not the case.\n  They don't mention that the filibuster never existed on judicial \nnominations. In fact, it never existed until the Democrats broke with \nover 200 years of Senate procedure and unleashed the filibuster last \nCongress to block 10 judges.\n  It was not a usual way of doing business. It was the first time in \nthe history of the Senate the filibuster was used. The Democrats want \nto have it both ways. They want to change the history of the Senate by \nblocking judges with the filibuster, rewrite the Constitution by using \nthe filibuster to thwart the advice and consent clause, and then blame \nRepublicans for simply saying, ``let's follow the Constitution and \nallow votes on judges, lets follow Senate tradition.''\n  They falsely portray our actions to preserve the advice and consent \nclause as something akin to minority persecution.\n  But what they don't mention is that the filibuster is not a law. It \nis not in the Constitution. In fact, the Founding Fathers didn't even \nenvision a filibuster weapon at all.\n  Even more astonishing is the fact that several of the Democrats who \nare now ardent supporters of the judicial filibuster are the same ones \nwho tried to eliminate the filibuster entirely just a few years ago, \nnot only on judicial nominations but on everything, including \nlegislative actions.\n  It is the Democrats who are altering history. It is the Democrats who \nare unleashing a weapon that threatens to alter the traditions and \nprecedent of the Senate.\n  It is the Democrats who are revising the history of our Founding \nFathers and undermining the three branches of our separate but equal \nsystem of Government.\n  For example, from 1789 until 1806 the Senate had a traditional \n``motion for the previous question'' in its rules. There was no \nintention to create a Senate where a filibuster was prominent. The \nfilibuster was not used in any significant way at all until the 1840's, \nand it was never used for judicial nominations.\n  The Senate's original cloture rule, in 1917, did not even apply to \nnominations because no Senator had ever used a filibuster to block a \nnomination.\n  Let me repeat that, up until 1917 the Senate's original cloture rule \ndidn't even apply to nominations because no Senator had ever used a \nfilibuster to block a nomination.\n  The rule did not apply, not because the Senate approved of such \nfilibusters but because Senators never contemplated them.\n  A thorough examination of Senate history clearly demonstrates that \nthere is no precedent for the Democrats' use of the filibuster to \npermanently block the confirmation of judicial nominations.\n  Some Democrats claim that Republicans want to destroy the filibuster \nfor all matters. This is simply not true.\n  What is true is that the only sitting Members of the Senate on record \nsupporting the elimination of the filibuster are Democrats.\n  In 1995, 19 Senators all Democrats, not one Republican, voted to \neliminate the filibuster for all matters, not only judicial but also \nlegislature. Nine of the 19 Democrats who voted for the Harkin-\nLieberman rule change remain in this body today.\n  And all of those Senators now support the filibustering of judicial \nnominations. If it was ok to end the filibuster rule in 1995, why is it \nnot ok today?\n  Let me just share some of the comments made by those Democratic \nSenators in 1995:\n\n       For too long, we have accepted the premise that the \n     filibuster rule is immune. Yet, Mr. President, there is no \n     constitutional basis for it. We impose it on ourselves. And \n     if I may say so respectfully, it is, in its way, inconsistent \n     with the Constitution, one might almost say an amendment of \n     the Constitution by the rules of the U.S. Senate.\n\n  The Democrats also said:\n\n       [A] filibuster ought to be used to slow down, temper \n     legislation, alert the public, change minds, but should not \n     be used as a measure whereby a small minority can totally \n     keep the majority from voting on the merits of a bill.\n\n  Now 10 years later, evidently what is good for the goose can forget \nabout the gander.\n  Turning to the issue of Senate rules, the Democrats claim that \nchanging the rules of the Senate is unprecedented, that using the \nConstitution to end the filibuster is tyranny.\n  Again, let me point out another instance where the goose has left the \ngander.\n  The constitutional option is grounded in Article I, Section 5 of the \nU.S. Constitution that empowers the Senate to ``determine the Rules of \nits Proceedings.''\n  The Senate has repeatedly exercised the constitutional option to \ndefine minority rights, as long ago as 1977, and it has done so in a \nDemocratic-led majority.\n  The use of a simple majority vote to set precedents is as old as the \nSenate. In fact, the constitutional option has been exercised in 1977, \n1979, 1980, and 1987.\n  It was used in 1977 to end post-cloture filibusters; in 1979 to limit \namendments to appropriations bills; in 1980 to govern consideration of \nnominations; and again in 1987 to govern voting procedures.\n  In every instance, the Senate acted independently of the Senate rules \nin order to change Senate procedures in the face of obstruction or \nabuse by a minority of Senators.\n  History clearly shows that it is the constitutional option that has \nbeen used before. It is the use of the filibuster that is an \nunprecedented expansion of minority obstruction.\n  An exercise of the constitutional option under the current \ncircumstances would return the Senate to the historic and \nconstitutional confirmation standard of a simple majority for all \njudicial nominations.\n  Employing the constitutional option here would have no effect on the \nlegislative filibuster, ant this is very important. Senators would \nstill have the ability to filibuster any bill, any time.\n  The Constitution calls upon the Senate collectively to determine \nwhether or not a particular nominee is qualified to serve. This \ndetermination is made in one vote, the approval or disapproval of the \nnomination itself. Advice and consent does not mean avoiding a vote on \na judicial nominee entirely by employing a filibuster.\n  If a Member of the Senate disapproves of a judge, then let them vote \nagainst the nominee.\n  But a filibuster should never be used to deprive the people of the \nchoice selected by their elected representatives.\n  It is the Senate's duty to collectively participate in a show of \n``advice and consent'' to the President by voting. It is this act that \nexercises what James Madison referred to as the remote choice of the \npeople.\n  I sincerely hope we can work through the impasse on judicial \nnominations.\n\n[[Page S4141]]\n\n  I hope those opposed to the President's nominees will be given the \nopportunity to vote against them and that they will speak their mind \nabout it.\n  But I also hope that we will be allowed to provide the guidance we \nare required to provide under the Constitution.\n  The basic decision the Senate must make is this: Either \nconstitutional advice and consent prevails or the filibuster is allowed \nto change the Constitution. I believe in the Constitution. I believe we \nshould vote on the nominations.\n  As I have said so many times before, ``vote them up, or vote them \ndown, but just vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, the Senator from Colorado talked about \nthe ongoing conversation with respect to the filibuster in the Senate. \nIf I may, I would like to reminisce for a little while because I have \nsomething of a history in the Senate. I have clearly not been here \nnearly as long as many of my colleagues, but I first came into this \nChamber when I was a teenager. My father was a Senator. I was a summer \nintern in his office. I suppose there was something strange about me as \na teenager because I was more interested in the Senate than I was in \nsports or cars, the two subjects that young boys are supposed to be \npaying attention to.\n  I remember sitting in the family gallery one evening listening to the \ndebates. In those days, there were debates. There was not the situation \nwe find now where Senators come to the floor to posture for the \ntelevision cameras. They came to the floor to have a clash of ideas. I \nremember a particular debate where a Senator on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle was holding forth. He seemed to be winning the argument and \nthe Senators on the Republican side of the aisle sent up the call for \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, who entered the back of the \nChamber. I remember the Democratic Senator saying, I see the \nRepublicans have brought up their heavy artillery. Then there was an \nexchange between these two Senators which the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee clearly won.\n  The Democratic Senator got a little flustered and a little angry at \nbeing bested in the debate and so he started to complain about the fact \nthat Colorado, a small State, had as many Senators as Illinois, the big \nState, which he represented. Whereupon the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee from Colorado then said, the Senator is no longer opposed to \nthe bill. He is now opposed to the Constitution. I must say, I am not \nsurprised. And he turned on his heel and walked out and the debate was \nover. It was an exciting thing to watch for those of us who were \npolitical junkies.\n  We have come a long way from that. I don't think it is a long way \nforward. We have come a long way from the give and take of debate into \nan atmosphere where this Senate has become the platform for people to \nexpress harsh views, strong political rhetoric, and occasionally, in my \nview, go over the line of that which is appropriate. We have become a \nsounding board for partisanship rather than a deliberative body for \ndebate.\n  I am not quite sure when we started in that direction or what brought \nus from that old time to this present time. One of the moments might \nhave been the debate over the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme \nCourt. Robert Bork is the only nominee I know of whose name has turned \ninto a verb. We now hear groups, as they talk about a nominee, say \n``we're going to Bork him.'' Look back at what was done with respect to \nthe nomination of Robert Bork and it was nothing short of character \nassassination; or, to use a phrase that was popular in the last \nadministration, the politics of personal destruction.\n  We have seen that activity poison the comity of the Senate on both \nsides of the aisle because when it was done to Robert Bork on behalf of \nthose who were opposed to the nomination made by President Reagan, \nthose who were Reagan supporters began to say, we will do the same \nthing. When Democratic Presidents came along, their nominees began to \nbe attacked on a personal basis rather than on the merits of the \nsituation, much as Robert Bork had been. Now it becomes a standard \ntactic on both sides of the aisle.\n  Why do I raise that with respect to the controversy over whether the \nSenate has the right by majority vote to change its rules? I raise it \nbecause too much of the current debate over that question has gone in \nthe direction of ``Borking''--Senators on both sides of the aisle, the \nprocess on both sides of the aisle and, if you will, the institution \nitself.\n  I have great reverence for this institution and I am distressed at \nwhat I see as I look over the landscape with respect to this particular \ndebate. I see on one side e-mails and press releases saying we must \nstop George W. Bush from packing the courts with right-wing whackos. \nThat is what this debate is about. The filibuster is our tool to \nprevent right-wing whackos from getting on the court.\n  The first circuit court judge ever prevented from gaining a vote by \nvirtue of the filibuster in the history of the American Republic was a \nman named Miguel Estrada. Miguel Estrada is an immigrant to this \ncountry. He came here not speaking English. He graduated from the \nHarvard Law School as the editor of the Harvard Law Review. He served \nin the Justice Department under the first President Bush in the \nSolicitor's Office and received glowing recommendations and reports \nfrom every one of his superiors. Indeed, his performance was \nsufficiently outstanding that he remained in the Justice Department in \nthe Solicitor's Office for 2 years while Janet Reno was the Attorney \nGeneral. Janet Reno is not known for harboring right-wing whackos.\n  The American Bar Association gave him their highest recommendation \nfor this position and they are not known for harboring right-wing \nwhackos.\n  Yet the level of debate has followed to the point that those who \ndecided they must oppose Miguel Estrada for whatever reason stand mute \nwhile he and others like him are attacked as right-wing whackos. \nUnfortunately, this kind of attack does not stay on one side or the \nother. Today there are radio ads being run in the home states of \nSenators who have still not made up their mind how they are going to \nvote, radio ads that attack these Senators' integrity and suggest if \nthey do not vote as the majority leader would like them to vote, they \nare not people of faith. They are attacking their integrity and their \nreligion. To me, that is as repugnant as attacking the President's \nnominees as right-wing whackos.\n  This kind of vilification must stop, but I don't know how to stop it. \nThe first amendment gives us all a right to say whatever we want to \nsay, however ridiculous it may be, however offensive it may be. But it \nis ridiculous and it is offensive to have the kind of debate going on \nover this issue. This is a legitimate issue on which Senators can have \nlegitimately differing views. It should not become a vehicle for \npracticing the politics of personal destruction. But it is going on.\n  I simply raise my voice in the hope that on both sides, the \ntemperature of the rhetoric can come down, and we can discuss the issue \non its merits. Let me do my best to discuss the issue on its merits in \nthe time I have.\n\n  First, what are we talking about? We are talking about changing a \nSenate tradition. We are also talking about changing a Senate rule. I \nwant people to understand the two are not the same. Indeed, we have \nformal rules in the Senate governing the way we do business. We have \ncreated traditions\n\n[[Page S4142]]\n\nand, quite frankly, the tradition trumps the rule. If somebody invokes \nthe rule, they can overturn the tradition, but the tradition that has \ntaken hold trumps the rule.\n  I will give an example of which I am sure the Presiding Officer is \naware. The rule says the Presiding Officer is required to recognize \nwhichever Senator addresses the Chair first. The tradition is that the \nPresiding Officer recognizes the majority leader first, even if he is \nnot the first one in a jump-ball situation to shout out the name of the \nPresiding Officer. The tradition says the Presiding Officer recognizes \nthe minority leader second, recognizes the majority manager of the bill \nthird, the minority manager of the bill fourth, and then those Senators \nwho ask for recognition are recognized according to the rule.\n  We honor that tradition for a variety of good reasons. We have not \nwritten it into the rules, but it does not matter because the tradition \ntrumps the rule and it helps the Senate move forward.\n  I make a point of this difference for this reason: those who say the \nfilibuster being used to stop judicial nominees are acting in \naccordance with the rule, are exactly right. The rule has always been \nthere and those who used the rule to stop the nomination to prevent an \nup-or-down vote on Miguel Estrada were entirely within their rights and \nacting absolutely in compliance with the rules. Let's not demonize them \nfor using the rules.\n  However, those who say it is a violation of the Senate tradition to \nuse the filibuster to block a circuit court judge are also exactly \nright. By tradition, we have always held in the Senate that a nominee \nwho gets out of committee and comes to the Senate is entitled to an up-\nor-down vote. By invoking the rule in the last Congress, the then-\nDemocrat leader overturned the tradition. By talking about changing the \nrule now, the Republican leader, the majority leader, is entirely \nwithin his rights. Neither one should be demonized for the position \nthey took.\n  Let's look at why the tradition held for so many years. It held \nbecause the spirit of comity ruled in the Senate and each party \nrecognized the time would come when the other party would control the \nPresidency. Indeed, if you look at history, it is almost inevitable \nthat the other party will control the Presidency. Since the end of \nWorld War II through the election of 2004, we have had 15 Presidential \nelections. The party in power has won eight and the party out of party \nhas won seven. You cannot get any closer than that. There has been only \none time in that entire run where a single party won three consecutive \nelections, Reagan in 1980, Reagan in 1984, and Bush in 1988. Every \nother time the longest run either party has been able to have has been \n8 years, so the historic norm says there will be a Democratic president \nafter 2008. I hope that is not the case, but that is what history \nsuggests will happen.\n  Each side has recognized that their side will have a President within \na relatively short period of time--since the end of World War II, \nwithin less than 8 years. So each side has said, let us not invoke the \nrule that says you can filibuster judges. Instead, let us abide by the \ntradition that says every nominee is entitled to an up-or-down vote. \nThat way, when we get the Presidency, our President will have the same \ncourtesy we are now extending to their President.\n\n  I remember very clearly when President Clinton sent some nominees to \nthis body which members of my conference decided were left-wing \nwhackos, if I might use that phrase. They, fortunately, did not use \nthat phrase in public as it is being used now. And I do not think they \nshould. But they felt these nominees were too extreme to be on the \nbench.\n  When it was clear we did not have the votes to prevent them from \ngoing on the bench, there were those in the conference who said: We \nhave to filibuster. Let's use the filibuster to prevent them. We can \nmuster 41 votes.\n  The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, my colleague from \nUtah, Orrin Hatch, and the then-majority leader, the Senator from \nMississippi, Trent Lott, both pled with us: Don't do it. Don't start \ndown that road. We have never done it before. And we shouldn't do it \nnow.\n  And why not? Because, they said: After 2000, we are going to have the \nPresidency, and we want our President to have the same courtesy we are \nbegging with you to extend to President Clinton. They carried the day. \nThere was no Republican filibuster on the floor of any circuit court \njudge.\n  Now we find ourselves in a situation where the tradition has been \nchanged, and the question is, will we now change the rule to \nreestablish the tradition? It is a legitimate debate. I have respect \nfor those who hold positions on both sides.\n  I do make this comment. If the rule change does not go through, and \nthe rule that now holds that says judicial nominees are fair game, I \nguarantee the next time the Democratic Party has a President who sends \nup a nominee that 41 Senators on the Republican side decide they do not \nlike, the Republicans will abide by the rule that has changed the \ntradition, and they will filibuster the nominee.\n  Now, I have many of my colleagues who say: No, no, we would never do \nthat. We honor the tradition, and we would go back to that tradition.\n  I do not believe them. I do not say they are lying to us. I think \nthey believe what they are saying now. But I believe, in the heat of \nthe battle that would come with a Republican minority in the Senate and \na Democratic President, the Republicans, in the present atmosphere, \nwould say: Let's use the filibuster. Let's give them a taste of their \nown medicine. The level of political dialogue would continue to go \ndown. The level of personal destruction would continue to go up.\n  The other question I raise for speculation: Suppose nothing happens \nin this Congress, Democrats win the Presidency in 2008, the Republicans \ndo use the filibuster to stop judges a Democratic President sends \nforward, but the Democrats are in control of the Senate. Will those who \nare standing here saying this is a disaster for the Senate give a \npledge that they will not, when they are in the majority, suggest using \n51 votes to get rid of the filibuster on judicial nominees?\n  I suggest they would be tempted to do the same thing the Republicans \nare trying to do now in order to take care of their Democratic \nPresident. Indeed, the record shows they have done that.\n  These quotations have already been given on the floor, but I want to \nrepeat them in this context.\n  Senator Byrd, in 1979, said:\n\n       Now we are at the beginning of Congress. This Congress is \n     not obliged to be bound by the dead hand of the past . . . \n     [I]t is my belief--which has been supported by rulings of \n     Vice Presidents of both parties and by votes of the Senate--\n     in essence upholding the power and right of a majority of the \n     Senate to change the rules of the Senate at the beginning of \n     a new Congress.\n\n  Senator Byrd now disavows that position. And I respect that. Each one \nof us is entitled to change our mind. I have changed my mind. He is \nentitled to change his. Will he make a pledge he will not change it \nback when the Democrats are in the majority and say: ``We want to \nprevent filibusters of our President's judicial nominees''?\n  Senator Kennedy said in 1975:\n\n       By what logic can the Senate of 1917 or 1949 or 1959 bind \n     the Senate of 1975? As Senator Walsh of Montana said during \n     the Senate debate in 1917 on the enactment of the original \n     rule XXII: ``A majority may adopt the rules in the first \n     place. It is preposterous to assert that they may deny future \n     majorities the right to change them.''\n\n  Senator Kennedy has obviously changed his mind. And I respect the \nSenator's right to change his mind. But I ask again, What assurance do \nwe have he will not change his mind back if the Democrats get the \nmajority and are seeking to protect a President of their own?\n  In 1995, there were nine Senators who voted in favor of eliminating \nall filibusters, not just judicial filibusters, all filibusters--nine \nSenators still serving, Senator Bingaman, Senator Boxer, Senator \nFeingold, Senator Harkin, Senator Kennedy, Senator Kerry, Senator \nLautenberg, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Sarbanes. They voted in \nfavor of eliminating all filibusters. They have now changed their \nminds. They have the right to change their minds. And I respect that. \nWhat indication do we have they will not change their minds back if we \ndo not get this thing settled in this Congress?\n  Going back to the newspaper that sometimes acts as the house organ \nfor the Democratic Party, the New York Times, this is what they had to \nsay in\n\n[[Page S4143]]\n\n1995, when Senator Harkin introduced the legislation to eliminate \nfilibusters.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that editorials of the New \nYork Times be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. The New York Times said: ``Time to Retire the \nFilibuster.'' That is the headline on the editorial. It says:\n\n       The U.S. Senate likes to call itself the world's greatest \n     deliberative body. The greatest obstructive body is more like \n     it.\n\n  And they go on to attack filibusters and give a little of the \nhistory. And then this is their summary of the filibuster, four \nparagraphs down:\n\n       One unpleasant and unforeseen consequence has been to make \n     the filibuster easy to invoke and painless to pursue. Once a \n     rarely used tactic reserved for issues on which senators held \n     passionate convictions, the filibuster has become the tool of \n     the sore loser, dooming any measure that cannot command the \n     60 required votes.\n\n  Well, you would think, then, that when the Republicans are saying, \n``Well, we don't want to eliminate the legislative filibuster, but we \ndo want to re-enthrone the Senate tradition that the filibuster is not \nused on circuit court judges,'' the first cheerleader would be the New \nYork Times. Having labeled the filibuster ``the tool of the sore \nloser,'' and saying that it is obstructionist, the New York Times ought \nto be cheering the idea that finally a majority is about to follow \ntheir advice offered in their editorial pages.\n  But, no, this is what the New York Times now says: ``The Senate on \nthe Brink.'' This is an editorial of March 6, 2005:\n\n       The White House's insistence on choosing only far-right \n     judicial nominees--\n\n  There is the politics of personal destruction I was referring to \nearlier--``only far-right judicial nominees'' has already damaged the \nfederal courts. Now it threatens to do grave harm to the Senate. If \nRepublicans fulfill their threat to overturn the historic role of the \nfilibuster in order to ram the Bush administration's nominees through, \nthey will be inviting all-out warfare and perhaps an effective shutdown \nof Congress.\n  Interesting what 10 years' time and a change of administrations can \ndo. The filibuster that was ``the tool of sore losers'' suddenly has \nbecome ``the historic role,'' even though they cannot point to a single \ncase in history where the filibuster has been used to prevent an up-or-\ndown vote on a circuit court nominee who made it to the floor.\n  How they can call that a ``historic role'' is something I will leave \nto the editorial writers of the New York Times.\n  I hope we will not see any more press releases attacking the \nPresident's nominees as ``right-wing whackos,'' that we will not see \nany more radio ads attacking Senators who are examining this matter as \nbeing people of no faith, that we will stop the politics of personal \ndestruction on both sides of this issue, and we will look at it in its \nhistoric pattern.\n  What we do or do not do on this issue will set the tone of where the \nSenate and future Presidents go for decades to come. The Republic \nsurvived for over 200 years without the minority of either party \nexercising its right to filibuster judges. I think we should be very \ncareful about enshrining in tradition the rule that says it is time to \nchange.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 1, 1995]\n\n\n                     Time to Retire the Filibuster\n\n       The U.S. Senate likes to call itself the world's greatest \n     deliberative body. The greatest obstructive body is more like \n     it. In the last session of Congress, the Republican minority \n     invoked an endless string of filibusters to frustrate the \n     will of the majority. This relentless abuse of a time-honored \n     Senate tradition so disgusted Senator Tom Harkin, a Democrat \n     from Iowa, that he is now willing to forgo easy retribution \n     and drastically limit the filibuster. Hooray for him.\n       For years Senate filibusters--when they weren't conjuring \n     up romantic images of Jimmy Stewart as Mr. Smith, passing out \n     from exhaustion on the Senate floor--consisted mainly of \n     negative feats of endurance. Senator Sam Ervin once spoke for \n     22 hours straight. Outrage over these tactics and their \n     ability to bring Senate business to a halt led to the current \n     so-called two-track system, whereby a senator can hold up one \n     piece of legislation while other business goes on as usual.\n       The two-track system has been nearly as obstructive as the \n     old rules. Under those rules, if the Senate could not muster \n     the 60 votes necessary to end debate and bring a bill to a \n     vote, someone had to be willing to continue the debate, in \n     person, on the floor. That is no longer required. Even if the \n     60 votes are not achieved, debate stops and the Senate \n     proceeds with other business. The measure is simply put on \n     hold until the next cloture vote. In this way a bill can be \n     stymied at any number of points along its legislative \n     journey.\n       One unpleasant and unforeseen consequence has been to make \n     the filibuster easy to invoke and painless to pursue. Once a \n     rarely used tactic reserved for issues on which senators held \n     passionate convictions, the filibuster has become the tool of \n     the sore loser, dooming any measure that cannot command the \n     60 required votes.\n       Mr. Harkin, along with Senator Joseph Lieberman, a \n     Connecticut Democrat, now proposes to make such obstruction \n     harder. Mr. Harkin says reasonably that there must come a \n     point in the process where the majority rules. This may not \n     sit well with some of his Democratic colleagues. They are now \n     perfectly positioned to exact revenge by frustrating the \n     Republican agenda as efficiently as Republicans frustrated \n     Democrats in 1994.\n       Admirably, Mr. Harkin says he does not want to do that. He \n     proposes to change the rules so that if a vote for cloture \n     fails to attract the necessary 60 votes, the number of votes \n     needed to close off debate would be reduced by three in each \n     subsequent vote. By the time the measure came to a fourth \n     vote--with votes occurring no more frequently than every \n     second day--cloture could be invoked with only a simple \n     majority. Under the Harkin plan, minority members who feel \n     passionately about a given measure could still hold it up, \n     but not indefinitely.\n       Another set of reforms, more incremental but also useful, \n     is proposed by George Mitchell, who is retiring as the \n     Democratic majority leader. He wants to eat away at some of \n     the more annoying kinds of brakes that can be applied to a \n     measure along its legislative journey.\n       One example is the procedure for sending a measure to a \n     conference committee with the House. Under current rules, \n     unless the Senate consents unanimously to send a measure to \n     conference, three separate motions can be required to move it \n     along. This gives one senator the power to hold up a measure \n     almost indefinitely. Mr. Mitchell would like to reduce the \n     number of motions to one.\n       He would also like to limit the debate on a motion to two \n     hours and count the time consumed by quorum calls against the \n     debate time of a senator, thus encouraging senators to save \n     their time for debating the substance of a measure rather \n     than in obstruction. All of his suggestions seem reasonable, \n     but his reforms would leave the filibuster essentially \n     intact.\n       The Harkin plan, along with some of Mr. Mitchell's \n     proposals, would go a long way toward making the Senate a \n     more productive place to conduct the nation's business. \n     Republicans surely dread the kind of obstructionism they \n     themselves practiced during the last Congress. Now is the \n     perfect moment for them to unite with likeminded Democrats to \n     get rid of an archaic rule that frustrates democracy and \n     serves no useful purpose.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, March 6, 2005]\n\n                        The Senate on the Brink\n\n       The White House's insistence on choosing only far-right \n     judicial nominees has already damaged the federal courts. Now \n     it threatens to do grave harm to the Senate. If Republicans \n     fulfill their threat to overturn the historic role of the \n     filibuster in order to ram the Bush administration's nominees \n     through, they will be inviting all-out warfare and perhaps an \n     effective shutdown of Congress. The Republicans are claiming \n     that 51 votes should be enough to win confirmation of the \n     White House's judicial nominees. This flies in the face of \n     Senate history. Republicans and Democrats should tone down \n     their rhetoric, then sit down and negotiate.\n       President Bush likes to complain about the divisive \n     atmosphere in Washington. But he has contributed to it \n     mightily by choosing federal judges from the far right of the \n     ideological spectrum. He started his second term with a \n     particularly aggressive move: resubmitting seven nominees \n     whom the Democrats blocked last year by filibuster.\n       The Senate has confirmed the vast majority of President \n     Bush's choices. But Democrats have rightly balked at a \n     handful. One of the seven renominated judges is William \n     Myers, a former lobbyist for the mining and ranching \n     industries who demonstrated at his hearing last week that he \n     is an antienvironmental extremist who lacks the \n     evenhandedness necessary to be a federal judge. Another is \n     Janice Rogers Brown, who has disparaged the New Deal as ``our \n     socialist revolution.''\n       To block the nominees, the Democrats' weapon of choice has \n     been the filibuster, a time-honored Senate procedure that \n     prevents a bare majority of senators from running roughshod. \n     Republican leaders now claim that judicial nominees are \n     entitled to\n\n[[Page S4144]]\n\n     an up-or-down vote. This is rank hypocrisy. When the tables \n     were turned, Republicans filibustered President Bill \n     Clinton's choice for surgeon general, forcing him to choose \n     another. And Bill Frist, the Senate majority leader, who now \n     finds judicial filibusters so offensive, himself joined one \n     against Richard Paez, a Clinton appeals court nominee.\n       Yet these very same Republicans are threatening to have \n     Vice President Dick Cheney rule from the chair that a simple \n     majority can confirm a judicial nominee rather than the 60 \n     votes necessary to stop a filibuster. This is known as the \n     ``nuclear option'' because in all likelihood it would blow up \n     the Senate's operations. The Senate does much of its work by \n     unanimous consent, which keeps things moving along and \n     prevents ordinary day-to-day business from drowning in \n     procedural votes. But if Republicans change the filibuster \n     rules, Democrats could respond by ignoring the tradition of \n     unanimous consent and making it difficult if not \n     impossible to get anything done. Arlen Specter, the \n     Pennsylvania Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary \n     Committee, has warned that ``the Senate will be in turmoil \n     and the Judiciary Committee will be hell.''\n       Despite his party's Senate majority, however, Mr. Frist may \n     not have the votes to go nuclear. A sizable number of \n     Republicans--including John McCain, Olympia Snowe, Susan \n     Collins, Lincoln Chafee and John Warner--could break away. \n     For them, the value of confirming a few extreme nominees may \n     be outweighed by the lasting damage to the Senate. Besides, \n     majorities are temporary, and they may want to filibuster one \n     day.\n       There is one way to avert a showdown. The White House \n     should meet with Senate leaders of both parties and come up \n     with a list of nominees who will not be filibustered. This \n     means that Mr. Bush--like Presidents Bill Clinton, Ronald \n     Reagan and George H.W. Bush before him--would agree to submit \n     nominees from the broad mainstream of legal thought, with a \n     commitment to judging cases, not promoting a political \n     agenda.\n       The Bush administration likes to call itself \n     ``conservative,'' but there is nothing conservative about \n     endangering one of the great institutions of American \n     democracy, the United States Senate, for the sake of an \n     ideological crusade.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank my friend from Utah for his usual \ncourtesy. After all, he has in his lineage a Senator. His father, as \ndoes he, served as a Senator. He knows, as did his father, the normal \ncourtesies that make this place run so much more smoothly. So I \nappreciate it.\n  I spoke at the beginning of the week about the alarming rise of \nreligious McCarthyism. I hoped that by drawing attention to this \nsituation the majority leader and other Republican leaders would speak \nout against any campaign that improperly characterizes Senators as \nbeing ``against people of faith.'' That demonizing of Senators and \ntheir motives has no place in this country, and absolutely none in \ndebate among Senators. It is a slur. It is a smear. It is untrue. Every \nSenator, Republican and Democratic, knows it. The Republicans should \ndenounce a campaign based on bigotry and demagoguery.\n  With rare exceptions, they have refused to do so. And even the \nmajority leader will apparently act in support of such a campaign this \nweekend.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will yield for one, but I would prefer--\n  Mr. BENNETT. It is only one.\n  I wonder if the Senator heard my denunciation of that kind of thing \nwhen I gave my speech?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I was about to refer to that. So I now do refer to the \nfact that the Senator from Utah said people should not be demonized as \nbeing against people of faith if they oppose somebody.\n  I appreciate it. It is the first time I have heard that said on his \nside of the aisle. Unfortunately, many others have been saying just the \nopposite. That is why I wish the majority leader would not act in \nsupport of such a campaign this weekend.\n  The upcoming telecast to incite congregants with the false charge \nthat those who oppose judicial activists are anti-Christian or anti-\nfaith is wrong. It is divisive and it is destructive. That Republican \nofficials will lend support to that effort through their silence, \nrather than denounce it, is disturbing and disappointing. I appreciate \nthe Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett, finally speaking out, or having a \nvoice finally speak out from that side of the aisle denouncing it.\n  To divide the American people along religious lines is wrong. It has \nalways been wrong. Smearing political opponents as anti-faith is \ndespicable. Apparently, some will stop at nothing and stoop to any \nlevel. No scurrilous charge is too coarse; no baseless accusation is \ntoo outlandish. When a few of us had the honor of attending the funeral \nof Pope John Paul II in Rome as part of the official Senate delegation \nrecently, guess what happened. Democrats, but not Republicans, were \ncastigated for not being present in Washington. There were, of course, \nseven Republicans and seven Democrats. The same people who make these \ncharges castigated the Democrats for being in Rome.\n  When we explain in public session the basis on which we have decided \nto oppose a nomination of somebody we believe does not merit a lifetime \nappointment to the Federal bench, the judicial activism we detail is \nignored and we are smeared as anti this or anti that. So I thank the \nmany religious leaders who have come forward this week to uphold \nAmerica's great traditions of respecting faith, honoring faith, and \nensuring that the constitutional prohibition against any religious test \nfor public office be strictly observed.\n  Christian leaders from a variety of denominations, Muslim leaders, \nand Jewish leaders, have joined to reject these disgraceful efforts of \na few partisans injecting religion into the discussion of judicial \nnominations. They have publicly denounced the efforts of the religious \ndemagogues making slanderous charges in a win-at-all-costs bid to rile \nthe passions and to further divide Americans one from another. I am \ngrateful for the voices of these religious leaders. We need less \ndivision, not more. We need to work together more, not less. We need to \nunite, not divide.\n  I share the disappointment of the more than 400 religious leaders who \nhave written to Majority Leader Frist urging him to ``repudiate those \nwho misuse religion for political purposes and who impugn the faith of \nany who disagree with them.''\n  All of us need to repudiate the message of divisiveness and religious \nmanipulation.\n  The Reverend Dr. Weldon Gaddy, president of the Interfaith Alliance, \nrecently wrote to Senator Frist to warn against transforming ``religion \nby baptizing it as a disciple of partisan politics.''\n  Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, \nreminded Senator Frist:\n\n       Religious liberty has flourished in our nation precisely \n     because Americans have been steadfast in their commitment \n     against sowing religious discord as a means to achieve \n     political success.\n\n  My Irish and my Italian grandparents, like so many others, came to \nthis country seeking a better life for their families, not just a \nbetter job but the freedoms that have always been so much a part of \nAmerica's great attraction. But it has taken time and pain for us to \nrealize as a nation that dream of religious freedom and tolerance.\n  I remember my parents talking about days I thought were long past, \nwhen Irish Catholics were greeted with signs that told them they need \nnot apply for jobs. Italian Catholics were told that they and their \nreligious ways were not wanted. That is what my grandparents \nexperienced and my parents saw. The smears we are seeing today mock the \npain and injustice that so many American Catholics endured. We have \ncome too far to turn back to the darkness of intolerance.\n  Partisans these days are seeking to rekindle the flames of bigotry \nfor\n\n[[Page S4145]]\n\nshort-term political gain. That is more than just wrong, it is \ndespicable. To raise the specter of religious intolerance in order to \ntry to turn our strong, independent Federal courts into an arm of a \npolitical party is an outrage. It is shocking that some would \ncavalierly destroy the independence of our Federal courts and with it \nthe best protection Americans have of our freedoms.\n  This tactical shift follows on the rhetorical attacks on judges over \nthe past few weeks in which Federal judges were likened to the KKK and \n``the focus of evil.'' At an event attended by Members of Congress, we \nhave heard calls for Stalinist solutions to problems; the Stalinist \nsolution being, of course, if you have somebody you don't agree with, \nyou kill them. Stalin said: No man, no problem.\n  We have heard the calls for mass impeachments. Last week the Senate \nDemocratic leadership called upon the President and the Republican \nleadership of Congress to denounce the inflammatory statements against \njudges. This week I renew my call to all Senators--and in particular to \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle, the Republicans--to denounce \nthe religious McCarthyism that is again pervading this debate. I am sad \nto see so many Senators stay silent when they should disavow these \nabuses. Why Republicans do not heed the clarion call that our former \ncolleague, Senator John Danforth, an Episcopalian priest, sounded a few \nweeks ago, I don't know.\n  The demagoguery and divisive politics being so cynically used by \nsupporters of the President's most extreme judicial nominees needs to \nstop. These smears are lies and, like all lies, depend on the silence \nof others to live and to gain root. It is time for the silence to end. \nThe Bush administration has to accept responsibility for the smear \ncampaign. They have to end it. This kind of religious smear campaign \ndoesn't just hurt Democrats, it hurts the whole country. It hurts \nChristians and it hurts non-Christians. It hurts all of us because the \nConstitution requires judges to apply the law, not their personal \nviews. Remember that all of us, no matter what our faith--and I am \nproud of mine--are able to practice our religion as we choose or not to \npractice a religion. The beauty of the first amendment is we can \npractice any religion we wish or none if we wish. It is a fundamental \nguarantee of our Constitution. The Constitution's prohibition against a \nreligious test in Article VI is consistent with that fundamental \nfreedom.\n\n  All Americans should understand the Constitution is there to protect \nall of us. It is the protection of the Constitution that has allowed \nthis country to evolve into a tolerant Nation. It was not always a \ntolerant Nation; it has evolved into one. But the Constitution has \nprotected that evolution.\n  Those who would try to drag us back into religious intolerance for \nshort-term political gains subvert the Constitution and damage the \ncountry. There are those who say that we are against people of faith if \nwe have opposed a handful of the President's nominees. By their false \nlogic, the 205 judicial nominees nominated by President Bush whom \nDemocratic Senators have helped to confirm would seem not to be people \nof faith, if that is our litmus test. Of course, that is as false and \nridiculous on its face as are the slurs being insinuated against those \nwho have opposed the few other nominees who have not been confirmed.\n  Those who hurl these false charges never mention that the same \nSenators they are slandering have supported hundreds of nominees who \nare people of faith. They never hesitate to stoke the flames of bigotry \nand to encourage their supporters to continue the smear in cyberspace \nor the pages of the newspapers or through direct mail or radio ads. \nMaybe this slander is the only thing that tests well in their political \npolls so that even though untrue, it is the one thing they can agree \nupon. Sort of the equivalent of the weapons of mass destruction, the \njustification for attacking Iraq: it turned out it wasn't true, but it \nwas certainly convenient.\n  Not only must this bogus religious test end, but Senators should \ndenounce the launching of the so-called nuclear option, the \nRepublicans' precedent-shattering proposal to destroy the Senate in one \nstroke while shifting more power over the Senate to the White House, to \ndestroy the kind of checks and balances the Senate has historically \nhad.\n  I would like to keep the Senate safe and secure and in a ``nuclear-\nfree'' zone. The partisan power play Senate Republicans are now likely \nto employ will undermine the checks and balances established by the \nFounders in the Constitution. One of the beauties of this country is we \nhave always had checks and balances. That is how the most powerful \nNation on Earth remains a democracy, and it does not have the \ntemptation to become a dictatorship, something that none of us, \nRepublicans or Democrats, would want.\n  If you remove the checks and balances so that you can nominate judges \nwho will be basically an arm of one element of the Republican Party, \nthen you have taken a giant leap toward an unfettered executive \ncontrolling all three branches of the Federal Government--a Republican-\ncontrolled House, Republican-controlled Senate, the Presidency, and now \nthe Federal judiciary, the one part that should be above politics.\n  It will not only demean the Senate--a Senate I have been proud to \nserve in for 31 years--but it will destroy the comity on which it \ndepends. It also will undermine the strong independent Federal \njudiciary that has protected the rights and liberties of all Americans \nagainst the overreaching of the political branches, whether the branch \nis controlled by Democrats or by Republicans.\n  Our Senate Parliamentarian, who steps away from politics and simply \ntells us what the rules are, and the Congressional Research Service, \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, have both said the so-\ncalled nuclear option would violate Senate precedent. I would ask my \nfriends on the Republican side, do you really want to blatantly break \nthe rules just for some short-term political gain? Do you really want \nto turn the Senate, this unique Chamber, into a place where the \nparliamentary equivalent of brute force is what prevails?\n  The recently constituted Iraqi National Assembly was elected in \nJanuary. In April it acted pursuant to its governing law to select a \npresidency council by the required vote of two-thirds of the Assembly. \nIt required two-thirds, a supermajority. That same governing law says \nit can only be amended by a three-quarters vote of the National \nAssembly. The use of the nuclear option in the Senate would be akin to \nthe Iraqis in the majority political party of the Assembly saying they \nhave decided to change the law to allow them to pick only members of \ntheir party for the government, and to do so by a simple majority vote.\n  That is certainly different than what our own President has praised \nit for in requiring that supermajority. They might feel justified in \nacting contrary to law because the Kurds and the Sunni were driving a \nhard bargain and because governing through consensus is not as easy as \nruling unilaterally. Governing by consensus is not supposed to be. That \nis why our system of government is the world's example.\n  If Iraqi Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds can cooperate in their new \ngovernment to make democratic decisions, I would think it would be a \nlot easier for Republicans and Democrats to do so in the Senate. If the \nIraqi law and Assembly can protect minority rights and participation, \nso can the rules in the Senate. That has been the defining \ncharacteristic of the Senate. It is one of the principal ways in which \nit was designed to be so distinct from the House of Representatives.\n  This week, the Senate debated an emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill to fund the war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThe justification for these billions of dollars being spent every \nsingle week--billions of dollars in American taxpayers' money--is that \nwe are seeking to establish democracies.\n  How ironic that at the same time we are undertaking these efforts at \ngreat cost to so many American families, some are seeking to undermine \nthe protection of minority rights and the checks and balances \nrepresented by the Senate through our own history.\n  This week the Secretary of State said in Moscow that ``the \ncentralization of the state power in the presidency at the expense of \ncountervailing institutions like the Duma or an independent\n\n[[Page S4146]]\n\njudiciary is clearly very wrong.'' Just as those developments undercut \ndemocracy in Russia, so, too, our American democracy is undercut by the \nconcentration of power in the Executive, removing checks and balances \nand undermining the independence of the Federal judiciary. It is ironic \ngiven that the President and Secretary of State speak so eloquently \nabout the fundamental requirements of a democratic society--and I \napplaud them for doing that. They do it when they meet with President \nPutin of Russia. At the same time, the Bush administration and Senate \nRepublicans are intent to employ the nuclear option to consolidate \npower in this Presidency in this country.\n  The President has, in his own words, acknowledged that democracy \nrelies on the sharing of power. I publicly applauded his inaugural \nspeech when he talked about this issue. He acknowledged that democracy \nrelies on the sharing of power, on checks and balances, on the \nindependent court system, the protection of minority rights, and on \nsafeguarding human rights and dignity. But the so-called nuclear option \nis in direct contradiction to maintaining those values and those \ncomponents of our democracy.\n  Just as Abu Ghraib and other abuses make it more difficult for our \ncountry effectively to condemn torture and abuse when we speak to the \nrest of the world, the nuclear option used as a partisan effort to \nconsolidate power in a single political party and institution would \nmake all the lectures on democracy we give to leaders of other \ncountries ring hollow.\n  I spoke to a group of Russian Parliamentarians--if I might tell a \nshort story--who came to see me shortly after the Soviet Union \ncollapsed. They wanted to talk about our Federal judiciary. Like other \nrepresentatives I heard in other emerging democracies, they asked: ``Is \nit true that the U.S. Government might be a party in a lawsuit, but \nthen the Government could lose?''\n  I said: Absolutely right.\n  They said: You mean people would dare to sue the Government?\n  I said: It happens all the time. We have an independent judiciary. \nYes, they could.\n  They said: Well, if the Government actually lost, don't you fire the \njudge?\n  I said: No, they are an independent judiciary.\n  I have argued cases on behalf of the Government where it might have \nbeen nice to fire the judge, but that is not the way we do things. It \namazes people in other parts of the world. They are amazed that people \nhave disagreed with their Government and could actually go to court, \nbring a challenge, and seek redress, even if it meant the Government \nwould have to lose to get that redress.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist is right to refer to our independent \njudiciary as the crown jewel of our democracy. It is more than a crown \njewel, it is a dazzling jewel, a light to the rest of the world, \nespecially those parts of the world that want to become democratic \nnations.\n  Judicial fairness and independence is also essential if we are to \nmaintain our freedoms. I would say to the majority leader of the other \nbody, Mr. DeLay, and others, stop slamming the Federal judiciary. We \ndon't have to agree with every one of their opinions. And we don't on \neither side. Let us respect their independence.\n  When the U.S. Supreme Court decided the Presidential election in \n2000, I thought that the 5-to-4 majority--a very close majority, a one-\nvote majority--engaged in an incredible and overreaching act of \njudicial activism. But I went on the floor of the body and before the \ntelevision cameras and I called for Americans to respect the opinion of \nthe Court, even though I disagreed with it.\n  On the Judiciary Committee at the time, I attended the argument of \nBush v. Gore, side by side with my Republican counterpart. We wanted to \nshow the country that we had to get along and work together. Democrats \ndidn't ask to impeach Justice Scalia when we wholeheartedly disagreed \nwith his action. Instead we took to the floor of this body and the \nother body and to the airwaves and said the Supreme Court has spoken. \nWe must uphold the decision of the Court.\n  Part of upholding the Constitution is upholding the independence of \nthe third branch of Government. One political party or the other will \ncontrol the Presidency, as they have for over 200 years. One party or \nthe other will control Congress.\n  In my 30 years here, I have been in the majority several times and in \nthe minority several times. These things go back and forth. No \npolitical party should control the judiciary. It has to be independent \nof all political parties. Think of it, that was the genius of the \nFounders of this country: one branch of Government, totally independent \nof the other, independent of political parties. That genius has \nprotected our liberties and rights for well over 200 years. It is a \ngenius of this country that will continue to protect us, unless we \nallow some to destroy it for short-term political gain. It would be a \nterrible diminution of our rights if we were to remove the independence \nof our Federal judiciary. We are liable to do something that no army \nthat marched against us have ever been able to do to this most \nwonderful of democracies. If you take away the independence of our \nFederal judiciary, then our whole Constitutional fabric unravels. And \nthat bright promise that brought my ancestors here from Italy and \nIreland would be diminished--the bright promise that I hope continues \nfor my children and grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken long and I appreciate the courtesy of my \ncolleague from Utah.\n  I close by asking unanimous consent that copies of letters sent by \nhundreds of religious leaders to Senator Frist, the letter from the \nInterfaith Alliance to Senator Frist, the statement by the National \nCouncil of Churches, the letter from the Anti-Defamation League to \nSenator Frist, and a statement from Rabbi David Saperstein, Director of \nthe Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                   April 21, 2005.\n\n    American Religious Leaders and Supporters Opposed to ``Justice \n                    Sunday's'' Manipulation of Faith\n\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: We write as religious leaders who \n     cherish America's distinctive tradition of religious respect, \n     tolerance, and pluralism.\n       We write as members of religious traditions that revere \n     truth and are guided by prophetic calls to seek justice.\n       We are gravely disappointed that you have lent support to \n     those who are trying to create confusion and sow division \n     with false charges of religious discrimination and \n     persecution. Good people can and do differ on policy \n     questions like the filibuster. We emphatically reject claims \n     that those who seek to uphold the country's traditions of \n     checks and balances are forcing Christians to choose between \n     their faith and public service.\n       It is simply not truthful to assert that supporting the \n     filibuster amounts to an attack on people of faith. Most, \n     perhaps all, of the 95% of the Bush nominees who have been \n     approved, have been people of faith. They enjoyed support \n     from both sides of the aisle.\n       As Senate Majority Leader, you have a responsibility to \n     defend your colleagues on both sides of the aisle, public \n     servants whom you know to be deeply religious people, from \n     shameful and divisive accusations that they are attacking \n     people of faith. You have a responsibility to defend the \n     Nation from efforts utilizing deception and fear-mongering to \n     manipulate Americans of faith. And, perhaps most importantly, \n     as one of our Nation's highest elected officials, you have a \n     responsibility to repudiate those who misuse religion for \n     political purposes and who impugn the faith of any who \n     disagree with them.\n       Your participation in the ``Justice Sunday'' event gives \n     your personal stamp of approval and legitimizes an event \n     built on inflammatory falsehoods. We urge you either to \n     withdraw your participation in this event or, if you \n     participate, to use that opportunity to repudiate the message \n     of divisiveness and religious manipulation that is at the \n     core of the gathering.\n           Sincerely,\n       Signed by 406 religious leaders.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 17, 2005.\n     Hon. William Frist,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: As President of The Interfaith \n     Alliance, a national, grassroots organization with 150,000 \n     members coming from over 75 different faith traditions, I \n     write to you again about your interest in introducing to the \n     United States Senate your so-called ``nuclear option.'' \n     However, the focus of this open letter to you is the \n     association being made between a person's political position \n     on the nuclear option and the\n\n[[Page S4147]]\n\n     legitimacy of that person's religion. Though my personal \n     language to you does not reflect the precise manner in which \n     each of our 150,000 members would speak to you, the crucial \n     concern in my message to you represents a primal interest and \n     resonates with the mindset of these diverse individuals in \n     this inter-religious movement.\n       Senator Frist, I suppose it was bound to happen. Leaders of \n     the religious right and politicians pushing a partisan agenda \n     in the name of religion have so intermingled politics and \n     religion that, now, even you, the leader of the United States \n     Senate, appear unable to discern the difference between \n     authentic faith and partisan politics. I can think of no \n     other reason that you would address a group of people and \n     even offer encouragement to people who have announced that \n     opposition to the elimination of the filibuster signals \n     antipathy toward religious faith, thus fostering a \n     redefinition of religion that is blasphemy and a redefinition \n     of democracy that is scary.\n       Politically-based judgments about faith are inappropriate \n     at best, but, at worst, they raise suspicions about the \n     motivations of those who make them. Do such politically-\n     motivated judgments about religion come from people--\n     political leaders or spiritual leaders--attempting to \n     manipulate religion to advance their personal brand of \n     politics? Regardless of the reason for the out-of-bounds \n     judgment, the judgment does not work. Oh, to be sure, it may \n     gain a person or a group an edge in political advantage, but \n     it fails as a valid criterion for evaluating religion. A \n     particular political posture never will be the standard by \n     which to measure the authenticity of a religious conviction! \n     Even the suggestion that a person's support or opposition to \n     religious faith can be determined by that person's support or \n     opposition to a political initiative called ``the nuclear \n     option'' is derogatory of religion and an insult to \n     democracy. I would think that you would want to disassociate \n     yourself from such thought.\n       Though I personally disagree with your enthusiasm for \n     eradicating the historic practice of the filibuster, viewing \n     your efforts as a broadside to a democracy that values the \n     rights of the minority whether in the Senate or in society \n     as a whole, I never would pass judgment on the integrity \n     of your religious faith because of your commitment to that \n     political strategy.\n       Senator Frist, I grew up in the state that you represent. \n     In a fundamentalist Baptist church in West Tennessee, I was \n     taught the value of religious liberty--its value for \n     Christianity and its value for government. The people in that \n     congregation knew the sad history of a denial of rights to \n     religious minorities prior to the passage of the First \n     Amendment to the Constitution. With gratitude to God for that \n     invaluable education, my conviction about the dangers of \n     entangling religion and government (not faith and politics) \n     has intensified across the years. Please understand that many \n     of us are scared to death that we see a precious \n     constitutional principle being dismantled in order for a few \n     religious people who claim to speak for all religious people \n     to have their religious views imposed on the entire \n     population of the nation through the power of the United \n     States government.\n       With a religious conscience as enflamed as the conscience \n     of anybody in the religious right, I oppose the election of \n     judges who will, in the name of religion, make decisions that \n     politicize religion and blunt the vitality as well as \n     compromise the integrity of the rich religious community in \n     this nation. Must my religious conviction be attacked as \n     ``anti-faith'' simply because I do not agree with you when \n     you attempt to destroy a democratic process that has been \n     tried and true? If I feel that way as a person who is a \n     member of your faith tradition, you only can imagine what \n     people from other religious traditions and people within no \n     religious tradition are feeling about such tactics and the \n     implicit, if not explicit, endorsement of those tactics by \n     you and other political leaders.\n       For you to use your prestigious Senate position to \n     encourage ferocious attacks on the judiciary launched by the \n     people to whom you plan to speak next Sunday and for you to \n     condone their framing of partisan political posturing as an \n     act of faith so that all who are opposed to their theocratic \n     aggression are dubbed anti-religion are insults to the \n     Senate, a blow to democracy, and a cause for great anxiety in \n     the broader community committed to the historic values of \n     democracy.\n       All of us should be clear in understanding that the most \n     anti-faith initiatives in our nation right now are those that \n     seek to transform religion by baptizing it as a disciple of \n     partisan politics. A call for respect for balancing the three \n     branches of government and for respecting minority voices in \n     Congress even as in society is not a religious act, but it is \n     a pervasively patriotic act on the part of people who feel \n     like a few are trying to steal the nation from the many in \n     the same way that they have tried to hijack religion and \n     claim that only their voices represent people of faith.\n       Members of The Interfaith Alliance like me personally love \n     this nation too much and appreciate the role of religion in \n     the nation too much to allow a destructive entanglement of \n     religion and politics to go without challenge. I urge you \n     to reconsider your commitment to speak to a group on \n     Sunday evening that seems to love the nation only when the \n     leaders of the nation favor their particular religion and \n     their preferences in politics. If you proceed with the \n     speech, however, I urge you to make clear that neither \n     your politics nor their politics, whether those two are \n     the same or different, represent a religious position. \n     Even though you will be speaking to people gathered in a \n     church, we all know that you are doing politics and \n     claiming a divine blessing depicted as exclusive to your \n     position. Such an act has no place in a house of worship \n     or, for that matter, in the repertoire or rhetoric of a \n     statesman in this great, diverse nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy,\n       President, The Interfaith Alliance Pastor of Preaching and \n           Worship, Northminster Baptist Church, Monroe, Louisiana\n     Member of the Council of 100 Leaders, World Economic Forum.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Disagreeing Without Demonizing\n\n       A partisan political campaign to change the Senate \n     filibuster rules has taken a detour through church-state \n     territory, and NCC General Secretary Bob Edgar has challenged \n     the tactics as ``dangerous and divisive'' to the nation's \n     religious and public life. In a statement issued Tuesday, \n     Edgar says:\n       ``We are surprised and grieved by a campaign launched this \n     week by Family Research Council and Senate Majority Leader \n     Bill Frist, who said that those who disagree with them on \n     President Bush's judicial nominees are `against people of \n     faith.'\n       ``This campaign, which they are calling `Justice Sunday,' \n     should properly be called `Just-Us' Sunday. Their attempt to \n     impose on the entire country a narrow, exclusivist, private \n     view of truth is a dangerous, divisive tactic. It serves to \n     further polarize our nation, and it disenfranchises and \n     demonizes good people of faith who hold political beliefs \n     that differ from theirs.\n       ``To brand any group of American citizens as `anti-\n     Christian' simply because they differ on political issues \n     runs counter to the values of both faith and democracy. It is \n     especially disheartening when that accusation is aimed at \n     fellow Christians. The National Council of Churches \n     encompasses more than 45 million believers across a broad \n     spectrum of theology and politics who work together on issues \n     important to our society. If they disagree with Senator \n     Frist's political positions, are these 45 million Christians \n     now considered `anti-Christian'?\n       ``In the spirit of 1 Timothy 6:3-5, we urge Senator Frist \n     and the Family Research Council to reconsider their plan. We \n     will be praying for the Lord to minister to them and change \n     their hearts so that they will not continue to take our \n     nation down this destructive path.''\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 15, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Frist\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: We are deeply troubled by reports that \n     you will be participating in the upcoming telecast ``Justice \n     Sunday,'' scheduled for April 24, and we strongly urge you to \n     reconsider lending support to that program. The heated debate \n     regarding the status of the filibuster in the United States \n     Senate is a quintessentially political contest, not a \n     religious struggle. Nor should it be portrayed as such. \n     Whatever one's views may be on this or any other issue, \n     playing the ``religious'' card is as unacceptable as playing \n     the ``race'' card.\n       The proposal to change the Senate's procedural rules draws \n     both support and opposition from people of all faiths, as \n     well as from citizens who do not ascribe to religious \n     beliefs. ``Justice Sunday's'' message--that the filibuster is \n     being used as a weapon in the judicial confirmation process \n     to discriminate against ``people of faith''--is deeply flawed \n     and a dangerous affront to fundamental principles of American \n     democracy.\n       Religious liberty has flourished in our nation precisely \n     because Americans have been steadfast in their commitment \n     against sowing religious discord as means to achieve \n     political success. History shows that doing otherwise \n     promotes destructive religious competition, discrimination, \n     and even persecution. Responsible leaders must avoid taking \n     this country down that road.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Abraham H.

We call on him \n     to reconsider his decision to appear on the telecast and to \n     forcefully disassociate himself from this outrageous claim.\n\n[[Page S4148]]\n\n       Senator Frist must not give legitimacy to those who claim \n     they hold a monopoly on faith. They do not. They assert, in \n     the words of Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research \n     Council and organizer of the telecast, that there is a vast \n     conspiracy by the courts ``to rob us of our Christian \n     heritage and our religious freedoms.'' There is no such \n     conspiracy. They have been unable to ram through the most \n     extreme of the President's nominees, and now they are \n     spinning new claims out of thin air.\n       Alas, this is not an isolated incident. This past week, the \n     Christian Coalition convened a conference in Washington \n     entitled, ``Confronting the Judicial War on Faith.'' Their \n     special guest speaker was the House Majority Leader, Rep. Tom \n     DeLay. When leaders of the Republican Party lend their \n     imprimatur to such outrageous claims, including, at the \n     conference, calls for mass impeachment of Federal Judges, it \n     should be of deep concern to all who care about religion. It \n     should also be of concern to President Bush whose silence, in \n     the wake of the claims made both at the conference in \n     Washington and in the upcoming telecast, is alarming.\n       The telecast is scheduled to take place on the second night \n     of the Passover holiday, when Jews around the world gather \n     together to celebrate our religious freedom. It was in part \n     for exactly such freedom that we fled Egypt. It was in part \n     for exactly such freedom that so many of us came to this \n     great land. And it is in very large part because of exactly \n     such freedom that we and our neighbors here have built a \n     nation uniquely welcoming to people of faith--of all faiths. \n     We believe Senator Frist knows these things as well. His \n     association with the scheduled telecast is, in a word, \n     shameful. We call upon him to disassociate himself from the \n     claim that the Senate is participating in a filibuster \n     against faith, and to withdraw his participation from April \n     24th event.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, today, as in previous years, I would like \nto honor the memory of the victims of the Armenian genocide. This year \nmarks the 90th anniversary of the brutal campaign to eliminate \nArmenians from the Turkish Ottoman Empire.\n  April 24 was chosen as the day of remembrance because on that date in \n1915, more than 5,000 Armenians including civic leaders, intellectuals, \nwriters, priests, scientists, and doctors were systematically rounded \nup and murdered. The systematic and intentional killing continued until \n1923, leaving nearly 1.5 million Armenians dead.\n  There are those who attempt to deny that this atrocity ever occurred. \nBut there is no denying the overwhelming historical record and \neyewitness accounts that documented the appalling events of 1915-23, \nwhich occurred during the time of the Ottoman Empire. The United States \nAmbassador to the Ottoman Empire, Henry Morgenthau, stated at the time \nthat ``When the Turkish authorities gave the orders for these \ndeportations, they were merely giving the death warrant to a whole \nrace; they understood this well, and, in their conversations with me, \nthey made no particular attempt to conceal the fact . . . I am \nconfident that the whole history of the human race contains no such \nhorrible episode as this.''\n  The annual remembrance of the Armenian genocide is not a condemnation \nof our ally, the present day Republic of Turkey. But, our mutual \ninterest with our NATO partner and our friendship with, and respect \nfor, the Turkish people are not reasons to ignore historical fact. \nNobel Laureate writer Elie Wiesel has said that the denial of genocide \nconstitutes a ``double killing'' for it seeks to rewrite history by \nabsolving the perpetrators of violence while ignoring the suffering of \nthe victims.\n  During my time in the Senate, I have spoken about the Armenian \nGenocide many times. It is important that we take time to remember and \nhonor the victims, and pay respect to the survivors who are still with \nus. In addition, we must reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that \nhistory is not repeated. This is the highest tribute we can pay to the \nvictims of any genocide.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to honor the memory of the 1.5 \nmillion Armenian genocide victims by recognizing that there are still \nthose in the world who will stop at nothing to perpetuate campaigns of \nhate, intolerance, and unthinkable violence. We must do all we can to \nstop atrocities, like those in the Darfur region of Sudan, from \noccurring as well as continue to provide adequate recovery aid to \nsurvivors. In doing so, we will truly honor the memory of genocide \nvictims and fulfill our responsibilities as a world leader.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 90th \nanniversary of the Armenian genocide, the first genocide of the 20th \ncentury. One and a half million men, women, and children lost their \nlives as a result of the violent massacres and extensive deportation \ncarried out by the Ottoman Turkish rulers against their Armenian \ncitizens. Today, as we remember the bravery and sacrifice of the \nArmenian people in the face of great suffering, we renew our commitment \nto protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of all humanity.\n  Nine decades have passed since the terrible blows that befell the \nArmenian people in 1915. On April 24 of that year, more than 250 \nArmenian intellectuals and civic leaders in Constantinople were rounded \nup and killed, in what was the first step in a systematic plan to \nexterminate the Armenian population in the Ottoman Empire. After the \nround-up, Armenian soldiers serving in the Ottoman army were segregated \ninto labor battalions and brutally murdered. In towns and villages \nacross Anatolia, Armenian leaders were arrested and killed. Finally, \nthe remaining Armenian population, women, children, and the elderly, \nwere driven from their homes and deported to the Syrian Desert.\n  In reality, ``deportation'' was merely a euphemism for death marches. \nOttoman Turkish soldiers allowed brigands and released convicts to kill \nand rape the deportees at will; often the soldiers themselves \nparticipated in the attacks. Driven into the desert without food and \nwater, weakened by the long march, hundreds of thousands of Armenians \nsuccumbed to starvation. In areas of Anatolia where deportation was not \ndeemed practicable, other vicious actions were undertaken. In the towns \nalong the Black Sea coast, for example, thousands of Armenians were \npacked on boats and drowned.\n  The efforts to annihilate the Armenian population were well \ndocumented in first-hand accounts, press reports, and other testimony. \nHenry Morgenthau, the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey at the time, personally \nmade vigorous appeals to stop the genocide, calling it ``a campaign of \nrace extermination'' and ``the greatest horror in history''. Leslie \nDavis, a U.S. diplomat stationed in eastern Anatolia, had a similar \naccount, writing once to the State Department, ``it has been no secret \nthat the plan was to destroy the Armenian race as a race, but the \nmethods used have been more cold-blooded and barbarous, if not more \neffective, than I had at first supposed.'' Even Germany, Ottoman \nTurkey's own ally, condemned the Turkish ``acts of horror.''\n  Despite the testimony from U.S. diplomats who were witness to the \nevents and the abundance of credible, international evidence \ndocumenting the Armenian genocide, there are still those who refuse to \nacknowledge its occurrence. To anyone who doubts this brutal history, I \nwould recommend a visit to the National Archives, where much of the \nevidence collected by our diplomats, along with survivors' accounts, \nare stored.\n  I do not deny that coming to terms with history is a difficult and \npainful process, as those who lived in South Africa and the countries \nof the former Soviet bloc can tell us. But the challenge of acceptance \ndoes not justify the distortion of truth. Falsifying history insults \nthe memory of those who suffered and threatens our very understanding \nof justice and humanity.\n  We have a national interest in seeking that our foreign policy is \ngrounded in the same principles on which this Nation was founded, a \nrespect for the truth, the rule of law, and democratic institutions. \nClearly, this was in part the administration's motivation for its \nrecognition last fall of the genocide in Darfur. In his testimony \nbefore the\n\n[[Page S4149]]\n\nForeign Relations Committee on September 9, Secretary Powell declared \nthat ``the evidence corroborates the specific intent of the \nperpetrators to destroy 'a group in whole or in part'.'' This begs the \nquestion: if Darfur, why not Armenia? Did the Ottomans not seek to \ndestroy the Armenians to this same extent?\n  Although Americans of Armenian origin, many of whom came to this \ncountry fleeing persecution and looking to rebuild, make up a \nrelatively small community among the multitudes that comprise our \nNation, they have enriched our national life beyond proportion to their \nnumbers, in the arts and sciences, in medicine, in business, and in the \ndaily life of communities across the Nation. I support Americans of \nArmenian origin in calling for recognition of the genocide committed \nagainst their relatives 90 years and just a few generations ago. In \nrecognizing this tragedy, we reinforce our commitment to building a \nworld in which history will not repeat itself.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/22/senate-section/article/S4149-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SENATOR GAYLORD NELSON AND EARTH DAY\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize one of our most \nprominent Wisconsinites, Gaylord Nelson, the founder of Earth Day--and \na man who was a driving force for the way the American people and the \nworld view the environment and environmental conservation.\n  Gaylord Nelson was truly a pioneer who had the vision of starting a \nnational day to protect and celebrate our environment when it was not \npolitically popular. What started out as an idea in the early 1960s \nblossomed into a national day of observance with an estimated 20 \nmillion demonstrators participating in the first Earth Day in 1970. \nToday there will be an estimated 500 million people in 167 countries \ntaking part in Earth Day.\n  All over the country, Americans heard about the dangers of lead in \nour water and air, pesticides in our drinking water, and chemicals in \nour soil. An informed public brought pressure on Congress and the \nPresident to act. The movement that started that first Earth Day led to \nthe Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and \nRecovery Act, and Superfund legislation. These are the foundation of \nour environmental law today, and they would not have been possible \nwithout the work and vision of Senator Gaylord Nelson.\n  Senator Nelson entered public service in 1948, after serving 4 years \nin the military during World War II. He served as a Wisconsin State \nsenator, Governor, and then as a U.S. Senator for 18 years. As \nGovernor, he was known for conservation efforts and preserving wetlands \nlong before those causes became popular nationally. As a Senator, he \nbuilt on his environmentalist reputation to further issues including \nthe preservation of the Appalachian Trail corridor and the creation of \nthe national trail system.\n  Earth Day also reminds us that we need to work internationally. We \nneed to engage developing economies like China, India, and Russia to \nhead off major environmental disasters. We are not on this planet \nalone, and we can no longer pretend that environmental damage around \nthe globe does not come back to haunt us. Senator Nelson understood \nthat lesson almost 40 years ago, and he has been teaching it to the \nrest of us ever since.\n  The ideas of Gaylord Nelson are just as important today as they were \n35 years ago. The progress that followed in the wake of the first Earth \nDay must not be forgotten. As a nation and as neighbors in the world we \nmust continue to demand for higher accountability and higher \nenvironmental standards. Today is a reminder for all people to recommit \nthemselves to environmental stewardship and to thank Gaylord Nelson for \nfocusing us on how we impact the environment that sustains us--and the \nlegacy we owe to the generations that follow us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/22/senate-section/article/S4149-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ``GENTLEMAN'' JIM JEFFORDS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to our friend \nand colleague from Vermont, Jim Jeffords, who announced on Wednesday \nthat he will not seek re-election to a fourth term in the Senate in \n2006.\n  If anyone has earned the right to retire from politics, it is Jim \nJeffords. Jim began his public service in 1956, when he was just 22. He \njoined the Navy and served on active duty until 1959, when he entered \nHarvard Law School. He was elected to the Vermont State Senate in 1966, \nnearly 40 years ago. Two years later, he was elected State attorney \ngeneral, and he served in that capacity until 1973.\n  He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1974. \nI think that was a testament to the respect and affection that \nVermonters have for Jim. As my colleagues may recall, 1974 was a pretty \ntough year for Republicans to get elected.\n  Jim served in the House for 14 years, distinguishing himself on the \nAgriculture Committee and the Education and Labor Committee. He showed \nhis fiercely independent streak in 1981 when he was the lone House \nRepublican to vote against President Reagan's tax cuts that caused \nbudget deficits to explode.\n  In 1988, Jim was elected to the Senate, replacing another esteemed \nVermont Republican, former Senator Robert Stafford. In three terms in \nthe Senate, Jim has chaired the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee and the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  It is customary for Members of Congress to focus on a few issues \nduring their career. Jim is unusual because he has significant \naccomplishments in so many areas.\n  Over the course of his 30-year career in Congress, Jim has had an \nenormous impact on every education and job training bill, including the \nelementary and secondary education and the higher education \nreauthorization bills and the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct, IDEA; every farm bill; the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact; and \nevery environmental protection bill, including the landmark 1990 Clean \nAir Act amendments that established the ``cap and trade'' program for \nsulfur dioxide that has done so much to reduce acid rain in our part of \nthe country. Jim has also been one of the staunchest and most effective \nadvocates for the arts, humanities, libraries, and museums. And he has \nbeen a tireless champion of the women, infants and children, WIC, \nnutrition program.\n  Back home in his beloved Vermont, he is known as ``Gentleman Jim.'' \nAnd he is a gentleman, one of the most decent and thoughtful Members \never to have served in the Senate.\n  Because he is so soft-spoken and moderate, people underestimate him. \nOr at least they did, until he decided that President Bush and the \nRepublican majorities in Congress were taking our country in the wrong \ndirection.\n  I know that leaving the Republican Party and becoming an Independent \nwas one of the toughest decisions Jim has ever made. But he believed it \nwas the right thing to do, so he did it, with his characteristic \nhumility and without any rancor.\n  The Senate will be a poorer place without Jim Jeffords' expertise and \ncivility. But as I said a moment ago, if anyone has earned the right to \nretire, it is Jim Jeffords.\n  I know he wants to get back to Vermont and help his wife Liz battle \ncancer. Liz lost her sister recently, and their son-in-law will be \ndeployed to Iraq soon. So Jim and Liz and their family are especially \nin our thoughts and prayers right now.\n  We will miss Jim Jeffords, but history will mark his heroism and his \nenormous contribution to life in America. For that, we are eternally \ngrateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/22/senate-section/article/S4149-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4149-S4150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     RECOGNITION OF DARLEEN HORTON\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I speak today in honor of Darleen \nHorton, a teacher at Chenoweth Elementary in Louisville, KY. Ms. Horton \nwas recently selected by President Bush to receive the Presidential \nAward for Excellency in Mathematics and Science Teaching. Ms. Horton \nwas chosen based on her passion for her subjects and her dedication to \nher students.\n  The Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science \nTeaching identifies outstanding mathematics and science teachers in all \n50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Territories \nand the\n\n[[Page S4150]]\n\nU.S. Department of Defense Schools. This year the awards focused on K-\n6th grade teachers. Each teacher receives $10,000 and a trip to our \nNation's Capital.\n  The requirements for this award are difficult to attain and demand a \ngreat deal of effort on the part of the teacher. It is only given to \nthose teachers who embody excellence in teaching, demonstrate devotion \nto the students, and are able to uphold the high standards that \nexemplify American education at its finest. It recognizes the important \ncontributions teachers make to American young people and to the promise \nof America's future.\n  I am very proud of this Kentucky teacher's accomplishments. Since she \nbegan teaching in 1958, she has been an inspiration to many students. \nIn the news release concerning the Award, one of Ms. Horton's students \nwas quoted as saying, ``Teaching is the art of making learning \nirresistible.'' I have no doubt which teacher that student was talking \nabout. I congratulate Ms. Horton on her ability to make learning \nirresistible and I thank her for the work she has done to educate the \nnext generation of Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/22/senate-section/article/S4150-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONGRATULATING THE AMERICAN LEGACY FOUNDATION ON RECEIVING THE EPA \n                 CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AWARD\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President. I congratulate the American Legacy \nFoundation on the occasion of yesterday's announcement by the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency that the Foundation is a recipient of \nthe agency's Children's Environmental Health Award.\n  The widespread use of tobacco and devastating effects of secondhand \nsmoke create a serious environmental health risk for America's \nchildren. Since its inception 5 years ago, the American Legacy \nFoundation, a non-profit health organization dedicated to building a \nworld where young people reject tobacco and anyone can quit, has worked \nto discourage adult and youth tobacco use and reduce the effects of \nsecondhand smoke.\n  Passive exposure through secondhand smoke, or environmental tobacco \nsmoke, puts children at risk for a range of negative health \nconsequences including asthma, ear infections, bronchitis, pneumonia, \nreduced lung function, respiratory infection, and other chronic \nrespiratory symptoms. According to current population survey data, 13.8 \nmillion kids ages 0 to 17 are exposed to secondhand smoke and 22 \npercent of middle school students and 24 percent of high school \nstudents are exposed to secondhand smoke in the home. American Legacy's \ncampaigns and programs to reduce smoking are helping to reduce the \nnumber of young people breathing environmental tobacco smoke.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency is recognizing the Foundation \nbecause of its initiatives to address the negative health effects of \ntobacco. Outreach efforts include public awareness campaigns and \ninitiatives designed to educate and empower youth to take action \nagainst the environmental health threat that smoking and secondhand \nsmoke poses to them.\n  It is with great pleasure today that I commend the agency for its \nprogram of recognition and the American Legacy Foundation for its \naward. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/22/senate-section/article/S4150-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RANDY WHITE: AN IDAHO HERO\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, many times over the past few years \nthat our military men and women have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, we \nhave heard the accounts of combat, injury and death. Sometimes, we can \nlose sight of the fact that there are people here at home who put their \nlives on the line every day in the execution of their law enforcement \nduties. In September 2003, Randy White, a courageous police officer and \n16-year veteran of the Minidoka County Sheriff's Office put his life on \nthe line to protect innocent bystanders and fellow officers from injury \nand death. In the course of apprehending a fugitive from an Idaho bank \nrobbery in Jackpot, NV, Randy sustained gunshots to his abdomen and \nlegs, one of which was at point-blank range. He still suffers from \nthese injuries, but returned to work very shortly following his \nharrowing experience and has not allowed the extent of his injuries to \nderail his work and activities.\n  Randy and his wife SunDee have four children, Jared, Jordan, Michelle \nand Dalen. Randy is active in the LDS church in Rupert, ID, serving as \nhigh priest group leader. He has devoted many years to the Boy Scouts, \nfirst serving as a Cub Scout Master for 10 years and then a Scout \nMaster for 8. He now holds the position of Scout Committee Chairman. A \nthird generation Idahoan, Randy spent 10 years on active duty with the \nNavy and 19 years in the Navy Reserves. His active duty time included a \ntour in Vietnam. Along with his devotion to his family and dedication \nto his job and community, he has retained his sense of humor, even in \nthe recent trauma he experienced. He said this when asked about the \nshooting, ``I spent two years in Vietnam and was shot at many times but \nnever hit. I came back to sleepy Idaho and rural Nevada and got shot \nthree times!'' Randy is a courageous, hard-working father, husband and \ncommunity leader. I wish him well as he continues his recovery, and \ncongratulate him on his selection to be the new Rupert Chief of Police. \nToday, he is being awarded the FBI Shield of Bravery and Star Award in \nRupert, ID. I am honored to recognize Randy's bravery and courage today \nin the United States Senate, as well as the bravery and courage of all \nother Americans in law enforcement across our country. Randy embodies \nthe spirit of the great State of Idaho. We are all extremely fortunate \nthat individuals like this exceptional man we honor today protect our \nfreedom here at home. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/22/senate-section/article/S4150-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4150-S4151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HONORING THE CAREER OF SECRETARY JAMES ELLENBECKER\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I \nrecognize the leadership and many achievements of South Dakota \nSecretary of Social Services James Ellenbecker. Secretary Ellenbecker \nembodies the highest qualities of public service and has deservedly \nearned the respect and admiration of all those who have had the \nopportunity to work with him. After 35 years of public service, \nSecretary Ellenbecker is retiring as South Dakota's Secretary of Social \nServices, leaving behind an extraordinary legacy.\n  Secretary Ellenbecker began his career with the South Dakota \ngovernment in 1970, and has since dedicated his life to serving the \ncitizens of South Dakota. Working for the State Planning Agency and \nthen the Department of Labor, he ultimately found himself in the \nDepartment of Social Services after providing then-Governor Bill \nJanklow with information he urgently needed late one Friday afternoon. \nFollowing their encounter, Governor Janklow appointed James Secretary \nof Social Services in 1980, a post he has held ever since.\n  During his 25 year tenure as secretary, under the leadership of four \ndifferent governors, Secretary Ellenbecker played a vital role in \nenhancing South Dakota's Social Services infrastructure. As head of one \nof the largest and most complex agencies in the state, he promoted \ninnovations which significantly enhanced its treatment of the elderly, \nchildren and single parent families. His influence on South Dakota's \n1988 Elderly Initiative resulted in a responsive, efficient, and cost-\neffective long-term care system for the elderly, thus easing the \nburdens many families face both financially and emotionally. Under this \nnew plan, more aged residents could live at home and maintain their \nindependence.\n  Secretary Ellenbecker is also responsible for transforming South \nDakota's welfare program. As a result of his vision and dedication, \nSouth Dakota has one of the most successful child support programs in \nthe country. His strategy improved the lives of countless single \nparents by holding absent parents financially responsible for their \nchildren. Similarly, 67,000 uninsured children in South Dakota gained \naccess to health care as a result of Secretary Ellenbecker's diligent \nmanagement of South Dakota's medical services program.\n  I had the privilege of working with Secretary Ellenbecker during my \nyears of service in the South Dakota Legislature. Throughout my years \nin Congress, when constituents contacted my office with issues \ninvolving the South Dakota Department of Social Services, I could \nalways rely upon Secretary\n\n[[Page S4151]]\n\nEllenbecker to provide a thorough review of the situation and supply a \ndetailed response to my questions and the issues raised by the \nconstituents. I appreciated his willingness to share insight into \nissues affecting his department and to coordinate briefings with my \nstaff. Numerous South Dakotans and their families have benefited over \nthe years from our working partnership, and I commend his tireless \ndedication to his agency and to the people of South Dakota.\n  I am honored to share Secretary Ellenbecker's accomplishments with my \ncolleagues, and I publicly commend and thank him for his excellent \nservice to South Dakota. I wish Jim the very best, along with his wife \nKathy and their two children, Bradley and Ryon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/22/senate-section/article/S4151-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MR.

A bill to provide for alternative transportation in certain \nfederally owned or managed areas that are open to the general public; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today is Earth Day, founded 35 years ago \nto celebrate our natural world and encourage efforts to protect its \nfuture. As part of that effort, I am introducing today legislation \nsimilar to measures I have introduced in previous Congresses that will \nhelp protect our Nation's natural resources and improve the visitor \nexperience in our national parks and other public lands. The Transit in \nParks Act, or TRIP, establishes a new Federal transit grant initiative \nto support the development of alternative transportation services for \nour national parks, wildlife refuges, Federal recreational areas, and \nother public lands. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Alexander, \nAkaka, Boxer, Corzine, Dodd, Feinstein, Kennedy, Lautenberg, Levin, \nSalazar, Schumer, Stabenow, and Wyden, who are cosponsors of this \nlegislation.\n  Over the last several years, both the Administration and the Congress \nhave demonstrated support for transit in the parks by including either \nthe TRIP Act or a similar initiative in their proposals for the \nreauthorization of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. \nIn fact, the Transit in Parks program was included in the \nreauthorization bill that passed the Senate by an overwhelming vote \nduring the last Congress. Unfortunately, that legislation was not \ncompleted by the House-Senate conference committee before the end of \nthe Congress, and will have to be taken up anew during the current \nsession.\n  It is in this context that I want to underscore again today some of \nthe principal arguments I have made in past years as to why this \nlegislation is urgently needed. Every year, millions of visitors head \nto our national parks to enjoy the incredible natural heritage with \nwhich our Nation was endowed. But too many of them will spend hours \nlooking for parking, or staring at the bumper of the car in front of \nthem.\n  Clearly, the world has changed significantly since the national parks \nfirst opened in the second half of the nineteenth century, when \nvisitors arrived by stagecoach along dirt roads. At that time, travel \nthrough parklands, such as Yosemite or Yellowstone, was long, \ndifficult, and costly. Not many people could afford or endure such a \ntrip. The introduction of the automobile gave every American greater \nmobility and freedom, which included the freedom to travel and see some \nof our Nation's great natural\n\n[[Page S4152]]\n\nwonders. Early in this century, landscape architects from the National \nPark Service and highway engineers from the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads \ncollaborated to produce many feats of road engineering that opened the \nnational park lands to millions of Americans.\n  Yet greater mobility and easier access now threaten the very \nenvironments that the National Park Service is mandated to protect. The \nongoing tension between preservation and access has always been a \nchallenge for our national park system. Today, record numbers of \nvisitors and cars have resulted in increasing damage to our parks. The \nGrand Canyon alone has more than 4 million visitors a year. As many as \n6,100 vehicles enter the South Rim area in a single summer day. They \ncompete for 1,392 spaces in the Village area. About 150 commercial tour \nbuses enter the South Rim on a typically busy day. During the peak \nsummer season, the entrance route becomes a giant parking lot.\n  In 1975, the total number of visitors to America's national parks was \n190 million. By 2003, that number had risen to 266 million annual \nvisitors--almost equal to one visit by every man, woman, and child in \nthis country. This dramatic increase in visitation has created an \noverwhelming demand on these areas, resulting in severe traffic \ncongestion, visitor restrictions, and in some instances vacationers \nbeing shut out of the parks altogether. The environmental damage at the \nGrand Canyon is visible at many other parks: Yosemite, which has more \nthan 3 million visitors a year; Yellowstone, which has almost 3 million \nvisitors a year and experiences such severe traffic congestion that \naccess has to be restricted; Acadia; Bryce; Zion and many others. We \nneed to solve these problems now or risk permanent harm to our Nation's \nnatural, cultural, and historical heritage.\n  Visitor access to the parks is vital not only to the parks \nthemselves, but to the economic health of their gateway communities. \nFor example, visitors to Yosemite infuse upwards of $300 million a year \ninto the local economy, which supports almost 9,000 jobs. At \nYellowstone, tourists spend more than $200 million annually, which \nsupports more than 6,000 jobs in the park and in adjacent communities. \nIf the parks are forced to close their gates to visitors due to \ncongestion, the economic vitality of the surrounding region would be \njeopardized.\n  The challenge for park management has always been twofold: to \nconserve and protect the Nation's natural, historical, and cultural \nresources, while at the same time ensuring visitor access and enjoyment \nof these sensitive environments. Until now, the principal \ntransportation systems that the Federal Government has developed to \nprovide access into our national parks are roads, primarily for private \nautomobile access. The TRIP legislation recognizes that we need to do \nmore than simply build roads; we must invest in alternative \ntransportation solutions before our national parks are damaged beyond \nrepair.\n  In developing solutions to the parks' transportation needs, this \nlegislation builds upon a 1997 Memorandum of Understanding between \nSecretary of Transportation Rodney Slater and Secretary of the Interior \nBruce Babbitt, in which the two Departments agreed to work together to \naddress transportation and resource management needs in and around \nnational parks. The findings in the MOU are especially revealing: \nCongestion in and approaching many National Parks is causing lengthy \ntraffic delays and backups that substantially detract from the visitor \nexperience. Visitors find that many of the National Parks contain \nsignificant noise and air pollution, and traffic congestion similar to \nthat found on the city streets they left behind.\n  In many National Park units, the capacity of parking facilities at \ninterpretive or scenic areas is well below demand. As a result, \nvisitors park along roadsides, damaging park resources and subjecting \npeople to hazardous safety conditions as they walk near busy roads to \naccess visitor use areas.\n  On occasion, National Park units must close their gates during high \nvisitation periods and turn away the public because the existing \ninfrastructure and transportation systems are at, or beyond, the \ncapacity for which they were designed.\n\n  In addition, the TRIP legislation is designed to implement the \nrecommendations from a comprehensive study of alternative \ntransportation needs in public lands that I was able to include in the \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, as section \n3039. The Federal Lands Alternative Transportation Systems Study \nconfirmed what those of us who have visited our national parks already \nknow: there is a significant and well-documented need for alternative \ntransportation solutions in the national parks to prevent lasting \ndamage to these incomparable natural treasures.\n  The study examined over 200 sites, and identified needs for \nalternative transportation services at two-thirds of those sites. The \nstudy found that implementation of such services can help achieve a \nnumber of desirable outcomes: ``Relieve traffic congestion and parking \nshortages; enhance visitor mobility and accessibility; preserve \nsensitive natural, cultural, and historic resources; provide improved \ninterpretation, education and visitor information services; reduce \npollution; and improve economic development opportunities for gateway \ncommunities.''\n  In fact, the study concluded that ``the provision of transit in \nfederally-managed lands can have national economic implications as well \nas significant economic benefits for local areas surrounding the \nsites.'' The study determined that funding transit needs would support \nthousands of jobs around the country, while also providing a direct \nbenefit to the economy of gateway communities by ``expand[ing] the \nnumber of visits to the site and expand[ing] the amount of visitor \nspending in the surrounding communities.''\n  The study identified ``lack of a dedicated funding source for \ndeveloping, implementing, and operating and maintaining transit \nsystems'' as a key barrier to implementation of alternative \ntransportation in and around federally-managed lands. The Transit in \nParks Act will go far toward helping parks and their gateway \ncommunities overcome this barrier. This new Federal transit grant \nprogram will provide funding to the Federal land management agencies \nthat manage the 388 sites within the National Park System, the National \nWildlife Refuges, Federal recreational areas, and other public lands, \nincluding National Forest System lands, and to their State and local \npartners.\n  The bill's objectives are to develop new and expanded transit \nservices throughout the national parks and other public lands to \nconserve and protect fragile natural, cultural, and historical \nresources and wildlife habitats, to prevent or mitigate adverse impact \non those resources and habitats, and to reduce pollution and \ncongestion, while at the same time facilitating appropriate visitor \naccess and improving the visitor experience. The program will provide \ncapital funds for transit projects, including rail or clean fuel bus \nprojects, joint development activities, pedestrian and bike paths, or \npark waterway access, within or adjacent to national parks and other \npublic lands. The Secretary of Transportation may make funds available \nfor operations as well. The bill authorizes $90 million for this new \nprogram for each of the fiscal years 2005 through 2010, consistent with \nthe level of need identified in the study. It is anticipated that other \nresources--both public and private--will be available to augment these \namounts.\n  The bill formalizes the cooperative arrangement outlined in the 1997 \nMOU between the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of the \nInterior to exchange technical assistance and to develop procedures \nrelating to the planning, selection, and funding of transit projects in \nnational park lands. The bill further provides funds for planning, \nresearch, and technical assistance that can supplement other financial \nresources available to the Federal land management agencies. The \nprojects eligible for funding would be developed through the \ntransportation planning process and prioritized for funding by the \nSecretary of the Interior in consultation and cooperation with the \nSecretary of Transportation. It is anticipated that the Secretary of \nthe Interior would select projects that are diverse in location and \nsize. While major national parks such as the Grand Canyon or \nYellowstone are\n\n[[Page S4153]]\n\nclearly appropriate candidates for significant transit projects under \nthis bill, there are numerous small urban and rural Federal park lands \nthat can benefit enormously from small projects, such as bike paths or \nimproved connections with an urban or regional public transit system. \nNo single project will receive more than 12 percent of the total amount \navailable in any given year. This ensures a diversity of projects \nselected for assistance.\n  In addition, I firmly believe that this program will create new \nopportunities for the Federal land management agencies to partner with \nlocal transit agencies in gateway communities adjacent to the parks, \nboth through the TEA-21 planning process and in developing integrated \ntransportation systems. This will spur new economic development within \nthese communities, as they develop transportation centers for park \nvisitors to connect to transit links into the national parks and other \npublic lands.\n  The ongoing tension between preservation and access has always been a \nchallenge for the National Park Service. Today, that challenge has new \ndimensions, with overcrowding, pollution, congestion, and resource \ndegradation increasing at many of our national parks. This \nlegislation--the Transit in Parks Act--will give our Federal land \nmanagement agencies important new tools to improve both preservation \nand access. Just as we have found in metropolitan areas, transit is \nessential to moving large numbers of people in our national parks--\nquickly, efficiently, at low cost, and without adverse impact. At the \nsame time, transit can enhance the economic development potential of \nour gateway communities.\n  As we begin a new millennium, I cannot think of a more worthy \nendeavor to help our environment and preserve our national parks, \nwildlife refuges, and Federal recreational areas than by encouraging \nalternative transportation in these areas.\n  The Transit in Parks program is strongly supported by the National \nParks Conservation Association, American Public Transportation \nAssociation, Natural Resources Defense Council, Community \nTransportation Association, America Bikes, Friends of the Earth, \nAmalgamated Transit Union, Surface Transportation Policy Project, and \nothers, and I ask unanimous consent that the bill, a section-by-section \nanalysis, and letters of support be printed in the Record.\n  I believe that we have a clear choice before us: we can turn paradise \ninto a parking lot or we can invest in alternatives. As we celebrate \nthe 35th anniversary of Earth Day, I urge my colleagues to support the \nTransit in Parks Act to ensure that our Nation's natural treasures will \nbe preserved for many generations to come.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 890\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

In general\n       Amends Federal transit laws by adding new section 5316, \n     ``Federal Land Transit Program.''\n     Section 3. Findings and purposes\n       The purpose of this Act is to promote the planning and \n     establishment of alternative transportation systems within, \n     and in the vicinity of, the national parks and other public \n     lands to protect and conserve natural, historical, and \n     cultural resources, mitigate adverse impact on those \n     resources, relieve congestion, minimize transportation fuel \n     consumption, reduce pollution, and enhance visitor mobility \n     and accessibility and the visitor experience. The Act \n     responds to the need for alternative transportation systems \n     in the national parks and other public lands identified in \n     the study conducted by the Department of Transportation \n     pursuant to section 3039 of TEA-21, by establishing Federal \n     assistance to finance alternative transportation projects \n     within and in the vicinity of the national parks and other \n     public lands, to increase coordination with gateway \n     communities, to encourage public-private partnerships, and to \n     assist in the research and deployment of improved alternative \n     transportation equipment and methods.\n     Section 4. Definitions\n       This section defines eligible projects and eligible \n     participants in the program. A ``qualified participant'' is a \n     Federal land management agency, or a State or local \n     governmental authority acting with the consent of a Federal \n     land management agency. A ``qualified project'' is a planning \n     or capital alternative transportation project, including rail \n     projects, clean fuel vehicles, joint development activities, \n     pedestrian and bike paths, waterborne access, or projects \n     that otherwise better protect the eligible areas and increase \n     visitor mobility and accessibility. ``Eligible areas'' are \n     lands managed by the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and \n     Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management, as well \n     as any other Federally-owned or -managed park, refuge, or \n     recreational area that is open to the general public. \n     Qualified projects may be located either within eligible \n     areas or in gateway communities in the vicinity of eligible \n     areas.\n     Section 5. Federal agency cooperative arrangements\n       This section implements the 1997 Memorandum of \n     Understanding between the Departments of Transportation and \n     the Interior for the exchange of technical assistance in \n     alternative transportation, the development of alternative \n     transportation policy and coordination, and the establishment \n     of criteria for planning, selection, and funding of projects \n     under this section.\n     Section 6. Types of assistance\n       This section gives the Secretary of Transportation \n     authority to provide Federal assistance through grants, \n     cooperative agreements, inter- or intra-agency agreements, or \n     other agreements, including leasing under certain conditions, \n     for a qualified project under this section.\n     Section 7. Limitation on use of available amounts\n       This section specifies that the Secretary may not use more \n     than 5% of the amounts available under this section for \n     planning, research, and technical assistance; these amounts \n     can be supplemented from other sources. This section also \n     gives the Secretary discretion to make grants to pay for \n     operating expenses. In addition, to ensure a broad \n     distribution of funds, no project can receive more than 12% \n     of the total amount available under this section in any given \n     year.\n     Section 8. Planning process\n       This section requires the Secretaries of Transportation and \n     the Interior to cooperatively develop a planning process \n     consistent with TEA-21 for qualified participants which are \n     Federal land management agencies. If the qualified \n     participant is a State or local governmental authority, the \n     qualified participant shall comply with the TEA-21 planning \n     process and consult with the appropriate Federal land \n     management agency during the planning process.\n     Section 9. Department's share of the costs\n       This section requires that in determining the Department's \n     share of the project costs, the Secretary of Transportation, \n     in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, must \n     consider certain factors, including visitation levels and \n     user fee revenues, coordination in project development with a \n     public or private transit provider, private investment, and \n     whether there is a clear and direct financial benefit to the \n     qualified participant. The intent is to establish criteria \n     for a sliding scale of assistance, with a lower Departmental \n     share for projects that can attract outside investment, and a \n     higher Departmental share for projects that may not have \n     access to such outside resources. In addition, this section \n     specifies that funds from the Federal land management \n     agencies can be counted toward the local share.\n     Section 10. Selection of qualified projects\n       This section provides that the Secretary of the Interior, \n     in cooperation with the Secretary of Transportation, shall \n     prioritize the qualified projects for funding in an annual \n     program of projects, according to the following criteria: (1) \n     Project justification, including the extent to which the \n     project conserves resources, prevents or mitigates adverse \n     impact, and enhances the environment; (2) project location to \n     ensure geographic diversity and both rural and urban \n     projects; (3) project size for a balanced distribution; (4) \n     historical and cultural significance; (5) safety; (6) the \n     extent to which the project would enhance livable \n     communities, reduce pollution and congestion, and improve the \n     mobility of people in the most efficient manner; and (7) any \n     other considerations the Secretary deems appropriate, \n     including visitation levels, the use of innovative financing \n     or joint development strategies, and coordination with \n     gateway communities.\n     Section 11. Undertaking projects in advance\n       This provision applies current transit law to this section, \n     allowing projects to advance prior to receiving Federal \n     funding, but allowing the advance activities to be counted \n     toward the local share as long as certain conditions are met.\n     Section 12. Full funding agreement; Project management plan\n       This section provides that large projects require a project \n     management plan, and shall be carried out through a full \n     funding agreement to the extent the Secretary considers \n     appropriate.\n     Section 13. Relationship to other laws\n       This provision applies certain transit laws to projects \n     funded under this section, and permits the Secretary to apply \n     any other terms or conditions he or she deems appropriate.\n     Section 14. Innovative financing\n       This section provides that a project assisted under this \n     Act can also use funding\n\n[[Page S4156]]\n\n     from a State Infrastructure Bank or other innovative \n     financing mechanism that is available to fund other eligible \n     transit projects.\n     Section 15. Asset management\n       This provision permits the Secretary of Transportation to \n     transfer control over a transit asset acquired with Federal \n     funds under this section to a qualified governmental \n     participant in accordance with certain Federal property \n     management rules.\n     Section 16. Coordination of research and deployment of new \n         technologies\n       This provision allows the Secretary, in cooperation with \n     the Secretary of the Interior, to enter into grants or other \n     agreements for research and deployment of new technologies to \n     meet the special needs of eligible areas under this Act.\n     Section 17. Report\n       This section requires the Secretary of Transportation to \n     submit a report on projects funded under this section to the \n     House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the \n     Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, to be \n     included in the Department's annual project report.\n     Section 18. Authorization\n       $90,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated for the \n     Secretary to carry out this program for each of the fiscal \n     years 2005 through 2010.\n     Section 19. Conforming amendments\n       Conforming amendments to the transit title, including an \n     amendment to allow 0.5% per year of the funds made available \n     under this section to be used for project management \n     oversight.\n     Section 20. Technical amendments\n       Technical corrections to the transit title in TEA-21.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 21, 2005.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     309 Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The undersigned organizations want \n     to thank you for introducing the Transit in Parks Act that \n     will enhance transit options for access to and within our \n     public lands. We applaud your leadership and foresight in \n     recognizing the critical role that mass transit can play in \n     protecting our public lands and improving the visitor \n     experience.\n       Visitation to America's public lands has skyrocketed during \n     the past two decades. The national parks, for example, have \n     seen their visitation increase from 190 million visitors in \n     1975 to approximately 277 million visitors last year. \n     Increased public interest in these special places has placed \n     substantial burdens on the very resources that draw people to \n     these lands. As more and more individuals crowd into our \n     public lands--typically by automobi1e--fragi1e habitat, \n     endangered plants and animals, unique cultural treasures, and \n     spectacular natural resources and vistas are being damaged \n     from air and water pollution, noise intrusion, and \n     inappropriate use.\n       As outlined in your legislation, the establishment of a \n     program within the Department of Transportation dedicated to \n     enhancing transit options in and adjacent to public lands \n     will have a powerful, positive effect on the future \n     ecological and cultural integrity of these areas. Your \n     initiative will boost the role of alternative transportation \n     solutions for many areas, particularly those most heavily \n     impacted by visitation such as Yellowstone-Grand Teton, \n     Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Acadia, and the Great Smoky Mountains \n     national parks. For instance, development of transportation \n     centers and auto parking lots outside the parks, complemented \n     by the use of buses, vans, or rail systems, and/or bicycle \n     and pedestrian pathways would provide much more efficient \n     means of handling the crush of visitation. The benefit of \n     such systems has already been demonstrated in a number of \n     parks such as Zion and Cape Cod.\n       Equally important, the legislation will provide an \n     excellent opportunity for the NPS, BLM and FWS to enter into \n     public/private partnerships with States, localities, and the \n     private sector, providing a wider range of transportation \n     options than exists today. These partnerships could leverage \n     funds that the federal land managing agencies currently have \n     great difficulty accessing.\n       Finally, we support the legislation because it addresses \n     the critical lack of resources for maintaining and operating \n     alternative transportation systems once they are established.\n       We wholeheartedly endorse your bill as a creative new \n     mechanism to protect and enhance both the resources and \n     visitor experiences associated with America's public lands.\n       We look forward to working with you to move this \n     legislation to enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n       Thomas C.

Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n         Urban Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: Thank you for sharing with us a copy \n     of the ``Transit in Parks Act'' (TRIP) which would amend \n     federal transit law at Chapter 53, title 49 U.S.C. The Act \n     would authorize federal assistance to certain federal \n     projects and state and local entities to finance mass \n     transportation projects generally for the purpose of \n     addressing transportation congestion and mobility issues at \n     national parks and other eligible areas. In addition, the \n     legislation would encourage enhanced cooperation between the \n     Departments of Transportation and Interior regarding joint \n     efforts of those federal agencies to encourage the use of \n     public transportation at national parks.\n       I am pleased to support your efforts to improve mobility in \n     our national parks. Public transportation clearly has much to \n     offer citizens who visit these national treasures, where \n     congestion and pollution are significant--and growing--\n     problems. Moreover, this legislation should broaden the base \n     of support for public transportation, a key principle the \n     American Public Transportation Association has been \n     advocating for many years.\n       I applaud you for writing the legislation, and look forward \n     to continuing to work with you and your staff. Please let us \n     know what we can do to help your initiative!\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                William W. Millar,\n     President\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 19, 2005.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the more than 550,000 \n     members of the Natural Resources Defense Council, I am \n     writing to support your Transit in Parks Act. Many of our \n     national parks are suffering from the impacts of too many \n     automobiles: traffic congestion, air and water pollution, and \n     disturbance of natural ecosystems resulting in both the \n     degradation of natural and cultural resources and the \n     visitor's experience. Providing dedicated funding for transit \n     projects in our national parks, as your bill would do, is a \n     priority solution to these problems in the National Park \n     System.\n       It is essential in many parks to get visitors out of their \n     automobiles by providing attractive and effective transit \n     services to and within national parks. A sound practical \n     transit system will improve the visitor's experience--making \n     it more convenient and enjoyable for families and visitors of \n     all ages. Better transit is critical to diversifying \n     transportation choices and providing better access for the \n     benefit of all park visitors. Air pollutants from automobiles \n     driven by visitors can exacerbate respiratory health \n     problems, damage vegetation, and contribute to haze that too \n     often obliterates park vistas. And the more we get people \n     into public transit and out of their inividual cars, the more \n     energy will be conserved. Lastly, a positive park transit \n     experience will demonstrate to visitors that transit could \n     serve them at home too, which should provide the indirect \n     benefit of higher ridership on other transit systems, in \n     short, this bill would help to reduce reliance on automobiles \n     by authorizing the funding so our national parks can build \n     and operate efficient and convenient transit systems.\n       With their great biodiversity and their recreational and \n     educational value for all Americans, national parks make up \n     some the nation's most valuable land. As driving increases in \n     parks and on our roadways, it is crucial to find ways to use \n     existing infrastructure more efficiently and to reduce the \n     impacts of transportation onthese vital and sensitive lands.\n       We commend and thank you for your dedication and leadership \n     on this issue and more generally to the protection of our \n     national parks. Please look to us to help you establish \n     better public transit in our national parks.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles M. Clusen,\n     Senior Policy Analyst.\n                                  ____\n\n           Amalgamated Transit Union, Office of the International \n                                                        President,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 12, 2005.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n         Urban Affairs, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the more than 180,000 \n     members of the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU), the largest \n     labor organization representing mass transit, over-the-road, \n     and school bus drivers in the United States and Canada, I am \n     writing to express our strong support for the ``Transit in \n     Parks Act'' (TRIP), which would provide increased funding for \n     public transportation in national parks and other public \n     lands. Without question, this legislation begins to address \n     the major congestion and environmental issues that currently \n     exist in U.S. National Parks from coast to coast.\n       Through the years, Federal transit programs have enabled \n     public transportation providers to assist urban communities. \n     to\n\n[[Page S4157]]\n\n     significantly reduce congestion and improve air quality by \n     investing in mass transit, either bus or rail. Like you, we \n     believe that this can also be achieved in our national parks, \n     which during peak months become the equivalent of American \n     cities, inundated with hundreds of millions of visitors each \n     year. Therefore, ATU supports the adoption of the Transit in \n     Parks Act as part of TEA 21's reauthorization.\n       We would welcome the opportunity to discuss this and any \n     other transit issues with you or your staff at any time. As \n     always, thank you for your continuous support of the people \n     who proudly provide public transportation services for \n     millions of Americans each day, and for recognizing that mass \n     transit can provide benefits beyond our cities and suburbs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Warren S. George,\n     International President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 21, 2005.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: the Community Transportation \n     Association continues to support your efforts to provide \n     alternative transportation strategies in our national parks \n     and other public lands. Our association's 7,500 members \n     provide public and community transportation services in many \n     of the smaller communities that border these national parks, \n     monuments, and recreational areas, and our association has \n     members actively involved in providing transportation \n     services at several national parks.\n       All of us know the danger that congestion and increases in \n     traffic pose for the future of these sites and locations. \n     Your continued sponsorship of the Transit in Parks Act is an \n     important step in helping ensure that America's natural \n     beauty and historic treasures remain a continuous part of our \n     nation's future. We have members throughout the country whose \n     experiences support the principle that public transit \n     investments in and near national parks and public lands can \n     improve mobility, support the economic vitality of these \n     parks' ``gateway communities,'' and make dramatic \n     improvements in the experiences of park visitors, employees, \n     and community residents alike.\n       We appreciate your dedicated efforts and initiative in this \n     regard, and look forward to helping you advance this \n     important piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Dale J.
