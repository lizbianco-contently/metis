Mr. President, today we return to the comprehensive \nimmigration bill. We had a very constructive day and evening yesterday. \nI appreciate everyone's patience and participation in moving the debate \nalong. We worked late last night, up to about 11 o'clock, and we had \nvotes over the course of the day and the night. Because of that, and \nour agreement for multiple votes on Monday afternoon, we were able to \nannounce no rollcall votes for today.\n  I do encourage Members to take advantage of the session today if they \ndesire to speak on the immigration legislation, to look over amendments \nthat are likely to be proposed, and to spend time getting ready for \nthose amendments once they reach the floor. Today would be a great \nopportunity to come to speak on some of those amendments in advance as \nwell.\n  It is my intention to complete action on the bill next week, and it \nwould expedite the process if Members would use the time productively \ntoday and Monday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/19/senate-section/article/S4819-6", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4819-S4820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BROADCAST DECENCY ENFORCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I want to comment on a couple of issues and take advantage \nof the time that we have this morning.\n  Late last night, in closing, we passed the Broadcast Decency \nEnforcement Act to address abuses and potential abuses in the broadcast \narena and to raise indecency fines by a factor of 10.\n  We told broadcasters in a loud and direct and unanimous voice--it was \na unanimous vote last night: Clean up your act or face the \nconsequences.\n  When families are watching Sunday night football games, they should \nnot have to brace themselves for a televised striptease. I am, of \ncourse, referring to Janet Jackson's infamous ``wardrobe malfunction'' \nduring that 2004 Super Bowl.\n  While this particular incident represented a new low in broadcasting, \nunfortunately, as all of us know who do watch television regularly, it \nwas not an isolated incident. Numerous studies have shown that prime-\ntime network programming is growing, has grown, and continues to grow \nover time increasingly coarse, even during the evening family hour when \nchildren are most likely to be watching TV either by themselves or with \ntheir other family members or parents.\n  That Super Bowl stunt was just the latest in the ever-worsening \nattempts to grab out commercial attention. It is obvious why this tried \nto appeal to a low, broad, very coarse common denominator--to make \npeople look, and to make people look to increase those commercial \nratings and thus end up accumulating more money.\n  Between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m, when there is a reasonable \nchance that children are watching, broadcasters are required to keep \ntelevision clean. The requirement is there. Families should be able to \nturn on that television during that period of time and trust the \nbroadcasters to abide by the law. Broadcasters should know that if they \ncross the line the penalties will be serious. That is why this \nlegislation is so important.\n  Broadcasting has become such big business that, steadily, the current \nFCC fines have become a little drop in this sloshing bucket of profits. \nThis bill, the bill we passed late last night, the Broadcast Decency \nEnforcement Act, will help change all of that. The fact is, airwaves \nare a limited natural resource that we, in essence, all own.\n  In return for free access to this limited space, this limited supply, \nbroadcasters are obligated to serve the public's interest. If adults \nwant to watch adult material in the middle of the day, there are plenty \nof pay stations they can go out and purchase so they can see that \nmaterial. And late at night, between 10 o'clock and 6 a.m, the FCC \nrules allow a safe harbor for material adults can handle but kids \nreally should not be seeing. When they know kids are watching on free \nTV, broadcasters should not be able to shrug their shoulders, to look \nthe other way, to disobey the rules.\n  I hope to see the decency bill we passed last night become actual law\n\n[[Page S4820]]\n\nand toughen those penalties. I hope TV becomes smarter, becomes more \nengaging. That is a task not for us but for the people who make TV. Our \njob as legislators is to protect those basic standards of decency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/19/senate-section/article/S4820-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LITTLE BOY BLUE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, briefly on another issue, just because each \nday we are bombarded with so much bad news, disappointing news, news \nthat makes you want to put the newspaper down or turn off the \ntelevision, I want to share with my colleagues a piece of good news, \nheartwarming news, news that is reflective of the compassion that we as \nan American people have, that we have the opportunity to express at \ntimes, and this particular incident, I believe, represents it quite \nconcretely. It is about a very special 7-year-old boy from Afghanistan.\n  His name is Mohammad Omar. He suffers from a congenital anomaly, a \nbirth defect that is not all that rare but we didn't know how to treat \nuntil the beginning of the 1940s, 1950s, when the research was \ninitially done. Before that, it had a 100-percent mortality rate. As \nyou will tell from the outcome of the story, surgery has changed that.\n  His defect is called tetralogy of Fallot. Tetralogy means there are \nfour things--It doesn't matter what they are--but it is a hole between \ntwo chambers of the heart; a ventricular septal defect it is called. \nThe second is an outflow tract obstruction from the right ventricle to \nthe lungs, and therefore the obstruction there means the blood does not \nget up through the lungs. There is an overriding VSD and then there is \nsome right ventricular hypertrophy--the right side of the heart is big \nand very muscular.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Would you like me to \nhelp explain some of that for you?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is three of the four tetralogies. I know my colleague \nknows the fourth is that right ventricular hypertrophy. I would be \nhappy to yield to the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. I have forgotten quite a bit about that, so maybe you \nshould go ahead and explain it.\n  Mr. FRIST. I will be brief. But what is fascinating is that with \nscience and with the great progress that is made, today it can be \ncured, where before it couldn't. What is interesting about the overall \nstory is that Mohammed's father, Fateh, about a year ago--this is over \nin Afghanistan--brought his son to an American military hospital, \nreaching out, not knowing where to go. The province is the Khowst \nProvince. He happened to run across my colleagues, or colleagues in the \nmilitary, who are cardiologists, who are heart specialists. And looking \nat the blue appearance--because you don't get this oxygen flow through \nthe heart, blood through the right side of the heart--they said it was \nprobably tetralogy of Fallot.\n  With a few tests they made the diagnosis and they petitioned Mohammed \nto come to the States for treatment, but the visa applications by \nMohammed and his dad, Fateh, were initially denied. But somewhere out \nthere was a little angel looking out, and sure enough they ran into a \nfellow who happened to be a student of mine back at Vanderbilt, Dr. \nSloane Guy, whom I hadn't seen for a while, and I was with him at a \ntime when he was looking to the future, didn't know where he was going, \nwhether it was heart medicine, cardiology, heart surgery. He was on \nactive duty in Afghanistan.\n  He called me and said: Isn't there anything that we can do? So, \nworking together, I--and this is really compassion, reaching out, going \nbeyond what a lot of people usually do--but working with the State \nDepartment, again reaching out, the Department of Defense, we were able \nto get approval for young Mohammed to come here and, indeed, on \nTuesday, just 3 days ago, they arrived at Andrews Air Force Base.\n  Yesterday morning, Mohammed underwent surgery at the Children's \nNational Medical Center. Straightforward surgery, it would be described \nby Dr. Jonas, Richard Jonas, who is a renowned cardiac surgeon, fellow \ncardiac surgeon, but does the surgery over at Children's National \nMedical Center--fairly routine surgery, although it was pretty complex \nsurgery in truth, repairing the hole between the ventricles--the right \noutflow obstruction--and hooking things back up so they flow normally. \nRight now the young boy is still in the intensive care unit. That is \nthe normal course, but he is recuperating nicely. You never want to \npredict the long-term outcome because in the first 5 or 6 days anything \ncan happen.\n  But my point is, that is the kind of story you don't hear. It took a \nlot of people reaching out, coming together, the best of the public \nsector, the best of the private sector, the best of the generosity of \ndoctors, the compassion of individuals in Afghanistan who made the \ninitial diagnosis coming together with the result that just a few miles \nfrom here is unfolding.\n  Larry King, whom you know, although sometimes we are here after he is \non at night, many of us turn him on at night, just about every night--\nthe Larry King Cardiac Foundation provided much of the financial \nsupport to bring him here. The Afghan Embassy, right now, is providing \nsupport for the family and support with interpreters and food and the \nlike. Dr. Jonas and his cardiac surgical team, including the people who \nrun the part of the pulmonary bypass machine, and all the technicians \nthere who contributed their time, the great resource of the Children's \nNational Medical Center, which is right here--everybody came together \nto make this story possible.\n  To me, this reflects the stories that never get told. But it also \nshows how humanitarian outreach can be used as a currency for peace. It \nis built around trust. It is built around outreach. It is built around \nselflessness and going beyond faces that you see every day; everybody \nworking towards a common goal.\n  So I just wanted to take the opportunity to tell that very brief \nstory. I do wish Mohammed a speedy recovery and wish his dad the very \nbest. While waiting in Afghanistan, not knowing whether or not this \nlifesaving surgery--without surgery he would die--without knowing \nwhether this lifesaving surgery would be provided by people in a \ncountry they had no idea even existed, in terms of the people, he \nbecame known as the little blue boy; Little Boy Blue, I guess, is what \nthey called him because of that blue appearance.\n  So it will be a great story because that blue appearance, Little Boy \nBlue no longer will be Little Boy Blue. He will be a healthy young \nchild with a normal lifespan thereafter.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/19/senate-section/article/S4820-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, while the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader are still in the Chamber, I wish to express my \ngratitude to each of them, as well as the managers of the comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill that is in the Chamber and that we have been \ndebating this week, for the progress we have made. I think it has been \nin the greatest traditions of the Senate that we have taken a \ncontroversial subject where debate that has been long overdue and we \nhave had an open and honest and vigorous debate on many important \namendments that have helped improve the bill, from my perspective. But \nthis is the Senate at its best. While we know we will not always agree \nwith one another, there is one place on the face of the planet\n\n[[Page S4821]]\n\nwhere we have the freedom, we have the opportunity to have debates and \ntry to build consensus.\n  I know there are some--and I was just on a talk show moments before I \ncame to the floor, and the person hosting that had expressed some \nfrustration about what has been going on here, and I encouraged him to \nthink of this according to the old adage that watching legislation \nbeing made is somehow like watching sausage being made.\n  Parenthetically, I note sometimes that we maybe give sausage-making a \nbad name, but in all sincerity the important thing is that we are \nhaving the debate, we are having votes, and majorities are ruling. I do \nnot necessarily always like the outcome of those votes. Sometimes I do. \nBut the fact is that we are having votes and we are letting the process \nmove forward. Hopefully we will have a comprehensive reform bill passed \nby the Senate, a bill we can be proud of and will then be sent to the \nPresident's desk for consideration and possible signature. My hope is \nwe will continue to have this process move forward and have an \nopportunity to call up additional amendments.\n  I wanted to speak briefly about an amendment I intend to offer not \ntoday but at a later time. I have previously spoken about this issue.\n  The compromise bill that is currently in the Chamber contains \nlanguage that prohibits information sharing and restricts how the \nDepartment of Homeland Security may use information submitted in \napplications. The text in the underlying bill is exactly the same as \nthat contained in the 1986 amnesty legislation. Twenty years ago now, \nwe know from hindsight and experience, those provisions led to hundreds \nof thousands of ineligible aliens receiving green cards. The amendment \nI intend to offer does not eliminate the confidentiality provisions. It \ndoes, however, state that once an individual's application is denied, \nthere is no longer a need for confidentiality, and that information may \nbe shared with law enforcement personnel, that may be necessary to \ninvestigate fraud and bring others to justice.\n  The underlying bill says that information furnished by an applicant \ncan only be used to make a determination on that specific application. \nThe information may also be used in connection with a criminal \ninvestigation or prosecution. But if the Department of Homeland \nSecurity identifies a pattern of fraud, it would be prohibited from \nusing that information in one fraudulent application to deny another \napplication that was submitted as part of a criminal conspiracy. The \nsame restrictions were included in the 1986 legislation program, and \nthat caused widespread fraud and abuse. There is no reason to treat \nlegalization applications any differently from any other immigration \napplication submitted to the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The New York Times described the 1986 agricultural worker amnesty as \n``One of the most extensive immigration frauds ever perpetrated against \nthe United States Government.'' Although the estimated size of the \nillegal alien population engaged in agricultural work in the 1980s was \nonly about 300,000 to 400,000 out of a total agricultural workforce of \n2.5 million, 1.3 million aliens were amnestied under the program.\n  Let me make sure that is clear. Although the estimated size of the \nillegal alien population engaged in agricultural work in the 1980s was \nonly 300,000 to 400,000, 1.3 million aliens were amnestied under that \nprogram.\n  The confidentiality provisions of the 1986 act were credited with \ncausing the widespread fraud and abuse. In 1999, the General Counsel \nduring the Clinton administration testified before the House that ``the \nconfidentiality restrictions of the law in the 1986 amnesty also \nprevented the Immigration and Naturalization Service from pursuing \ncases of possible fraud detected during the application process.''\n  In 1995, a man by the name of Jose Velez, the ex-president of LULAC, \nwas found guilty of immigration fraud after he filed fraudulent \napplications under the 1986 amnesty. The task force that brought down \nthat particular conspiracy resulted in guilty pleas or convictions of \n20 individuals who together were responsible for filing false \nlegalization applications for in excess of an estimated 11,000 \nunqualified aliens. In other words, 20 people pled guilty to falsified \nlegalization applications for in excess of 11,000 unqualified aliens.\n  Between March of 1988 and January 1991, Velez and his coconspirators \nsubmitted approximately 3,000 fraudulent applications. In connection \nwith the 1986 legalization program, there were 920 arrests, 822 \nindictments, 513 convictions for fraud and related criminal activity.\n\n  (Mr. Isakson assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. This is not about history. This is about what is also \nhappening even today. I am reminded of the report of the 9/11 \nCommission and the studies and investigations we conducted after 9/11 \nwhich indicated a consensus that we had to bring down some of the \nstovepipes that prohibited information sharing in our intelligence \ncommunity. Essentially this amendment is designed to bring down the \nstovepipes that have prohibited the Department of Homeland Security \nfrom sharing information that would lead to discovery of evidence of \nmassive fraud in our immigration system. I hope that when the amendment \nis called up, when we have a chance to vote on it, my colleagues will \nsupport it.\n  But again, this is not just about history. This is about what is \nhappening today. I have in front of me a news release dated May 19, \n2006, from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency entitled \n``Six People Indicted in Multi-State Amnesty Fraud Conspiracy.''\n  This is out of Atlanta, GA, which may be of particular interest to \nthe Presiding Officer. Several individuals--it looks like six \nindividuals were indicted by a Federal grand jury on May 9, 2006, on \ncharges of conspiracy to encourage and induce aliens to reside \nunlawfully in the United States and to make false statements in \napplications presented to the Department of Homeland Security. They \nwere charged in separate counts for making false statements in \napplications presented to the Department of Homeland Security, and also \nthere were two counts of money laundering.\n  The U.S. attorney in charge described this conspiracy in these words:\n\n       The six individuals indicted in this conspiracy were \n     involved in a multi-state scheme to solicit immigrants who \n     were illegally present in the United States to file \n     fraudulent applications for amnesty with the Department of \n     Homeland Security. The defendants, as part of a money making \n     scheme, allegedly assisted immigrants who did not meet \n     legitimate amnesty program requirements to file applications \n     containing false statements. This office--\n\n  The Office of the U.S. Attorney--\n\n     is committed to vigorous investigation and prosecution of \n     schemes such as this one as part of the President's \n     initiative to strengthen enforcement of our Nation's \n     immigration laws.\n\n  The U.S. attorney goes on to say:\n\n       Not only did these individuals seek to exploit our legal \n     immigration system for personal financial gain, they used \n     their positions as religious leaders to prey upon the \n     immigrant community.\n\n  That statement was attributed to Ken Smith, special agent in charge \nof the Office of Immigration and Custom Enforcement. That office is \nlocated in Atlanta. He goes on to say:\n\n       This case highlights the importance of ICE's close \n     partnership with other law enforcement agencies as we seek to \n     dismantle criminal document and benefit fraud networks.\n\n  Mr. President, I will not read the rest of this news release, but I \nwill ask unanimous consent that at the end of my remarks this document \nbe made part of the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  So, Mr. President, we have had a productive week in the Senate \ndealing with the issue of comprehensive immigration reform. Each of us \nhas perhaps won some and lost some in terms of the amendments we \nfavored or disfavored, but I think it has been a good week for the \nSenate, a good week for the cause of securing our borders and restoring \npublic respect for our laws. At the same time, as we continue to be a \nnation that does welcome legal immigration, one of the things that I \nwill say that I hope we continue to focus on is what in our immigration \nsystem really is in America's best interest--recognizing that we can't \nsimply open our borders to anyone and everyone who wants to come to the \nUnited States or we would be swamped by a veritable tsunami of \nhumanity.\n\n[[Page S4822]]\n\n  We should continue to be a welcoming country but one that respects \nnot only our heritage as a nation of immigrants but also respects our \nheritage as a nation of laws. Indeed, at this time, we are trying to \nexport that heritage as not only the Democratic country that respects \ndemocracy but one that respects the rule of law in places such as \nAfghanistan and Iraq, and so we need to tend to business here at home.\n  But as we continue to debate and discuss and hopefully pass laws that \nare in America's best interest and improve our system, we will look at \nexactly what type of legal immigration we should encourage. I would ask \nmy colleagues to not only focus on the massive low-skilled immigration \nthat is part of this underlying bill but also focus on those people who \nhave special talents and special educational credentials and \nexperience, highly skilled individuals whom we ought to encourage to \ncome to this country and, if they want to become American citizens, \nprovide them an opportunity to do so. When we look at the costs \nassociated with the underlying bill, what we have learned is low-\nskilled, poorly educated individuals are more likely to be a financial \nburden on the American taxpayer than those who are highly skilled and \nhighly educated. Indeed, those highly skilled and highly educated legal \nimmigrants whom we ought to be encouraging to come to the United States \nand become part of this great country are people who are going to help \nAmerica to continue to be competitive in the global marketplace. That \nincludes, of course, foreign students who study at our universities.\n\n  I personally believe that when someone graduates with one of these \nimportant advance degrees in math, science, engineering, the very sorts \nof skills and talents which will make America competitive, we ought to \ngive them preferential treatment when it comes to their application for \nlegal permanent residency and putting them in line for American \ncitizenship, if that is their wish.\n  I hope what is not lost in all of this debate about immigration \nreform is America's great heritage as a nation of immigrants, our \nheritage as a nation that believes in the rule of law. What that means \nto me is we ought to be encouraging legal immigration that is in the \nbest interests of this Nation while discouraging and preventing illegal \nimmigration by comprehensive border security, interior enforcement, \nworksite verification, and sanctions against employers who cheat, while \nwe also create a legal immigration system to deal with the workforce \nneeds and our prosperity in America going forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                      U.S. Immigration and Customs\n\n\n                                                  Enforcement,\n\n                                                     May 19, 2006.\n\n                              NEWS RELEASE\n\n      Six People Indicted in Multi-State Amnesty Fraud Conspiracy\n\n       Atlanta, GA.--Emma Gerald, 54, of Kennesaw, Ruy Brasil \n     Silva, 49, of Roswell, Marcos Amador, 19, of Atlanta, Denise \n     Silva, 45, of Roswell, Douglas Ross, 29, of Marietta, and \n     Hudson Araujo, 27, of Brockton, Massachusetts, were indicted \n     by a federal grand jury on May 9, 2006, on charges of \n     conspiracy to encourage and induce aliens to reside \n     unlawfully in the United States and to make false statements \n     in applications presented to the Department of Homeland \n     Security (DHS). Emma Gerald, Ruy Brasil Silva, and Marcos \n     Amador are charged in separate counts for making false \n     statements in applications presented to DHS. Emma Gerald is \n     also charged with two counts of money laundering.\n       Ross was arraigned today in Atlanta. Araujo was taken into \n     custody by federal agents in Brockton, Massachusetts, and had \n     his initial appearance in federal court in Boston today. \n     Denise Silva is a fugitive being sought by federal law \n     enforcement authorities. Gerald, Ruy Brasil Silva, and Amador \n     were indicted on related charges on February 14, 2006. Gerald \n     was released on a secured bond and Ruy Brasil Silva and \n     Amador are in custody. Their arraignments on this indictment \n     have not yet been scheduled.\n       United States Attorney David E. Nahmias said, ``The six \n     individuals indicted in this conspiracy were involved in a \n     multi-state scheme to solicit immigrants who were illegally \n     present in the United States to file fraudulent applications \n     for amnesty with the Department of Homeland Security. The \n     defendants, as part of a moneymaking scheme, allegedly \n     assisted immigrants who did not meet legitimate amnesty \n     program requirements to file applications containing false \n     statements. This office is committed to vigorous \n     investigation and prosecution of schemes such as this one, as \n     part of the President's initiative to strengthen enforcement \n     of the Nation's immigration laws.''\n       ``Not only did these individuals seek to exploit our legal \n     immigration system for personal financial gain, they used \n     their positions as religious leaders to prey upon the \n     immigrant community,'' said Ken Smith, Special Agent-in-\n     Charge of ICE's office of Investigations in Atlanta. ``The \n     case highlights the importance of ICE's close partnerships \n     with other law enforcement agencies as we seek to dismantle \n     criminal document and benefit fraud networks.''\n       According to United States Attorney Nahmias, the charges \n     and other information presented in court: Emma Gerald, the \n     pastor of a local church, held herself out as a consultant to \n     aliens seeking amnesty in the United States. Gerald did \n     business under the name ``EJ Consulting Services.'' Under a \n     program known as the ``Catholic Social Services/Lulac/Newman \n     Amnesty Program'' (the ``CSS Amnesty Program''), certain \n     aliens who were illegally in the United States were eligible \n     to apply for temporary residence in this country. In order to \n     be eligible, an alien had to meet certain requirements, \n     including having been present in the United States unlawfully \n     from prior to January 1982; and having previously applied for \n     temporary residence but having been turned down because the \n     alien left and re-entered the United States without the \n     permission of the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service (INS).\n       Gerald conducted meetings at Marietta churches to solicit \n     aliens, largely Brazilian nationals who were illegally \n     present in the United States, to apply for the CSS Amnesty \n     Program. Ruy Brasil Silva was a pastor of one of the churches \n     and made it available to Gerald for the meetings. Marcos \n     Amador acted as a translator and assistant to Gerald. Gerald \n     advised the Brazilian aliens that the Department of Homeland \n     Security did not have records to establish whether an alien \n     met the CSS Amnesty Program requirements as to length of \n     residence in the United States or previous unsuccessful \n     application for amnesty, so that they could apply even if \n     they did not qualify. Over the course of the scheme, Gerald \n     charged the aliens between $300 per person/$500 per married \n     couple to approximately $600 per person/$1100 per married \n     couple. For an extra fee, Gerald and Amador would provide the \n     aliens with letters falsely stating that they met the program \n     requirements as to length of residence and previous \n     application for amnesty. Douglas Ross, Gerald's son, attended \n     the meetings, assisting Gerald with preparing and collecting \n     applications and collecting money from the aliens.\n       Gerald, Ruy Brasil Silva, Amador, Ross, and Denise Silva \n     conducted similar meetings in Florida, collecting money from \n     Brazilian aliens to assist them in filing fraudulent \n     applications. Gerald, Ross, and Hudson Araujo conducted \n     meetings in Brockton, Massachusetts.\n       The United States is seeking forfeiture of Gerald's \n     Kennesaw, Georgia home and several vehicles, including \n     Gerald's Mercedes-Benz automobile, on the grounds that they \n     were purchased with proceeds of the criminal scheme or were \n     used to facilitate the criminal activity. The United States \n     is also seeking forfeiture of several bank and investment \n     accounts, on the grounds that criminal proceeds were \n     deposited into the accounts.\n       The indictment charges one count of conspiracy against all \n     the defendants, one count of false statement against Gerald \n     and Amador, one count of false statement against Gerald and \n     Ruy Brasil Silva, and two counts of money laundering against \n     Gerald. The conspiracy charge and false statement charges \n     each carry a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison and a fine \n     of up to $250,000. The money laundering charges each carry a \n     maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to \n     $250,000.\n       This case is being investigated by special agents of the \n     Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs \n     Enforcement, and postal inspectors of the United States \n     Postal Inspection Service.\n       Assistant United States Attorneys Teresa D. Hoyt and Jon-\n     Peter Kelly are prosecuting the case.\n       Members of the public are reminded that the indictment \n     contains only allegations. A defendant is presumed innocent \n     of the charges and it will be the government's burden to \n     prove a defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have had some good debate this week \non the immigration bill that is before the Senate. We made some \nprogress toward improving the legislation. I think to some degree the \ngood and decent and deeply felt views of the American people are \nbeginning to be heard--but not clearly enough in this body. We still \nneed to listen to them more.\n  I submit that on every single issue the American people have it \nright. We discussed last night and debated last night some key issues. \nI know one of the supporters of the bill described this as a difficult \nissue, complicated, emotional, but we are trying to do something. He \nsuggested that was courageous and we should be not afraid to move \nforward. Well, we do need to move forward but we did not have to move \nforward on this bill. We could have moved forward, as the House did, \ntaking the first step to ensure that we have a legitimate legal system \nof enforcement that works, and then we could move on to the \ncomprehensive solution of what to do with the illegal alien population \nand the future immigration policies of the United states. We can do \nthat separately, or we can try to do them together at the same time.\n  I was inclined to believe that we weren't ready to deal with this \nissue comprehensively. That is why I thought the House's idea wasn't so \nbad. But it was complained about on this side, with great moral \nsuperiority, that their approach to security first was somehow bad and \nnot worthy of respect.\n  I think it is very worthy of respect. In fact, I think this bill \nwould show that we probably would have been better off to have followed \ntheir lead. This is the great Senate of the United States of America, \nand we are not here just to do something, anything. We are here to do \nthe right thing. We are here to confront one of the big issues of our \ntime, and to do it in a way that is consistent with our laws and our \nvalues and the values of the American people. That is what we should \ndo. That is our responsibility to our constituents, to our posterity, \nto the heritage we have been given. That is absolutely our \nresponsibility.\n  I will tell you, and I will say it plainly, and others may not, but \nthis legislation fails miserably in that regard. It is unworthy of the \nSenate. It should never pass, it should never become the law of the \nUnited States of America. It does not meet our highest ideals. It does \nnot create a system that is consistent with the national interest of \nthe United States.\n  Let me say with regard to the work that we did this week, I will sort \nof run down and point out some of the things that occurred, some good \nthings occurred, and some things that were not so good that occurred. \nAlso, in my time today, I want to move from that to a more thoughtful \ndiscussion of what any good immigration reform bill should have in it, \nwhat issues it should deal with, and point out how this bill is \ndefective in the most fundamental way it lacks the basic principles of \nany good immigration reform bill.\n  We started out on the floor of the Senate with a 614-page bill , My \nstaff, Cindy Hayden and her team, discovered that the bill on the floor \nthat they were urging passage of would have brought 78.7 to 217 million \nlegal immigrants into the United States in 20 years, equal to 26 to 66 \npercent of the entire total population of the United States of America \nof 298 million. That is what we were being asked to vote on.\n  I believe we were correct. We were the only group, apparently, to \nhave ever researched this, and I think that includes the authors \nthemselves.\n  Those who were opposed to this bill were being accused of wanting to \nlock up people and close our borders and not let anybody in and do all \nthese horrible things, which was never the case. We simply said let's \ntalk about a good policy for America.\n  We attempted to deal with the important issue of making sure \nenforcement will happen. I raised it in the Judiciary Committee and got \na modest amendment on this issue passed. The Presiding Officer, Senator \nIsakson from Georgia, went right to the heart of the issue and drafted \na very good amendment that I thought had a very good chance to pass, \nand should have passed, and it deals with this fundamental problem, \nmost clearly demonstrated by what happened in 1986.\n\n  In 1986, they passed comprehensive amnesty and immigration reform. \nThose who were in the Senate then--I was not yet here--and remember the \ndebate know it was an amnesty to end all amnesties. It was supposed to \ncreate a legal immigration system, and we were told we would not have \nto do this again. Those concerned about it warned, however, one amnesty \nbegets another amnesty. The more you go down that path, the easier it \nis. This sends a signal to the world that we are not serious about our \nlaws. In that one bill in 1986, we passed the amnesty, and we \nauthorized a number of things to occur that were supposed to result in \nan effective legal system. Well, the amnesty became law just like that. \nBut the other things that the enforcement side took--the required \nfunding and congressional assistance, and mostly Presidential \nleadership--never occurred. It didn't occur.\n  So Senator Isakson came up with an amendment this week that I thought \nwas pretty good. It basically would have ensured that the borders were \nsecure before any of the amnesty provisions could be implemented. They \nare telling us constantly that the borders are going to be made secure \nif we pass this bill, so let's hold their feet to the fire and say this \ntime the American people want to have a little hold on you before you \ngrant amnesty again. Let's be sure the borders are secure first, that \nCongress won't forget that goal after the bill passes. Without the \nIsakson language, the amnesty provisions in the bill take effect the \nday the bill is signed. But we didn't accept that amendment. Instead, \nwe will remain in the position where we hope that we will have \nimmigration enforcement in the future. We accepted the Salazar trigger \namendment that simply requires the President to determine that the \nbill's amnesty and guest worker provisions will ``strengthen the \nnational security of the United States.''\n  That is not sufficient. That doesn't go to the meat of the issue like \nSenator Isakson proposed. And why was it rejected? Why was it rejected? \nI have had a suspicion and a growing suspicion over the years that this \nCongress is always willing to pass some bits of legislation dealing \nwith immigration. But if any piece of legislation hits the floor of the \nSenate that will actually work, that is when the system pushes back \nand, for one reason or another, one excuse after another, it never \nhappens. So I think this would have worked, and that is the reason it \ngot rejected.\n  What else occurred, good and bad, through the week? My amendment was \naccepted 83 to 16 to put 870 miles of physical barriers on the border, \n370 miles of fencing, and 500 miles of vehicle barriers--a good \namendment, consistent with what the Secretary of Homeland Security and \nthe President said they desired. We probably need more, but we need at \nleast that. It was accepted.\n  Amusingly, I saw in the paper--I wasn't there when the final vote was \ncounted, but I saw in the paper that 17 Senators changed their votes, \nmostly on the other side, the Democratic side, after it became clear \nthe amendment was going to pass. Many Senators, for months, have been \nrolling their eyes\n\n[[Page S4824]]\n\nand said we don't need fences. That is not very good. That is not a \ngood thing to do. Fences will work, trust me. They will work. But that, \nof course, begets the objection, I suspect. But when we voted, it was \ninteresting that we ended up with a vote of 83 to 16, suggesting that \nthe American people are beginning to have their voices heard a little \nbit in Congress.\n  Then perhaps the most significant amendment that was adopted was a \nBingaman amendment. It would reduce the incredible escalating number \nunder the new H-2C visa foreign worker program. Under the original \nbill, the numbers were unbelievable. The amendment reduced the total \nnumber of immigrants that would have come into the United States if \nthat bill became law from 78 to 217 million to a lower 73 million to 93 \nmillion. That was a strong vote for that provision and we make progress \nin reducing the numbers.\n  However, this bill, S. 2611, still enacts a four- to fivefold \nincrease over the current levels of legal immigration into America over \n20 years. Current law would bring in 18.9 million over 20 years. Did \nyou get that? This bill, if passed today, even after the Bingaman \namendment passed by a substantial majority, would still bring into our \ncountry three, four, five times--at least four times, I suggest--the \nnumber of people who can come into our country legally today.\n  That is a huge number and will lead us at the end of 20 years to have \nthe highest percentage of foreign-born Americans this Nation has ever \nhad in its history, including the great migration period between 1880 \nand 1925. It is a colossal bill still in terms of those numbers.\n  The Senate also accepted, after rejecting it 3 weeks ago when the \nbill first came up--the bill was pulled from the floor because we \ncouldn't get a vote on Senator Kyl's amendment to make certain that \ncriminals are not given amnesty under the bill. It was a simple \namendment to say criminals, felons, couldn't be given amnesty, and we \ncouldn't get a vote on that amendment. It was so bad apparently, the \nDemocratic leader was so determined to block this vote, that Senator \nFrist pulled the bill down.\n  As time went on, we were ready to vote on that amendment, and they \naccepted it, not graciously, but they took it. It certainly makes sense \nthat we do that.\n  The Senate rejected the Vitter amendment by a substantial amount--66 \npeople voted against it--which would strike the bill's provisions that \nadjust the illegal alien population to lawful permanent residents, the \nso-called amnesty provision.\n  The Senate narrowly accepted the Cornyn amendment, 50 to 48, which \nprotects U.S. jobs for workers by making sure the H-2C visa holder can \nonly apply for green cards if they have actually worked--they are \nsupposed to work--if they actually worked for 4 years and their \nemployer attests they will still have a job after they are given a \ngreen card, and the Secretary of Labor determines there are not enough \nU.S. workers available to fill the job position.\n  Then the very next vote, a companion amendment by Senator Kennedy \nwhich was adopted with 56 votes, gutted that protection, in effect, and \nit no longer requires that the employer promise to continue to employ \nan H-2C alien.\n  Federal benefits was a key vote yesterday. The Senate shockingly \nrejected the Ensign amendment 50 to 49--close, close vote--that would \nhave prevented aliens from collecting Social Security benefits as a \nresult of their illegal entry into the country, their illegal work, and \ntheir illegal presentation of a Social Security number. Fraudulent \npresentation of a Social Security number and criminal entry into the \nUnited States, and this bill provides they can draw Social Security. We \nhad an amendment to clarify that issue, and the Senate voted to keep \nthe provision in the bill.\n  Social Security is in trouble now. Thankfully, the Senate accepted \nthe Cornyn amendment that assessed a $750 fine to illegal aliens that \nwill go into the State impact assistance account, and the money will be \nused to help the States pay for costs that are connected with \nimmigration.\n  The Senate accepted an amendment by Senator Inhofe on a 63-to-34 \nvote, 34 Senators voting no, stating that English is a national \nlanguage and strengthening the citizenship test where one is supposed \nto know something about the Constitution, the Declaration of \nIndependence, George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and crew, \nand the history of the United States. It would strengthen that a bit. \nBut 34 Senators voted against that amendment. It was adopted. We are \nmoving forward.\n  My good friend, Senator Cornyn, who is as positive and effective a \nSenator as we have had join us in quite a long time, said that we made \na lot of progress this week. I say we made some progress. I want to \nshare with my colleagues why I think there are serious problems in the \nlegislation.\n  Last week, I detailed 15 loopholes in the bill that is before us \ntoday. Of those 15, maybe 4, 5, 6 have been fixed in significant part, \nleaving 8 or 9 that have not been fixed. I will not go over those at \nthis time, but I do want to say that those concerns I raised last week \nare very real. They really need to be fixed. Those loopholes need to be \nclosed. Those concerns need to be dealt with. I am prepared to debate \nor negotiate with anyone about the importance of those points I made \nlast week. I think most American people would agree with me on every \nsingle one of those issues.\n  Today I wish to talk about a more broad concern with the bill and its \npotential impact. I again emphasize that we are sensitive to the good \nand decent people who come here. Those of us who are unhappy with the \nway this bill is written are not against immigration and not against \nimmigrants; we are not for closing our borders and not for not having \nanymore immigration. That is all foolish. We are not for arresting \npeople by the tens of thousands and hauling them out of the country. \nThat is not going to happen. But, I don't think the view of the House \nof Representatives, that we ought to deal with enforcement first and \ndemonstrate that we can create a lawful and workable system first, is \nimmoral, impractical, or radical. It makes a lot of sense to me.\n  Secondly, I am not aware of any Member of Congress who favors hostile \nor extreme measures in dealing with the issues today. We want \nimmigration to occur. We will expect to see some increases in \nimmigration, but we want it to be legal, under policies and terms that \nare appropriate for the United States of America.\n  The American people are with us on this issue. They expect us to \ncreate an immigration system that works and is legal. They don't want \nto reward those who break into our country with every single benefit we \nprovide to those who come legally. To me, that is, indeed, amnesty.\n  The American people do not think big business and advocacy groups \nshould be able to meet in secret and create some great design of a \nplan, foist it on the Senate, and that we can't consider it, review it, \nand reject it if we need to.\n  That is basically part of the debate we had last night. It was \nargued: Well, there has been a great compromise. Sessions, you and the \nAmerican people, your views weren't part of it, but we know better for \nour country than you do. And if you amend this section, the compromise \nwill collapse, and the bill may not get passed. You can't change this \nbill.\n  The section we were trying to change was the section that is as bogus \nas any part of the bill. It is the section that is captioned in big \nprint: temporary guest worker. That is what the President has been \nsaying he favors. He told me that personally a couple of days ago. He \ntold me, when he flew to Alabama, that he believed in temporary \nworkers. But it is not so that this bill creates a temporary worker \nprogram. I challenge any one last night to tell me that what I am \nsaying is not true.\n\n  Under this bill, under that rubric of big print language, \n``Nonimmigrant Visa Reform, Subsection A, Temporary Guest Workers''--\nwhat it really says is if you come into this country under this work \nvisa you get to convert your status to a green card holder--a legal \npermanent resident that can then become a citizen. Somebody said last \nnight: Why are people afraid to discuss this issue? I say to the \nsupporters of the bill: Why are you afraid to tell the\n\n[[Page S4825]]\n\ntruth about your bill? Why do you title the section one thing and then \nwrite it to actually do another?\n  Why are you putting in here ``temporary guest workers'' when there is \nnothing ``temporary'' or ``guest'' about them. Why? Are they afraid the \nAmerican people will find out what is really in that provision which \nwould have brought in, had it not been amended by Senator Bingaman, \nperhaps 130 million new people into the country permanently? What kind \nof temporary program is that?\n  How does it work? This is the way it works: You come in, get a job; \nyou come in under this guest worker proposal, and within the first day \nyou arrive, your employer can seek a green card for you. If you \nqualify--and most will--then that green card will be issued, and you \nare then a legal permanent resident. You are a legal permanent resident \nwithin weeks or months of entry into the country, and within 5 years of \nbeing a legal permanent resident and having a green card, you can apply \nfor citizenship. If you know a little English and don't get arrested \nand convicted of a felony, you will be made a citizen by right under \nthat provision. So it is not a temporary guest worker program. We need \none in the bill. It is not there. That is what the President says he \nsupports.\n  The American people don't think we ought to huddle up, have some \ngroups come in and meet with a few Senators and have them foist on the \nAmerican people an immigration bill that ignores their concerns about \nlegality and their legitimate concerns over the depressing of the wages \nof American citizens. That is not a myth. The law of supply and demand \nhas not been abrogated with regard to wages and labor.\n  In terms of lawfulness, decency, morality, and the national interest, \nthe American people are head and shoulders above the Members of \nCongress who are asserting and pushing this flawed legislation. A huge \nmajority of the American people have been right on this issue for \ndecades. It is the executive branch and the Congress that have been \nderelict in their most solemn duties. If the American people had been \nlistened to and not been stiff-armed by an arrogant elitist bureaucracy \nand political class, we wouldn't have 11 million to 20 million people \nin our country illegally today.\n  The American people have been concerned about this issue--and the \npolls have shown it--for 20, 30 years. So what is our national interest \nand what policies should we pursue? What about border workforce \nenforcement? Any good bill would include a good enforcement system at \nthe border and workplace.\n  We should focus our policies on higher skill needs, college degrees, \ninstead of low-wage workers. Serious consideration should be given to \nhow we welcome new immigrants into the American world and have them \nreach their fullest and highest aspirations. We are not able to do that \nunder the current system, and we certainly should fix this illegality \nand actually provide some mechanism for a large number of people to \ncome out from the shadows, as they say.\n  We should consider seriously the impact of wages on the American \nworkers, and we need to consider what other developed nations, such as \nCanada, Britain, and France are doing. How are they confronting these \nquestions? Why don't we do that? I will tell you why we don't. It is \nbecause this bill is totally incompatible and inconsistent with the \nprinciples those advanced nations are following.\n  All of this must be done with the full recognition that America \ncannot accept everyone who might want to come here, and that is just a \nfact.\n  I recently took a trip with Chairman Specter of the Judiciary \nCommittee to South America. We were provided State Department news \nclips. There was an article about a poll in Nicaragua that said 60 \npercent of the people in Nicaragua would come to the United States if \nthey could. Sixty percent of the people of Nicaragua said they would \ncome to the United States if they could.\n  We next stopped in Peru, and I asked one of the officials at the \nEmbassy about that poll and asked him did he think it was true. He said \nthey just had a poll in Peru earlier this year--I mean this year, both \nthese polls were this year--earlier this year, he said, and 70 percent \nof the people of Peru said they would come to the United States if they \ncould. What about the whole world? We have people who want to come from \nIndia and China and South America and Brazil and Haiti and the \nDominican Republic and the Middle East and Bangladesh and Taiwan and \nthe Philippines. These are good people. I am not putting any of them \ndown. I am just saying for an absolute fact--an absolute fact--that we \ncannot accept everybody who would like to come here. Therefore, we \nshould decide how to create a system that makes the laws enforceable \nand then enforce them, and we ought to seek to bring in people who \nprovide the greatest asset to America.\n\n  So we will be confronting another issue we need to confront, and that \nis chain migration. Once a person comes in and they get that green card \nand then they become a citizen, once they get the green card, they can \nbring their wife and children. They may have six children. And the wife \ngets to come and the children get to come. Then, in addition to that, \nonce they become a citizen, they can bring their parents and their \nbrothers and sisters, even if it is a large number of them. They can \nbring, through this chain migration system, huge numbers of people who \nmay not be what our Nation needs at the time. Maybe there is a glut in \nthe skills their brother or sister has. Maybe those things would \nmitigate against them. And maybe there is some college graduate in the \nDominican Republic who is anxious to come but does not qualify, cannot \nget in because the visas have been used up by this chain migration \nprocess, which makes no sense and needs to be altered.\n  Also, we need to consider the impact on the Federal Treasury. Even as \na green card holder and as a citizen, you are entitled to an earned \nincome tax credit. Most of the people legalized or coming in under this \nbill would be lower wage workers, and the earned income tax credit for \nthose who qualify amounts to a tax refund to a lower wage worker on \naverage of $2,400 per worker, per year. So they would qualify for the \nearned income tax credit, their parents would qualify for SSI health \ncare, Social Security benefits as we have in this bill, welfare \nbenefits, education, and health care. The bill calls for instate \ntuition for illegal immigrants. That is still in here via the DREAM \nAct. Those kinds of things are in this bill.\n  So we have had a week of some productivity, but we have much more to \ndo in creating a bill that is fundamentally worthy of this Senate and \nthat will deal in an effective way with where we are heading in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Washington, Senator Wyden. I \ndon't know how long he wants to speak. I have some more to go. If he is \nnot going to be particularly long, I would--\n  Mr. WYDEN. Would my colleague yield just briefly for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I was going to talk for about 15 minutes or \nso. I would be happy to wait for my friend from Alabama, if he would \nlike to finish. How much longer do you intend to speak?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Probably longer than that. A good bit; probably 30 or \nso minutes more. So I would be pleased to yield to the Senator if he is \nready and pick up after that. I think I am going to be closing out the \nSenate when we finish up, anyway.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would be ready in just a couple of \nminutes to start. If my colleague would like to go on for a couple of \nadditional minutes, and then I will speak, and then he could return.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Sounds great.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank him for his courtesy.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So one of the most significant issues facing America \ntoday is how many immigrants will be allowed to enter the United States \nand become citizens. I am not sure we have given any thought to that. \nAs I said, when we announced at the beginning of this week that the \nnumbers could be as high as 200 million people allowed into the \ncountry, I don't think most Senators had any idea that was so. My staff \nworked that up at about the same time the Heritage Foundation did their \nown independent analysis, and they were very close in numbers to ours. \nI hope that played a role in our ability\n\n[[Page S4826]]\n\nto pass a bill the next night that did bring those numbers down. As I \nsay, we are now looking at about 73 million to 93 million more people \nlegally coming into our country in the next 20 years.\n  I wish to emphasize this: Don't think those are small numbers. We are \na 300 million-person country right now, and I am talking about 4 times \nthe legal immigration rate presently existing in our country. Under the \ncurrent law, we would have 19 million come in over 20 years. Under this \nbill, we would have 73 million to 93 million coming in by a short 20 \nyears from now.\n  I asked the Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing on April 19 to \nexamine the full impact of the legislation and what we could do about \nit. I asked that we examine what the estimated numerical impact is of \nthe immigration proposal and how does the future chain migration of \nfamily members impact the total immigration numbers under the proposal. \nI asked that we have hearings on what will be the legislation's \nestimated fiscal impact on the Federal Treasury as well as State and \nlocal governments; how will the entitlement programs such as Medicaid, \nTANF, and food stamps be affected; what level of immigration in the \nfuture is in our best national, economic, social, and cultural \ninterests; and what categories of immigrants in terms of skills and \neducation should compose the overall level of annual immigration. I \nstated that we need to have a national discussion on this issue. The \nAmerican people need to be involved.\n  We had one committee hearing, and it lasted about 2 to 3 hours and \nthree or four Senators came. The individual provisions of the bill have \nnever been examined by any committee. Let me state that again. The \nindividual provisions of the bill on the Senate floor have never been \nexamined by any committee. But every witness who came to that one \nhearing acknowledged that high-skilled immigrants are good for the \neconomy and that low-skilled immigrants are a net drain on the \neconomy--on average, not every single one. Many of them turn out to be \nproductive and go on and be productive. But on average, from an \neconomist point of view, based on the data we have, they tend to take \nout more in taxes than they pay in taxes.\n\n  I sent a second letter asking for further committee hearings. I \nwanted to examine the numerical figures in the bill, the fiscal impact, \nbut we never had any hearings on that.\n  So we did our studies on the legislation, and we came out with these \nnumbers. We did our calculations, and we believe the numbers would run \nfrom 80 million or more people coming in over 20 years to perhaps 200 \nmillion people. Two hundred million would be two-thirds of the current \npopulation of the United States of America.\n  So we worked hard on those numbers. I don't think they were ever \nseriously challenged. This is the way it ran. Under current levels of \nlegal immigration, there would be 18.9 million people coming into the \ncountry. If we had passed this legislation as it originally was when it \nhit the floor, we would have had 78.7 million at a minimum coming in--4 \ntimes the current level of immigration--and it could have hit the \nmaximum of 217 million, according to our calculations--about 11 times \nthe current level of immigration. So those are huge numbers. I think \nthey caused great concern.\n  After the amendment Senator Bingaman offered was passed and it took \nout that 20-percent-per-year escalator clause on the 325,000-person \nguest worker program per year--under this new program, if you hit that \n325,000 one year, automatically the next year's limit was 20 percent \nmore, automatically the next year would be 20 percent more, and \nautomatically the next year would be 20 percent more. I think that \nwould have sent a clear signal to the entire world that the United \nStates was going to accept huge numbers of immigrants, and I believe we \nwould have had applications flooding in and it would have been a very \nserious problem. We did pare that back to 200,000 per year without any \n20 percent increase over 20 years, and that made the huge difference I \njust mentioned. So now about 73 million to 93 million will come in over \n20 years, 4 to 5 times the current rate.\n  I submit that is still far too large a number. We have had no real \nserious national discussion about what impact that would have on \nworking Americans, what impact it would have on our welfare and our \ncultural ability to assimilate and welcome foreign visitors and workers \nwho come to our country, and I think it would cause us great \ndifficulty. So we still need to talk about that.\n  I ask my colleagues and those in the media, how much have you heard \nthis discussed? How many people in the Senate have actually discussed \nand debated and acknowledged how huge a change this is and whether it \nis the kind of change we should carry out? Has it even been discussed? \nOh, but they say, we have to pass something. We just have to pass \nsomething and get it off our plate. You know, the Senate has a lot to \ndo. We are busy. Let's just move on it. Let's just show courage. Let's \njust move it on and get something to the House.\n  Oddly, some of the people who have been making the most fun and \ncomplaining about the House of Representatives for their enforcement \napproach are now justifying and asking us to pass the bill on the basis \nof, well, it will get better after we go over to the House. They tell \nme to not be so worried about all of these provisions because the House \nMembers will never agree to it and we might make the bill better in \nconference.\n  That is kind of an odd argument to make. If you are so holy and so \nrighteous, why don't you come down here and defend these numbers they \ntried to slip by 3 weeks ago without a single amendment being \nconsidered by the Senate. They tried to move that through here. \nFinally, it blew up and Senator Frist pulled the bill down, insisting \nthat at least there be some amendments considered as we move this piece \nof legislation forward.\n  So, Mr. President, in a few minutes I will share a few more remarks \non some of the specific concerns I have involving this philosophy of \nthe bill in a few moments. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wyden are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. WYDEN. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I yielded the floor to Senator Wyden a \nfew moments ago, and I wish to complete some thoughts.\n  I documented without any real dispute that the provisions in the bill \nbefore the Senate today will increase legal immigration into our \ncountry by an extraordinary amount, by four to five times the current \nlevels. That is a huge increase.\n  At the same time, we have done the research on it, and I will not go \ninto the details, but the programs that allow most of the people to \ncome into our country favor low-skilled workers. We think from 70 to \n90, maybe 92 percent of the workers who will come in under the \nprovisions of the bill in the Senate today will come in as low-skilled \nworkers. That is very significant because it is quite clear from every \nprofessional, independent, pro-immigration economist who has analyzed \nit that low-skilled workers do not tend to pay as much in taxes as they \ntake out. They become a net drain on the Treasury of the United States. \nThat is an important issue. If we are going to do comprehensive reform, \nwhy haven't we discussed this issue? I ask my colleagues and those who \npromoted the legislation before the Senate today, has that been \ndiscussed with the American people? Have we had extensive hearings in \ncommittees on this question? The answer is no.\n  In fact, if you read the bill, you will discover there has been a \nstudied and carefully carried out plan to conceal how many people will \ncome in under the temporary guest worker programs when, in fact, what \nthey mislabel as a\n\n[[Page S4827]]\n\ntemporary program is in fact a permanent worker program that leads on a \ndirect path to citizenship in fairly short order. I am talking about \nthe future immigration programs in the bill here. I am not talking \nabout the other 11 to 20 million illegal aliens who may claim amnesty \nunder this bill.\n  If we are going to do a comprehensive plan, why don't we think first \nand foremost about what our Nation needs, what the implications are for \nimmigration, how it has enriched us in so many ways in the past, how \nmany wonderful, decent people come here. But we also need to ask \nourselves, what are the limits of immigration? What are the aspects of \nit that could be better handled? We need to think these things through \nin a careful, legitimate way, focusing on the legitimate national \ninterests of the United States of America, because it is not our policy \nand cannot be the policy of any nation to allow immigrants into their \nnation solely on the basis that it is good for the immigrant.\n  I don't want to be harsh about this. I am not being unkind. We want \nto have immigration. I will support an increase in legal immigration \nover the current levels if it is a reasonable increase focused in the \nright direction and promotes the interests of the United States. We \nwill have more coming in, but we need to ask the question of how we \nshould do it, who should be allowed to take advantage of the limited \nnumber of slots we can legitimately bestow on those who come here.\n  It cannot be their choice, but there seems to be talk here that \nreminds me of entitlement talks, rights talks, that someone in a \nforeign nation around the world has some sort of right to come to \nAmerica, an entitlement to come to America, that we cannot deny them. \nWhere did that come from? That is not true in any other nation in the \nworld. It is an example of muddled thinking.\n  It is Mr. Barone who wrote a book called ``Hard America, Soft \nAmerica.'' Sometimes we need to just have clear thinking. Some things \nyou just need to make a decision about. One of those is the number of \npeople who can come into our country is limited. A great nation, a wise \nnation, wants to make sure the people who come into the country best \nsuit and best foster that nation's progress. How simple is that?\n  Let's talk about the national impact of low-skilled workers versus \nhigh-skilled workers. I asked for a series of hearings. We got one \nhearing. It went 2 or 3 hours. We had good professors, but only three \nor four Senators showed up. I have some of the testimony from that \nhearing and some other information relevant to that important question \nthat I will read from in a minute. Shouldn't we be talking about those \nthings? We are talking about a lot of issues that may be hot buttons \nand of concern, and I am pleased we have a fence at the border, but at \nthe same time, the great Senate of the United States needs to think \nabout the future.\n  This is what we learned. The economic experts who testified before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee on April 25, 2006, at the immigration \neconomic impacts hearing agreed that low-skilled immigrants unavoidably \ndepress the wages of American workers in low-skilled job categories. \nThey held, it is fair to say, a common consensus. Some are pro-\nimmigration, and they argue benefits and other things, but they all \nheld a common consensus that high-skilled immigrants are better for the \neconomy than low-skilled workers. Low-skilled workers are an overall \nnet drain on the economy.\n  Professor Richard Freeman, the Herbert S. Ascherman professor of \neconomics at Harvard University, testified, among other things:\n\n       One of the concerns of when immigrants come into the \n     country is that they may take some jobs from Americans or \n     drive down the wages of some Americans. Obviously, if there \n     are a large number of immigrants coming in, and if they are \n     coming in at a bad economic time, that's very likely to \n     happen.\n\n  He went on to talk about the impact of high-skilled workers. He \nnoted:\n\n       I think America makes a huge gain, and much of the gains \n     are to us. Some of the gains are to the immigrants, of \n     course.\n  You will notice he says that more than once. He talks about who \nactually gains from immigration. For low skilled workers who come here, \nit is a gain to them because they are coming to a better and freer and \nmore prosperous country. But the real question our Nation should ask \nis, How does it benefit us? He says:\n\n       There are gains to us from high-skilled workers and to the \n     immigrants.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Having a lot of immigrants coming in at the top, it does \n     make it more difficult for some young Americans to advance in \n     those fields, but we can recompense the young Americans with \n     other policies.\n\n  He goes on to note:\n\n       It's very important to understand that the biggest \n     beneficiaries from immigration tend to be the immigrants, \n     particularly if you are a low-skilled immigrant.\n\n  He adds this:\n\n       If you are a poor immigrant, your income in the United \n     States will be six to eight times what it is in Mexico.\n\n  Professor Dan Siciliano, director of the program in law, economics, \nand business at the Stanford Law School, a pretty good law school, is a \npretty strong advocate in favor of immigration, but he talked about the \nquestion of the cost of low-skilled immigrants. He said:\n\n       If you look at the fiscal/economic impact, which is the \n     Government's coffers impact, it might be true that lower-\n     skilled workers, just like all of us, have a negative impact \n     on the fiscal bottom line. And so we may have a modest net \n     negative fiscal impact for all low-wage workers in the United \n     States, not just immigrants. This is not unique to \n     immigrants, documented or undocumented.\n\n  What he was saying is that low-skilled American workers who are not \ntrained, not skilled, and not educated, will draw more from the Federal \nTreasury than they put into it. That is one of the reasons we work so \nhard to train and provide skills to American workers, so they can rise \nand be successful and reach their highest possible aspirations. But \nwhen that does not occur, it does have a cost to the economy. Why would \nyou want to import large numbers who don't have skills when there are \nlarge numbers of people with skills who want to come here?\n  Dr. Barry Chiswick, head of and research professor at the Department \nof Economics at the University of Illinois in Chicago, said this:\n\n       What about the impact on low-skilled American workers? How \n     does a large amount of new labor into the country impact \n     American workers of low skill?\n\n  He was blunt. He told it like it was. He said:\n\n       There is a competition in the labor market, and the large \n     increase in low-skilled immigration that we have seen over \n     the last 20 years has had a substantial negative effect on \n     the employment and earnings opportunities of low-skilled \n     American workers.\n\n  He goes on to add:\n\n       The large increase in low-skilled immigration has had the \n     effect of decreasing the wages and employment opportunities \n     of low-skilled workers who are currently resident in the \n     United States.\n\n  We have some Members on the other side who want to bring in five \ntimes as many low-skilled workers as we bring in today. Do they want to \ndispute the professor from Chicago?\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The last amnesty [in 1986] actually encouraged additional \n     low-skilled immigration in anticipation of further amnesties.\n\n  I went back and saw the summary of the debate in 1986. People who \nopposed that amnesty predicted that we were going to be driven \ninevitably to future amnesties and we should stand on principle and fix \nthe system in 1986. This professor clearly agreed that their prediction \nhas come true.\n  He goes on to add:\n\n       Over the past two decades, the real earnings of high-\n     skilled workers have risen substantially. The real earnings \n     of low-skilled workers have either stagnated or decreased \n     somewhat.\n\n  That is a sad statement. It is a sad event, if it is true, because \npeople are doing well today. The economy is booming. But as I will \npoint out to my colleagues in further remarks, the wages for low-\nskilled workers are not increasing. They are not sharing in the \nbenefits of the progress and prosperity this Nation is enjoying at this \npoint. We have an agreement here struck between the Chamber of Commerce \nand some political activist groups to move this bill through, and they \nare not concerned sufficiently about the interests of decent American \ncitizens who may not have the highest skills. These Americans, however, \nare entitled to a decent wage and their wages should be going up in \nthis time of prosperity.\n  Dr. Chiswick goes on to say:\n\n       We need to provide greater assistance to low-skilled \n     Americans in their quest for better jobs and higher wages, \n     and one of the\n\n[[Page S4828]]\n\n     ways we can help them in this regard is by reducing the very \n     substantial competition that they're facing from this very \n     large and uncontrolled low-skilled immigration that is the \n     result of both our legal immigration system and the absence \n     of enforcement of immigration law.\n\n  I lay this on the table, like I have done before. If people want to \ndisagree with Professor Chiswick, let's have them down here and explain \nthat. Professor Samuelson and a lot of others agree with him, and the \nnumbers tend to confirm that. When you have a shortage of labor, a \nlaboring man's value goes up because he can demand a high wage. When \nyou have a large amount of low-wage people willing to go out and take a \njob, it can drive down wages an American worker can expect to get when \nthey go out and seek a job. I don't believe we are going to repeal the \nlaw of economics for labor. It has always been there, and it always \nwill be.\n\n  Dr. Chiswick also shared with us his thoughts about the cost of low-\nskilled immigrants, and he notes:\n\n       Low-skilled immigrants make greater use of government \n     benefits and transfers than they pay in taxes.\n\n  I am not condemning anybody. We should not condemn anybody. We have a \nnation that is generous and wants to help people who have difficulties \ngetting by in life. We are always going to do that.\n  But he says:\n\n       Low-skilled immigrants make greater use of government \n     benefits and transfers than they pay in taxes. So in terms of \n     the public coffers, they serve as a net drain. Whereas high-\n     skilled immigrants have the opposite effect. And the \n     consequences of low-skilled immigration are pretty much the \n     same whether they are in legal status or illegal status, \n     although the net effect on the public coffers is actually \n     more negative for legal immigrants who are low-skilled \n     immigrants.\n\n  Did you hear that? Once they become legal and get a green card or \nbecome a citizen, they are entitled to more benefits than when they are \nillegal. But in fact, both of them turn out to be net drains on the \ncoffers of the United States, according to Professor Chiswick.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       And if you do the analysis separately for high-skilled and \n     low-skilled immigrants, what you would find is that even in a \n     period of surplus, low-skilled immigrants would be paying \n     less in taxes than the burdens that they would be putting on \n     government expenditures.\n\n  Mr. Siciliano, who is more pro-immigrant and sees it in a more \npositive light, interjected and said:\n\n       Truthfully, just like low-skilled U.S. workers.\n\n  And Professor Chiswick responded:\n\n       Just like low-skilled natives, yes.\n\n  Mr. Siciliano responds:\n\n       Yes, in no different way than low-skilled U.S. workers.\n\n  And Mr. Chiswick replied:\n\n       But low skilled natives are here. And low-skilled \n     immigrants, do we want them in?\n\n  In unlimited numbers, I would add. What about high-skilled \nimmigrants? What did Mr. Chiswick say about that?\n\n       Two-thirds of the immigrants coming into the United States \n     annually come in under kinship criteria.\n\n  That is chain migration.\n\n       Only about 7 percent are skill tested. For only about 7 \n     percent do we really ask the question what will you \n     contribute to the American economy?\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       We need to alter our immigration policies to increase the \n     focus on attracting high ability, high-skilled immigrants. \n     What we want to do is attract those immigrants who would have \n     the largest positive contribution to the American economy, \n     and they will be highly skilled immigrants, immigrants with \n     high skills in literacy, numeracy, scientific knowledge, \n     technical training. Current immigration law pays very, very \n     little attention to the skills that immigrants bring to the \n     United States.\n\n  That is his statement. It is something we need to think about as we \npass a bill that pretends to be comprehensive.\n  Professor Harry Holder, also testifying at our hearing, who was \nassociate dean and professor of public policy at Georgetown University, \nanother pretty good university, said this about the impact of low-\nskilled American workers:\n\n       There are jobs in industries like construction that I think \n     are more appealing to native born workers. And many native \n     born, low-income men might be interested in more of those \n     jobs, although employers often prefer the immigrants, \n     especially in residential construction. Now, absent the \n     immigrants, employers might need to raise those wages and \n     improve those conditions of work to entice native born \n     workers into those construction, agriculture, janitorial, \n     food preparation jobs.\n       I believe that when immigrants are illegal, they do more to \n     undercut the wages of native born workers because the playing \n     field isn't level and the employers don't have to pay them \n     market wages.\n\n  He was then asked about future immigration policy, and he said:\n\n       I agree with Professor Chiswick. We are not ready to open \n     the floodgates of immigration. We will continue to have \n     controls on immigration. And we need to find cost-effective \n     and humane ways to limit those immigrants.\n\n  So we didn't get five hearings. We didn't get a national dialog. We \nhad one hearing for a few hours and a number of professors, pretty much \nthose professors who consider themselves pro-immigrant, and that is \nwhat they told us.\n  Let me share a few more points on that subject from another \nindividual. The Washington Times, on May 8, published a column by Alan \nTomlinson. He is an official with the U.S. Business and Industry \nCouncil Educational Foundation. He went back and did some studies and \ndealt with this allegation that without ever increasing flows of \nimmigrants, representatives of numerous industries have warned their \nsectors will literally run out of workers and the economy will \ncollapse. He was not so impressed after he did some studies. He said:\n\n       Most statistics available show conclusively that far from \n     easing shortages, illegal immigrants are adding to labor \n     gluts in America.\n  Think about that. He says that we don't have a shortage, we have a \nglut.\n\n       Specifically, wages in sectors highly dependent on \n     illegals, when adjusted for inflation, are either stagnant or \n     have actually fallen. When labor is genuinely scarce and too \n     many employers are chasing too few workers, businesses \n     typically bid wages up in the competition to fill jobs. When \n     too many workers are chasing too few jobs, employers \n     typically are able to cut wages, confident that beggars can't \n     be choosers.\n\n  Then he checked the Department of Labor statistics. He says this:\n\n       The Labor Department data revealed that the wage-cutting \n     scenario is exactly what has unfolded recently throughout the \n     economy's illegal immigrant heavy sectors.\n\n  Then he talked about restaurants. We hear there are not enough people \nto work in restaurants. Illegal immigrants comprise 17 percent of the \nfood preparation workers, 20 percent of cooks, and 23 percent of \ndishwashers. What did he find?\n\n       According to the data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics, through inflation-adjusted wages for the broad \n     food services and drinking categories, wages fell in real \n     terms 1.65 percent between 2000 and 2005.\n\n  If there is a crisis to get cooks and dishwashers, how are they able \nto cut salaries? How does the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that \nsalaries went down? This is one of the areas where we have the most \nnumbers of illegal immigrants.\n  He then goes on to talk about the hospitality industry, which \nincludes hotels. They say we have to have a person who puts that \nchocolate on your bed every night and makes up your bed and comes in \nand puts your toiletries in a line for you, whether you want that or \nnot. You have to have them. The Bureau of Labor Statistics data, \naccording to him, who studied them, show that inflation-adjusted wages \nfell nearly 1.1 percent from 2000 to 2005. So hotels are booming, and \nthey are building new hotels, and they say they cannot get workers.\n  Why are wages not going up? Perhaps if they pay a little more money \nto decent American citizens, they might be able to get more to work. \nThey may have to charge $180 instead of $170 a night for a room. Is \nthat going to destroy the American economy? I think not. Maybe the \naverage American worker would be better able to participate in the \nprosperity that is going on.\n  He talked about the construction industry. He says that, \ninterestingly, from 1993 to 2005, wages in that sector only increased 3 \npercent. That is 12 years. The wages, according to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, in the construction industry area only increased 3 percent \nin 12 years. From 2000 through 2005, at the height of the housing boom, \ninflation-adjusted wages actually fell 1.59 percent. So we have this \ncrisis in workers, and wages are falling.\n  He then talks about food manufacturing. They make up a big part of \nthat. Let me point out that even in the construction industry, the \nillegal immigrants make up only 12 percent of\n\n[[Page S4829]]\n\nthe workforce. So this argument that you cannot get anybody who is \nnative-born to work in construction is bogus. The one thing that hurts \nme the most when I hear President Bush say it is when he says these are \njobs Americans won't do. I reject that. He should never say that. These \nare good jobs, honorable jobs, filled by honorable American people. In \nthe construction area, almost 90 percent are American workers, and \nthere is nothing they won't do. They may not do something because they \ndon't get enough pay or benefits or retirement, but the jobs themselves \nare noble contributions to America. They go out and build something--a \nwall, drywall, a roof on a house--and that is a lot better than some of \nthese lawyers and other people who contribute very little, I submit, to \nthe net economy.\n  They talked about the 14 percent of the workers in food \nmanufacturing, including animal processing. That includes chicken \nplants, slaughterhouses, and beef-processing plants. You have heard \nthat we cannot get workers there. Pew Research says that illegals make \nup 27 percent of workers in that category. That is the highest sector, \nit looks like, according to this. What happened to their wages from \n2000 to 2005? They say they cannot get people to work in the chicken \nplants. That is what they say in Alabama--they cannot get workers and \nwe might have a real problem without the illegal workers. If so, how \ndid adjusted wages fall 1.4 percent during that period of time?\n  He goes on to note that examining more closely the pattern within the \n2000 to 2005 period provides compelling evidence that illegal \nimmigrants have been used deliberately to force down wages. In most \nindustries that used illegal immigrants heavily, inflation-adjusted \nwages rose modestly during the first years of the current decade. Yet, \nsoon after, they dropped significantly.\n  What about the guy who wrote the textbook on economics, Robert \nSamuelson? I think he would be considered a liberal. Robert Samuelson \nproduced an op-ed on May 17, 2006, this year. He deals directly with \nthe question of immigration. This is what he said:\n\n       The central problem is not illegal immigration, it is \n     undesirably high levels of poor and low-skilled immigrants, \n     whether legal or illegal. Immigrants are not all the same. An \n     engineer making $75,000 annually contributes more to the \n     American economy and society than a $20,000 laborer. On \n     average, an engineer will assimilate easily.\n\n  He quotes favorably Professor Chiswick, and I just quoted from his \ntestimony before the hearing. This guy has written books on economics. \nHe quotes the same quote I just gave, I believe. I will not repeat \nthat. He quotes Mr. Chiswick's comments concerning the fact that low-\nskilled immigrants tend to pay less in taxes. They receive more \nbenefits, such as income transfers, the earned-income tax credit, food \nstamps, public schooling, and publicly provided medical services. He \nquotes this from Mr. Chiswick, too: While low-skilled immigrant workers \nmay raise the profit of their employers, they tend to have a negative \nimpact on the well-being of the low-skilled, native-born population and \non the native economy as a whole.\n\n  Mr. Samuelson adds this:\n\n       Hardly anyone is discussing these issues candidly. It is \n     politically inexpedient to do so. We can be a lawful society \n     and a welcoming society simultaneously, to use the \n     President's phrase, but we cannot be a welcoming society for \n     a limitless number of Latin America's poor, without seriously \n     compromising our own future and indeed the future of the many \n     Latinos already here. Yet, that is precisely what the \n     President and many Senators, Democrat and Republican, support \n     by enforcing large guestworker programs and an expansion of \n     today's legal system of visas. And in practice these \n     proposals would result in substantial increases in low-\n     skilled immigrants.\n\n  What are other countries doing? I will wrap up with these thoughts. \nWhat are other nations around the world doing as they consider their \nimmigration policies?\n  In Australia, immigrant applications are considered under either the \ngeneral migration program, which includes skilled or migrant spouses \nand those sponsored by family members already settled in Australia, or \nthe humanitarian refugee program. For fiscal 2004-2005, the Australian \nGovernment set a goal of 120,000 migrants, far less than our number; \n42,000 places for family members; 72,000 for skilled business migrants; \nand 13,000 for the humanitarian and refugee program--though actual \narrivals were just over 123,000.\n  Under the skilled migration program in Australia, applicants are \ngiven points for different criteria. In the fiscal year 2004, the pass \nmark for general skilled migration was 120 points. So they have a \npoints based system. As it turned out that year, you had to have 120 or \nmore or you were not approved. Points were awarded for age--lower age \ntends to be better--skill, English language ability, specialized \nskills, job offers in demand fields, or completion of an Australian \nuniversity degree. If a foreign student comes here and finishes at the \ntop of their class at Georgetown or the University of Alabama, they \nhave to leave for at least 2 years. Somebody can come in here for a \nlow-skilled job and get a green card the first day they come in. How \nsilly is that? But that is what Australia does. They give 5 additional \npoints for a capital investment in Australia of at least $100,000. \nAustralian work experience, fluency in the Australian community \nlanguage, and skilled occupations are given various points.\n  What about Canada? They accept six major categories of immigrants: \nskilled and independent workers, business immigrants, provincial \nnominees, family class, international adoptions, and Quebec-sponsored \nimmigrants. Refugees are also counted in immigration statistics. They \ndo not have a country-based or worldwide quota, but they establish \nannual targets. In fiscal year 2004, approximately 236,000 people were \naccepted for permanent residence in Canada; 113,000 were skilled, \n62,000 family, 10,000 business, 6,000 provincial nominees, and 32,000 \nrefugees. There is a pretty good mix there. Far higher--over half of \nthat number clearly are people with high skills, high education, and \nbusiness capability.\n  The strictest preference system is used in Canada for skilled workers \nand is based on a point system. Under the current system, applicants \nmust obtain at least 67 out of 100 points and have at least 1 year of \nwork experience within the past 10 years in a management occupation or \nin an occupation normally requiring university or technical training, \nas identified by the Canadian occupational classification system. \nPoints are awarded for education, languages, employment experience, \nage, employment, and adaptability. So they have standards. In our \nsystem, people come in basically under entitlements. If you meet this \nstandard, you get to come in regardless of your skill.\n  What about France? Two days ago, France's lower House of Parliament \napproved a new immigration bill supported by one of the top Cabinet \nmembers. The Parliament approved a bill that would allow the country to \nselectively choose which foreigners can live and work in that country \nand would require that immigrants learn the French language. You know, \nthey care about that French language. We need to care a little more \nabout the English language.\n  I remember when Chirac walked out of the European Union conference \nbecause a Frenchman, in speaking to the delegation, spoke to them in \nEnglish. He was so offended that a Frenchman would speak English at an \ninternational conference, he left. That is a little bit much, I think, \nbut I don't think there is anything wrong with a nation that is proud \nof its language and wanting to preserve it.\n  So this French bill could make it easier for the country to screen \nout poorly educated immigrants in favor of highly skilled workers.\n  It would tighten restrictions under which immigrant workers can bring \ntheir families to France. That is chain migration. You get to bring \nyour family no matter what skills they bring to the Nation. It would \nabolish the right of illegal immigrants to receive residency papers \nafter living in France for 2 years. So in a way, it abolishes amnesty. \nIt abolishes the right of illegal immigrants to receive residency \npapers, even after they have lived in the country for 10 years. The \nbill passed by 367 to 164 and will be debated in the French Senate next \nmonth.\n  An article I happened to catch on the airplane the other day in the \nEconomist, a London-based newspaper, said Americans are nativists, not \ninternationalists. Why don't we talk about some of these EU countries \nthat are supposed to be so progressive? This is\n\n[[Page S4830]]\n\nwhat the Economist wrote on May 6 describing the background of France's \nimmigration policy and the reason for their legislation:\n  Until the mid-seventies, immigrants to France came to work. Since the \nlaw was tightened in 1974, the inflows have changed. Today, only 7,000 \npermanent workers arrive each year, down from over 107,000 in the late \nsixties. Three-quarters of legal immigrants to France are family \nrelated. Not skill related, family related.\n\n       France has a low proportion of skilled immigrants. France's \n     Interior Minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, argues ``that under the \n     pretext of protecting jobs at home, France has created a \n     system that let's in only those who have neither a job nor \n     any useful skills.''\n\n  How about that?\n  The Economist article goes on to describe an immigration bill that \nMr. Sarkozy has put before the French Parliament this week, which \naddresses that very problem.\n\n       Mr. Sarkozy's proposal, in many ways, simply follows the \n     practice of other countries, notably Australia, Canada, \n     Switzerland, as well as Britain and the Netherlands. In each \n     case, the policy is based on a recognition that there is no \n     such thing as zero immigration, and that a managed, skill-\n     based immigration policy will not only control inflows, but \n     will also bring benefits to those countries.\n\n  Madam President, we have focused on a lot of hot button issues, some \nof which are very important, but we have not given serious thought to \nthe fundamentals of what we are doing here, and what impact it will \nhave on our country. We are not giving any thought to what the \nNetherlands, what France, what Britain, what Canada, and what Australia \nare doing. We are not in any way following their model. In fact, we are \nignoring the testimony of some of our Nation's most prestigious \neconomists on those issues.\n  As a result, we have a fundamentally flawed piece of legislation on \nthe floor of the Senate. It should never ever become law, and it is a \nsad day when those who are supporting this legislation are reduced to \nquietly going around and suggesting: Don't worry about it being so bad, \nwe just have to do something and maybe the House of Representatives \nwill save us.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to recognize the Army \nAviation Association's top National Guard aviation unit for 2005. Since \n1969, the Army Aviation Association has presented this award to the \nbest Army National Guard aviation unit. Indeed, it is a great honor to \nrepresent the State of this year's winner, the 1st Battalion, 126th \nAviation Regiment of the Rhode Island Army National Guard.\n  The 1st of the 126th has a long and distinguished history. Tracing \nits roots back to 1930 and the 68th Field Artillery Brigade, the 1st of \nthe 126th was founded as a field artillery unit and later transitioned \nto medical care specialists. But in the 1960s, the unit was reorganized \ninto an aviation unit. Since that time, it has performed with \nextraordinary professionalism and skill in its role as an aviation \nunit.\n  Deployed to Iraq from January to December of 2005, the 1st of the \n126th served as the core of Task Force Dragonwing during Operation \nIraqi Freedom. Task Force Dragonwing, based out of Balad Airbase north \nof Baghdad, was the lead force responsible for conducting combat \nsupport aviation operations through the entire Iraqi theater. They \naccumulated over 16,000 hours of combat mission flight hours during \nnearly 2,000 missions while transporting 66,000 passengers and 5,000 \ntons of cargo. During their tour, they flew 46 missions in direct \naction against known or suspected anti-Iraqi forces, and 22 missions \nwere subjected to known surface-to-air fire, with 7 aircraft receiving \nbattle damage. Throughout the professional performance of their duties, \nno members of the unit were killed or seriously injured.\n  The 1st of the 126th is comprised of 457 soldiers who man and \nmaintain 24 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters and 12 CH-47 Chinook \nhelicopters. Their mission is to perform air assault and movement \noperations and to provide command, control, supervision, staff \nplanning, and logistical support to all units affiliated with the \nbattalion.\n  During one of my visits to Iraq, I had the great honor and \nopportunity to fly with them, to observe their unit firsthand. In fact, \nI was honored to be accompanied by GEN John Abizaid, whose comments \nabout their skill and professionalism brought great pride to me and all \nRhode Islanders. This unit was ably commanded by COL Chris Callahan and \nwas led by soldiers, pilots, and crew members with great skill and \ncourage and professionalism.\n  I was, indeed, honored and thrilled to be with them in Iraq, to see \ntheir operation, to see the contribution they made to our effort in \nIraq. The 1st of the 126th has proven itself an exceptional unit and \ndeserves to be selected by the Army Aviation Association as the top \naviation unit for 2005. They have served their country with honor. We \nare all proud of their service, in the State of Rhode Island and \nthroughout the Nation. Indeed, it is heartwarming to see them being \nrecognized nationally for their great success, their great service to \nthe Nation, and their great professionalism. I commend Colonel Callahan \nand all the officers and personnel of that unit for their service, for \ntheir sacrifice, for their dedication to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/19/senate-section/article/S4830-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4830-S4832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NEEDLESS SUBSIDIES TO OIL COMPANIES\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, a couple of weeks ago, I stood in this \nspot for almost 5 hours because I wanted to prosecute an important \ncause, the cause of cutting needless subsidies to oil companies when \nthe price of oil is over $70 a barrel. Today the price of oil is still \nabout $70 a barrel, but there is a prospect of some good news. Late \nlast night, the House of Representatives did something that seemed \nunimaginable in the Senate a couple of weeks ago. They actually had a \nvote on whether profitable oil companies should get taxpayer-funded \nroyalty giveaways at a time when our citizens are paying record prices \nat the gas pump.\n  When I spoke on the floor several weeks ago, all I was trying to do \nwas get an up-or-down vote on exactly what the House of Representatives \nvoted for last night. In fact, I spoke in this spot for more than 4 \nhours before any Senator of either political party raised any concern \nabout the proposal I was advancing. But despite that extended effort, I \nwas unable to get an up-or-down vote on my proposal to stop ladling out \ntens of billions of dollars of unnecessary subsidies to the oil \nindustry.\n  Last night, the House of Representatives not only voted, but they \nvoted overwhelmingly, on a bipartisan basis, to put a stop to this \nextraordinary waste of taxpayer money.\n  I remind the Senate and those who may be following this debate that \nthe Government Accountability Office has said that a minimum of $20 \nbillion will be spent on this program. There is litigation involving \nthis program underway. If the litigation is successful, and we are not \nable to roll back this subsidy, this program could cost taxpayers $80 \nbillion.\n  Fortunately, the House voted last night to prohibit funding for new \noffshore oil and natural gas production leases if companies do not pay \nroyalties based on fair market prices. The House vote aims to get oil \nand gas companies to renegotiate Federal contracts signed in 1998 and \n1999 that included royalty relief for companies at a time when crude \noil prices were considerably lower than they are now. If the companies \nwish to continue to get new leases in the future, they would have to \nrenegotiate the old leases and pay royalties based on current market \nconditions. This is very much along the lines of what I sought, after \nan extended discussion, to have the Senate vote on just a few weeks \nago.\n  Some have argued that this approach would be essentially like \nblackmailing the companies by denying new leases\n\n[[Page S4831]]\n\nunless they renegotiated the old ones. These opponents have argued \nthat, instead, Congress ought to keep in place these giveaway contracts \nat a cost of billions of dollars to our citizens.\n  I also point out, as we did several weeks ago on this floor, that \nthis was a bipartisan ripoff. Mistakes were made during the Clinton \nadministration in 1998 and 1999. Secretary Norton sweetened the pot \nearly on, during the President's term, administratively. Then in the \nsummer of 2005, in the conference between the House and the Senate, \nthese subsidies were made still sweeter. So the sugar just kept coming \nat a time when the program was already way too sweet for the taste of \ntaxpayers.\n  No one has a constitutional right to get new leases to drill on \nFederal lands at giveaway prices. Congress can set new terms and \nconditions for new leases at any time. In fact, the Congress did just \nthat less than a year ago in passing the Energy bill. The House of \nRepresentatives did the same thing in their vote last night. I still \nbelieve the Senate ought to have an opportunity to debate and to vote \non the oil royalty issue as well, and I will tell the Senate today I am \ngoing to do everything in my power to get this issue back on the floor \nof the Senate as soon as possible. This is a ripoff of our taxpayers. \nIt is an outrage, at a time when middle class folks show up at a gas \nstation in Georgia and Oregon and elsewhere around the country, pay \nhuge prices, and then on top of it their taxpayer dollars are being \nused to subsidize the companies with these giveaway contracts.\n  This is too important an issue for the Senate to duck. Too much \ntaxpayer money is at stake for the Senate to duck. I do not see how the \nSenate can explain away not voting on this after the discussion we have \nhad thus far and after the House of Representatives has now voted, in a \nbipartisan way, to do what was the subject of extended debate on the \nSenate floor.\n  The oil companies are supposed to pay royalties to the Federal \nGovernment when they extract oil from Federal lands. But in order to \nstimulate production of oil in our country, the Federal Government, \nover the last decade, has been discounting these royalty fees. These \ndiscounts now amount to billions of dollars. The royalty relief that is \ngiven to the oil companies is now the granddaddy of all the oil \nsubsidies.\n\n  There has been a lot of debate on the floor of this body over the \nlast few weeks about tax breaks for the oil companies. The President, \nin my view, to his credit, has indicated that he understands that these \ntax breaks are no longer needed. I was very pleased to see that. I was \npleased to hear the President's comment because when the chief \nexecutives from the major oil companies came to the Energy Committee \nlast November, I literally went down the row and asked them if they \ncontinued to need all of these tax breaks.\n  The oil executives said they don't need the tax breaks. But the \nCongress decided to keep ladling them out. So on top of the oil \ncompanies' record profits, on top of record prices, on top of record \ntax breaks, what we have seen is record amounts of royalty relief \ngranted to the oil companies as well.\n  With prices in the stratosphere, I do not see how anyone can justify \nthis multibillion-dollar subsidy. The point of my amendment several \nweeks ago was to get rid of these special oil company discounts, the \nspecial breaks that amount to billions of dollars, unless the price of \noil comes down or unless the Bush administration determines that \nroyalty relief is necessary to avoid supply disruption.\n  There is, in my view, a growing bipartisan chorus saying that royalty \nrelief is not needed. For example, as another showing of bipartisanship \nin this cause, a distinguished Member of the other body who chairs the \nResources Committee, Congressman Richard Pombo, said in a newspaper \ninterview that there is no need for this particular incentive. He said \nthere is not any need for what the Congress has been ladling out and \nhas said it is not necessary at a time of these prices.\n  In addition, Mr. Michael Coney, a lawyer for the Shell Oil Company, \nnot exactly a place where you would look for somebody to gratuitously \nbash the industry--he basically said the same thing. He said in this \nkind of climate you can't make a case for a multibillion-dollar \nsubsidy.\n  The architect of the program, the author of the program, a very \nrespected, very esteemed former colleague of many of us here, Senator \nBennett Johnston of Louisiana, has said what has taken place with \nrespect to the royalty relief program is not at all what he had in mind \nwhen he wrote the law.\n  Last night, the House of Representatives took a landmark step towards \nreforming this program to reflect current market conditions. I pay a \nspecial congratulations to two long-term friends from the other body, \nCongressman Ed Markey and Congressman Maurice Hinchey. They both spent \nan enormous amount of time on this issue. They focused on building \nbipartisan support for their effort. And what Congressman Markey and \nwhat Congressman Hinchey were able to do last night was a real \nbreakthrough in terms of protecting the interests of taxpayers. I \ncongratulate those two for building a bipartisan coalition on behalf of \nthis cause.\n  What I proposed in the Senate was a similar approach to getting the \nroyalty program back on track. I said we ought to roll back these \nroyalty relief subsidies. Let's make sure we are sensitive to the \nprospect of conditions that can't be anticipated now. If the President \nsays there is going to be a supply disruption or problems are taking \nplace, then we would have a chance to look at it again. Previously, \nthere had been a particular provision in the royalty relief program \nthat said when the oil prices shot up, when they went above a certain \nlevel--then it was considered above $34 a barrel--the companies would \nhave to, once again, start paying these royalties. But the problem the \nSenate and now the House has been looking at stems from the fact that \nsome in the Clinton administration weren't watching the store. They \nweren't watchdogging this program. They weren't watchdogging the \ninterests of taxpayers as they should have. So they did not put in this \nclause, the clause that protects taxpayers by setting the price level \nwhen you cut off the subsidies, and they didn't include the clause that \nprotects the taxpayers in a number of the leases.\n  As a result, what has happened is taxpayer money has been wasted and \nthere has been a litigation derby, with scores and scores of lawsuits, \nwith companies still asserting the right to get more cash out of the \ntaxpayer till. The Government Accountability Office has estimated that \nat minimum the Federal Government is going to be out $20 billion. This \nis the biggest subsidy of them all in the energy area.\n  I recall when I was on the Senate floor earlier our colleague from \nFlorida, Senator Nelson, raised an important concern with respect to a \noil subsidy program that he was troubled by. It costs the taxpayers $1 \nbillion. Senator Nelson of Florida was spot on, in terms of trying to \nprotect taxpayers and deal with another area where taxpayers' interests \nhave not been well served. But Senator Nelson was talking about \nsomething that was relatively small potatoes compared to the money that \nis involved with royalties.\n  Suffice it to say, with the subsidies going out the door now and the \nprospect that the litigation is successful, there is a very real threat \nthat the cost of the subsidy will go still higher, and there are some \nindependent experts in this field who have said that the cost of this \nprogram could come in at $80 billion.\n  Under the Energy bill signed into law last summer, the oil companies \nwere given new subsidies in the form of reduced royalty fees for the \noil and gas they extract from Federal land, including offshore drilling \nin the Gulf of Mexico. This particular new subsidy in the summer of \n2005 was signed into law when the companies were already reporting \nextraordinary profits. We were already seeing the consumer getting \npounded at the gas pump, and it would have been an ideal time, in that \nsummer of 2005, for the Congress to do what members of both political \nparties have been talking about, and that is roll back these \nunnecessary expenses, these unnecessary costs to taxpayers. It should \nhave been done in that conference in the summer of 2005.\n  It was wrong that Senators and Members of the other body agreed, in \nthe summer of 2005, to expand a program which has lost any sensible \nphilosophical foundation, a program that\n\n[[Page S4832]]\n\nbegan in a time when oil was around $16 a barrel, and now is one that \nhas been reconfigured into one that gives out subsidies when the price \nof oil is $70 a barrel.\n  Back when that energy conference got together in the summer of 2005, \nthose Members of the Senate and the other body should have said: This \nis the time to draw the line. This royalty relief program does not pass \nthe smell test. It makes absolutely no sense to be dispensing billions \nand billions of dollars of royalty relief to the oil companies on top \nof everything else they already receive.\n  What I hope now, with the promising action that was taken in the \nHouse of Representatives late last night, is I hope it is possible for \nsome common sense, some practical action on behalf of taxpayers, to win \nbipartisan support in the Senate. That is what caused me to come to \nthis floor several weeks ago and stay in this spot for almost 5 hours.\n  I am about done now because I think we have made the point, and I \ndon't think we need to spend 5 hours on it today. But I will tell you \nthat a program like this, which was useful back when prices were low, \nmakes no sense, no sense at all anymore.\n  You can argue for government subsidies at a time when, for example, \noil prices are low, and when we are talking about the need to stimulate \nproduction, when the American economy needs a shot in the arm. But you \ncertainly don't need billions of dollars of royalty relief for \ncompanies at a time when you have record profits, record costs, and \nrecord tax breaks.\n  I am very hopeful that when the Senate comes back next week, we will \nbegin a bipartisan effort to put in place legislation very much along \nthe lines of what passed the House of Representatives late last night. \nThere will be an opportunity to support the kind of commonsense reform \nI have been talking about, which passed the House last night, when the \nInterior appropriations bill comes to the floor.\n  I also appreciate particularly the efforts of Senator Kyl of Arizona \nwho has worked with me on this cause. He was a very active colleague \nduring the debate, and since then has worked with me to try to find a \nway to advance this cause in the Senate.\n  We now have a new opportunity to protect the interests of taxpayers \nand to modernize our energy policy.\n  Talk about not keeping up with the times. How can you argue in favor \nof a program that began when oil was $16 a barrel? That is what we are \ndealing with. We are subsidizing the price of this commodity at a time \nwhen it hovers around $70 a barrel using a program that began decades \nago when the price of oil was $16 a barrel. It makes no sense.\n  I am going to be back on this floor at the first possible opportunity \nto see if it is possible, on a bipartisan basis, to accomplish what I \nand Senator Kyl were not able to do on a bipartisan basis a couple of \nweeks ago. I hope in the Senate there will be a new interest in saving \nour taxpayers' money and promoting fiscal responsibility by reining in \nfurther royalty relief for oil companies. We ought to stipulate that if \nthe price goes down, or America faces some kind of supply disruption, \nwe could revisit it. But until then, we ought to roll back this oil \ncompany royalty relief and save our citizens' hard-earned taxpayer \ndollars for more worthy causes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/19/senate-section/article/S4832-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4832-S4833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Madam President, many of our Nation's law enforcement \nofficers have come to Washington, DC, to commemorate National Police \nWeek. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize all Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement officials for their outstanding \nservice and their vital contributions to the safety of our communities. \nI would also like to honor the memory of those who gave their lives in \nthe line of duty. These officers, and their families, have paid the \nultimate sacrifice for the safety of others.\n  The first National Police Week was celebrated in 1962 when President \nJohn F. Kennedy signed an Executive order designating May 15 as Peace \nOfficers Memorial Day and the week in which that date falls as ``Police \nWeek.'' The weeklong tribute to our Nation's local, State and Federal \npolice officers honors those who died in the line of duty and those who \ncontinue to serve and protect us every day at great personal risk. \nAccording to the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund, 1,635 law \nenforcement officers have been killed in the line of duty in the last \n10 years. In 2005 alone, 155 officers lost their lives, including 5 \nfrom Michigan. The names of these officers have been permanently \nengraved on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial along side \nmore than 17,000 others.\n  Sadly, more police officers have lost their lives to guns than to any \nother cause over the last 10 years. In 2005, 59 officers were shot to \ndeath while in the line of duty. This year's Police Week activities \noccur shortly after the horrific shooting of Detective Vicky Armel and \nOfficer Michael Garbarino at a police station in nearby Fairfax County, \nVA. Last Monday afternoon, Detective Armel and Officer Garbarino were \nambushed in the parking lot of the police station by an 18-year-old \nreportedly armed with an AK-47 military-style assault rifle, a high-\npowered hunting rifle, and five handguns. During the course of the \nshootout with Detective Armel, Officer Garbarino, and other officers, \nthe gunman fired more than 70 times. Tragically, Detective Armel died \nlater that day and Officer Garbarino passed away early Wednesday \nmorning.\n  It is not enough to simply mention those, like Detective Armel and \nOfficer Garbarino, who have given their lives protecting our \ncommunities. In order to truly honor their service and sacrifice, we \nshould take up and pass commonsense gun safety legislation to help \nprotect law enforcement officials from the threat posed by military \nstyle firearms.\n  The sale of assault rifles like the AK-47 used in last week's \nshooting were prohibited under the 1994 assault weapons ban. \nUnfortunately, the President and the Republican congressional \nleadership allowed this legislation to expire on September 13, 2004, \nallowing 19 previously banned types of assault weapons and other \nfirearms with military style features to once again be legally sold. \nRecognizing the especially lethal nature of these military style \nfirearms, I have cosponsored legislation to restore and strengthen the \nassault weapons ban.\n  I am also a cosponsor of legislation to prohibit the sale of the \nFive-Seven armor-piercing handgun and its ammunition in the United \nStates. A number of national law enforcement organizations have \npublicly called for a ban on these firearms because of the threat they \npose to police officers, even those wearing body armor. According to \nthe manufacturer's Web site, the Five-Seven weighs less than 2 pounds \nfully loaded and measures only 8.2 inches in length, making it easily \nconcealable. A statement which previously appeared on the Web site \nboasted ``Enemy personnel, even wearing body armor can be effectively \nengaged up to 200 meters. Kevlar helmets and vests as well as the \nCRISAT protection will be penetrated.'' These military style pistols \nclearly have no sporting purpose and pose a great threat to the lives \nof our law enforcement officers.\n  We can and should do more to support and protect those who are \nworking to ensure the safety of our communities.

Madam President, I join Senator Kohl as sponsor of the \nOil Industry Merger Antitrust Enforcement Act. This bill will make it \nsignificantly more difficult for oil companies to merge, and should \nhelp put an end to the record energy prices that continue to burden \nAmerica's consumers and businesses.\n  As we all know, these high fuel costs are affecting every family, and \nthey show no sign of coming back down. We must continue our efforts to \ndo something about it. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Antitrust, \nCompetition Policy and Consumer Rights, I have been working for years \nto combat the problem of higher energy prices. Along with Senator Kohl, \nI have championed legislation to make it clear that that the Department \nof Justice has the legal authority to prosecute OPEC for its price \nfixing of crude oil prices. As we all know, the biggest part of our gas \nprices is the price of crude oil, and the only way we can restore \ncompetition in the market for crude oil is to fight against OPEC's \nblatantly illegal and anticompetitive conspiracy to fix prices of this \ncrucial commodity.\n  I have also asked the Federal Trade Commission to monitor gasoline \nprices to make sure that consumers are not subject to price gouging or \nillegal price manipulation, and in response to that request the FTC has \ninstituted an ongoing project to monitor gasoline prices in 360 markets \nacross the Nation, including 12 in my home State of Ohio.\n  Further, the Judiciary Committee has held two hearings addressing the \ncauses of higher fuel prices in recent months, and last month I joined \nwith Chairman Specter and Senators Kohl, Leahy, Feinstein, and Durbin, \nto sponsor legislation which prevents oil companies from unfairly \nmanipulating the supply of oil in order to artificially raise prices, \nand also calls for investigations into how effective enforcement of oil \nmergers has been, whether past mergers need to be revisited, and \nwhether the enforcement agencies need new standards for reviewing oil \nindustry mergers. That legislation also creates a Joint Federal and \nState Task force to investigate information sharing in the oil industry \nthat may lead to artificially high prices for gasoline, electricity, \nand heating oil. Perhaps most important, it provides a ``NOPEC'' \nprovision like the one that Senator Kohl and I have sponsored in the \npast, which enables Justice to prosecute the illegal OPEC cartel.\n  While all these efforts are steps in the right direction, we continue \nto see increasing fuel costs, and one likely reason is the ongoing \nconsolidation in the oil industry. And, as our energy needs increase \nand as oil gets harder and more expensive to find and produce, it seems \nlikely that this consolidation will continue. Therefore, we need to \ncontinue our efforts to maintain competition in this industry, and by \nmaking it more difficult for oil companies to merge, this legislation \nprovides a different and useful approach for keeping these companies \nindependent and maintaining the competition that still exists.\n  Specifically, this bill changes the burden of proof in cases alleging \nillegal mergers, so that oil companies that want to merge must prove \nthat their merger will not harm consumers. In addition, this bill \nrequires the antitrust agencies to specifically consider the unique \nconditions of the petroleum market when evaluating these mergers, in \norder to assure that when reviewing proposed mergers the agencies are \nfocusing on the potential dangers of oil industry mergers. These \nchanges, taken together, will make sure that only pro-competitive \nmergers are allowed, and will help protect consumers and businesses \nfrom higher energy prices.\n  We still have many challenges to face in our ongoing efforts to \ncombat high energy prices, but this bill will make a difference and I \nstrongly encourage my colleagues to join in support of its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/19/senate-section/article/S4834-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF CLARK, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, today I rise in order to pay \ntribute to the 125th anniversary of the founding of the city of Clark, \nSD. As the county seat of Clark County, this vibrant, progressive \ncommunity has been a center of commercial and civic activity since its \ninception.\n  The site which Clark is built on was chosen by GEN S.J. Conklin, who \nwould later become known as the Father of Clark County. The prospects \nof the town increased greatly when the railroad was complete in early \n1882. With the arrival of the trains came a flurry of economic \nactivity. The first businesses opened in Clark were the Clark House \noperated by Mattie Greenslet and a general store operated by COL W.H. \nLamb. Later there would be a land office and the Big Store, known as \nthe largest department store west of Minneapolis.\n  Now Clark is home to seven churches, a thriving business community, \nexcellent hunting and fishing, and the high school's Clark Comets, \namong various other attractions. Each year, Clark hosts both Potato Day \nand the Halloween Spooktacular. Additionally, there are over two dozen \ncivic organizations doing good work in the community.\n  I am pleased to announce that Clark will be celebrating its 125th \nanniversary with a community celebration on June 10 to 11. There are \nnumerous events scheduled, including a parade, street dance, ecumenical \nchurch service, community potluck, and baseball games. This celebration \nis a fitting way to recognize Clark's long and productive history.\n  Even 125 years after its founding, Clark continues to be a vital \ncommunity and a great asset to South Dakota. I am proud to publicly \nhonor Clark on this memorable occasion. The citizens of Clark are \ncontinuing to live up their motto: Clark is indeed ``a nice place to \nvisit . . . a great place to call home.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/19/senate-section/article/S4834-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4834-S4835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE PASSING OF ANN WEBSTER SMITH\n\n Mr. CHAFEE.

Just last \nyear, Ms. Smith was awarded the Piero Gazzola Prize, given once every 3 \nyears by the International Council on Monuments and Sites, for her \nlifelong efforts to protect the world's historic and cultural sites. \nThis tribute, seconded by scores of ICOMOS leaders from throughout the \nworld, is a statement that leadership is as much about cultivation, \npersistence and persuasion as it is bold initiative.\n  In addition to her 30 years of service to ICOMOS, Ms. Smith served as \nNew York's Deputy Commissioner for Parks, Recreation and Historic \nPreservation, and as a professional staff member at the USDOT and \nAdvisory Council for Historic Preservation. She was most active in \nthose critical years when she and her colleagues created the modern \ninstitutional foundation for preservation in the U.S.\n  In her service to ICOMOS, Ms. Smith was dedicated to recognizing the \nworld's greatest cultural and natural sites through the United Nations \nWorld Heritage Program. At the same time, as an American she had \ngreater ambitions for her own country. In a letter she sent me just \nlast January, she lamented: ``I have long been concerned by the fact \nthat the United States, the first nation to ratify the Convention after \nits passage in 1972, has been so slow to recognize the importance of \nimplementing the Convention. In my view the Convention has the \npotential for increasing community pride, for expanding educational \nawareness and interest in our Nation's heritage and history, for \ndeveloping concern about the importance of distinguished architecture \nand planning, especially in urban areas, and for serving as an \nimportant tool for the expansion of development\n\n[[Page S4835]]\n\nof cultural tourism.'' Increasing numbers of Americans agree with Ms. \nSmith's vision.\n  Clearly, Ann Webster Smith was respected and loved by the entire \ncultural heritage and preservation community for a lifetime of \nleadership and friendship. Her work will live on because she inspired \nso many throughout the U.S. and the world to work as hard as they can \nto recognize, celebrate and protect our cultural heritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/19/senate-section/article/S4835-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:33 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 5386.

A bill to facilitate and expedit direct refunds to coal \nproducers and exporters of the excise tax unconstitutionally imposed on \ncoal exported from the United States; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nthat will ensure fair tax treatment for domestic coal producers and \ncoal exporters to help them receive the coal excise tax refunds due to \nthem from an unconstitutional tax they paid.\n  For years the Federal Government collected the coal excise tax on \ncoal exports from coal producers and coal exporters. In 1998, the \nFederal Courts declared the coal excise tax unconstitutional when \napplied to exported coal.\n  Although those that export coal are entitled to the refunds of the \nunconstitutional coal excise tax on exported coal, they face serious \nand significant obstacles to obtaining refunds of the tax with the \nInternal Revenue Service and the courts.\n  This legislation will end unnecessary litigation on this issue and \nsimplify the IRS process that U.S. coal producers and exporters use to \nobtain refunds of the coal excise tax they paid. It also will ensure \nthat the producer or exporter that actually exported the coal, and thus \nis entitled to the refund, receives that refund.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 2913. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe employment tax treatment and reporting of wages paid by \nprofessional employer organizations; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, Senator Baucus and I are \nintroducing legislation that will update and clarify the tax rules for \nbusiness clients and that use professional employer organizations, \nPEOs. This legislation will improve the efficiency of small businesses \nby eliminating any uncertainty about the ability of qualifying PEOs to \nassume liability for paying wages and collecting and remitting Federal \nemployment taxes.\n  Business owners are overwhelmed with the challenges of meeting \nFederal and State employment and tax responsibilities. Many businesses, \nparticularly small to mid-sized businesses are turning to professional \nemployer organizations for assistance with these employment \nobligations. A PEO works with its business clients to provide \ncomprehensive employment services. The PEO assumes responsibility for \nthe management of human resources, employee benefits, payroll, and \nworkers' compensation, allowing their business clients to focus on \ntheir core competencies to maintain and grow their bottom line. In \nshort, this legislation is about improving the efficiency of America's \nsmall businesses.\n  Businesses today need help with the increasingly complex employment \nrelated matters. The most important of these matters is the payment of \nwages and the collection and remitting of employment taxes. \nIncreasingly, businesses are turning to PEOs to assume these \nresponsibilities. Our legislation will eliminate any ambiguity about a \nPEO's ability to assume employment tax responsibility while providing \nimportant safeguards for the PEO's small business clients.\n  Tbe Small Business Efficiency Act will permit PEOs that are certified \nby the IRS, CPEO, to collect and remit Federal employment taxes of \ntheir business clients' employees. The certification process is \nvoluntary and was designed with significant input from all \nstakeholders, including the Department of the Treasury and the IRS. To \nbe certified by the IRS, the CPEO would have to meet financial and \nother standards and maintain ongoing certification by the IRS. The CPEO \nwould be required to assume full and sole responsibility for the \ncollection of Federal employment taxes.\n  In addition to the many benefits for business clients, the government \nbenefits from improved employment regulatory compliance and tax \nadministration The IRS has stated that CPEOs would facilitate tax \nadministration by reducing the number of returns it processes and by \nreducing errors in calculating and paying employment taxes. This is a \nwin-win situation. The PEO arrangement not only reduces the \ngovernmental burden of collecting employment tax and unemployment \ncompensation obligations, it also assures consistent compliance with \ncomplex tax laws and timely and expedited payment of taxes. This is \nclearly an improvement for PEOs, the business clients of PEOs, and the \nFederal Government.\n  The Small Business Efficiency Act will substantially simplify \nemployment tax obligations for businesses that use PEOs. The \nlegislation will provide clarity for PEOs, their business clients, and \nthe IRS regarding the rights of a PEO to assist business client with \nemployment tax responsibilities while significantly improving tax \nadministration. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a \nsection-by-section description of the bill be printed in the \nCongressional Record and I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto address this issue in a timely manner.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2913\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Short Title: The Small Business Efficiency Act.\n       Section 2. No Inference Language: The legislation is \n     narrowly drafted to provide expressly that except for the \n     payment of employment taxes as provided in the bill, there is \n     no inference regarding the determination of who is a common \n     law employer under Federal tax laws or who is an employer \n     under other provisions of the law.\n       Section 3. Certified Organizations: Creates a voluntary \n     certification program for Professional Employer Organizations \n     (CPEOs) by establishing basic requirements which must be met \n     in order to be certified by the Internal Revenue Service \n     (IRS).\n       Section 3(a) describes the responsibility of the CPEO with \n     respect to the covered workers performing services at its \n     business client's worksite, with the CPEO being treated as \n     the employer of those covered workers for employment tax \n     purposes. This section provides that after certification, a \n     CPEO assume the responsibility and liability for payment of \n     wages and collection of Federal employment taxes for covered \n     workers. This section also provides that a CPEO and its \n     clients will be treated as ``successor'' employers for \n     employment tax purposes with no additional taxes owed simply \n     because a client engages or disengages a CPEO. Finally, the \n     section imposes rules that prevent abuse.\n       Section 3(b) describes certification requirements which a \n     PEO must demonstrate to the IRS by written application. As \n     established by the Secretary of the Treasury, these could \n     include requirements with respect to tax status, background, \n     experience, business location, and annual financial audits, \n     as well as verification of the continuing accuracy of \n     representations and information on a periodic basis. In \n     addition, this section requires CPEOs to obtain financial \n     reviews from independent CPAs and to post a bond for the \n     payment of employment taxes. A worksite employee is a worker \n     who performs services at the CPEO's business client worksite \n     if the worker and at least 85% of the individuals working at \n     the worksite are covered by a written service contract that \n     provides the CPEO will (1) assume responsibility for payment, \n     reporting and withholding of wages, employment taxes and \n     employee benefits, without regard to the adequacy of payment \n     by the client business. The service contract would also be \n     required to expressly provide that the CPEO assumes shared \n     responsibility with the business client for firing the worker \n     or hiring or recruiting any new worker and for maintaining \n     employee records.\n       Section 3(c) provides conforming amendments with respect to \n     certain credits and reporting rules.\n       Section 3(d) makes certain clerical amendments.\n       Section 3(e) creates regulatory authority to develop \n     appropriate reporting and recordkeeping rules.\n       Section 3(f) authorizes the creation of a CPEO \n     certification user fee not to exceed $500.\n       Section 3(g) provides that the provisions of the Act will \n     take effect on January 1 of the first calendar year beginning \n     more than 12 months after the date of enactment. This section \n     further requires the Secretary of the Treasury to establish \n     the certification program not later than 6 months following \n     the effective date.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 2915. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to improve \nscreening for colorectal cancer for TRICARE beneficiaries over the age \nof 50; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a simple \nbill that would give military dependents and retirees the same choices \nfor colon cancer screening that every Medicare beneficiary and every \nFederal employee enjoys. This legislation requires Tricare to abandon \nits overly restrictive and outdated policy of limiting coverage of \nscreening colonoscopy to a small group of high-risk individuals. By \ncontrast, for several years both Medicare and the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program have paid for screening colonoscopy to detect \ncancer in average-risk people, and my bill simply applies this same \nstandard to the Tricare program.\n  Why is this bill so important? Colon cancer is highly curable when \ndetected and treated early but extremely lethal when it reaches an \nadvanced stage. Early detection and prompt treatment are the keys to \nsurviving colon cancer. Among those whose colon cancer has been cured \nby modern diagnostic and treatment methods are President Reagan, \nSupreme Court Justice Ginsburg, and our colleague Senator Burns, to \nname just a few.\n\n[[Page S4840]]\n\n  Why is access to colonoscopy so critical? At present, \ngastroenterologists overwhelmingly recommend colonoscopy as the \npreferred method to use for screening of colon cancer in average risk \nindividuals over 50. Colonoscopy is more sensitive than other methods \nof screening in detecting colonic neoplasia, pre-cancerous changes or \nfull-blown cancers, at an early stage; colonoscopy is more reliable in \nfinding colonic neoplasia in the upper \\2/3\\ of the colon; and \ncolonoscopy permits biopsy and removal of abnormal tissue as soon as it \nis discovered, in a single procedure. In fact, medical specialists \nrefer to colonoscopy as the ``gold standard'' for colon cancer \nscreening.\n  Since, 2001, the Medicare Program has permitted the use of \ncolonoscopy to screen for colon cancer in ``average risk'' individuals, \nand the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program has used the same \ncriteria since 2003. But the Tricare medical program for military \nbeneficiaries clings to an outmoded policy that authorizes screening \ncolonoscopy to detect colon cancer only for only a very narrowly \ndefined group of ``high risk'' people, not the much broader group of \n``average risk'' individuals covered by the Medicare and FEHBP \nprograms. By failing to keep up with modern medical practice, as well \nas with other federal health programs, Tricare seems to be \ninappropriately restricting access to a potentially lifesaving tool for \nearly cancer detection. The resulting unnecessary delay in detection of \ncolon cancer puts our military community at needless risk.\n  To remedy this situation, my bill requires the Tricare program to use \nthe same criteria as the Medicare program in paying for screening \ncolonoscopy. My bill does not mandate that screening colonoscopy be \nused for colon cancer detection in Tricare beneficiaries; that decision \nis left to Tricare patients and their doctors. Rather, this legislation \nsimply affords Tricare participants the same options that Federal \nemployees and Medicare beneficiaries have enjoyed for some time.\n  Frankly, I see no logical reason why those who have served our \ncountry in uniform for over 20 years, and the family members of those \ncurrently on active duty, should not have access to the same high-\nquality medical choices offered to our senior citizens and to our \nFederal workers. The policy on colon cancer screening that has worked \nwell for 42 million Medicare beneficiaries and 9 million FEHBP \nparticipants, a policy that is endorsed by most medical specialists, \nseems totally appropriate for the Tricare population. It is time to \nbring the Tricare program's colon cancer screening criteria into the \n21st century.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis commonsense legislation\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \n        Leahy, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Obama, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 2917. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to ensure net \nneutrality; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill preserve the open, unrestricted nature of the Internet. I want to \nthank my colleagues, Senator Dorgan and Senator Inouye, with whom I \nhave worked closely to draft this bill. I also want to acknowledge \nSenator Wyden, who has introduced similar net neutrality legislation, \nfor his leadership on this issue.\n  Having risen from its humble beginnings as an obscure tool for a few \ntech-savvy enthusiasts, the Internet now stands as the epicenter of \ncommerce today. An April 2006 Pew Internet study cites that 73 percent \nof adults in the U.S. now use the Internet, 45 percent of whom use it \nfor making major financial decisions. Last year alone, over $1.7 \ntrillion in transactions took place on the Internet, and today 725,000 \nsmall businesses use e-commerce giant eBay as a way to reach customers. \nBecause anyone, anywhere, can communicate and transact business with \nvirtually any corner of the globe with an Internet connection, the \nbenefits of the Internet on small businesses--and on rural places like \nmy home State of Maine--cannot be overstated.\n  The Internet became a robust engine of economic development by \nenabling anyone with a good idea to connect to consumers and compete on \na level playing field for consumers' business. Anyone can send an e-\nmail or set up a Web site at little or no cost, and the marketplace has \npicked winners and losers, rather than an arbitrary gatekeeper.\n  When users log onto the Internet, they take a lot of things for \ngranted. They assume that they will be able to access whatever Web site \nthey want, when they want to--and if they have a broadband connection, \nthey expect this to happen at a high speed, regardless of what Web site \nthey choose. They also assume that they can use any feature they like, \nanytime they choose--watching online videos, searching for information, \nmaking purchases, and sending e-mails and instant messages. They assume \nthat they can attach devices to make their online experience better--\nthings such as Web cameras, game controllers, or extra hard drives. \nWhat they are assuming is called ``net neutrality,'' the principle at \nthe core of the Internet's DNA. The idea is that the Internet should be \nopen and free, restricted by no one.\n  Unfortunately, all this may change very soon if Congress does not \ntake action. In August 2005, the Federal Communications Commission \nissued an order removing virtually all regulation of Internet \nfacilities that connect homes and businesses to the World Wide Web. \nAmong the regulations lifted were the long-standing non-discrimination \nrules that required the owners of Internet facilities networks--in most \ncases cable and telephone companies--to allow delivery of all Internet \ncontent to the end user at the same speed, refraining from blocking any \nWeb sites. These long-standing rules have enabled small businesses in \nMaine and across the country to have the same access to customers as \ngiant corporations. Yet without the protections of the legislation we \nintroduce today, those small businesses may be reduced to second-class \ncitizen status on the Web.\n  Telephone and cable companies supply broadband Internet service to 98 \npercent of Internet subscribers in this country. Recently, executives \nfrom several of the largest of these firms publicly indicated their \nintention to charge fees to Web site operators before giving them \naccess to their highspeed lines, and relegate those who do not pay up \nto the slower transmission lines. A Web site owned by a company who is \na competitor could even be blocked entirely.\n  Anyone who has sat frustrated at a computer screen waiting for a file \nto download knows what this means for the those Web site owners not \nwilling to pay up: their sites and applications will run at a slower \npace, thus turning away consumers. These Internet companies, e-mail \nservices, and Web site owners will be relegated to the Information \n``Dirt Road''--the Information Superhighway will be reserved for those \ncompanies who are willing to pay the toll. Worst of all, consumers and \nbusinesses who rely on these Internet services will be completely \npowerless, since it is beyond their control as to which Web site owners \nare willing to pay the fees.\n  The legislation we introduce today keeps the rules where they always \nhave been, until last year. First, the bill bars network operators from \nblocking, degrading or impairing Internet traffic. Second, the bill \nensures that network operators are not allowed to create a two-tiered \nInternet--an Internet that treats those who can afford to do business \nwith large nationwide broadband providers more favorably than those who \ndo not. Virtually everyone has called for more widespread deployment of \nbroadband facilities: this bill ensures that those high-speed networks \nare available for all users of the Internet.\n  This legislation already enjoys support from a broad spectrum of \ngroups who care about Internet freedom, such as the Consumer's Union, \nthe Parent's Television Council, the Gun Owners of America, the \nAmerican Library Association, and the Christian Coalition. Altogether \nover 140 organizations have backed our efforts to prevent \ndiscrimination the Internet.\n  If we allow companies to set up tollbooths along the Information \nSuperhighway, we will fundamentally alter every Internet user's \nexperience and stifle the entrepreneurship that flourishes on the \nworld's last remaining\n\n[[Page S4841]]\n\nfrontier. Network operators should not have the power to decide which \nWeb pages load faster, which content their customers can access, and \nwhose data has the highest priority. Network operators already enjoy \nnear-monopolistic privileges in many markets across the country. Should \nthis market power now be extended to messaging services, streaming \nvideo, or online shopping, just to name a few?\n  Consumers should decide which businesses succeed and which fail, not \nnetwork providers. What has made the Internet such a remarkable success \nis the ability of consumers everywhere to use the connection they pay \nfor to experience a world of their own choosing on their own terms. \nEarlier this month, the New York Times endorsed the legislation in an \neditorial when it called for ``a strong net neutrality bill that would \nprohibit broadband providers from creating a two-tiered Internet. \nSenators who care about the Internet and Internet users should get \nbehind it.'' I hope my colleagues join me in supporting the Internet \nFreedom Preservation Act.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today my colleague Senator Snowe and I are \nintroducing the Internet Freedom Preservation Act.\n  Internet freedom, known as net neutrality, is one of the most \nimportant issues facing us as the telecommunications landscape \ncontinues to change, and frankly, how this issue is resolved could \ndetermine whether our Nation continues to be a world leader in the area \nof innovation and technology.\n  Consumers, businesses, and the very marketplace of ideas have \nbenefited from the historically open nature of the Internet.\n  From the largest of corporations to the person working alone in a \ngarage, all have had the ability to offer their content, services, and \napplications over the Internet and to reach consumers, because of this \nopen structure of the Internet and the existence of net neutrality \nnondiscrimination rules.\n  I think it is important to point the wide variety of groups that have \ncalled for the preservation of strong net neutrality protections: \ngroups as diverse as Consumers Union, AARP, Microsoft, Amazon, Gun \nOwners of America, and the National Religious Broadcasters, and over \n150 organizations or companies so far have weighed in on this important \nissue.\n  The Internet, and the broadband network operators that bring the \nInternet to businesses and consumers, have enabled even the most rural \ntown in my State of North Dakota to be connected to the rest of the \nworld, and this connection has brought economic opportunities, and \nadvances in health and education that could otherwise not have been \npossible.\n  Now, however, the open nature of the Internet is at risk. It is at \nrisk because of actions by the Federal Communications Commission, and \nbecause of the lack of competition in the broadband market.\n  Non-discrimination rules that existed for years on broadband \nproviders have been removed, leaving only the marketplace to act as a \ncheck. The problem is, however, that the broadband marketplace is \nhighly concentrated--98 percent of consumers get their broadband from \neither cable modem or DSL, and up to 50 percent of consumers can only \nget their broadband from one broadband provider.\n  Thus, the situation is not a marketplace of players on an equal \nfooting. Broadband network operators have substantial market power and \nthe incentive to use it. There have been public statements by some of \ntheir CEOs that have made clear that they intend to use that leverage \nto exact payments from content providers and to operate as gatekeepers.\n  These broadband network operators have become more than just the pipe \nthat carries content, services, and applications to a consumer; they \nnow are in the business of these content, services and applications as \nwell. Thus, they have the leverage, and the incentive to favor their \nown services over competition.\n  Until now the Internet has been driven by consumers and innovators, \nwhich have in turn, encouraged broadband deployment.\n  Consumers pay for their Internet connection, and expect that they can \ngo anywhere they lawfully want to on the Internet.\n  But without maintaining the longstanding nondiscrimination rules that \nhave been in place for decades, the Internet could go from being driven \nby consumers and innovators to bring dictated by network operators.\n  What will be the impact on the next great application or service over \nthe Internet if the very first thing the next start-up has to do is \nwork out an agreement with the broadband provider?\n  What will be the impact on consumers if their choices are \nartificially limited by their broadband providers as to what VOIP or \nvideo service they can get?\n  I agree that broadband network operators are investing millions of \ndollars in building the next generation of infrastructure, and I \ncommend them for that. Under our bill they will still be able to be \ncompensated for their investments, as they are now, by charging for \ntheir broadband connections.\n  But they should not be able to put up additional tolls on the \nInternet, or erect barricades to competition that will change the \nnature of the Internet as we know it.\n  Our bill will preserve the freedom and the openness of the Internet \nthat we have come to take for granted, but that is now at risk.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this legislation that I introduce \ntoday with Senator Snowe.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to today in support of the \nlegislation introduced by my colleagues Senators Snowe and Dorgan to \npreserve a founding principle of communications law that is critical to \nthe promotion of innovation and opportunity for all Americans. The \npreservation of the open, non-discriminatory architecture of the \nInternet is vital to the American economy and society. Over a \nrelatively short timeframe, the Internet has become a robust engine for \nmarket innovation, economic growth, social discourse, and the free flow \nof ideas precisely because it has allowed consumer choice and control \nover the use of lawful content, applications and services. In turn, \nanyone with a good idea has been able to connect to consumers and \ncompete on a level playing field for consumers' business. The \nmarketplace has picked winners and losers, and not a central \ngatekeeper. This bedrock concept of connecting innovators and consumers \nwithout interference, known as ``net neutrality,'' has been a hallmark \nfeature of the Internet and is a principle reason why America leads the \nworld in online innovation.\n  Regrettably, without this legislation that heritage may be at risk as \ntraditional rules that have required communications operators to follow \nprinciples of non-discrimination no longer apply. In August 2005, the \nFCC refused to adopt meaningful and enforceable consumer safeguards at \nthe time it classified DSL and cable modem as an information service. \nAs a result, the bill that I have cosponsored with Senators Snowe and \nDorgan is necessary to ensure that consumers and content companies have \nthe ability to use the Internet without interference or gate-keeping by \nthe network operators.\n  This bill responds to recent FCC decisions by preserving the openness \nof the Internet and thereby encourages the continued development of \ninnovative Internet technologies, services, and content that has fueled \nthe American economy. Specifically, under the bill, consumers will have \nthe ability to access the content of their choosing, and Internet \nbusinesses will have the ability to compete head-to-head with network \nproviders on the basis of the merits of their offerings.\n  As the father of the Internet, Vint Cerf, said to our Committee, the \nInternet is ``innovation without permission.'' The proposed legislation \nwill ensure that the Internet indeed remains a platform that spawns \ninnovation and economic development for the benefit of all Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Lott):\n  S. 2918. A bill to provide access to newspapers for blind or other \npersons with disabilities; to the Committee on rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Rules Committee, legislation to ensure \nthat the blind and those with disabilities continue to have free access \nto electronic editions of periodicals and newspapers. This service is \nan extension of the existing authorization for the Library of\n\n[[Page S4842]]\n\nCongress to provide Braille books, recordings, sound reproduction \nequipment, musical scores, and other materials to the blind and \nphysically disabled individuals.\n  Currently, the National Federation of the Blind provides these \nservices through its NFB-NEWSLINE program which has been funded by the \nLibrary of Congress through its Books for the Blind program. The NFB-\nNEWSLINE program is a telephone-based electronic audio newspaper \nservice serving our Nation's 1.3 million blind Americans by providing \n23 million minutes of on-demand service in response to 2,600 calls per \nday at an average cost of 2.7 cents per minute.\n  Congress established the Books for the Blind program within the \nLibrary of Congress in 1931. The program is administered by the \nNational Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, NLS, \nwhich continues to be the primary source of Braille and audio books and \nmagazines for blind adults today. However, until development of the \nNFB-NEWSLINE program, it was not economically feasible for NLS to \nprovide timely access to newspapers for the blind. Under current \nproduction methods, it would require several weeks for NLS to prepare \nand deliver a single copy of a daily newspaper.\n  The NFB-NEWSLINE program, however, is designed for real time rapid \ndistribution of the electronic text of newspapers. Under this program, \nthe blind can access daily newspapers on the day of publication through \ntelephone access to the digital text. The funding for this program has \nbeen provided by a public-private partnership between NFB-NEWSLINE, \nstate sponsors, including public libraries, rehabilitation agencies, \nand several affiliates of NFB, and the Library of Congress. Newspaper \nand magazine content is contributed by many participating news \norganization and publishers.\n  The bill Senator Lott and I are introducing today will ensure the \ncontinued Federal share of this partnership so that NFB-NEWSLINE can \ncontinue to serve as the multi-state provider of this service. \nCurrently, NFB-NEWSLINE provides some level of service to all 50 \nstates, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico by providing local \ndialing numbers for the blind and disabled to use to access newspapers \nand periodicals. The annual telecommunications costs for this service \nis approximately $750,000 which serves approximately 40 percent of the \neligible readers.\n  This bill will enable NFB-NEWSLINE to continue to serve existing \nreaders with improved services while at the same time expanding \nservices to more readers. The bill authorizes $750,000 for this service \nin fiscal year 2007 and such sums as are necessary in fiscal years \n2008-2011. This is a very efficient program that for a very small \nFederal investment will allow the blind and disabled to more fully \nparticipate in their communities through access to the daily news. With \nthe current state of technology, it is simply unacceptable that the \nblind and disabled do not have real time access to daily newspapers and \nperiodicals.\n  I commend NFB-NEWSLINE for developing this public-private partnership \nto serve the needs of the blind and disabled individuals and I pleased \nto introduce this legislation to ensure the continuation of this \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/19/senate-section/article/S4842-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4083.

The Secretary \n     shall pay the fee and expenses of the arbitrator, subject to \n     the availability of appropriations for such purpose.\n       (iii) Arbitration proceedings.--The arbitrator shall \n     conduct the proceeding in accordance with the policies and \n     procedures promulgated by the American Arbitration \n     Association applicable to private arbitration of employment \n     disputes. The arbitrator shall make findings respecting \n     whether the termination was for just cause. The arbitrator \n     may not find that the termination was for just cause unless \n     the employer so demonstrates by a preponderance of the \n     evidence. If the arbitrator finds that the termination was \n     not for just cause, the arbitrator shall make a specific \n     finding of the number of days or hours of work lost by the \n     employee as a result of the termination. The arbitrator shall \n     have no authority to order any other remedy, including, but \n     not limited to, reinstatement, back pay, or front pay to the \n     affected employee. Within 30 days from the conclusion of the \n     arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall transmit the \n     findings in the form of a written opinion to the parties to \n     the arbitration and the Secretary.

or\n       (III) severe weather conditions that prevented the alien \n     from engaging in agricultural employment for a significant \n     period of time.\n\n       (iv) Application period.--The alien applies for adjustment \n     of status not later than 7 years after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (v) Fine.--The alien pays a fine to the Secretary in an \n     amount equal to $1,000.\n       (vi) English language.--The alien has demonstrated an \n     understanding of the English language, as required under \n     section 312(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1423(a)(1)).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/19/senate-section/article/S4843-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FLOOR PRIVILEGES\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Madam President, we will be closing in a few moments, but \nI did want to comment on an event this week that in many ways \ncelebrates the progrowth tax policy that President Bush initiated over \n5 years ago, and which, with the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, tax relief, \nand the relief of regulatory burden, has resulted in quite remarkable \ngrowth in our economy over the last 18 months.\n  This week in the Rose Garden the President signed into law the Tax \nIncrease Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005. The bill represents \na real victory for the American people, for each and every American \nfamily, and for the continued strength and vibrancy and resilience of \nan economy that leads the world.\n  The Republican majority has worked hard to resist efforts to raise \ntaxes, and that is exactly what this bill accomplished. It was 6 years \nago, back in\n\n[[Page S4845]]\n\n2000, that the President inherited an economy that was in recession. It \nwas emerging from a bursting Internet bubble, and the answer to our \neconomic malaise at the time was tax relief, was tax cuts. There was a \nlot of opposition on the floor of the Senate, but we got them through; \nsometimes by just a few votes, but we got them through. Now, because of \nthe President's firm, fiscally bold vision and strong fiscal and tax \nleadership, our economy is doing very well. America's families now feel \nbetter off because, indeed, they are better off.\n  We now have cut taxes for nearly 100 billion hard-working citizens. \nNew home sales were up nearly 14 percent just last month, and minority \nhome ownership is at its highest level ever. Consumer confidence is the \nhighest since May of 2002. The economy has created 5.3 million jobs. \nUnemployment is down to 4.7 percent, lower than the average of the \n1990s, lower than the average of the 1980s, and lower than the average \nof the 1970s. The tax cuts on capital gains and dividends are \nbenefiting Americans across the income spectrum.\n  It is interesting that if you look at the income tax returns each \nyear that are reporting capital gains and dividends, almost half of \nthem come from households with reported adjusted gross income of less \nthan $50,000. Tax relief, capital gains, and dividends go across the \neconomic spectrum.\n  Overall, the economy has enjoyed 18 consecutive quarters of economic \ngrowth. Meanwhile, all of this spurred growth has filled the tax \ncoffers just as anticipated, just as we said it would. As we argued \nback then, and as history has demonstrated, cutting taxes actually \nresults in increased tax revenues.\n  In January, the Congressional Budget Office found that the tax cuts \non capital gains and dividends resulted in the Government collecting an \nadditional $26 billion in revenue in 2004 and 2005. This year, tax \nrevenues will be 29 percent higher than they were in 2003 as a result \nof tax cuts. In fact, the Treasury Department reported last week that \nthis year's tax revenues were the second highest in American history, \ngiving the country a significant surplus for the month.\n  Last November, we called for extending the alternative minimum tax \nrelief. In February I insisted that Congress keep rates low on capital \ngains and dividends. Last week, as part of the Tax Increase Prevention \nAct, we delivered because we always remember that tax dollars are the \npeople's money, not the government's money.\n  We believe open markets and abundant opportunity unleashes our \ngreatest resource: the energy of the American people and the ingenuity \nof the American people. Keeping taxes low helps Americans find and keep \njobs, it boosts the family budget, and makes America a great place to \ndo business. It allows the entrepreneur to take a chance on that great \nidea, to reinvest, to hire more workers, to create jobs. As \nRepublicans, we believe in encouraging that creative and optimistic \nspirit. It is what has built this country. It is what makes America \ngreat.\n  We will continue to champion economic growth and fiscal \nresponsibility. We will continue to keep America moving forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/19/senate-section/article/S4845-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MAY 22, 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Madam President, the Senate has made a lot of progress on \nthe immigration bill. After spending almost 2 weeks on the bill a month \nago, we brought the bill back this week, and not knowing exactly what \nto expect, I set out with a pretty high watermark, a pretty high goal, \nand that is to consider a number of amendments in an open and free \ndebate and have those amendments voted upon. We have accomplished \nexactly what I had set out to do.\n  We are going to have another busy week. We have a recess, Memorial \nDay recess, after next week, so we have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, \nThursday, and Friday to conduct a lot of business. Senators are using \nthe day today--some of them have come to the floor to speak and to \ndebate and talk about the various issues. Others are using it to study \namendments for next week. Our next voting will be with two rollcall \nvotes on Monday, at least two votes, maybe others, beginning at 5:30.\n  The chairman will be here Monday working through the afternoon, \nworking with Senators on their proposed amendments. It is important \nthat we have the language on amendments people might be offering.\n  We have a lot of other work to do. The supplemental bill is currently \nin conference. Our colleagues are working very hard, in the House and \nSenate, so that we can complete that supplemental bill before the \nMemorial Day recess. The nomination of Brett Kavanaugh also is pending. \nBrett Kavanaugh has been nominated to the circuit court, and we need to \nbring him to the floor before we depart for that Memorial Day recess.\n  A lot of other issues are underway. The pensions conference report is \nbeing worked on aggressively, day in, day out, and I look forward to \nhaving that completed so when it is available we will be able to take \nit to the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/19/senate-section/article/S4845-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MAY 22, 2006, AT 1 P.M.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
