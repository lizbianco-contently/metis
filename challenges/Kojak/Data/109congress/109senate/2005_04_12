The Psalmist answers, ``One who has clean hands and a pure heart \nwho has not used G-d's name in false oaths.'' Almighty Legislator of \nour lives, our hopes, our dreams, as legislators, one may sometimes \ndespair and say, ``Who can stand in G-d's place?'' After all, we are \nhuman, limited. What a vast distance between us and the Creator of the \nlaws of the universe.\n  And yet, the Psalmist gives us hope. If you want our law to reflect \nultimate law, ``Start,'' says the Psalmist, ``with clean hands and a \npure heart.'' No worthy law has ever emanated from this place that was \nnot first and foremost ethical.\n  And then the Psalmist asks us to remember our vow, a vow given to the \nUltimate Legislator and to the American people, to hold fast to our vow \nno matter how great the pressure.\n  On this Tuesday in April 2005, may there be a sense of spring and \nrenewal. Let us bridge the distance between the law of the human beings \nand the law of the Creator of the universe.\n  Rabbi Akivah taught, ``The greatest of G-d's law is, `Love thy \nneighbor as thyself.' (Leviticus 19:18).'' May this Senate, may this \nCongress, may this people come ever closer through our laws to the \nultimate law of love. May you be blessed in your work, and may that \nwork make you, and through you, all of America, a home that reflects\nG-d's love on this Earth, and let us all say, Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/12/senate-section/article/S3441-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable David Vitter led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/12/senate-section/article/S3441-4", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We would like to finish this bill which \nprovides funding for our troops as quickly as we can.\n  Also, today we will have our respective policy luncheons and will \nrecess from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. to accommodate those meetings.\n  Mr. President, at this juncture I will yield to my colleagues for \ntheir brief statements and recognition of our guest Chaplain today, and \nthen I will have a brief opening statement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this is a very welcome moment for me \nbecause I have known Rabbi Orenstein personally for many years. Members \nof my family have worshiped at his synagogue, the Congregation Beth El \nin South Orange. I have worshiped with him for 35 years.\n  Rabbi Orenstein is going to be retiring from Congregation Beth El \nvery shortly. He and his lovely wife Sylvia are going to be honored for \ntheir many years of service, and it is going to be done next month.\n  Rabbi Orenstein is a distinguished scholar. He has a master's degree \nin Judaica and was ordained as rabbi at the Jewish Theological Seminary \nof America where he also received a doctorate of divinity.\n  He has completed course work for a Ph.D. in linguistics at New York \nUniversity. The rabbi has always inspired education and learning in his \ncongregation and has held interesting meetings for the congregation \nover the years. He traveled to Russia on four separate occasions to \nmeet and teach refuseniks.\n\n[[Page S3442]]\n\n  Also, during his career, he served as a chaplain at Lackland Air \nForce Base in Texas and St. Alban's Naval Hospital, and he is now a \nchaplain for the New Jersey State police.\n  I have a personal message for Rabbi Orenstein, and that is, as he \ncontemplates retirement--I speak as one who knows; I tried retirement, \nand I did not like it. I am not recommending anything differently for \nyou, but I know with your active mind and your social conscience \nyou are going to be doing lots of things that continue to benefit the \ncommunity, and I expect you will be spending a lot of time with your \nsix grandchildren. We wish all of you well.\n\n  The rabbi's daughter Debra is also a rabbi, and she serves at a \nsynagogue in Los Angeles. She has authored a book on Jewish rituals for \nwomen. Rabbi Orenstein is justifiably proud of his family, his \ndaughter, and his other two children, one of whom is a professor at the \nLaw School of Indiana, and his son Raphael, who is soon to be a doctor.\n  I know the 575 families at Congregation Beth El will miss Rabbi \nOrenstein. I make the plea here: Do not take this retirement too \nseriously. Stay active; be available to the community. We wish you \nwell. It has been my honor and pleasure to know you well for so many \nyears. I look forward to our contact continuing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nCorzine, is recognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, it is also my honor to bestow my \ncongratulations on Rabbi Orenstein for his 35 years of service to \nCongregation Beth El and a lifetime of service to community and \nmankind.\n  His words this morning about love and our responsibility to our \ncommunities and attention, which is demonstrated both by his family and \nthe Congregation Beth El, are testimony to a human being who has a \nheart that reflects that love in his everyday life.\n  Senator Lautenberg has gone through his resume, but the real issue of \na man's life is what he has done for others, and no one has contributed \nmore to his community or reached out to lift up his fellow man than \nRabbi Orenstein.\n  I am honored that he was able to open this morning's session, but I \nam also honored to have him as a friend. Thank you very much for being \nhere.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/12/senate-section/article/S3442-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today marks the 50th anniversary of the \nintroduction of the polio vaccine. On April 12, 1955, Americans across \nthe country cheered the news that Dr. Jonas Salk and his team of \nresearchers had developed a vaccine that was ``safe, effective, and \npotent.'' One of mankind's most ancient enemies going as far back as \nancient Egypt would finally be vanquished. It was truly a watershed in \nAmerican history, launching an era of unprecedented vaccine \ndevelopment.\n  Today, vaccines protect children from more than 12 vaccine-\npreventable diseases, reducing disease rates by as much as 99 percent \nin the United States.\n  It is hard for today's generation to imagine the fear and the panic \nthat gripped the Nation every summer in the first decades of the 20th \ncentury. Everyone was at risk--young and old, rich and poor. At the \nfirst signs of illness, swimming pools were closed and drained, movie \ntheaters were padlocked shut, mothers cloistered their children for the \nduration, as everyone waited for that anxious cloud to pass.\n  Some polio victims died. Others were debilitated for life. The 1916 \npolio epidemic alone killed 6,000 Americans and paralyzed another \n27,000.\n  Polio's most famous victim was, of course, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, \nwho contracted the virus at the age of 39 while on vacation. As America \nwould later learn, the disease permanently paralyzed the future \nPresident.\n  Even now, half of the 1 million polio survivors today suffer residual \nbouts of illness. Deborah Cunningham of Nashville, TN, recalls her \nchildhood struggle with the vicious disease. It was 1951. She was only \n6 years old. She had just begun the first grade when one morning she \nwoke up with a severe headache. As she tried to walk across her bedroom \nto get dressed for school, she collapsed on the floor.\n  Her parents rushed her to the local hospital where doctors examined \nher. They asked her to try to lift her legs. As she told a newspaper, \nthe Commercial Appeal: ``I didn't know why they gave me such funny \nlooks.''\n  She thought she had done as they said but, in fact, neither of her \nlegs moved an inch. Deborah spent the next month in isolation, unable \nto speak or to eat solid foods. She was then moved to a ward for \nchildren with polio for 8 months where she spent the first 3 months \nencased in an iron lung.\n  In 1946, there were 25,000 cases of polio across the country. By \n1952, the annual tally had more than doubled to 58,000 new cases. Until \nJonas Salk's historic breakthrough, polio was one of the most dread \ndiseases in the world. Indeed, the development of the polio vaccine has \nbeen compared to the Moon landing.\n  Today, polio has been nearly eradicated from the globe. Worldwide, \nonly six countries are still significantly afflicted. In 1988, there \nwere 350,000 cases worldwide. In 2003, that number was down to only 784 \nnew cases. The World Health Organization is confident they will \neradicate polio from the face of the globe by the end of the year.\n  One gentleman who has been instrumental in the drive to eliminate \npolio is Tennessee's own William Sergeant, chairman of the \nInternational PolioPlus Committee. The 86-year-old has dedicated over \n40 years fighting the spread of the disease. In 1998, he was the first \nrecipient of the Hannah Neil World of Children Award.\n  Today, the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History will \ncelebrate the vaccine's 50th anniversary. Dr. Salk's youngest son and \nFDR's granddaughter will be in attendance.\n  Together they will help launch the Smithsonian's monthlong exhibition \non the rise and fall of polio and the heroic efforts of Dr. Salk, and \npeople such as Mr. Sergeant who worked tirelessly to defeat the \ndisease.\n  As we celebrate polio's final retreat from human history, we must be \never vigilant and aware of the new threats that are taking place today. \nHIV/AIDS, SARS, West Nile virus, avian flu, and most recently the \nMarburg virus are among the emerging dangers in the 21st century. \nCurrently, Angola is suffering the most severe Marburg outbreak in \nrecorded history. As of yesterday, the virus has killed 193 victims in \n1 month.\n  Marburg, which is a variant, a cousin, of the Ebola virus, is spread \nby bodily fluids, by things as small as little beads of sweat. Nine out \nof 10 people who contract the disease die typically within a week. The \nvirus has an incubation of 5 to 10 days. The victim then suffers a \nsudden onset of fever, chills, and muscle aches. These symptoms quickly \nescalate to nausea, vomiting, chest tightness, and abdominal pain, \nultimately leading to organ failure and death. There is no cure and \nthere is no effective vaccine.\n  Scientists do not know the source of the virus or how it is initially \ntransmitted into the human population. It is one plane ride away from \nthe United States of America. There is no cure and there is no vaccine. \nAt this very moment, international health workers in Angola are working \nfeverishly to contain its spread. The epidemic is expected to last up \nto 3 months.\n  Meanwhile, there is avian flu. We continue to receive disturbing \nreports on the avian flu outbreaks in Asia. Already 50 people have \ndied. Experts warn that the virus may mutate into a more lethal and \nmore transmissible form,\n\n[[Page S3443]]\n\npotentially unleashing a worldwide flu epidemic. If we do not address \nthis threat now, tens of millions of people could die as a result, and \nwe are dangerously behind.\n  The flu vaccine shortage last winter underscores the fragility of our \nvaccine supply in this country and indeed around the world. It \nunderscores our need to bolster Federal and State preparedness whether \nin the event of a bioterror attack or emerging infectious disease. We \nhave had this discussion before. We need to take action.\n  There are now only five major vaccine manufacturers worldwide that \nhave production facilities in the United States. That is for all \nvaccines. Only two are U.S. companies. Over the past 2 decades, the \nnumber of manufacturers that made vaccines for children has dwindled \nfrom 12 now down to 4. Only two of the four manufacturers that make \nlifesaving vaccines for children are in the United States of America.\n  Early this year, Republican leadership unveiled the Protecting \nAmerica in the War on Terror Act of 2005. This legislation contains \ncritical new provisions to strengthen our public health infrastructure, \nstabilize the vaccine industry, and encourage advanced research and \ndevelopment. It encourages the development of countermeasures against a \nbiological, radiological, or nuclear attack as well as emerging \ninfectious diseases. It does not address routine childhood \nimmunizations.\n  This legislation incorporates recommendations from top health \nofficials, industry experts, and infectious disease specialists. I urge \nmy colleagues to support these long overdue measures to keep America \nsafe.\n  I am gratified by my colleagues' efforts in the House to press this \npublic safety issue. Indeed, in a few minutes the House Subcommittee on \nLabor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies is \nholding a hearing on pandemic preparedness and influenza vaccine \nsupply. Officials from the CDC, NAID, and the Office of the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services will offer testimony this morning on the \nstatus of our public health security.\n  We cannot afford to be complacent. Experts tell us that the emergence \nof the worldwide flu pandemic is not a mere possibility but an all too \nfrightening probability. Millions of lives could be lost if we fail to \nact. We must continue to search for preventions and cures to the new \ndiseases on the horizon.\n  Most recently, thanks to the success of U.S. immunization efforts, \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that rubella \nis no longer a major health threat in the United States. However, Dr. \nJulie Gerberding, director of the CDC, stresses:\n\n       We have to remain vigilant because, as we say in public \n     health, our network is only as strong as the weakest link . . \n     . [We] have to sustain our commitment to immunization. We \n     have to strengthen all of the links in the network, and we \n     have to do everything possible to protect the health of \n     children here within our country, as well as beyond.\n\n  We have come a long way since the famed Ernest William Goodpasture \nhelped pioneer the development of vaccines. His work at Vanderbilt \nUniversity helped create the vaccines that protect us from chickenpox, \nsmallpox, yellow fever, typhus, Rocky Mountain fever, and many other \nviral diseases. I am confident that we possess the ingenuity. America \nhas been the engine of countless lifesaving discoveries and global \nhealth efforts. Now it is time for us to demonstrate our resolve once \nagain for the safety of our fellow citizens and millions of people \naround the globe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, we have been joined this morning by the \nSenator from Colorado, and I yield to him such time as he may consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the great and wonderful Senator \nfrom Delaware for yielding me the time.\n  I rise to speak briefly about the bipartisan action taken by the \nSenate yesterday when it confirmed the nomination of Paul Crotty to be \nU.S. district judge for the southern district of New York.\n  I commend my colleagues for their willingness to put aside their \npartisan differences and to make sure that the judicial confirmation \nprocess worked in the case of Judge Crotty. I commend them for acting \nso obviously for the good of the American people.\n  Even more importantly, it is my hope that this example will prove to \nbe an enduring one for all of us as we move forward with the subject of \njudicial nominations in the future. Our duty to evaluate Presidential \njudicial nominations and to confirm or reject nominees is a \nparticularly solemn obligation under our Constitution. Our 871 article \nIII Federal judges hold positions of great respect and great power. \nThey put criminals in jail. They decide our most important private \ndisputes and they explain what our laws mean. Our constitutional duty \nto evaluate judicial nominees is doubly important because judges are \nappointed for life. If we make a mistake, our country is stuck with a \nbad judge for years and sometimes decades.\n  On March 1, 2005, I sent a letter to President George Bush concerning \njudicial nominations. I respectfully suggested to the President that \nthere are many well-qualified candidates to serve on the Federal bench, \nmen and women who unquestionably would gain the consensus and approval \nof this body. The fact that the Senate reached consensus on 205 of the \nPresident's 215 judicial nominations over the past 4 years demonstrates \nthe willingness, indeed the strong desire, of the majority and minority \nin the Senate to achieve this consensus.\n  Let me repeat that statistic one more time: 205 of the 215 \nnominations of President Bush have been confirmed by this body. That is \na 95-percent confirmation approval rating. When there is that kind of \napproval of the President's nominees, this body is doing its job and \nnot being, as some people have suggested, an obstructionist body.\n  Judge Crotty is an example of the way judicial nominations should be \npursued in order to be successful under our Constitution. His \nnomination resulted first from consultations and then from an agreement \namong Senator Schumer, Governor Pataki of New York, and the White \nHouse. That kind of collaborative consensus approach to making sure \nthere are no problems with the confirmation of judges who are nominated \nby the White House is exactly what ought to be pursued in other \njudicial vacancies that occur in our country.\n  Partisanship in this particular appointment played no role \nwhatsoever, and it should play no role. Judge Crotty was a consensus \nchoice, a nominee without extreme ideologies or any troubling factors \nin his background. Judge Crotty's qualifications to sit in judgment of \nothers were apparent to all Senators, Democrats and Republicans alike.\n  Our duty runs to all the people of our Nation, whether they are \nRepublicans, Democrats, Independents, or something else. At the end of \nthe day, I plead with my colleagues in this Chamber, which has been so \nmuch a part of our constitutional history, to avoid moving forward with \nthe so-called nuclear option that has the potential of shutting down \nthe work of this body on behalf of the people of the United States.\n  At the end of the day, I suggest to the President of the United \nStates and to our leadership in this body that there are issues which \nare of much greater importance for all of us to work on on behalf of \nthe people. The people's work should be about having a national and \nhomeland security program that works to protect our homeland and \nprotect our Nation. The people's business should be about making sure \nthat we pass energy legislation that addresses our overdependence on \nforeign oil today. The people's business should be about how we deal \nwith the problem of health care which is strangling so many Americans \nand so many businesses across our country.\n  There are so many issues that are important to take care of the \npeople's business that we ought not allow ourselves to get into the \ndistractive avenue of dealing with the controversial issue of the few \njudges who historically have been rejected by the Senate. I\n\n[[Page S3444]]\n\nsuggest to all of my colleagues that it is important we move forward in \nthe collaborative, cooperative approach that was taken in the \nnomination and in the confirmation of Judge Crotty to be a Federal \ndistrict judge for the State of New York.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, would you inform me how much time is \nremaining in morning business on the Democratic side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There remains 17 minutes 24 \nseconds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/12/senate-section/article/S3444-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3444-S3445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONSIDERATION OF TIMELY ISSUES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in morning business to speak to \nseveral issues which I believe are timely in the consideration of the \nbusiness of the Senate.\n  We are still in this national debate relative to Social Security. \nPresident Bush has proposed a plan to privatize and change Social \nSecurity, creating the possibility of so-called personal accounts. The \nPresident has taken this message on the road, saying that he would \nvisit 60 cities in 60 days to talk about this issue. What we found is a \nreaction across America opposed to the President's proposal.\n  What we find is when the people of this country hear the details of \nPresident Bush's privatization plan, they are very skeptical. The \nreason is obvious. Even the President concedes that his privatization \nplan for Social Security will not strengthen Social Security. Today, \nleft untouched, the Social Security Program would, for the next 36 or \n37 years at a minimum, make every payment to every retiree every year \nwith a cost-of-living increase.\n  If the President had his way and privatized Social Security, we have \nasked how much longer would the Social Security plan last. The answer \nis it would not only not extend the life of Social Security, it would \nshorten the life of Social Security because the President's plan is to \nreach into the Social Security trust fund to take out money that could \nbe invested in the stock market. As you take money out of the trust \nfund, there is less money, obviously, to pay retirees. So the \nPresident's approach is going to weaken Social Security, not strengthen \nit.\n  Second, the President's approach involves dramatic cuts in benefits \nfor senior citizens. If you take the money out of the Social Security \ntrust fund, there is less to pay. The President's White House memo that \nwas leaked a few weeks ago discloses that they would change the index \nby which people are paid Social Security benefits. That index decides \nwhat increase will come each year in Social Security. The President \nwould reduce that index, so you would find in 10 or 20 years that \nretirees in America would get 40 percent less when it comes to their \nSocial Security benefits. That would drive many seniors, who have paid \ninto Social Security for a lifetime, into a position where they would \nbe below the poverty line. So the second aspect of President Bush's \nprivatization plan is not only that it does not strengthen Social \nSecurity, but there are dramatic benefit cuts to those who have paid a \nlifetime into Social Security, driving more seniors into poverty, \nmaking them vulnerable to a life that is much different than they had \nanticipated as they went to work every day and paid into Social \nSecurity.\n\n  The final point is one of the more important ones as well. President \nBush's privatization of Social Security is going to add dramatically to \nAmerica's national debt. In fact, the estimates from the President's \nown agencies say that this plan of his to privatize will add $2 \ntrillion to $5 trillion to the national debt. That is a dramatic \nincrease in the mortgage of America that our children will have to pay \noff. Who will hold the mortgage of America? Right now, the people \nholding the mortgage happen to be Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea, OPEC. So \nwe will find ourselves more in debt to those who are financing \nAmerica's national deficit, and our children will have to pay them off. \nWe will have to dance to their tune. If they lose confidence in the \nAmerican dollar, we will have to raise interest rates in order to \nentice them to buy our debt. Raising interest rates to lure China and \nJapan onto our side means raising interest rates at home.\n  So President Bush's privatization plan on Social Security has run \ninto a firestorm of criticism. It is a plan which does not strengthen \nSocial Security; it threatens massive benefit cuts and adds \ndramatically to our national debt.\n  I see my colleague from Delaware is on the floor, so I will speak \nvery briefly.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from \nthe Washington Post of April 9.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 9, 2005]\n\n             And the Verdict on Justice Kennedy Is: Guilty\n\n                           (By Dana Milbank)\n\n       Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy is a fairly \n     accomplished jurist, but he might want to get himself a good \n     lawyer--and perhaps a few more bodyguards.\n       Conservative leaders meeting in Washington yesterday for a \n     discussion of ``Remedies to Judicial Tyranny'' decided that \n     Kennedy, a Ronald Reagan appointee, should be impeached, or \n     worse.\n       Phyllis Schlafly, doyenne of American conservatism, said \n     Kennedy's opinion forbidding capital punishment for juveniles \n     ``is a good ground of impeachment.'' To cheers and applause \n     from those gathered at a downtown Marriott for a conference \n     on ``Confronting the Judicial War on Faith,'' Schlafly said \n     that Kennedy had not met the ``good behavior'' requirement \n     for office and that ``Congress ought to talk about \n     impeachment.''\n       Next, Michael P. Farris, chairman of the Home School Legal \n     Defense Association, said Kennedy ``should be the poster boy \n     for impeachment'' for citing international norms in his \n     opinions. ``If our congressmen and senators do not have the \n     courage to impeach and remove from office Justice Kennedy, \n     they ought to be impeached as well.''\n       Not to be outdone, lawyer-author Edwin Vieira told the \n     gathering that Kennedy should be impeached because his \n     philosophy, evidenced in his opinion striking down an anti-\n     sodomy statute, ``upholds Marxist, Leninist, satanic \n     principles drawn from foreign law.''\n       Ominously, Vieira continued by saying his ``bottom line'' \n     for dealing with the Supreme Court comes from Joseph Stalin. \n     ``He had a slogan, and it worked very well for him, whenever \n     he ran into difficulty: `no man, no problem,' '' Vieira said.\n       The full Stalin quote, for those who don't recognize it, is \n     ``Death solves all problems: no man, no problem.'' \n     Presumably, Vieira had in mind something less extreme than \n     Stalin did and was not actually advocating violence. But \n     then, these are scary times for the judiciary. An anti-judge \n     furor may help confirm President Bush's judicial nominees, \n     but it also has the potential to turn ugly.\n       A judge in Atlanta and the husband and mother of a judge in \n     Chicago were murdered in recent weeks. After federal courts \n     spurned a request from Congress to revisit the Terri \n     Schiavo case, House Majority leader Tom Delay (R-Tex.) \n     said that ``the time will come for the men responsible for \n     this to answer for their behavior.'' Sen. John Cornyn (R-\n     Tex.) mused about how a perception that judges are making \n     political decisions could lead people to ``engage in \n     violence.''\n       ``The people who have been speaking out on this, like Tom \n     DeLay and Senator Cornyn, need to be backed up,'' Schlafly \n     said to applause yesterday. One worker at the event wore a \n     sticker declaring ``Hooray for DeLay.''\n       The conference was organized during the height of the \n     Schiavo controversy by a new group, the Judeo-Christian \n     Council for Constitutional Restoration. This was no \n     collection of fringe characters. The two-day program listed \n     two House members; aides to two senators; representatives \n     from the Family Research Council and Concerned Women for \n     America; conservative activists Alan Keyes and Morton C. \n     Blackwell; the lawyer for Terri Schiavo's parents; Alabama's \n     ``Ten Commandments'' judge, Roy Moore; and DeLay, who \n     canceled to attend the pope's funeral.\n       The Schlafly session's moderator, Richard Lessner of the \n     American Conservative Union, opened the discussion by \n     decrying a ``radical secularist relativist judiciary.'' It \n     turned more harsh from there.\n       Schlafly called for passage of a quartet of bills in \n     Congress that would remove courts' power to review religious \n     displays, the Pledge of Allegiance, same-sex marriage and the \n     Boy Scouts. Her speech brought a subtle change in the \n     argument against the courts from emphasizing ``activist'' \n     judges--it was, after all, inaction by federal judges that \n     doomed Schiavo--to ``supremacist'' judges. ``The Constitution \n     is not what the Supreme Court says it is,'' Schlafly \n     asserted.\n\n[[Page S3445]]\n\n       Former representative William Dannemeyer (R-Calif.) \n     followed Schlafly, saying the country's ``principal problem'' \n     is not Iraq or the federal budget but whether ``we as a \n     people acknowledge that God exists.''\n       Farris then told the crowd he is ``sick and tired of having \n     to lobby people I helped get elected.'' A better-educated \n     citizenry, he said, would know that ``Medicare is a bad \n     idea'' and that ``Social Security is a horrible idea when run \n     by the government.'' Farris said he would block judicial \n     power by abolishing the concept of binding judicial \n     precedents, by allowing Congress to vacate court decisions, \n     and by impeaching judges such as Kennedy, who seems to have \n     replaced Justice David H. Souter as the target of \n     conservative ire. ``If about 40 of them get impeached, \n     suddenly a lot of these guys would be retiring,'' he said.\n       Vieira, a constitutional lawyer who wrote ``How to Dethrone \n     the Imperial Judiciary,'' escalated the charges, saying a \n     Politburo of ``five people on the Supreme Court'' has a \n     ``revolutionary agenda'' rooted in foreign law and \n     situational ethics. Vieira, his eyeglasses strapped to his \n     head with black elastic, decried the ``primordial illogic'' \n     of the courts. '\n       Invoking Stalin, Vieira delivered the ``no man, no \n     problem'' line twice for emphasis. ``This is not a structural \n     problem we have; this is a problem of personnel,'' he said. \n     ``We are in this mess because we have the wrong people as \n     judges.''\n       A court spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you want to know the extremes which are \nbeing reached in the debate on the role of judges in America, read this \narticle. There was a meeting in Washington, DC, of some of the more \nconservative groups on the Republican side. These conservative leaders \nmet to discuss ``Remedies to Judicial Tyranny.''\n  They decided that Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy--a Ronald \nReagan appointee, I might add--should be impeached.\n\n       Phyllis Schlafly [originally from my home State of \n     Illinois] said [that Justice] Kennedy's opinion forbidding \n     capital punishment for juveniles ``is a good ground of \n     impeachment.'' To cheers and applause from those gathered at \n     a downtown Marriott for a conference on ``Confronting the \n     Judicial War on Faith,'' Schlafly said that Kennedy had not \n     met the ``good behavior'' requirement for office and that \n     ``Congress ought to talk about impeachment.''\n\n  Unfortunately, hers was not the most incendiary quote. A gentleman by \nthe name of Edwin Vieira, a lawyer-author, the article goes on to say:\n\n     . . . not to be outdone . . . told the gathering that Justice \n     Kennedy should be impeached because his philosophy, evidenced \n     in his opinion striking down an anti-sodomy statute, \n     ``upholds Marxist, Leninist, satanic principles drawn from \n     foreign law.''\n       Ominously, Vieira continued by saying his ``bottom line'' \n     for dealing with the Supreme Court comes from Joseph Stalin.\n\n  I am quoting Mr. Vieira:\n\n       He [Stalin] had a slogan, and it worked very well for him, \n     whenever he ran into difficulty: 'no man, no problem,''' \n     Vieira said.\n\n  The Washing Post goes on to say:\n\n       The full Stalin quote [this is what Stalin really said] . . \n     . is ``Death solves all problems: no man, no problem.''\n\n  This type of outrageous statement from the so-called conservative \nRepublican right is clear evidence that what we have heard from \nCongressman Tom DeLay in the House of Representatives, and from even \nMembers in our own Chamber, represents a departure from the line of \ncivility which we have refused to assault or cross when it comes to \ndealing with the separate branches of Government.\n  There is no doubt that decisions are handed down by Federal courts \nacross America on a daily basis with which I personally disagree and \nfind abhorrent. But to suggest retribution against judges--first from \nSchlafly that it should involve impeachment and then from Mr. Vieira \nthat it should go further--suggests an assault on the independence of \nthe judiciary about which every American should be concerned. When the \nmen and women who don these robes for lifetime appointments have the \ncourage to rule in cases, even in controversial cases, they should not \nfeel they are going to be threatened on a regular basis by Members of \nCongress or by those in political parties who happen to see things \ndifferently.\n  We know how this can reach an extreme. We have seen it happen. In my \nhome State of Illinois, the family of one of our outstanding Federal \njurists was assaulted, and two of them were murdered. This type of \nreaction shows that when you give comfort to this crazed mindset, it \ncan have disastrous results. The people who sponsored this conference \nshould be embarrassed that they came together and suggested this kind \nof action against Federal judges.\n  It is time to put an end to this. We need to have an independent \njudiciary in touch with the ordinary lives of American citizens, in \ntouch with the value of our families. But we always should stand and \ndefend the independence of our judiciary and the integrity of the men \nand women who serve in that branch.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/12/senate-section/article/S3445-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3445-S3446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE JUDICIARY\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, yesterday I was in my State capital, \nDover, DE, before I came down here. I was a short distance from a place \ncalled the Golden Fleece Tavern. It no longer exists, but it was the \nsite of the place where Delaware became the first State to ratify the \nConstitution. They did that on December 7, 1787. That action took place \na couple of months after a Constitutional Convention about 75 miles up \nthe road in Philadelphia.\n  Some of my colleagues may recall that one of the last issues resolved \nat the time of the Constitutional Convention was the question of how \nthey were going to select these judges, the third branch of our \nGovernment. How do we select these judges? There were some at that time \nwho were fearful of creating a Presidency that would be too strong, \nhaving had a bite of the apple of putting up with a king of England for \na number of years. They did not want to create a king or someone of \nroyalty in this country to be our leader. Our Founding Fathers worked \ndiligently in any number of ways to create checks and balances to \nensure that we didn't end up with a king but ended up with a President. \nAmong the checks and balances they incorporated into our Constitution \nis one that deals with the selection of our judges. We all know how \nPresidents nominate and the Senate confirms or does not confirm \nnominees to lifetime appointments to the Federal bench.\n  Twice in our Nation's history we have seen instances where a \nPresident sought to stack the courts. Both were Democrats. One was \nThomas Jefferson at the beginning of his second term as President, and \na second was FDR at the beginning of his second term as President. Both \ntimes, both Presidents, both Democrats, were rebuffed. Today, Democrats \nno longer reside in the White House. Today, the Republicans are in the \nmajority here in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.\n  With the election of last November, President Bush is in a position \nto see much--not all, but a good deal--of his legislative agenda \napproved; perhaps modified but ultimately approved. He is also in a \nposition to leave an even more enduring legacy through his nomination \nof hundreds of judges in the Federal courts of almost every State. In \nPresident Bush's first term, he nominated over 200 men and women to the \nFederal bench, and 215 nominees were actually debated here on the \nSenate floor, and 205 were approved. That is an approval rate of about \n95 percent. Of the 10 who were not approved, our side would say they \nwere simply out of the mainstream.\n  As the 108th Congress concluded last year, the vacancy rate stood at \nthe lowest, I believe, since the Reagan era. How did that compare with \nthe Clinton era? In President Clinton's time as President for 8 years, \n81 percent of his Federal nominees were approved, as compared to 95 \npercent of President Bush's in the last 4 years. It is kind of an \nirony, at least to me, that 81 percent for President Clinton was \nenough, it was OK, but 95 percent for President Bush is unacceptable.\n  While our Republican friends are prepared to change the rules of the \nSenate in an effort to make it a lot easier to confirm Federal judges, \nand are poised, I am told, to turn some 200 years of precedent on its \nhead because 95 percent may not be enough, I think to do so would be a \nmistake.\n  We have a chance to pass not only class action legislation, but we \nhave a chance to pass bankruptcy legislation, asbestos litigation \nreform, a comprehensive energy policy, restructuring of the postal \nsystem for the 21st century, and on and on. This could be the most \nfruitful legislative session in recent memory. I would hate to see us \ndestroy that potential.\n\n[[Page S3446]]\n\n  I say also that the slope we get on with respect to changing the way \nwe close off debate on judicial nominations is a slippery one. Today, \nwe may want to apply it to judicial nominations; later on we may want \nto apply it to nominees for Cabinet positions or nominations for other \npositions. It is a slippery slope.\n  My Republican friends would be wise to listen to former Republican \nSenators who served on that side of the aisle, people such as Senators \nWallop, McClure, Danforth, and today Senator Dole, Robert Dole. They \nreminded today's Republican Senators, the majority in the Senate, that \nthe bed we make today is one we may have to sleep in. There won't \nalways be a Republican President. Some day there will be a Democrat \nPresident. It could be 4 years from now. There will not always be a \nRepublican majority in the Senate. It goes back and forth.\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, before we go down \nthis road, keep in mind a couple of things. No. 1, we have the \npotential to get so much done this year. I would hate to see us blow \nthat opportunity.\n  No. 2, this is a slippery slope--a policy change that may be designed \ninitially to make it easier to confirm judicial appointments but could \neasily be applied to other appointments to other positions.\n  No. 3, some Democrats would take some consolation in the thought that \nwe are not going to always be in the minority, and as there was a \nDemocrat President for the last 8 years for the last century, there \nwill be another one in the future.\n  My Republican friends, be careful of the bed you make because someday \nyou will have to chance to sleep in it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to address one of the \nmost important obligations that we, as Members of the Senate, are bound \nto fulfill--the approval or disapproval of the President's judicial \nnominations.\n\n  Perhaps no other constitutional duty vests as much responsibility in \nthe executive, or this body, than article II, articulating the \nPresident's power of appointment, a power that is only realized when \nthe Constitution works as it was intended to, when we fulfill our \nobligation as laid out in the clause requiring this body's advice and \nconsent.\n  This fundamental duty carries with it the weight and responsibility \nof generations, a lifetime appointment to a position that requires a \ndeep and mature understanding of legal thought, and a solemn oath to \nuphold the law.\n  This debate is not about numbers. It is not about percentages, how \nmany judges that Republicans confirmed or how many judges Democrats \nconfirmed. To frame the debate as nothing but a statistical argument is \nto betray the American people.\n  We were not sent to Congress to focus on a numerical count but \ninstead to make sure that limited government allows for opportunity and \npromise without stifling individual freedom and liberty.\n  We were sent here to build a stronger Union and to uphold our \nobligations under the Constitution.\n  The Founding Fathers referred to judges as ``the guardians'' of the \nConstitution and gave to the President the responsibility to appoint \nthem.\n  Alexander Hamilton once wrote that, in order to maintain the health \nof the three branches of government, all possible care is requisite to \nenable the judiciary to defend itself.\n  It is frightening to think that a minority in the Senate is eroding \nthe foundation of the third branch by perpetuating obstruction and \nendangering the citadels of justice.\n  No where does the Constitution give Congress the ability to ignore \nthe appointment process.\n  By refusing to give judicial nominations an up or down vote, it is \nnothing more than a Congressional veto with a fancy name.\n  James Madison characterized the appointment of judges as the remote \nchoice of the people.\n  Failure to provide an up or down vote deprives the people of the \nUnited States the choice selected by their representatives, denying \nchoice to the very same people who elected us to office and the same \npeople who live under the Constitution that we have sworn to protect.\n  The legal prowess of a nominee is obviously an important factor to \nconsider when confirming a judge.\n  The Constitution calls upon the Senate collectively to determine \nwhether or not a particular nominee is qualified to serve. This \ndetermination is made in one gesture, the approval or disapproval of \nthe nomination itself.\n  In 2003 and 2004, a series of votes were held on various nominees. \nSome were approved, while others were denied a vote altogether, even \nthough they were clearly supported by a majority of Senators.\n  Procedural processes do not fulfill the advice and consent \nrequirement. Advice and consent does not mean avoiding the question on \na judicial nominee entirely by employing a filibuster.\n  If a Member of the Senate disapproves of a judge, then let them vote \nagainst the nominee. But do not deprive the people of the right to \nsupport a nominee through their elected representative.\n  It is our vote, the right of each Member to collectively participate \nin a show of ``advice and consent'' to the President, that exercises \nthe remote choice of the people.\n  The burden of obstruction is borne by the American people. Empty \nseats on our highest courts delays the recourse and justice guaranteed \nby the Constitution.\n  As so many of my colleagues have stated before me, such justice \ndelayed is justice denied.\n  In the shadow of September 11, 2001, we now recognize the efforts \nbeing made by the enemies of the United States to destroy the liberties \nand freedom of our great Nation. The most basic of our country's values \nand traditions are under attack.\n  Congress responded by enacting new laws and by providing financial \nassistance to businesses, families and defense; we acted swiftly to \nsuffocate terrorists and destroy the hateful organizations that work to \nundermine our society.\n  Through strong and courageous leadership, the President has stood \nfirm against terrorist and terrorist regimes.\n  But our government cannot function without an equally strong \njudiciary, the third branch of government. It is through the judiciary \nthat justice is served, rights protected, and that law breakers are \nsentenced for their crimes.\n  The Senate cannot willingly refuse to provide an up or down vote on \njudicial nominees without acknowledging that irreparable harm may be \ndone to an equal branch of government.\n  Judges must take an oath to uphold the law, regardless of their \npersonal views.\n  Time after time, a nomination has been blocked by a minority of \nSenators because they feel that they are better judges of a nominee's \nability to fulfill that oath than a majority of the Senate.\n  The result of this obstruction is a broken nomination process.\n  I sincerely hope we can work through the impasse on the judicial \nnomination process.\n  I hope those opposed to the President's nominees will vote against \nthem and speak their mind about it. But I also hope that we will be \nallowed to provide the guidance we are required to provide under the \nConstitution.\n  As I have said so many times before, ``vote them up or vote them \ndown, but just vote.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am the Senator from Tennessee, and we \nknow something about country music in our State. There is an old \ncountry music song with the line that goes something like this: There \nis light at the end of the tunnel and I hope it ain't no train.\n  I am beginning to think it is a train and that there is not much way \nto avoid a train wreck. The train wreck I am talking about is a threat \nby the minority to ``shut the Senate down in every way'' if the \nmajority adopts rules that will do what the Senate has done for 200 \nyears, which is to vote up or down the President's appellate judicial \nnominees.\n\n[[Page S3447]]\n\n  Until recently, not to vote at all on a President's judicial nominee \nwas unimaginable. Take the case of Clarence Thomas in 1991: The first \nPresident Bush nominated him to the Supreme Court of the United States. \nI haven't seen any debate in this body with as much passion in it as \nthe Thomas nomination. But he was nominated in July, the Senate voted \nin October 52 to 48, and it was done. Yet, in the last session of \nCongress, for some reason that escapes me, the minority felt it had to \nuse the filibuster to deny an up-and-down vote 10 times on 52 of the \nPresident's appellate judicial nominees. That has never happened \nbefore. There are a lot of ingenious arguments being made on the other \nside, but that has never happened.\n  Some people mention Abe Fortas in 1968--I was here then; I was \nworking for Howard Baker in the Senate. The votes against Fortas were \nin the majority. But even if you give that to the other side, neither \nparty has ever used the tactic of denying an up-or-down vote on \njudicial nominees in 200 years.\n  The argument that the Senate doesn't have the power to change this \nprocedure would get thrown out of court in a summary judgment. From \n1789 when the Senate first met and adopted its rules by majority vote, \nit has adopted its rules by majority vote as the Constitution provides.\n  The nominees who the President put up who were rejected were badly \nabused. Charles Pickering, from Mississippi, was accused of not being \nsensitive to civil rights. In 1967, he put his children into \ndesegregated schools in the middle of Mississippi. He testified in \ncourt against the grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, who was described \nby Time Magazine as the most evil terrorist in America.\n  Bill Pryor, not sensitive on civil rights? Too conservative? Bill \nPryor was law clerk to John Minor Wisdom in New Orleans, as the \nPresiding Officer knows, perhaps the leading civil rights judge in the \nSouth during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, and Bill Pryor has repeatedly \ndemonstrated he can separate his views from his judicial judgments. \nMost recently he was part of the court--by his recess appointment--that \nrejected an appeal on the Terri Schiavo case. I don't know how he felt \npersonally about it, but he felt under the law there was no recourse in \nFederal courts. Chairman Arlen Specter has sent a certain memorandum \naround to Members asking us to look at Priscilla Owen's real views on \nRoe v. Wade. She hasn't said she wants to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n  The question is not whether the Senate has the power to adopt the \nrules by majority vote--it unquestionably does; that is common sense--\nbut whether we should.\n  I am one of the Republicans who believe such a rules change is not a \ngood idea--not good for the Senate, not for the country, not for \nRepublicans, and not for Democrats. The Senate needs a body that by its \nprocedures gives unusual protection to minority rights.\n  Tocqueville, in the early 19th century, warned of the tyranny of the \nmajority. In South Africa we saw a political miracle when the new Black \nmajority respected the property rights of the White minority. In 1967, \nwhen I came here--and I see the Republican whip here; he came about a \nyear or two later--the Republicans were the ones worrying about \nprotecting minority rights. There were 64 Democrats and 36 Republicans \nthen. There were 38 Republicans in 1977 when I came back working with \nHoward Baker, and in 1979, when Senator Byrd eloquently argued the \nmajority could make Senate rules, there were only 41 Republicans, so \nthe Republicans were worrying about minority rights.\n  But minority rights can also be abused. Remember what the filibuster \nwas used for in the 1930s, the 1940s, the 1950s, and the 1960s. The \nfilibuster was used to deny Black Americans the right to vote. It was \nused to keep the poll tax. It was used to stop a Federal anti-lynching \nlaw. It was used to keep African Americans from sitting down and having \nlunch in Nashville. So the filibuster can also be an abuse of minority \nrights.\n  It is not my job to advise the Democrats, and I wouldn't presume to \ndo it, but I believe it is a mistake for the Democrats to provoke a \nrules change, and I believe it is a bigger mistake, as they have \nthreatened, to ``shut down the Senate,'' when it happens. Last month, \nthree dozen Democrats stood on the steps of the Capitol and basically \nthreatened to do that. On December 13, in the Washington Post, the \nSenator from New York, Mr. Schumer, said that the use of the nuclear \noption would ``make the Senate look like a banana republic . . . and \ncause us to try to shut it down in every way.''\n  Consider what the Senator from New York is saying. Not only will the \nminority not allow a vote on judges up or down in a country where the \nrule of law is of paramount concern, but they will shut the Senate down \nin every way at a time when natural gas prices are at $7, shut the \nSenate down in every way at a time when oil prices and prices at the \npump are at record levels, shut the Senate down in every way when there \nis a Federal deficit that needs to be brought under control, shut the \nSenate down in every way when the immigration laws need fixing, and \nshut the Senate down in every way while we are at war.\n\n  I don't believe the American people like the idea of Washington \npoliticians threatening to shut the Senate down in every way. As I \nremember, the last prominent political leader who said something like \nthat was my friend, Newt Gingrich, 10 years ago. It backfired, and he \nwas out of office in about a year.\n  The people expect us to go do work, to do our jobs. They expect us to \nvote on judges, to lower natural gas prices, to reduce the deficit, to \nfix the immigration laws, and to win the war on terror. We cannot do it \nif part of the Senate wants to shut the Senate down in every way.\n  Our Senate leader, Bill Frist, has been working hard to avoid this \ntrain wreck. I still hope we can avoid it. I believe my colleagues in \nthis body know the enormous respect I have for the new Democratic \nleader, Harry Reid. He and I worked together on American history. I had \nthe privilege of being with him in a delegation for 8 days in \nPalestine, Israel, Iraq, Kuwait, Georgia, Ukraine, and France, and not \nonce in those 8 days did the Democratic leader undercut the policies of \nthe President of the United States. He conveyed the U.S. position. I am \nnot surprised by that. That is the way it should be. But I am impressed \nby that. I am impressed by the Democratic leader. I am convinced he and \nthe majority leader can make this Senate do its job if given the \nchance.\n  We need to avoid this train wreck if there is a way to do it. Twice I \nhave offered in the Senate my suggestion about how I as one Senator \ncould do it. I said 2 years ago that I would give up my right to \nfilibuster a President's nominee for an appellate judgeship even if it \nwere President Kerry or President Clinton or President Reid or any \nother Democrat. I might vote against that nominee, but I would never \nfilibuster as long as I were a Senator.\n  Now, if six Democrat Senators and six Republican Senators would say \nthe same thing, then there would be no need for a rules change, and \nthere would be no need for a train wreck. All we need are six Democrat \nSenators and six Republican Senators who believe there ought to be up-\nor-down votes regardless of the President's party and who believe it \nwould be wrong to shut the Senate down. The right thing to do is to \nhave an up-or-down vote on any of the President's Federal appellate \njudicial nominees. That has been the way we have done it for 200 years. \nThe wrong thing to do is to shut the Senate down in every way.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today to address the current \ninstitutional crisis in the Senate brought on by the insistence of a \nfew on defeating the will of the American people in preventing the \nSenate from doing its job of voting on the President's nominees to the \nFederal bench.\n  We all know that the Constitution is very clear on this front. The \njudicial nominees are chosen solely by the\n\n[[Page S3448]]\n\nPresident with the advice and consent of the Senate. Until President \nBush was elected, no one has ever interpreted this requirement to mean \nanything other than a simple majority vote. The Senate has never denied \nan up-or-down vote to any appellate court nominee who had majority \nsupport. But the Democrats have rejected this 200-year-old Senate \ntradition and, with it, the very will of the American people.\n  The Democrats lost the election, and they seem unwilling to accept \nthe fact. Instead, they unilaterally change the rules and politicize \nthe judicial confirmation process. This is extreme behavior and extreme \ntactics--threatening to shut down the Senate if we should dare to \nconfirm a well-qualified nominee with bipartisan majority support. This \nis an epitome of arrogance--assuming they know better than the majority \nof their colleagues and the President. The people back home want to see \nthese nominees treated fairly and given an up-or-down vote.\n  Is it fair to say to nominees that they are out of the mainstream \nwhen they have the support of the Democrats and the Republicans making \nup the majority of the Senate? I submit it is the obstructionists who \nare out of the mainstream when they block an up-or-down vote on \nnominations of justices such as Janice Rogers Brown for years.\n  Extreme, arrogant, out of the mainstream--this is the anything-goes \nSenate Democrats who are willing to go to any length to deny exemplary \njudges the opportunity to dedicate their lives to service to the \nAmerican people.\n  By trying to shred the reputation of some of the most respected and \nadmired judges in public service in this country, a few Senators are \nsending a very powerful message to any others who may aspire to the \nbench. They are telling us, don't bother. It appears to be increasingly \nlikely that such talent, dedication, and personal sacrifice will be \nrewarded with attacks on the floor of the Senate and years of \nuncertainty while a bipartisan majority waits powerless to confirm \nthese nominees.\n  I call for a return to tradition. The American people have done their \njobs and expect us to do the same. We in the Senate need to do our jobs \nand confirm fair judges through a fair process.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/12/senate-section/article/S3448-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3448-S3449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   50TH ANNIVERSARY OF POLIO VACCINE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today we celebrate the 50th anniversary \nof the polio vaccine. The people of my generation, who were youngsters \nat that time, remember full well the exciting development. Now polio is \nvirtually eradicated.\n  The Committee on Foreign Operations, which I have had the privilege \nto either chair or be ranking member for the last decade or so, has \nappropriated about $160 million toward that fight over the last 6 \nyears.\n  Of course, the Rotary International, a private organization, deserves \nthe lion's share of the credit for almost total eradication of polio. \nThis private civic group with international chapters made this a \nproject some 20 years ago and have collected and spent about $600 \nmillion and delivered the vaccine in all parts of the world. So because \nof this, today we can celebrate, essentially, the complete eradication \nof this disease from the Earth. Rotary deserves a big part of the \ncredit for that.\n  I rise to talk about this for another reason. It had an enormous \nimpact on me personally. I was struck with polio when I was 2 years \nold. My dad was overseas fighting in World War II. Polio was similar to \nhaving the flu--you felt sick all over. Except when polio went away \nthere were residual effects. In my case, when my flu-like symptoms went \naway, I had a quadricep in my left leg that was dramatically affected.\n  My mother was, of course, like many mothers of young polio victims, \nperplexed about what to do, anxious about whether I would be disabled \nfor the rest of my life. But we were fortunate. While my dad was \noverseas my mother was living with her sister in east central Alabama, \nonly about 40 or 50 miles from Warm Springs. As everyone knows, \nPresident Roosevelt established Warm Springs, where he went to engage \nin his own physical therapy, as a center to treat other polio victims. \nSo my mother was able to put me in the car, go over to Warm Springs, \nand actually learn, from those marvelous physical therapists who were \nthere, what to do.\n  They told my mother she needed to keep me from walking. Now, imagine \nthis. You are the mother of a 2-year-old boy. And we all know how \nanxious little boys are to get up and get around and get into trouble. \nSo my mother convinced me that I could walk, but I couldn't walk--a \npretty subtle concept to try to convey to a 2-year-old. In other words, \nshe wanted me to think I could walk, but she wanted me to also \nunderstand I should not walk.\n  Now, obviously, the only way to enforce that with a 2-year-old is to \nwatch them like a hawk all the time. So I was under intense observation \nby my mother for 2 years. She administered this physical therapy \nregiment at least three times a day--all of this really before my \nrecollection. But we now know the things that happened to us in the \nfirst 5 years of our lives have an enormous impact on us for the rest \nof our lives.\n  So this example of incredible discipline that she was teaching me \nduring this period I always felt had an impact on the rest of my life \nin terms of whatever discipline I may have been able to bring to bear \non things I have been involved in. I really have felt my mother taught \nme that before I was even old enough to remember.\n  So this went on for 2 years. My first memory in life was stopping at \na shoe store in LaGrange, GA. We had left Warm Springs for the last \ntime, and the physical therapist there had told my mother: Your son can \nwalk now. We think he is going to have a normal childhood and a normal \nlife. We stopped at a shoe store in LaGrange, GA, and bought a pair of \nsaddle oxfords, which are low-top shoes--my first recollection in life.\n  Thanks to my mother, I had a normal childhood. I was not able to run \nall that well, but I played baseball and have had a normal life. The \nonly impact of that early childhood experience with polio is that I \nhave a little difficulty going down stairs. Most people do not want to \ngo up stairs and do not mind walking down stairs. I like to walk up \nstairs and take an elevator down because an effected quadricep impacts \nyour ability to descend stairs.\n  So I am particularly moved by the fact that we can stand here today \nand say that polio is essentially eradicated from the face of the \nEarth. When I was a youngster, the fear of polio was enormous. Mothers, \nevery summer, lived in fear that their children would come down with \npolio, and many did, many died. Many had much more serious aftereffects \nthan I did, certainly.\n  But it is with great gratitude that I commend Rotary International \ntoday for this extraordinary accomplishment of getting this vaccine out \nall over the world so that we can essentially say, in 2005, that polio \nhas been eradicated from the face of the Earth.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Wall \nStreet Journal entitled ``Polio and Rotary'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 12, 2005]\n\n                            Polio and Rotary\n\n       Today marks the 50th anniversary of the Salk polio vaccine. \n     Poliomyelitis, also know as infantile paralysis, used to be \n     one of childhood's most feared diseases. A few years after \n     Dr. Jonas Salk announced his vaccine on April 12, 1955, \n     nearly every child in the U.S. was protected. Today polio has \n     disappeared from the Americas, Europe and the Western Pacific \n     and is nearly gone from the rest of the world.\n       A too-little known part of this feat is the role played by \n     Rotary, the international businessman's club, which 20 years \n     ago adopted the goal of wiping out the disease. Rotary \n     understood that medical breakthroughs are worthless unless \n     people aren't afraid to immunize their children and efficient \n     delivery systems exist to get the vaccine to them. And so it \n     mobilized its members in 30,100 clubs in 166 countries to \n     make it happen.\n\n[[Page S3449]]\n\n       In 1985, when Rotary launched its eradication program, \n     there were an estimated 350,000 new cases of polio in 125 \n     countries. Last year, 1,263 cases were reported. More than \n     one million Rotary members have volunteered their time or \n     donated money to immunize two billion children in 122 \n     countries. In 1988, Rotary money and its example were the \n     catalyst for a global eradication drive joined by the World \n     Health Organization, Unicef and the U.S. Centers for Disease \n     Control. In 2000 Rotary teamed up with the United Nations \n     Foundation to raise $100 million in private money for the \n     program. By the time the world is certified as polio-free--\n     probably in 2008--Rotary will have contributed $600 million \n     to its eradication effort.\n       An economist of our acquaintance calls Rotary's effort the \n     most successful private health-care initiative ever. A \n     vaccine-company CEO recently volunteered to us that the work \n     of Rotary and the Gates Foundation, both private groups, has \n     been more effective than any government in promoting vaccines \n     to save lives. It's become fashionable in some quarters to \n     deride civic volunteerism, but Rotary's unsung polio effort \n     deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 1268, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n       A bill (H.R. 1268) making emergency supplemental \n     appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2005, \n     to establish and rapidly implement regulations for State \n     driver's license and identification document security \n     standards, to prevent terrorists from abusing the asylum laws \n     of the United States, to unify terrorism-related grounds for \n     inadmissibility and removal, to ensure expeditious \n     construction of the San Diego border fence, and for other \n     purposes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as was just indicated, we are now back on the \nsupplemental appropriations bill, which is critical to the funding of \nour effort to continue our activities in Iraq and Afghanistan and \nelsewhere around the world.\n  One of the reasons Senator Cornyn and I want to speak for a few \nminutes this morning is to make the point that we very much hope our \ncolleagues will join with us in ensuring the quick passage of this bill \nso we can get on with that effort and then move to other business.\n  There has been a suggestion that amendments might be offered to the \nbill that do not relate to the funding of the war effort. For example, \nsome of our colleagues have talked about offering amendments that \nrelate to the subject of immigration. Now, that subject is one we are \ngoing to have to debate this year, and we are going to have to consider \nlegislation very seriously later on this year, but our view is that it \nwould be inappropriate to consider that legislation in the context of \nthis supplemental appropriations bill.\n  We are aware of the fact there was a provision in the House bill that \nrelated to driver's license standards and asylum, but those are matters \nthat relate more to terrorist activities than our immigration laws, as \nthey pertain to illegal immigration. Therefore, our view is that we \nwould refrain from offering amendments of that kind and would hope our \ncolleagues would as well.\n  We would hope, by indicating what we plan to do, that our colleagues \nwould appreciate our commitment--that is to say, Senator Cornyn and \nmyself--to seeing that the issue of illegal immigration generally and \nimmigration reform specifically will, in fact, be considered by the \nSenate a little bit later on this year.\n\n  It is our intention to introduce legislation and to work through the \namendment process, perhaps before that, to ensure that we are doing \neverything we can in the Congress to ensure our borders are secure, \nthat we have adequate law enforcement both at the borders and in the \ninterior of the country, and that we, therefore, create the \nprecondition for the consideration of immigration reform, which is that \nwe do have a commitment to enforce the law and abide by the rule of law \nin this country.\n  There is one thing I think almost everybody interested in the \nimmigration debate will agree on, and that is that we have a broken \nlegal system right now. Employers pretend they are not employing \nillegal immigrants, but they know they are, and they have documents the \nGovernment has called for. The Government pretends to enforce the law, \nbut it knows the documents, in many cases, are counterfeit.\n  The industry will very candidly tell you they do not know what they \nwould do without the illegal employment they have today. So they are \nputting pressure on some of our Members to come forward with \nlegislation to create a legal regime for these employees and, indeed, \nthere should be.\n  We should get to the point where nobody in this country hires illegal \nimmigrants anymore. To do that, we are going to have to demonstrate a \ncouple things. The first is that we are committed to enforcing such a \nlaw, because our constituents rightly tell us: Why should we consider \nimmigration reform--temporary worker reform, for example--if we don't \nthink it is going to be enforced? You are not enforcing the law today. \nWhat makes us think you are going to enforce the law in the future?\n  It is a good question. We have to be able to answer that question in \nthe affirmative and say we are committed to enforcing the law. It \nbegins with enforcement at the border, and it goes right on through \nwith the rest of the law that makes it illegal to hire illegal \nimmigrants. Those laws do need to be adequately enforced.\n  If we could commit ourselves to do that, then I believe we could lay \nthe foundation for successfully getting legislation to provide some \nkind of guest worker or temporary worker program that will both \nliberalize the ability of employers to bring legal immigrants into this \ncountry to work for them on a temporary basis and also deal with the 10 \nto 15 million--nobody knows exactly how many for sure--illegal \nimmigrants who exist in the country today. Many of those people work \nhard. They come to work here. They intend only to send money back to \ntheir relatives in Central America or Mexico or wherever they came \nfrom. Many of them are, indeed, needed in our workforce. But we cannot \ncondone a situation in which they are working illegally. So we have to \ncome up with a structure that would permit us to take advantage of \ntheir desire to work here, but to do so in a legal construct and not to \nreward them with any kind of amnesty.\n  The specifics of doing that have been discussed a little bit by the \nPresident of the United States, who laid out some principles for a \nguest worker program, as he calls it. What Senator Cornyn and I are \nhere to talk about today is the fact that we are working on legislation \nto try to embody many of the principles the President has laid out to \ncreate a legal mechanism by which we can meet our workforce needs in \nthis country but to do so all within the rule of law, where the law \nwill be strictly enforced, there will be no more hiring of illegal \nimmigrants, and therefore we remove the magnet which currently exists \nwhich draws illegal immigrants into our country because they can be \nemployed easily.\n\n  So we remove that magnet, but we do so in a way that does not reward \nthe lawbreakers, the people who come here illegally and use illegal \ndocumentation to obtain employment and, in many cases, are creating a \ndrain on society, and ensure they are not rewarded for their illegal \nbehavior by amnesty, which I think most people would agree, at a \nminimum, means they would not be granted a path to citizenship or be \nable to chain migrate their family into the country ahead of those who \nwant to do so legally; meaning, specifically, that, of course, anyone \nwho wanted to do that could get in line in their country of origin with \na worker sponsor for legal, permanent residency or green card status. \nIf they acquired that status, then there are other things that flow \nfrom that, such as the ability to apply for citizenship. But that \nshould only come as a result of going home, being there, and getting in \nline with everybody else. It certainly should not be granted to people \nwho came here illegally and would be permitted to stay here while that \nstatus was pending. That is the kind of thing we mean by saying no \namnesty.\n\n[[Page S3450]]\n\n  But at the end of the day, I think President Bush is right, that we \nhave to come to grips with this problem. We have to find a way, as he \nsaid, to match willing workers with willing employers but to do so \nstrictly in the confines of a legal regime. What Senator Cornyn and I \nhave been working on for several weeks now is a bill we hope would \nembody many of those principles. It is not going to track exactly what \nthe President has proposed. I would also say the President has not \ngotten real specific about several areas, and we are going to have to \nfill in a lot of those blanks.\n  We will talk to our colleagues, and we will talk to the various \ngroups that are involved in this issue to see what their ideas are \nabout how best to make this work. But the bottom line so far as we are \nconcerned is, if we do this, we have to be able to commit to the \nAmerican people that since we now have a legal and relatively easy \nmechanism for filling the workforce needs here in our country, we are \nnot going to condone any illegal employment in this country. If we \nestablish that principle, we then help to remove that magnet which is \ndrawing so many illegal immigrants to the United States.\n  Just to conclude with this point. I mentioned the fact we would be \nintroducing legislation, which we intend to do. But there are also \nopportunities for us to demonstrate this commitment to enforcing the \nlaw. Let me mention a few of those. In whatever way we can accomplish \nthis, whether it be before the introduction of such legislation or in \nconjunction therewith, we intend to move forward.\n  The intelligence reform bill of last year authorized 2,000 new Border \nPatrol agents each year for 5 years, but we do not have enough money in \nthe budget for any more than about a tenth of that number.\n  Currently, there are about 11,000 Border Patrol agents. A pre-9/11 \nstudy conducted by the University of Texas said we needed at least \n16,000 Border Patrol agents on our southern border alone in order to \nsecure the border. So we clearly have to fund the addition of more \nBorder Patrol agents. Authorized in the intelligence bill as well were \n800 additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigators, again \nfor a 5-year period, an additional 800 Customs/Border Protection \ninspectors at our Nation's ports, 8,000 new detention bed spaces, and \nsome other requirements that all follow if we are going to enforce the \nlaw.\n  We need to fund these programs to demonstrate our commitment to the \nlaw. We also need to reimburse the States for their incarceration of \nillegal immigrants in prisons. The so-called SCAAP funding accomplishes \nthat. It is the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. But there was \nnot any money in the budget this year, and it needs to be at least $750 \nmillion. We need to do some other work to ensure that States do not \nbear the costs of the Federal Government's failure to enforce the \nFederal law.\n  There are a lot of things that have to be done. The point we are \nmaking is, one, this is complicated. It is big. It has to be done. It \nshould not be attempted on a bill which we have to get passed quickly \nto ensure funding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere. \nThis is a debate we can have in the future, and I am assuring our \ncolleagues we are moving the process forward. I chair the Terrorism and \nHomeland Security Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee. My \ncolleague, John Cornyn, chairs the Immigration Subcommittee. We intend \nto try to move this legislation through the Judiciary Committee as a \nmatter of regular order as soon as we can get our legislation complete.\n  My colleague from Texas wants to make a presentation regarding this \nsame subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to follow on the comments of \nSenator Kyl because we are working together on this important \nlegislation, what we hope and expect will be comprehensive immigration \nreform. The message both of us would like to convey is that this is a \ncomplex topic. It can't be accomplished this week, especially not on \nsupplemental appropriations designed to make sure our troops have the \nequipment and resources they need to fight the global war on terrorism.\n  Let me give a little background to explain my perspective. It tracks \nclosely with what Senator Kyl has already said.\n  Our Nation's immigration system is badly broken. It leaves our \nborders unprotected, threatens our national security, and makes a \nmockery of the rule of law. We have failed to enforce our laws and to \nprotect our borders for far too long through years of neglect. In a \npost-9/11 world, we simply cannot tolerate this situation any longer. \nNational security demands a comprehensive solution to our immigration \nproblem.\n  Senator Kyl and I have determined that we would work together. We \nhave a particular interest, being Senators from two border States along \nthe southern border where the illegal immigration is perhaps the most \nrampant. We also want to come up with a plan that addresses not only \nour national security but deals with the economic issues that are \nintegrally intertwined with this complex issue in a way that is \ncompassionate and deals with the very real human consequences and \ncauses for illegal immigration.\n  We are undertaking a thorough review of our immigration laws as we \nspeak. At the conclusion of our discussions, Senator Kyl and I plan to \nintroduce a comprehensive immigration reform bill that will \ndramatically strengthen enforcement, bolster border security, and \ncomprehensively reform our laws. I particularly am glad to be working \nwith Senator Kyl. He chairs the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology, \nand Homeland Security, and I chair the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nImmigration, Border Security, and Citizenship. We have already had our \nfirst hearing, a joint hearing, on border security. The second one, \nthis Thursday, will focus on interior enforcement, or maybe I should \nsay interior nonenforcement, when it comes to our immigration laws.\n  In the past, we have simply not devoted the funds, the resources, or \nthe manpower to properly enforce our immigration laws and protect our \nborders. That must change. If we have anything to do with it, it will \nchange.\n  Let me put the matter as clearly and explicitly as I possibly can. No \ndiscussion of comprehensive immigration reform is possible without a \nclear commitment to, and a dramatic elevation in, our efforts to \nenforce the law. That includes enforcement both at the border and \nwithin the interior. We must have strong border protection between \nports of entry and a strong employee verification system to put an end \nto the jobs magnet for illegal entry.\n  Our immigration laws also present substantial difficulties to our \nalready overburdened law enforcement and border security officials, \nseparate and apart from inadequate funding and resources. It is my \nbelief these difficulties simply cannot be solved by additional funding \nand additional resources alone, as important as they are. After all, \nunder our current immigration laws, literally millions of people enter \nthis country outside of legal channels to hold jobs that are offered by \nAmerican businesses and are needed to ensure American economic growth. \nThere is a serious concern that some fraction of this population may \nharbor evil impulses toward our country. Yet it is a practical \nimpossibility to separate the well meaning from the ill-intentioned.\n  Put simply, we must focus our scarce resources on the highest risks \nto our country and our national security. We need our law enforcement \nand border security officials to spend their highest energies on people \nwho wish to do us harm rather than those who wish only to help \nthemselves and their families through work. Our comprehensive \nimmigration proposal will strengthen enforcement of the law, but it \nwill also provide laws that are capable of strong enforcement.\n\n  We agree with the President's stated principles. They are, however, \njust principles, and certainly he understands and looks to the Congress \nto come up with the specifics in the form of legislation. Such laws can \nbe designed in a way to be compassionate and humane. Above all, they \nmust be designed to protect U.S. sovereignty and to further U.S. \ninterests. They must be reformed to better serve our national security \nand our national economy. They must ensure respect for the rule of law \nand not permit undocumented workers to gain an advantage over those who \nhave followed the rules.\n\n[[Page S3451]]\n\n  In the coming months we will craft a proposal that implements all \nthose objectives, and we welcome the coming debate as well as the input \nand the opportunity to work with our colleagues in the Senate.\n  Finally, we speak today as the Senate is about to begin debate on a \nsupplemental appropriations bill. Congress should not delay enactment \nof critical appropriations necessary to ensure the well-being of our \nmen and women in uniform fighting in Iraq and elsewhere around the \nworld. Attempting to conduct a debate about immigration reform while \nthe supplemental appropriations bill is pending in the Senate would do \njust that--it would unnecessarily and inappropriately delay getting \nthose funds to our troops who need them. Our immigration system is \nbadly broken and fails to serve the interests of our national security \nand our national economy and undermines respect for the rule of law.\n  To solve that problem, Congress must engage in a careful and \ndeliberate discussion about the need to bolster enforcement of and to \ncomprehensively reform our immigration laws. We should not short-\ncircuit that discussion by enacting legislation outside of the regular \norder of business in the House and the Senate. I hope we will enact \nthis supplemental appropriations bill soon. Once that process is \ncompleted, I will continue to work closely with Senator Kyl and any \nother Member of this body who has a good idea to contribute to enact \ncomprehensive immigration reform that is in the best interests of our \nNation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 344\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide $1,975,183,000 for medical care for veterans)\n\n       On page 188, after line 20, add the following:\n\n                               CHAPTER 5\n\n                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n                     Veterans Health Administration\n\n                            Medical Services\n\n       For necessary expenses for furnishing, as authorized by \n     law, outpatient and inpatient care and treatment to \n     beneficiaries of the Department of Veterans Affairs and \n     veterans as described in paragraphs (1) through (8) of \n     section 1705(a) of title 38, United States Code, including \n     care and treatment in facilities not under the jurisdiction \n     of the department and including medical supplies and \n     equipment and salaries and expenses of health-care employees \n     hired under title 38, United States Code, and to aid State \n     homes as authorized under section 1741 of title 38, United \n     States Code; $1,975,183,000 plus reimbursements: Provided, \n     That of the amount under this heading, $610,183,000 shall be \n     available to address the needs of servicemembers deployed for \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom; \n     Provided further, That of the amount under this heading, \n     $840,000,000 shall be available, in equal amounts of \n     $40,000,000, for each Veterans Integrated Service Network \n     (VISN) to meet current and pending care and treatment \n     requirements: Provided further, That of the amount under this \n     heading, $525,000,000 shall be available for mental health \n     care and treatment, including increased funding for centers \n     for the provision of readjustment counseling and related \n     mental health services under section 1712A of title 38, \n     United States Code (commonly referred to as ``Vet Centers''), \n     increased funding for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) \n     programs, funding for the provision of primary care \n     consultations for mental health, funding for the provision of \n     mental health counseling in Community Based Outreach Centers \n     (CBOCs), and funding to facilitate the provision of mental \n     health services by Department of Veterans Affairs facilities \n     that do not currently provide such services: Provided \n     further, That the amount under this heading shall remain \n     available until expended.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add as \ncosponsors Senators Akaka, Byrd, Boxer, Bingaman, Rockefeller, \nMikulski, Jeffords, Salazar, and Dayton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today in Iraq and in Afghanistan, our men \nand women in uniform are making great sacrifices to serve our country. \nLast month I had the opportunity to meet with some of them in Baghdad \nand in Kuwait and all of us can be very proud of their service. Every \nperson I met with was a dedicated professional who was putting their \nduty above their personal well-being.\n  Today, I am very concerned that when all of these new veterans come \nhome and need medical care, they are going to be pushed into a veterans \nhealth care system that does not have the medical staff, the \nfacilities, or the funding to take care of them.\n  There is a train wreck coming in veterans health care. I am offering \nan amendment to deal with this emergency now before it turns into a \ncrisis. The VA health care system is overcrowded. It is underfunded. It \nis understaffed. It is struggling to deal with existing veterans. I \nfear what will happen when tens of thousands of our new veterans are \nadded to this already strained system.\n  As Americans, we make a promise to those who join our military that \nwe will take care of them when they come home. It is a promise all of \nus have to work together to keep, and that is why I am on the Senate \nfloor today. This is not a Democratic issue. It is not a Republican \nissue. This is an American issue. I am willing to work with anyone to \nmake sure all of our veterans get the health care they are promised.\n  I appreciate the leadership of many Senators, especially Senator \nCraig who chairs the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee on which I \nserve. I thank Senator Hutchison of Texas who chairs the committee that \nfunds veterans health care. I truly appreciate their commitment to our \nveterans. I look forward to working with them, and I will work with \nmany others to make sure we are doing everything we need to do to \nprepare for the influx of many new veterans.\n\n  With Senator Akaka and others, I am offering a veterans health care \namendment to this emergency supplemental. Our amendment recognizes that \ncaring for our veterans is part of the cost of war. This is being \noffered on the emergency supplemental because our amendment recognizes \nthat caring for our veterans is a part of the cost of war.\n  Our amendment does three things: First, it makes sure all soldiers \nwho need health care when they return home from Operation Enduring \nFreedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom can get that health care. To do \nthat, this amendment provides $610 million. Second, it provides funding \nfor mental health care for our newest veterans. Specifically, it \nprovides $525 million for expanded mental health services, including \n$150 million to treat post-traumatic stress disorder for counseling, as \nwell as family therapy. Third, the amendment helps address the \nshortfalls that are crippling our regional VA networks. It provides $40 \nmillion to each and every VISN, Veterans' Integrated Service Network.\n  This chart shows the 21 regional health networks. For each region, \nour amendment provides $40 million to spend on their priorities. For \nsome areas it is going to mean erasing big deficits. For others it will \nhelp them hire more medical staff. In other parts of the country they \nwill use it to buy medical equipment. That flexible funding that each \nVISN gets will allow each region to prepare their staff and facilities \nfor our newest veterans. It will put a total of $840 million where \nthese local communities need it the most.\n  In short, this amendment will ensure that we can handle the health \ncare needs of all the veterans who will seek care after serving our \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  The total cost of the amendment is $1.98 billion. Let me explain how \nwe arrived at that figure. First, we looked at the number of new \nveterans who will return to the VA for care. We multiplied that by the \naverage cost per patient and added the cost of reversing the deficits \nthat are today facing our VA hospitals and the cost of meeting \nincreased mental health care needs that everyone assures us we are \nfacing.\n\n[[Page S3452]]\n\n  Some Senators may wonder if this is the appropriate vehicle to fund \nveterans health care, so let me talk about that for a minute.\n  I would have preferred to fund this critical need in the regular \nbudget process. I tried to do it several times last month in the Budget \nCommittee and on the floor with Senator Akaka. Unfortunately, our \namendments were voted down. But the need is not going away. The \nshortfalls are only going to get worse. So if we are not going to take \ncare of our veterans from Iraq in the regular budget, then we have to \ntake care of them in the bill that funds our war efforts. This is the \nappropriate bill because the veterans health care train wreck is an \nemergency, and because caring for our veterans is part of the cost of \nwar.\n  As I have been talking about this amendment and discussing it with \nour veterans, I have been pleased by the support it has received. This \namendment is supported by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, AMVETS, \nDisabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and it is \nsupported by the VA workers who care for our veterans, represented by \nthe American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO. I thank all \nof these organizations and their members for supporting my amendment \nand reaching out to their Senators to call for its passage.\n  Before I go any further, I want to note that veterans health care is \na very personal issue for me. My father was a disabled World War II \nveteran. I grew up knowing the sacrifices that our veterans make. When \nI was in college, I interned in our VA hospital in Seattle during the \nVietnam war, and I saw how important the services were to our soldiers \nwho were returning. I became the first woman to serve on the Senate \nVeterans Affairs Committee. I know what the costs are and I know what \nthe challenges are.\n  The VA provides some of the best care, research, and treatment \nanywhere. Our VA employees have a unique understanding of the \nchallenges that our veterans face when they return, and their \ndedication is unmatched. Like them, I want to make sure this system \nworks for every veteran of every war and every generation.\n  I will share some specific examples from throughout our country that \nillustrate the emergency in veterans health care today. These examples \ndidn't come from me. They came from people who know our VA facilities \nfirsthand. A couple days ago, I posted a form on my Web site, \nmurray.senate.gov, where veterans and their advocates can share their \nstories and examples with me. I have been heartened with the things \npeople have shared. I invite other veterans to share their stories with \nme and with their own Senators.\n  For anyone who thinks this is not an emergency or it doesn't merit \nemergency funding, I invite you to listen very closely. I am going to \ntalk about different places, but the overall problem is the same \neverywhere.\n  For years, VA funding has not kept up with the growing demand for \ncare and with the rising costs of health care. So VA networks around \nour country have held off making improvements. When a doctor or nurse \nleft, they were not replaced. When equipment needed to be purchased, it \nwas put on hold. When a clinic needed to be opened, it was held in \nlimbo. When there wasn't enough money in the operating budget, they \nstarted taking money from their capital budget.\n  Now all those years of chronic underfunding are coming back to roost \nat the worst possible time, as we are about to have a major influx of \nnew veterans, men and women serving honorably in Iraq and Afghanistan \ntoday, when they are returning, our VA facilities across the country \nare facing deficits, staff shortages, and inadequate facilities.\n\n  Let me give a couple of examples that have been shared with me.\n  In Alaska, as of yesterday, they are starting a waiting list for \nnonemergency care for all new priority 7 veterans who are not enrolled \nin VA primary care. That means those people cannot get an appointment \nto even see a doctor.\n  In Colorado, the Eastern Colorado Health Care System is $7.25 million \nshort this year.\n  In California, last year, the VA hospital there in Los Angeles closed \nits psychiatric emergency room.\n  In Florida, the VISN 8 facilities were facing a $150 million deficit \nearlier this year. West Palm Beach Medical Center has a deficit alone \nof $6 million.\n  In Idaho, at the VA in Boise, they are resorting to hiring freezes \nwhen we have soldiers coming home.\n  In Kentucky, veterans at the Louisville hospital, who are having a \ntype of bladder examination, have to lie on a broken table because \nthere is no money to replace that broken equipment.\n  In Maine, the Togus VA has a $12 million deficit.\n  In Minnesota, at the Minneapolis VA, they have a $7 million \nshortfall. They have one of the VA's four sites for dealing with \nveterans with complex, multiple injuries but they are not hiring \nanymore staff for that specialized center because of the deficit.\n  All of us who have visited our returning soldiers at Walter Reed or \nBethesda know many of them are returning with these kinds of injuries \nthat need to be treated at hospitals such as the one in Minneapolis.\n\n  In Missouri, at the Kansas City VA Medical Center, they have a $10 \nmillion operating deficit. I am also told that in Missouri there are \nnot enough doctors and providers to see all the veterans. If a veteran \nis less than 50-percent service-connected disabled, he or she is put on \na waiting list.\n  In South Dakota, they are expecting to be $7 million in the red by \nthe end of this fiscal year. The VA is proposing to save $2 million by \nnot filling staff vacancies. I am told, in fact, they need 58 new beds, \nand that some of the bedframes in that facility are held together with \nduct tape and wire. So because of the deficits they cannot even buy new \nbeds. That is unacceptable for our veterans who have served this \ncountry.\n  I am also told that the Black Hills Health Care System is $3 million \nin the hole. They have had to use the capital budget to pay staff and \nother expenses.\n  In Texas, at the Temple, Texas, VA, nurses in inpatient care are \nworking 16-hour days several times a week because there is not enough \nstaff. We know that nurses providing direct care should only be working \n12-hour days, because longer shifts lead to medical errors and unsafe \ncare. This is not a way to treat our veterans who are returning.\n  In Virginia, as of January 1, I understand that Virginia had a budget \nshortfall of $14.5 million.\n  In my home State of Washington, we have problems, too. In Tacoma, at \nthe American Lake VA, you can only get an appointment if you are 50-\npercent or more service-connected disabled. That is not the promise we \nmade to the men and women who serve our country.\n  In Puget Sound, as of January, there was an $11 million deficit. At \nthe Seattle and American Lake VA they are leaving vacant positions \nunfilled. There are about 16 new vacancies every month and those \npositions are remaining empty. They hope to reduce the workforce by 160 \nfull-time equivalents by the end of this fiscal year.\n  This is having a huge impact on our patients. As of this month, the \nnext appointment at the Seattle VA urology clinic is not available \nuntil August. I can tell you that conditions like these are breaking \nthe hearts of our VA personnel who work day in and day out with the men \nand women who have served this country. They are frustrated at seeing \nso many veterans not get the care they have earned. Why? Because \nCongress is not providing the money.\n  I share these examples not to criticize or cast blame. We have \nproblems such as this in my State as well, as I have talked about. I \nshare these examples because we have to look at what is happening and \nrealize that our VA system is not prepared to handle a new generation \nof veterans. All of these examples, from more than a dozen States, \npoint to one conclusion: The VA is having trouble taking care of the \npatients it has today. It is certainly not prepared to handle a new \ninflux of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Many of these VA centers are in the hole for millions of dollars. \nThey are not in a position today to begin expanding care to meet the \ngrowing need. They cannot do it alone. We have to step in and help \nthem.\n  Before I close, I want to talk about one claim we made here during \nthis debate. Some Senators have suggested\n\n[[Page S3453]]\n\nthat the VA doesn't need any additional funding because it has some \nkind of reserve for $500 million. I was troubled by the idea that the \nVA has extra money it is not using while so many communities are \nstruggling, so at a hearing last week of the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee I got to the bottom of it. I wanted to share this chart with \ncolleagues.\n\n  At our hearing on April 7, I asked Acting Under Secretary for \nVeterans Health Care Dr. Jonathan Perlin:\n\n       Is there a $500 million reserve?\n\n  Dr. Perlin's reply was:\n\n       No . . . I don't know where that might have been suggested, \n     but there is no $500 million reserve that is sitting there \n     for future projects.\n\n  I share that with my colleagues to set the record straight. The VA is \nnot sitting on any type of reserve it can use for medical care. That \ncomes straight from the man who runs the program nationwide. We have VA \ncenters that are struggling in every part of our country. They cannot \ndeal with the caseload they have today. How in the world are they going \nto deal with all of the new veterans who are coming home from Iraq and \nAfghanistan?\n  We cannot kick this down the road any longer. It is an emergency \ntoday and if we do not deal with it now, it is going to be a crisis \ntomorrow. This is not a partisan issue; it is an American issue. It is \nabout whether we keep the promise to the men and women we send to serve \nus overseas.\n  I am willing to work with anyone who wants to make sure our country \nis prepared to care for all of the veterans who will be coming home \nsoon. They were there for us. We need to be there for them now. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this veterans health amendment. If you are \nconcerned about this--perhaps I mentioned your State or you have heard \nfrom your own veterans--let's talk about it and find a way to make it \nwork.\n  No matter what party you are in, we are all Americans first. We all \nhave an obligation, as President Lincoln said, ``to care for him who \nshall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and for his orphan.''\n  We need to pass a veterans health amendment and keep this promise to \nAmerica's veterans. This amendment is the last opportunity we will have \nto make sure our veterans--the men and women serving us--are taken care \nof when they return home.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend Senator Murray \nto offer an amendment to address the cost of providing health care to \ntroops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. She has made an excellent \nstatement about what we are facing in the country and the shortfalls we \nhave. She has taken the leadership on this and I am supporting her. We \nhope we will be able to continue to help our veterans with their health \ncare.\n  Following the 1991 Gulf war, returning servicemembers began to report \nunexplained illnesses and ailments that many linked to their service. \nOnly those who had been granted a claim for a service-connected \ndisability or demonstrated a financial need could turn to VA for health \ncare services at that time. Reservists and Guard members were \nparticularly vulnerable as military health care is lost after \nseparation from service.\n  Back in 1998, this very body voted unanimously to ensure that no \ncombat veteran would be caught up in stringent eligibility rules and be \ndenied treatment. Today, any servicemember who participates in the \ntheater of combat is eligible for free VA health care for 2 full years \nafter separation or release from active duty, without regard for strict \neligibility rules.\n  This benefit is more important than ever, especially to Reservists \nand Guard members. Experts calculate that about 40 percent of the lower \nenlisted grades in these services do not have any kind of health \ninsurance. Because TRICARE eligibility is lost after separation or \ndeactivation, VA is the only place many of these service members can \nturn.\n  My colleagues in the Senate have already recognized the need to \nprovide funds that would allow VA to absorb an influx of new patients \nfrom Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom. In 2003, $175 million was \nadded for VA to the supplemental appropriations bill. I point out that \nthis amount was provided only 1 month after the war in Iraq began and \nbefore we knew about the level of troop commitment.\n  This amendment we offer today allows VA to provide care for returning \ntroops, without displacing those veterans currently using the system. \nWe are now 2 years into this conflict, and VA has already begun to see \nreal impact. Last year, VA spent $63 million on returning veterans. \nUsing data from the first quarter, VA will spend an unbudgeted $120 \nmillion this year. Yet, the lion's share of our troops have not yet \nreturned home, are rehabilitating in the DoD health care system, or are \npending separation.\n  The amount of this amendment, $1.9 billion, is drawn from what we \nknow about past use of the VA health care system, coupled with what we \nknow to be the cost associated with shoring up the system for all \nveterans.\n  This is what we know: VA tells us that 20 percent of returning \nservice members are now turning to VA for care. Using this figure and \nVA's costs, we know that $600 million in additional funding will be \nneeded for returning service members alone.\n  We also know that right now VA hospitals are running deficits of \nabout $40 million per each health care network. Let me share some \nspecifics:\n  Outpatient clinics have stopped seeing even the poorest of patients, \nsending them hundreds of miles away to other facilities. The Townsend, \nMA, clinic is only seeing a tiny percent of those who need care.\n  In Network 20, which serves the Northwest and Alaska, we have now \nseen the beginnings of what could very well become a nationwide trend. \nPriority 7 veterans, who often make as little as $26,000 a year, are \nbeing denied care, as the Network is running about a $40 million \ndeficit.\n  Veterans in need of treatment for PTSD or addiction treatment will \nhave one less place to go due to the VA budget. The Psychiatric \nrehabilitation program at the Chillicothe VA hospital is being shut \ndown.\n  Thirty nursing home beds at the VA hospital in Manchester, NH, will \nnot be opening. VA officials expect to save $1.3 million by not opening \nthese beds.\n  As my good friend Senator Collins has pointed out, the hospital in \nTogus, ME, is operating under a $14.2 million deficit. This Maine \nfacility has a hiring freeze and cannot replace equipment.\n  The Kansas City VA Hospital is short-staffed because they are already \n$10 million in the hole. The Denver VA Hospital and its affiliated \nclinics are $7.25 million short. The Maryland Health Care System is \n$14.5 million in the red already this year. The list goes on and on.\n  The network that serves Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa, North Dakota, and \nSouth Dakota is facing an overall shortfall of $61 million. South \nDakota's facilities are $2.4 million short right now; Minnesota's are \n$25 million short; and Iowa's hospitals are at least $14 million short \nof what is currently needed. Bed frames are being held together by duct \ntape in some facilities, and cleaning staff cannot be hired to keep the \nfacilities sanitary for patients. Health care provider positions also \nremain open, resulting in shortages of doctors, nurses and medical \ntechnicians, to name a few.\n  Furthermore, Florida's facilities are $150 million in the red. And \nagain, this has resulted in key health care specialist positions going \nunfilled. In a region where so many veterans and active duty service \nmembers reside, a shortfall of this magnitude is shameful.\n  This trend towards hiring freezes and under-staffing of vital health \ncare programs and services is one that is of great concern to me. I \nknow that the American Federation of Government Employees is also very \nconcerned about the measures being taken by many facilities to \ncompensate for the numerous shortfalls around the country, and I \ncommend AFGE for its support of this amendment.\n  It will be impossible for VA to care for returning veterans in the \nmidst of this kind of situation. As my colleagues can see, the amount \nwe are asking for today is actually modest when compared to the very \nreal deficits some parts of the country are being forced to deal with. \nWhile we know that many Members of this body have worked to see that \ntheir VA facilities remain in good condition, we must do\n\n[[Page S3454]]\n\nmore to ensure quality of care throughout the entire VA system.\n  We also know that VA mental health must be improved if we are to meet \nthe needs of returning service members. Experts predict that as many as \n30 percent may need psychiatric care when they come home. Yet, we are \ntold that the system is nowhere near ready to handle this type of \nworkload. Steady budget cuts over the years have diminished VA mental \nhealth care capacity.\n  GAO recently found that VA has lagged in the implementation of \nrecommendations made by its own advisory committee on post-traumatic \nstress disorder to improve treatment of veterans who suffer from this \nvery serious mental illness. Furthermore, GAO concluded that it is \nquestionable as to whether or not VA can keep pace with the demand for \nmental health treatment from veterans of Operations Iraqi and Enduring \nFreedom.\n  While veterans' clinics now dot the landscape, they do not have the \nability to meet mental health needs. Vet Centers, which provide vital \noutreach and readjustment counseling to veterans of yesterday and \ntoday, have seen their workload double, but not one additional nickel \nhas been sent their way. There are large pockets of this country \nwithout any access to VA mental health care whatsoever.\n  Fixing these problems requires resources of at least $525 million. We \nknow this is a conservative estimate. Advocates believe that it would \ntake more than three times this amount to bring VA mental health care \nup to what it should be, but this amendment gets us going down the \nright track. The National Mental Health Association's letter of support \nfor this amendment states that ``. . . the nation has no higher \nobligation than to heal its combatants' wounds, whether physical or \nmental, and it has long looked to the VA health care system to carry \nout that obligation. To date, however, planning and budgeting for the \nVA health care system has been badly flawed and is failing America's \nveterans, and particularly the growing numbers from war.'' I ask for \nunanimous consent that the association's letter, as well as one from \nthe National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                         National Alliance for the\n\n\n                                          Mentally Ill (NAMI),\n\n                                    Arlington, VA, April 11, 2005.\n     Hon. Daniel Akaka,\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Akaka and Murray: On behalf of the NAMI \n     Veteran's Council, I am writing to thank you for your support \n     of an amendment to increase the veteran's health care budget \n     by $1.98 billion, with $525 million earmarked for mental \n     health enhancements.\n       Like all Americans, we feel that caring for the men and \n     women who serve our country is the commitment we make in \n     return for their sacrifices. It is critical that they know we \n     will not abandon that commitment upon their return from the \n     battlefield. Treatment for mental illness is as important to \n     their future, if not more important, than treatment for \n     physical illness.\n       The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA's) current working \n     statistics reflect a crisis in the making that Congress has \n     the power to avoid. While it is estimated that at least 30% \n     of veterans returning from Iraq will have mental health \n     treatment needs, this is likely a conservative number. We are \n     very encouraged that this amendment includes an extension of \n     time for these needs to be assessed and treated, since we at \n     NAMI know that often the symptoms of mental illnesses arc not \n     apparent immediately following trauma. People who have the \n     personal experience report that months or even years may pass \n     before veterans and their families are finally able to \n     determine that treatment is needed, and to seek help.\n       It is especially important to support the Veteran's \n     Centers, where it is very likely a veteran or family member \n     would initially seek information and assistance. Expansion of \n     mental health care in VA community-based outpatient clinics \n     (CEDCs) is already a VA priority, and an excellent plan, but \n     current limited resources will not support the Operation \n     Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom expected caseload.\n       We also know that many VA hospitals and clinics are \n     experiencing major funding crises (small increases in their \n     budgets simply do not match spiraling costs of service). As a \n     result, there are site closings, unaddressed maintenance and \n     equipment needs, personnel freezes, and stoppages on needed \n     expansions. This amendment would help alleviate those \n     shortfalls.\n       We strongly urge the Senate to adopt the provisions in this \n     important amendment. Let us keep our part of the bargain.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jane E. Fyer,\n     Chair, Veterans' Council.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   National Mental\n\n\n                                           Health Association,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, April 11, 2005.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Veterans Affairs, U.S. \n         Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: On behalf of the National Mental Health \n     Association and our 340 affiliates across the country, we are \n     writing to offer our strong support for the Murray-Akaka VA \n     health care amendment to the FY 2005 Emergency Supplemental. \n     We applaud the leadership you and Senator Murray are \n     providing in advancing this important initiative to enable \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs to meet veterans' urgent \n     health needs, and particularly those of veterans from \n     Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom.\n       With a grueling war taking a frightening toll on our men \n     and women in uniform, this nation faces a stern test: will it \n     meet its obligations to its warriors? Surely the nation has \n     no higher obligation than to heal its combatants' wounds, \n     whether physical or mental, and it has long looked to the VA \n     health care system to carry out that obligation. To date, \n     however, planning and budgeting for the VA health care system \n     has been badly flawed and is failing America's veterans, and \n     particularly the growing numbers returning from war.\n       This important amendment squarely tackles the major funding \n     gaps facing VA at this critical time. Among those gaps, it \n     has long been clear that VA lacks sufficient capacity to meet \n     veterans' mental health needs. With carefully-researched \n     studies documenting the growing mental health needs triggered \n     by a grueling war, Congress must make VA mental health care a \n     major funding priority. This amendment would do so, and would \n     close the critical gap that stands in the way of meeting a \n     fundamental VA obligation.\n       VA has long had a special obligation to veterans with \n     mental illness, given both the prevalence of mental health \n     and substance use problems among veterans and the large \n     number of those whose illness is of service origin. In \n     furtherance of that obligation, Congress, to its credit, \n     codified in law special safeguards to assure that VA gives \n     priority to the needs of veterans with mental illness. \n     Notwithstanding that step, however, the VA health care system \n     has had an uneven record of service to veterans with mental \n     health needs. Years of oversight by the Senate Committee on \n     Veterans Affairs and other bodies have documented the \n     enormous variability across the country in the availability \n     of VA mental health care, and the relatively limited capacity \n     devoted to rehabilitative help. With the nation at war--and \n     studies finding an already high percentage of returning \n     veterans showing evidence of post-traumatic stress disorder \n     and other war-related mental health problems--VA's special \n     obligation to veterans with mental disorders has special \n     poignancy. VA has taken important steps to make mental health \n     a greater health-care priority, but given the wide gap \n     between VA's mental health capacity and veterans' needs for \n     treatment and support services, real change will require \n     major new funding, particularly to meet war-related needs. \n     Veterans and their families cannot wait. The failure to \n     intervene early increases dramatically the risk that war-\n     related mental health problems will become more severe and \n     chronic in nature. As your amendment highlights, the time to \n     act is now.\n       Established in 1909, the National Mental Health Association \n     is the nation's oldest and largest advocacy organization \n     dedicated to all aspects of mental health and mental illness. \n     In partnership with our 340 state and local Mental Health \n     Association affiliates nationwide, NMHA works to improve \n     policies, understanding, and services for individuals with \n     mental illness and substance abuse disorders.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      Michael M. Faenza, M.S.S.W.,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. The costs of the war we are fighting today will continue \nto add up long after the final shot is fired, mainly in the form of \nveterans' health care and benefits.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort to see that they are \nprovided the care they are currently earning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we appreciate the comments of the \nSenators from Hawaii and Washington concerning the situation in our \nVeterans Affairs Department and the concerns that they expressed about \nreturning veterans who are now moving into the VA system and \nquestioning whether there are sufficient funds available to take care \nof the needs in Veterans' Administration hospitals and other different \nhealth care facilities throughout the country.\n  The subcommittee that has jurisdiction over veterans affairs held a \nhearing recently during which they questioned the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs on this subject. They were assured\n\n[[Page S3455]]\n\nthat the Department is not in a crisis requiring emergency \nappropriations. The fact is, less than 1 percent of the veterans \npopulation is made up of new eligibles who are entering into the \nVeterans' Administration system, and most of those who are requiring \nhealth care assistance and hospital care are older veterans who have \nalready been in the system for a number of years.\n  Because of that, the Department has not asked for any emergency \nappropriations to be included in this bill. The administration says \nthat sufficient funds exist now in the Department of Veterans Affairs \nbudget to take care of this fiscal year's needs.\n  We are now in April and a new fiscal year will begin in October and \nwe are already considering the request for the administration for next \nyear's funding. We have had a budget resolution adopted. Some of these \nissues were raised during the consideration of this issue by the Budget \nCommittee. I think the Senator from Washington offered an amendment to \nthe budget resolution along the lines that she is urging the Senate to \nconsider today, and the committee rejected the amendment.\n  That committee reviewed the issue closely and they have included in \nthe budget resolution authority for funding for the fiscal year \nbeginning next October. This Senator's amendment suggests the funds \nappropriated in this amendment, $1.9 billion, should be made available \nuntil expended, which means not only is this a suggestion that an \nemergency appropriation is needed--although the amendment does not say \non its face it is an emergency appropriation--it sounds as if this is \nin addition to this fiscal year's budget that will go on into next \nfiscal year. So it is an amendment to this fiscal year's funding \nauthority as well as to the next fiscal year and the next. ``Until \nexpended'' is the way the amendment reads.\n\n  I am suggesting that the Senate should look at the information we \nhave before us from the administration: The Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs, the Department of Defense, which is caring for injured \nveterans now in the military hospital system. These are not veterans \nhospitals, where those who have been injured in Iraq or Afghanistan are \nbeing cared for. Some may later be cared for there, and may be later \ncared for as part of the veterans system. But those who are returning \nnow are at Walter Reed Hospital or other hospitals in the Department of \nDefense system.\n  I am not the person in charge of the Veterans' Affairs Committee who \nmonitors veterans' needs on a regular basis. The Senator from Idaho, \nMr. Craig, is chairman of that committee. I have discussed the \namendment with him. I expect he wants to be heard on the amendment. The \nSenator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, is chair of the appropriations \nsubcommittee that has jurisdiction over the Veterans Affairs funding, \nand she is available to discuss the merits of the amendment. We have \ntalked informally with her.\n  At this time I hope the Senate will certainly consider the arguments \nthat have been made by the Senators from Hawaii and Washington. I \nrespect their concerns. I know their concerns are shared by other \nSenators. I share them. I don't know of any Senator who wants to come \ninto the Chamber and vote against an amendment to fund veterans \nprograms. It is hard to go home and explain to veterans why you voted \nagainst an appropriation for veterans health care.\n  What we are being told by the administration is the funds are not \nneeded, we have the funds available to care for the veterans \npopulation. There may be problems in the system that need the attention \nof the administration and administrators of individual health care \ncenters and hospitals, and certainly they ought to be addressed and we \nurge that they are. But it is not a matter of not having the money. If \nthere are problems that need to be addressed we can do that, but we are \nassured that none of the funds being asked for in this amendment are \nneeded for that purpose.\n  Mr. President, awaiting the arrival of other Senators, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the current \namendment be temporarily set aside so we can take up two amendments \nquickly.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, may I \ninquire of the Senator? We were in the process of considering the \namendment of the Senators from Washington and Hawaii on Veterans \nAffairs and funding for that Department. The chairman of the committee \nhas arrived on the floor to speak to that amendment. I had told the \nSenator from Massachusetts I would have no objection to offering his \namendment and then setting it aside.\n  I inquire: How much time will Senator Kerry require?\n  Mr. KERRY. Seven minutes very quickly, and then I am happy to set \nthose aside.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Is there a problem with the Senator from Idaho?\n  Mr. CRAIG. How long does the Senator plan to speak?\n  Mr. KERRY. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would like to make my comments. I think we are under \nunanimous consent to close down at 12:30.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto proceed, and after I have completed the Senator from Idaho be \npermitted to make his statement before we recess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                  Amendments Nos. 333 and 334 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I call up amendments numbered 333 and 334.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] proposes \n     amendments numbered 333 and 3334 en bloc.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To extend the period of temporary continuation of basic \nallowance for housing for dependents of members of the Armed Forces who \n                          die on active duty)\n\n       On page 169, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n\n extension of period of temporary continuation of basic allowance for \nhousing for dependents of members of the armed forces who die on active \n                                  duty\n\n       Sec. 1122. Section 403(l) of title 37, United States Code, \n     is amended by striking ``180 days'' each place it appears and \n     inserting ``365 days''.\n\n    (Purpose: To increase the military death gratuity to $100,000, \neffective with respect to any deaths of members of the Armed Forces on \n                   active duty after October 7, 2001)\n\n       On page 159, strike line 6 and all that follows through \n     page 160, line 22, and insert the following:\n       Sec. 1112. (a) Increase in Death Gratuity.--\n       (1) Amount.--Section 1478(a) of title 10, United States \n     Code, is amended by striking ``$12,000'' and inserting \n     ``$100,000''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendments made by this subsection \n     shall take effect on October 7, 2001, and shall apply with \n     respect to deaths occurring on or after that date.\n       (3) No adjustment for increases in basic pay before date of \n     enactment.--No adjustment shall be made under subsection (c) \n     of section 1478 of title 10, United States Code, with respect \n     to the amount in force under subsection (a) of that section, \n     as amended by paragraph (1), for any period before the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n       (4) Payment for deaths before date of enactment.--Any \n     additional amount payable as a death gratuity under this \n     subsection for the death of a member of the Armed Forces \n     before the date of the enactment of this Act shall be paid to \n     the eligible survivor of the member previously paid a death \n     gratuity under section 1478 of title 10, United States Code, \n     for the death of the member. If payment cannot be made to \n     such survivor, payment of such amount shall be made to living \n     survivor of the member otherwise highest on the list under \n     1477(a) of title 10, United States Code.\n       On page 161, line 23, strike ``$238,000'' and insert \n     ``$150,000''.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, many of us in the Senate have had the \nprivilege\n\n[[Page S3456]]\n\nof traveling to Iraq where we have visited some of the most remarkable \nyoung men and women our country has produced. We have met with hundreds \nof American soldiers, airmen, Marines and naval personnel, all of whom \nare doing a magnificent job under, obviously, very difficult \nconditions. I support this supplemental bill and for the obvious \nreasons.\n  The election and increased training and the clarity of a plan that \nhas been put forth and the increased effort of the Iraqis themselves \ncombined provide an important opportunity for the transformation of \nIraq. It is obviously vital in these circumstances to make sure our \ntroops have the ability to be safe but to also be able to get the job \ndone. We have always said that. But also I believe we need to do more. \nSupporting the troops means not just supporting them in the field and \nin the theaters, but it also means supporting them here at home. It \nmeans understanding that their lives, both as warriors fighting for \ntheir Nation and as spouses, parents, brothers, sisters, sons and \ndaughters struggling to see that the needs of their families are met--\nthe fact is that too many military families suffer when duty calls. \nThousands of reservists take a very significant pay cut when they are \ncalled up. Suddenly, single parents are left to struggle with the \nbills. One in five members of the National Guard don't have any health \ninsurance at all. That is devastating to their families. It is damaging \nto troop readiness.\n  I believe that everyone here understands the simple tenet that the \nGovernment has to keep faith with our troops. To do that we need to put \nin place a comprehensive military family bill of rights that puts \naction behind the promise to support our troops. I understand that the \nsupplemental bill is not the place to ask for the full consideration of \nthat military family bill of rights, so I am not going to propose the \nentire bill as an amendment here. But I am bringing two amendments to \nthe floor that are broken out of this bill of rights that I believe we \ncould all agree on and which would make an enormous difference in the \nlives of our soldiers. In agreeing to these, we can take an important \nstep in demonstrating our support for a military family bill of rights \nwhich is long overdue.\n  More than a year ago, I proposed increasing the benefits paid to \nsurviving military families to $500,000 through existing insurance \nbenefits and an increase in the death gratuity. I am not alone in this \neffort. Members on both sides of the aisle have introduced legislation \nto improve these benefits, and with very good reason.\n  Today, families receive only $12,420 to supplement whatever insurance \na loved one may have purchased. That $12,420 is completely inadequate. \nIn fact, it is a disgrace. We do right by our fallen police officers \nand firefighters in America. Their families receive $275,000, and it is \ntime that we did the same for our soldiers. Their survivors' lives \nremain to be lived, and though no one can ever put a price on the loss \nof a loved one, it is important for us to be as generous as we can and \nas realistic as we can as we help people to be able to put their lives \nback together. I was heartened when the administration embraced a \nformula to reach the $500,000 threshold, and I am glad the \nAppropriations Committee has included a benefit increase in this \nparticular bill, but the bill needs to go further and eliminate any \ndistinction between combat and noncombat deaths.\n  This is important for a number of different reasons.\n  First of all, the benefit, as matter of principle, ought to go to any \nAmerican who loses their life while serving our country, and we \nshouldn't draw a distinction between that kind of service. The fact is \nthat the uniformed leadership of our military doesn't believe we \nshould, either.\n\n  GEN Richard Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified \non this matter before the Armed Services Committee, and a number of \nother leaders. Let me share with colleagues.\n  GEN Richard Cody said:\n\n       It is about service to this country, and I think we need to \n     be very careful about making decisions based upon what type \n     of action. I would rather err on the side of covering all \n     deaths rather than trying to make a distinction.\n\n  Admiral Nathman said:\n\n       This has been about how do we take care of the survivors, \n     the families and the children? They can't make a distinction, \n     and I don't think that we should either.\n\n  GEN Michael Moseley of the Air Force said:\n\n       I believe a death is a death and our service men and women \n     should not be represented that way.\n\n  --i.e, they shouldn't be distinguished as to where it took place.\n  If you are a pilot flying in the Navy off an aircraft carrier and you \nare not in combat and you have a catapult failure and die, that family \nfaces the same crisis as a family of somebody who is shot down. We need \nto understand that. I'm glad the bill addresses that situation, but \nthere are other circumstances it does not.\n  GEN William Nyland of the Marine Corps said:\n\n       I think we need to understand that before we put any \n     distinctions on the great services of these wonderful men and \n     women, they are all performing magnificently. I think we have \n     to be careful about drawing any distinctions.\n\n  The amendment I offer today with Senators Pryor and Obama expands \nthis benefit to every member of the Armed Forces who dies on active \nduty.\n  I have a second amendment at the desk to help military families \nlessen the disruption that a death brings to the family.\n  At the present time, the survivors of those killed in action have to \nmove out of military housing in 180 days. But for those with young \nchildren in school, that becomes entirely disruptive often with respect \nto the school district kids are able to go to, and it is a very \ndifficult burden in many cases for widows and widowers to have to try \nto confront all of the difficulties of that transition, including the \nefforts of finding housing. The 180 days may mean starting a school \nyear in one State and finishing it in another. I don't believe that is \na message we ought to be extending to the families of those who give \ntheir lives in service to our country.\n  Given all of the disruption the loss of a parent brings to their \nlives, I propose allowing survivors the option to keep their housing \nfor a whole year as they deal with the countless other challenges. It \nmay seem like a small change, but I have heard from enough different \nfolks on active duty in the military about the significance of this \nparticular need, and it can make a huge difference for a family who is \nstruggling with the loss of a father or a mother.\n  Investing in our military families is not just appropriating the \nmoney for the equipment or the latest technology for the deployment \nitself, it is investing in the families themselves. And it is not as an \nact of compassion, it is a smart investment in America's military. Good \ncommanders know that while you may recruit an individual soldier or \nmarine, you retain a whole family. That is the way we ought to look at \nour policies.\n  Nearly 50 percent of America's service members are married today. If \nwe want to retain our most experienced service members, particularly \nafter we have invested millions of dollars in their training, then it \nis important--especially for the noncommissioned officers who are the \nbackbone of the military--that we keep faith with their families. If we \ndon't, and those experienced enlisted leaders begin to leave, we as a \nnation are weakened.\n\n  The two amendments I have proposed today are the beginning of a \nlarger effort to do right by our military families. I believe it is a \nstrong beginning. By joining measures to take care of military families \nat home with legislation to take care of those remarkable young men and \nwomen serving abroad, we are going to take a firm step toward putting \nmeaning behind the promise to support our troops. I hope these \namendments are agreed to.\n  I yield to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 344\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis cooperation in the unanimous consent propounded that allows me the \nflexibility to speak. I will be brief. We are at the lunch hour.\n  The chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on MILCON and \nVeterans Affairs is also on the floor with me. Let me speak for a \nmoment about the concerns we have in relation to the Murray amendment.\n\n[[Page S3457]]\n\n  First and foremost, let me say for the record that in no way do I \nquestion the integrity of the Senator from Washington. She and I have \nworked very closely together on veterans issues. She is a valuable \nmember of the Veterans Committee, as is the Presiding Officer.\n  Without question, our dedication to veterans I hope is unquestioned. \nThe reality is are we dealing with an emergency in an emergency \nsupplemental, or is there a very real need out in veterans land and \nwith the Veterans Administration and the systems that it funds and \noperates to meet current veterans' and incoming veterans' needs? I say \ncertainly without question that there is always a need. We could expand \nbudgets well beyond where they are today to meet needs, but by what \ndefinition? Critical, necessary, important for the moment, dealing with \nthe most needy veterans, the most handicapped, or simply spreading it \nout and making it more available?\n  Those are some of the tough choices you and I and members of that \nsubcommittee and certainly members of the subcommittee on \nappropriations have to make. The Senator from Washington has \nappropriately challenged us to look at a variety of other aspects that \nhave value. The question is, Are they an emergency at the moment? Do \nthey serve veterans who are not being served? In some instances, that \nwould be arguably yes. But are those veterans of critical service in \nthe sense they can find health care elsewhere in the sense of priority?\n  Let me talk briefly about what we are doing. We have just finished \ntrying to shape through a budget resolution the 2006 budget. We \nincluded $450 million more than the President's request, and we have \nincreased the 2006 budget over the 2005 budget by about $1.2 billion--a \nsubstantial increase by anybody's observation. We have also done that \nwithout turning to veterans in the less needy categories and saying \nthey will have to pay more for their services. We have been able to \nassume and bring into the system a good deal of that, which is \nimportant.\n\n  I find the number of $1.98 billion additional, not spread out over \nfiscal year 2006 but spent now in 2005 and the balance of 2005 in this \nemergency, a dramatic increase. Can the Veterans' Administration \neffectively and responsibly spend that kind of a bump up in money? I \nquestion that.\n  It is important to look at what is necessary. According to VA, they \nhave seen approximately 48,000 OIF and OEF veterans since the war \nbegan. With Senator Murray's $2 billion, it would be $41,000 per \npatient, an extraordinary amount by any measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator suspend? Would the Senator \nrequest unanimous consent to extend past 12:30?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \ncontinue. There are three Members in the Senate. I ask unanimous \nconsent we extend to no later than 12:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have given a figure of $41,000 per \npatient. That is an extraordinary amount by any measure. The VA's \naverage cost per patient is about $5,000.\n  My point in making this an issue is I want to work with the Senator \nfrom Washington. I am never going to argue that there aren't real needs \nin the Veterans' Administration. I am not going to argue that there \nought to be some priorities--mental health and those things that the \nSenator from Washington and I have shared as a common interest and a \ncommon concern.\n  Let me yield time to the Senator from Texas. She will take a few \nmoments and give the Senator from Washington adequate time to respond \nbefore the 12:45 time.\n  I am willing to work with the Senator from Washington, to examine her \nnumbers, but a $1.98 billion or $2 billion bump-up to be spent before \nclose of business in September--I am getting signals from the Senator \nwe are dealing with a 2-year appropriation. Let's look at those \nnumbers.\n  I close by saying, in my opinion, there is not an emergency in the \nVA. This is an emergency supplemental. I will work with the Senator to \nsee where we might go. It is wrong in an emergency to talk about things \nthat are long term in character and necessary to finance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Veterans' \nAdministration appropriations committee, I certainly want to look \nfurther at Senator Murray's numbers, but adding almost $2 billion to \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs for the next 6 months, we have to \nlook very carefully where we would spend that money and what the \nemergency nature of the request is.\n  In fact, we had our appropriations hearing with the Veterans' \nAdministration Secretary. I asked the Secretary specifically--we would \ncertainly be looking at supplemental appropriations in the near future; \nthen we would be looking at our full budget for next year--I asked if \nthere were enough resources to meet the needs of all returning veterans \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan for the current year, 2005. The Secretary \nsaid, yes, the VA does have the necessary resources in 2005 to continue \nmeeting the needs of all returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The key is when people return from Iraq and Afghanistan, we want to \nmake sure their medical needs are met. That is something we all share. \nMost of the people returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are still in the \nDepartment of Defense. They are either on active duty or they are \nactivated as Guard and Reserve. The bulk of them are still treated for \ntheir medical needs in the Department of Defense, not in Veterans \nAffairs. We have to look at how many people are returning and how many \npeople actually go into the VA system, how many people actually are \nleaving the military service. The number comes down significantly. We \nhave to look at this number.\n  All Members have the same goal, that we are going to ask for the \namount of money we need to give the medical care to our returning \nservice men and women and to people leaving the military. That is why I \nasked the question of our Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Do you have \nenough? Then I further asked if the 2006 budget was adequate for the \nreturning veterans. The response was, yes.\n  I certainly want to do everything we need to do for the purpose of \nproviding the care these veterans who have served our country, who are \nprotecting freedom, deserve from our Government. But we have to look at \nthe fact that is an emergency not in the 2006 budget. That would start \nOctober 1 of this year. Then we need to look further down the road at \nthat budget, which our committee certainly intends to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's amendment is now pending.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 344, As Modified\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I send a modification to the desk on our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 344), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 188, after line 20, add the following:\n\n                               CHAPTER 5\n\n                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n                     Veterans Health Administration\n\n                            Medical Services\n\n       For necessary expenses for furnishing, as authorized by \n     law, outpatient and inpatient care and treatment to \n     beneficiaries of the Department of Veterans Affairs and \n     veterans as described in paragraphs (1) through (8) of \n     section 1705(a) of title 38, United States Code, including \n     care and treatment in facilities not under the jurisdiction \n     of the department and including medical supplies and \n     equipment and salaries and expenses of health-care employees \n     hired under title 38, United States Code, and to aid State \n     homes as authorized under section 1741 of title 38, United \n     States Code; $1,975,183,000 plus reimbursements: Provided, \n     That of the amount under this heading, $610,183,000 shall be \n     available to address the needs of servicemembers deployed for \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom; \n     Provided further, That of the amount under this heading, \n     $840,000,000 shall be available, in equal amounts of \n     $40,000,000, for each Veterans Integrated Service Network \n     (VISN) to meet current and pending care and treatment \n     requirements: Provided further, That of the amount under this \n     heading, $525,000,000 shall be available for mental health \n     care and treatment, including increased funding for centers \n     for the provision of readjustment counseling and related \n     mental health services under section 1712A of title 38, \n     United\n\n[[Page S3458]]\n\n     States Code (commonly referred to as ``Vet Centers''), \n     including the staffing of certified family therapists at each \n     center, increased funding for post traumatic stress disorder \n     (PTSD) programs, including funding to fully staff PTSD \n     clinical teams at each Veterans Affairs Medical Center and to \n     provide a regional PTSD coordinator in each VISN and in each \n     Readjustment Counseling Service region, funding for the \n     provision of primary care consultations for mental health, \n     funding for the provision of mental health counseling in \n     Community Based Outreach Centers (CBOCs), and funding to \n     facilitate the provision of mental health services by \n     Department of Veterans Affairs facilities that do not \n     currently provide such services: Provided further, That the \n     amount under this heading shall remain available until \n     expended: Provided further, That the amount provided under \n     this heading is designated as an emergency requirement \n     pursuant to Section 402 of the conference report to accompany \n     S. Con. Res. 95 (108th Congress).\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me make a couple of comments. I thank \nthe Senators from Idaho and Texas for working with us on this critical \nissue. I know both of them have worked very long and hard on veterans \nissues and care deeply about making sure the men and women who serve \nare taken care of when they return home, as we promised.\n  Let me remind everyone, of the 240,000 men and women separated from \nour services since the beginning of the war in Iraq, 50,000 have \nalready asked the VA for services. Many more of them will continue to \ndo that as they come home and as they get back into their homes and \nlook for services, especially mental health services, as all know who \nhave worked with veterans for a long time.\n  This is an emergency. If any Members work with veterans in our \nStates, talk to our directors at home, and talk with soldiers who have \nreturned home, we will realize the long lines they are waiting in, the \nclinics that were promised that have not been opened, the tremendous \nservices that are not being provided.\n  As I discussed in my opening statement, beds are held together by \nduct tape in our facilities. This is not how we should be treating our \nveterans. It is an emergency because more veterans return in higher \nnumbers with the care not available for them.\n  I am willing to work with the Senators from Idaho and the Senators \nfrom Texas over the next several hours, or whatever it takes to come up \nwith a number. If they believe $1.98 billion is too high, I would like \nto talk to them about that. We can work together. I know both care \nabout this issue, and we want to find a way to make sure our veterans \nare taken care of.\n  I remind everyone when we send our men and women overseas, one of the \npromises we make to them is we will have the care available when they \nreturn. When we have veterans who are in beds that are held together by \nduct tape, when we have veterans who have to endure long waiting lines \nfor simple services, that is an emergency.\n  I clarify, the money in this bill will be used until it is expended. \nIt does not have to be expended this year. It will be used until \nexpended, allowing our veterans and our veteran services to put in \nplace facilities they need for our men and women coming home.\n  I close at this time, and I will work with Senators from Idaho and \nTexas and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee because I \nbelieve this is an emergency. I believe we have a responsibility. I \nwill make sure our veterans get the care they need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the Department of Veterans Affairs has been \na recognized leader in the treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, \nPTSD. With its outreach efforts and expert mental health staff, VA has \nmade great strides in its treatment of those suffering from the \npsychological wounds of war. Unfortunately, VA still has a long way to \ngo before it will achieve the level of PTSD treatment our veterans \ndeserve. Demonstrating this fact is a February 2005 GAO report, which \nfound that VA has not fully met any of the 24 clinical care and \neducation recommendations made in 2004 by VA's Special Committee on \nPTSD.\n  Titled ``VA Should Expedite the Implementation of Recommendations \nNeeded to Improve Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Services,'' this \nreport raises serious concerns about VA's ability to treat our \nveterans' mental health. In fact, I would like to quote one of the \nreport's most disturbing points: ``VA's delay in fully implementing the \nrecommendations raises questions about VA's capacity to identify and \ntreat veterans returning from the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts who \nmay be at risk for developing PTSD, while maintaining PTSD services for \nveterans currently receiving them.'' Further adding to the seriousness \nof this statement is that GAO reported in September 2004 that officials \nat six of seven VA medical facilities said they may not be able to meet \nan increased demand for PTSD services. Moreover, the Special Committee \nreported in 2004 that ``VA does not have sufficient capacity to meet \nthe needs of new combat veterans while still providing for veterans of \npast wars.\n  This is further proof of the need for increased funding for VA health \ncare. If we do not give VA the necessary funds, how can we expect it to \nproperly care for the flux of new veterans when it cannot even care for \nthose it currently treats? In fact, VA officials have cited resource \nconstraints as the primary reason for not implementing many of the \nSpecial Committee's recommendations.\n  In all, GAO found that based on the time frames in VA's draft mental \nhealth strategic plan, 23 of the 24 recommendations may not be fully \nimplemented until fiscal year 2007 or later. The remaining \nrecommendation is targeted for full implementation by fiscal year 2005, \n4 years after the Special Committee first recommended it.\n  Additionally, the GAO report found that ten of the recommendations \nare longstanding, as they are consistent with those made in the Special \nCommittee's first report in 1985. VA agreed then that these \nrecommendations would improve the provision of PTSD services to \nveterans, yet the changes still are not scheduled for full \nimplementation for another two years at the earliest. These delayed \ninitiatives include developing a national PTSD education plan for VA, \nimproving VA collaboration with DoD on PTSD education, and providing \nincreased access to PTSD services.\n  PTSD is caused by an extremely stressful event and can develop years \nafter military service. Mental health experts estimate that the \nintensity of warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan could cause more than 15 \npercent of servicemembers returning from these conflicts to develop \nPTSD, with a total of nearly 30 percent needing some kind of mental \nhealth treatment. While there is no cure for PTSD, these experts \nbelieve early identification and treatment of PTSD symptoms may lessen \ntheir severity and improve the overall quality of life for individuals \nwith this disorder.\n  Congress required the establishment of VA's Special Committee on PTSD \nin 1984, with the original purpose primarily to aid Vietnam-era \nveterans diagnosed with PTSD. One of the Special Committee's main \ncharges is to carry out an ongoing assessment of VA's capacity to \ndiagnose and treat PTSD and to make recommendations for improving VA's \nPTSD services.\n  In addition, a March 20, 2005, article in the Los Angeles Times \npointed out how concerned veterans' advocates and even some VA \npsychiatrists are with VA's handling of PTSD services, saying VA \nhospitals are ``flirting with disaster.'' The article highlighted the \nsituation at the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, specifically \nthe Los Angeles VA hospital, which last year closed its psychiatric \nemergency room. A decade ago, VA hospitals in Los Angeles had rooms to \ntreat 450 mentally ill patients each day. After a series of cutbacks \nand consolidations, however, the main hospital can now accommodate only \n90 veterans overnight in its psychiatric wards. During the same 10-year \nperiod, the overall number of mental health patients treated by the VA \nGreater Los Angeles increased by about 28 percent, to 19,734 veterans \nin 2004. If this is how VA handles PTSD care for our veterans at the \nNation's largest VA hospital, how does that bode for the rest of the \nnation?\n  VA must make strides in its provision of mental health services and \noutreach efforts to servicemembers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. \nIf we are not careful and do not give VA proper resources, progress \nwill be impossible. As Ranking Member of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, I will work to ensure that does not happen. As such, I am \npleased to tell you that\n\n[[Page S3459]]\n\ntoday I am offering an amendment to the Supplemental to partially fix \nthis problem. Our Nation's veterans deserve the best care possible, for \nboth their physical wounds and mental.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Los Angeles Times \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Mar. 20, 2005]\n\n    Mental Health Care for Veterans Disputed; While Need Has Grown, \n    Inpatient Services Have Been Drastically Cut in the Last Decade.\n\n\n           Critics say outpatient programs can't do the job.\n\n                         (By Charles Ornstein)\n\n       As troops return from Iraq and Afghanistan--including \n     thousands with combat-related mental disorders--they enter a \n     Veterans Affairs healthcare system sharply divided about how \n     to care for them.\n       In the last decade, veterans hospitals across the country \n     have sharply reduced the number of inpatient psychiatric \n     beds, replacing them with outpatient programs and homeless \n     services.\n       The new offerings, officials say, cost less and are just as \n     effective.\n       ``It used to be with mental illness that once you got it, \n     you never got rid of it,'' said Dr. Mark Shelhorse, a \n     national VA mental health official. But ``mental illness is \n     perceived as a disease now just like hypertension and \n     diabetes. We have medicines to treat it. We know that people \n     recover and lead fully normal lives.''\n       But veterans' advocates and even some VA psychiatrists say \n     the hospitals, including the massive Veterans Affairs Greater \n     Los Angeles Healthcare System, are flirting with disaster. \n     They say the facilities are ill-equipped to deal with \n     veterans who need the most extensive help for psychosis, \n     substance abuse, suicidal impulses and post-traumatic stress \n     disorder.\n       Last year, the Los Angeles hospital closed its psychiatric \n     emergency room, a move that heightened the anger of the VA's \n     critics.\n       ``We were too easily swayed in the past by the argument \n     that after a while, it [PTSD] will go away,'' said Jay \n     Morales, a Vietnam veteran who chairs the mental health \n     consumer advisory council at the Los Angeles hospital. ``But \n     there are Vietnam vets walking around today, 30 years after \n     the war ended, having these problems.''\n       Dr. William Wirshing, a psychiatrist for 23 years at the \n     Greater Los Angeles VA, agreed. ``It's absurd how much \n     they've cut--and it's absurd how much they continue to cut,'' \n     he said.\n       A decade ago, VA hospitals in Los Angeles had rooms to \n     treat 450 mentally ill patients each day. After a series of \n     cutbacks and consolidations, the main Wadsworth hospital on \n     Wilshire Boulevard can now accommodate only 90 veterans \n     overnight in its psychiatric wards.\n       During the same 10-year period, the overall number of \n     mental health patients treated by the VA Greater Los Angeles \n     increased by about 28 percent, to 19,734 veterans in 2004.\n       The VA hospital in Los Angeles, the largest veterans \n     hospital in the nation, treats 80,000 veterans annually with \n     a budget of more than $450 million. It includes the hospital, \n     nursing homes, a domiciliary, three main outpatient care \n     sites and 10 community clinics. There are an estimated \n     510,000 veterans in Los Angeles County alone.\n       VA officials say that despite the cutbacks, the Los Angeles \n     VA hospital offers more mental health services today than \n     ever. Instead of keeping patients in locked wards overnight, \n     the VA offers them outpatient programs and temporary \n     accommodations in partnership with nonprofit groups, \n     officials say.\n       ``It's not like we went into a hospital that was fully \n     occupied and we said, `We don't need this unit anymore,' '' \n     said Dr. Andrew Shaner, the hospital's acting director of \n     mental health. ``We built programs that kept people \n     relatively well and therefore out of the hospital, and that's \n     why we were able to do it.''\n       The question remains: Are the current offerings enough?\n       A report last fall by the U.S. Government Accountability \n     Office cited estimates that 15% of service members stationed \n     in Iraq and Afghanistan would develop post-traumatic stress \n     disorder. As of December, about 1 million troops had spent \n     time in one of the two war zones (about one-third have done \n     more than one tour).\n       The GAO determined that the VA did not have enough \n     information to know if it could meet the increased demand.\n       Shelhorse, the VA's acting deputy consultant for patient \n     care services for mental health, said the agency is \n     monitoring the situation carefully and is pumping millions of \n     dollars into mental health programs.\n       The shift from inpatient to outpatient mental health \n     services has become a controversial issue throughout the VA \n     system. A 1996 federal law prohibits the VA from reducing \n     specialized treatment and rehabilitation for disabled \n     veterans, including mental health services.\n       A VA committee has found that the agency hasn't abided by \n     that law. While VA hospitals may be treating more mentally \n     ill patients, they aren't spending as much money doing so. At \n     the West Los Angeles VA, the amount spent on mental health \n     has decreased from $74 million in fiscal 1997 to $64.4 \n     million in fiscal 2003, according to a national monitoring \n     system.\n       Experts disagree on whether outpatient care can replace \n     inpatient treatment.\n       ``I don't think that intensive community treatment can take \n     care of all the people that no longer have the availability \n     of inpatient beds,'' said Dr. H. Richard Lamb, a psychiatry \n     professor at USC.\n       Lamb said the trend has led to an increase in homeless \n     mentally ill and those in jails.\n       But Dr. Robert Rosenheck, director of the VA's Northeast \n     Program Evaluation Center, said changes in the VA system have \n     not produced those results.\n       Studies, he said, have not shown an increase in jailed \n     veterans after inpatient psychiatric beds have been cut. Nor, \n     he said, have there been significant increases in suicides or \n     veterans showing up at non-VA hospitals for care.\n       ``Veterans very much preferred coming in and being in a \n     supportive environment for an extended period of time,'' \n     Rosenheck said. But ``when you look at objective outcomes, we \n     don't see scientific evidence of adverse effects'' because of \n     the cutbacks.\n       Even so, veterans' advocates and psychiatrists have been \n     complaining for years about cutbacks at the Greater Los \n     Angeles VA.\n       For many, the final straw came in May when the hospital \n     closed the psychiatric emergency room and shifted mental \n     health emergencies to the main ER. Troubled patients are now \n     cared for by nurses and other staff who, according to the \n     critics, are not adequately trained to handle psychiatric \n     emergencies.\n       Critics point to several instances since the transition in \n     which psychiatric patients were admitted to inpatient wards \n     without any written orders or treated with disrespect by ER \n     nurses who didn't understand their disorders. At least one \n     female patient with PTSD attempted suicide.\n       ``This is a dangerous situation,'' said Guy Mazzeo, a \n     veteran and member of the L.A. mental health consumer \n     advisory council. ``None of us'' was consulted before the \n     change, he said, referring to advocates for veterans and the \n     VA's outside advisory groups. And none agree with it, he \n     said.\n       The veterans and their doctors have been joined in their \n     criticism by Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), whose \n     district includes the VA health center.\n       He asked the VA in January to hire a full-time psychiatrist \n     for the emergency room and arrange for specially trained \n     psychiatric nurses to work there, among other things. The VA \n     declined his requests.\n       ``I'm disappointed that the VA has not responded more \n     aggressively,'' Waxman said in an interview. ``With Iraq and \n     Afghanistan war veterans returning, these demands are only \n     going to increase.''\n       VA officials say the criticism is unfair. Care in the main \n     ER is more coordinated than the care given in the stand-alone \n     psychiatric emergency room, they say. Patients can get their \n     medical and mental problems treated in one place, instead of \n     having to be shuttled between two.\n       Administrators say ER staff members have received extensive \n     training. And they say that there's no evidence that patients \n     are receiving inferior care.\n       Dr. Dean Norman, the hospital's chief of staff, said the \n     closure of the psychiatric ER made sense because the number \n     of patients using it had been decreasing for years, and the \n     hospital did not have enough staff.\n       ``One of our goals is to be good stewards of taxpayer \n     dollars,'' Norman said. ``We didn't make this in a \n     precipitous or reckless fashion. This was well thought out, \n     and we had good reasons for doing this.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Murray in \ncosponsoring this important amendment\n\n[[Page S3460]]\n\nto increase veterans health care funding. We owe it to our veterans, \nwho have so bravely served our country, to give them the best medical \ncare possible. It is disappointing that funding for veterans programs, \nespecially veterans health care, has not kept pace with either the \nincreased number of veterans in the system or medical inflation. This \namendment is crucial to providing veterans with the services they have \nearned.\n  As I have talked to veterans in California--and as I have met with \nreturning soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan--I have come to one \ndisturbing conclusion: we are not serving all of the needs of our \nveterans now and we are not prepared to serve the tens of thousands of \nveterans who will be returning over the next couple of years.\n  Senator Murray's amendment begins to address this situation. It will \nincrease veterans health care funding by almost $2 billion. This \nincludes $610 million for new veterans returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Funding for these veterans is not included in the current \nVA budget. In addition, each of the 21 veterans regions will receive \n$40 million to address their budget shortfalls. This will allow each \nregion to determine how the funds can best be used to benefit their \nveteran population.\n  I am especially pleased that this amendment includes funding \ndesignated for veterans mental health care. Specifically, $525 million \nis designated to expand mental health services, with $150 million \ntargeted for the treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder--PTSD. The \nVA has estimated that 30 percent of men and women currently serving in \nthe Armed Forces will need treatment for mental illness or readjustment \nissues. That is why this funding is so critical.\n  This amendment has the support of many veterans organizations, \nincluding the Veterans of Foreign Wars, AMVETS, Disabled American \nVeterans, and Paralyzed Veterans of America. They realize, as I do, how \ncrucial it is that this funding be made available. Without it, the VA \nwill not be able to meet the needs of the men and women who have so \nbravely served our country. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today, I rise in support of an amendment \nto the emergency supplemental to provide an additional $1.98 billion \nfor veterans health care. I am a cosponsor of this amendment because I \nbelieve that when we talk about the costs of war, we cannot forget the \nbrave men and women who are returning from war every single day.\n  In the past couple months, my home State of Arkansas has seen the \nreturn of over 3,000 brave men and women from the Army National Guard, \nwho answered their Nation's call to serve in Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nMany of them will need ready access to health care as they attempt to \ntransition back to the civilian lives they knew before the war.\n  I am troubled because they are returning to a veterans health care \nsystem that is underfunded and overburdened. Increasing health care \ncosts and an influx of thousands of new veterans each month makes it \nessential that we do what we can to provide for veterans health care, \nand we do it now.\n  This amendment would enable the VA to absorb the new veterans being \nadded to the system and would reverse many of the critical budget \nshortfalls that have left many VA facilities without the medical staff \nor equipment they desperately need. It would also provide $40 million \nfor every veterans regional network so they can better meet their local \nneeds.\n  My father fought in Korea and I was raised from an early age to have \ntremendous respect for the unselfish service of the men and women of \nthe Armed Services. As a United States Senator, I believe we have an \nobligation to provide them with the health care they were promised and \nto honor the benefits they have earned. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment because it is the right thing to do, it is our moral \nresponsibility, and it should be a priority for each and every one of \nus.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Bush administration has decided that \nall funding for the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan be requested as \nsupplemental emergency funding. I believe, therefore, that we must \ninclude in this supplemental funding legislation, additional monies to \ncover the cost of the war incurred by the Veterans Administration.\n  The President's budget did not request sufficient funding to cover \nthe significant increases in medical costs of veterans wounded in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. While severely wounded service members are remaining \nlonger in the Department of Defense health care system than in past \nconflicts, the VA provides all care for these men and women after they \nare released from the military, and provides care to Guard members and \nReservists beginning immediately after they return home from a \ndeployment.\n  We must cover these expenses. We cannot turn away these veterans. We \nalso cannot turn away other veterans and deny them care in deference to \nthe newest veterans. That would not be right either.\n  I am pleased to join Senators Murray and Akaka in offering this \namendment to provide $1.9 billion in additional funding to the Veterans \nAdministration. Passage of this amendment would go a long way to \ncovering existing shortfalls and allowing the VA to ramp up to meet the \ncurrent and expected needs for the coming year. I am pleased that this \namendment addresses the critical issue of mental health by providing \n$525 million specifically for mental health care and treatment.\n  Unlike prior wars, where soldiers were expected to lay down their \nguns upon returning home and forget about the war, service members \nreturning from Iraq and Afghanistan understand that it is very \nimportant for their mental health and the well-being of their family, \nthat they deal with both the mental effects of the war and the \nemotional effects on their families of a long and stressful separation. \nVet centers exist all across the country to help veterans and their \nfamilies deal with the ghosts of war and manage the transition back \nhome. These centers do a phenomenal job, but they are generally very \nsmall and have been handling a limited case load. With veterans \nreturning from Iraq in huge numbers, particularly members of the \nNational Guard and Reserve who do not live on or near military bases \nthe job of the Vet centers has increased more than a hundred-fold. The \nVet centers need an increase in both staff and resources commensurate \nwith the demands now placed upon them.\n  We have learned from prior wars that much can be done to ease the \ntransition back to civilian life if it is done immediately. Immediate \nmental health care can prevent the onset of more difficult diagnoses, \nsuch as post traumatic stress disorder. The VA has developed expertise \nin the diagnosis and treatment of PTSD, well beyond that of the private \nsector. The challenge now is to spread this expertise throughout the VA \nsystem. This takes resources. We also have learned that those soldiers \nwho have suffered physical wounds will often need ongoing mental health \nassistance to face the challenges of life with a disability. We must \nnot turn our backs on them.\n  The bill before the Senate is designed to cover the costs of these \ntwo conflicts. We cannot say we have done so if we do not cover the \ncosts of the physical and emotional wounds from these conflicts. The \nonly way that this can be done with the funding provided by the \nPresident's budget is if our obligations to other veterans are set \naside. This would be wrong. The only way we can truly honor our \nobligations to all of our veterans is to support the amendment by the \nSenator from Washington, Mrs. Murray.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Murray amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/12/senate-section/article/S3460-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, it is my intention to make a point of \norder in connection with the amendment that has been offered by \nSenators Murray and Akaka. But I do not want to do that if they are not \nhere on the floor. I will wait to give them an opportunity to make any \nstatements or motions they may deem appropriate. So I do not want to \nforeclose anyone from having an opportunity to express themselves on \nthat issue. But I do make that announcement just for the information of \nall Senators, that we have pending before us an amendment that purports \nto add as a matter of emergency appropriations $1.9 billion to the \nVeterans' Administration accounts.\n  The administration has not asked for these funds. Testimony before \nthe relevant committees of jurisdiction, the Veterans Affairs' \nCommittee and the Appropriations subcommittee that funds or recommends \nfunding for veterans programs, has not led Senators to request funds \nfor inclusion in the committee mark. So there is a disparity between \nthe proponents of the amendment and what they are urging the Senate to \napprove and what is being requested as a matter of emergency \nappropriations.\n  In addition, the language of the amendment actually has a provision \nthat the moneys appropriated under the amendment would be available \nuntil expended, which means the funding would carry over into the next \nfiscal year. We are, right now, having committees consider the funding \nlevels that are needed in the next fiscal year, beginning October 1.\n  So with no requests for funds, with the administration saying they \nhave enough funds to run the VA health programs and hospital programs \nbetween now and the end of this fiscal year, we are going to suggest \nthat this is subject to a point of order. It is my intention to make \nthat point of order.\n  Seeing that the Senators are on the floor now, Mr. President, \npursuant to section 402 of S. Con. Res. 95 of the 108th Congress, I \nmake a point of order that the amendment contains an emergency \ndesignation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of order and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, a vote now occurs on the motion to waive, \nright?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is right.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, there is a question about how much time \nis going to be----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to waive is debatable.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, there is some confusion on my part. I \nthought the Senators were going to debate this, but there was a \nsuggestion that we could agree on a time for a vote on the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act. So I inquire of Senators whether that is the \nfeeling on the other side. We would be willing to enter into an \nagreement for a vote to occur at a time certain that might suit the \nconvenience of all Senators.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am happy to talk to the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee in order to work out a time agreement. I do \nhave more I would like to say. This amendment is extremely serious. It \nis an emergency. We would like some more time, so I am happy to talk to \nthe chairman about having an agreement on time, if he would like to do \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator. \nLet me suggest, then, if there is no objection, that we enter into an \nagreement that we have a vote that will occur at 3:30 this afternoon.\n  Would that be satisfactory with the Senator?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I assume the time will be equally divided \nbetween now and 3:30 on this amendment. That would be satisfactory.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nvote on the motion to waive the Budget Act with respect to the Murray \namendment at 3:30 p.m. today, with debate until the vote equally \ndivided in the usual form and no amendments in order to the amendment \nprior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chair and thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby my colleague, Senator Murray. Senator Murray, I believe, offered \nthis identical amendment in the Appropriations Committee when it marked \nup the appropriations supplemental bill. I was very pleased to support \nher then.\n  I want to refer back to a time when we held a hearing with the \nSecretary of Defense. My colleague, Senator Murray, was at that \nhearing. She asked some questions, and other colleagues did, and I did, \nabout this issue of health care, health care for soldiers and health \ncare for veterans. One of the questions we asked was, What is the \ncontinuum here between a soldier and a veteran?\n  I would guess all of us in this Chamber have driven to Bethesda Naval \nHospital and Walter Reed Medical Center to visit young men and women \nwho have been wounded with respect to hostilities in Iraq. I have made \nmany such visits. I have seen these brave soldiers lying in their \nhospital bed, often with an arm missing or a leg missing or other \nserious wounds, convalescing and recovering. In most cases, God \nwilling, when they recover, they will get rehabilitation, and then they \nwill, in most cases, be discharged from the service.\n  We asked the Secretary of Defense, at that point, What is the \ndifference between a soldier on active duty and a young soldier who has \njust been released from Walter Reed Medical Center who is then \ndischarged but continues to need medical help for the wounds they \nsuffered in the war? Is there really any difference? And should there \nreally be a difference in the health care that is delivered?\n  I am enormously proud of the men and women who work at hospitals such \nas Walter Reed Medical Center and Bethesda Naval Hospital, those we see \nmost often when we visit. That health care could not be better. They do \nan extraordinary job.\n  There was recently an article about the job they do in a publication \ncalled the Washington Monthly. I discussed that article with Mr. \nPrincipi, then the head of the VA. I said, you ought to send this \narticle out to every single employee of the VA because without \nsufficient money--and they have not had sufficient money--they have \ndone an extraordinary job.\n  But the question is, When someone becomes a veteran, having come off \nactive duty with a war wound, what happens? Is there full funding in \nthat case for the kind of health care they need? The answer is no.\n  My colleague from the State of Washington, Senator Murray, \nunderstands that. She has led the fight on this issue for a long while, \nto say: Can't we have full funding for health care for veterans?\n  You can go any place in this country these days and talk about \nAmerica's service men and women, and people respond to it. They care \nabout the people who wear this country's uniform, and they want to \nsupport them. But that support does not just occur with respect to when \nthey are in a hospital such as Walter Reed or Bethesda. That support \nmust occur with respect to VA hospitals and community-based veterans \nclinics.\n\n  As you know, the President's budget does not provide funding for the \nclinics\n\n[[Page S3462]]\n\nthat were promised, the clinics that would allow a veteran who has \nhealth care issues to show up at a local storefront VA clinic instead \nof having to drive, particularly in rural States, hundreds and hundreds \nand hundreds of miles. Well, that is not funded by the President's \nbudget. Even though they had decided they were going to do that, the \nPresident says, no, we do not have the money.\n  My colleague from the State of Washington, Senator Murray, asks the \nquestion: What is more important in this country? I am not asking you \nfor 10 things, but just give us a couple. What is more important than \nkeeping our promise of health care to veterans? Just give me a couple \nof things that are more important. These are the people to whom we \noffered a promise, who answered the call: Uncle Sam wants you. Wear the \nuniform of this country. Put yourself in harm's way, perhaps lose an \narm, perhaps lose a leg, maybe lose your life.\n  What is more important than saying to those people who answered that \ncall that when you need medical help in our veterans medical system, we \nwill have adequate funding to make sure you get that help?\n  I recall one day a father calling me and saying: I have a son who \nfought in the Vietnam war, and he suffered a head wound, a bullet to \nthe brain. It was a very serious head wound that left him in \ndevastating condition, and because of that brain wound and his \nincapacity, he was suffering muscle atrophy, and at some point he had \nto have a toe removed. They said, well, to have that toe removed, you \nhave to take this young veteran to Fargo, ND, which was about 250 miles \naway--500 miles round trip.\n  So for this young man, who suffered a wound to the head in a war and \nwas incapacitated as a result of it, put him in a car and drive him 500 \nmiles round trip to have a toe removed. I said: Isn't there some common \nsense here? Couldn't this be done somewhere closer? We finally resolved \nthat.\n  But the fact is, the money that was left out of the President's \nbudget for the storefront community clinics for veterans, that is \nexactly the kind of thing they can do in many cases. Yet somehow this \nis not an urgent priority, with all of the young veterans coming back \nwith wounds from this war, the Iraqi war, and with all of the World War \nII veterans now reaching that age where they need maximum care, the \nmaximum claim on health care they were promised.\n  If ever we need to decide as a priority in this Congress that we need \nto keep our promise to veterans, it is now. That is all the Senator \nfrom the State of Washington is saying: Let's keep this promise. There \nseems to be money for a lot of other priorities around here that rank \nfar lower than health care for America's veterans.\n  All of us have stories about these veterans, about those we have \nvisited who were involved in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and now the \ngulf war. Those stories, individually and collectively, talk about \nheroism and commitment and service, duty, honor, country. Duty and \nhonor, it seems to me, for us is to make the right choice.\n  It is always about choices in Congress. Who among us will decide \ntoday that it is the wrong choice to fully fund veterans health care in \nthis country? Who among us will decide that is the wrong choice? For \nme, it is the right choice to decide veterans deserve to know we keep \nour promise. That is the import of the amendment from Senator Murray. I \nam proud to stand here and speak for it and support it and vote for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Murray \namendment. This is an emergency supplemental bill. We are considering \nfunding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. I voted against this \nwar. I didn't think we were prepared. I didn't think we had a coalition \nto stand behind us that would send in the soldiers and bring the \nresources to the battle. Our military went into this war and performed \nadmirably. We were well prepared for the military invasion. Clearly we \nwere not prepared for what happened afterward.\n  For 2 years now we have been in Iraq and Afghanistan. For 2 years we \nhave seen the casualties come home and we have seen the body bags and \ncaskets come home as well. We have lost over 16,000 of our best and \nbravest in Iraq to this day. Among our allies, thank goodness there \nhave been fewer losses. But in comparison it shows we are carrying the \nburden of battle. Our sons and daughters are carrying the burden of \nbattle. The taxpayers, with this bill, will put the resources into \nmaterial and equipment so these soldiers can do their job and come home \nsafely.\n  How many of us have stood up on the floor of the Senate on both sides \nof the aisle praising these men and women in uniform, saying we have to \nstand behind them, keep them in your thoughts and prayers, don't be \nashamed to wave that flag? We are all proud Americans.\n  Senator Murray comes to us today and asks whether our pride in our \nfighting men and women is enough for us to declare it an emergency to \nmake sure our veterans hospitals and clinics are up to the task of \nserving these men and women. For us to give all the great speeches \nabout how much we admire the soldiers and then, when they are hurt and \ncome home, to throw them into a VA system unprepared to take care of \nthem is a mockery. If we truly believe in the goodness of the men and \nwomen who risk their lives for America, why wouldn't we vote for the \nMurray amendment to put the money in the veterans hospitals so the very \nbest doctors and nurses and equipment is there for our sons, our \ndaughters, the husband, and wives of people we love.\n  Let me tell you about one element of this which I am particularly \nproud that Senator Murray has added at my request. It is estimated that \nat least one out of every five soldiers who serves will come home and \nface a condition known as posttraumatic stress disorder. What is it? If \nyou saw the movie ``Patton,'' you can recall that scene where George C. \nScott, playing Patton, went in the military hospital, saw a soldier on \na cot and asked: Where were you hit, soldier? The soldier responded: I \nwasn't hit. I just can't do it anymore. And Patton reached down and \nslapped him. He slapped that soldier and that slap reverberated across \nAmerica, a scandalous headline that this general would slap a soldier \nbecause he couldn't face battle.\n  In all honesty, it is that attitude and denial which have led the \nUnited States to ignore this very real problem. It wasn't until 1980, \n25 years ago, that the Veterans' Administration acknowledged the fact \nthat when you take men and women in America, train them to be soldiers \nand sailors, marines and airmen, serve in the Coast Guard, put them \ninto battle, they can have life experiences and witness events which \nwill have a dramatic impact on them personally. They may need help and \ncounseling to come home and set their lives on the right path. The \nfirst time we acknowledged posttraumatic stress disorder was 1980. They \nused to call it shell shock and battle fatigue. But it was never \nacknowledged as a medical problem that needed attention until 1980.\n\n  A few weeks ago I went across my State of Illinois. I went to five \ndifferent locations for roundtables. I invited medical counselors from \nthe Veterans' Administration to tell me about the soldiers who were \ntrying to come to grips with this torment in their minds over what they \nhad done and what they had seen. I was nothing short of amazed at what \nhappened. In every single stop, these men and women came forward and \nsat at tables before groups in their communities, before the media, and \ntold their sad stories of being trained to serve this country, being \nproud to serve, and going into battle situations which caused an impact \non their mind they never could have imagined, and coming home with \ntheir minds in this turmoil over what they had done and seen, and many \ntimes having to wait months and, in one case, a year before they could \nsee a doctor at a VA hospital.\n  I couldn't believe the stories of World War II veterans. A veteran in \nsouthern Illinois who was in the Philippines couldn't come to my \nmeeting because ``I just can't face talking about it,'' 60 years after \nhis experience. Veterans from Korea where my two brothers served, \nveterans from Vietnam who came home rejected by many, who couldn't \nresolve their difficulties because they were afraid to even acknowledge \nthey were veterans, tormented by this for decades.\n\n[[Page S3463]]\n\n  The ones that gripped my heart the most were the Iraqi veterans. I \nwill never forget these men and women. The one I sat next to at \nCollinsville, a bright, handsome, good looking young marine, talked \nabout going into Fallujah with his unit and how his point man was \nriddled with bullets, and he had to carry the parts of his body out of \nthat street into some side corner where he could be evacuated, at least \nthe remains could be evacuated. Then he served as point man and went \nforward. A rocket-propelled grenade was shot at him, and it bounced off \nhis helmet. One of the insurgents came up and shot him twice in the \nchest. This happened in November. He was there. He survived.\n  When he came home, he couldn't understand who he was because of what \nhe had seen and been involved in. He had problems with his wife, \ndifficult, violent problems, and he turned to the VA for help.\n  I said to this young marine: I am almost afraid to ask you this, but \nhow old are you?\n  He said: I am 19.\n  Think of what he has been through. Thank goodness he is in the hands \nof counselors. Thank goodness he is getting some help, moving in the \nright direction.\n  But in another meeting in southern Illinois, another soldier said, in \nfront of the group: As part of this battle, I killed children, women. I \nkilled old people. I am trying to come to grips with this in my mind as \nI try to come back into civilian life.\n  A young woman, an activated guardswoman from Illinois, said when she \ncame out, still in distress over what she had seen and done, they \nstopped her at Camp McCoy in Wisconsin and sat her down and asked: Any \nproblems? Of course, that should have been the time for her to come \nforward and say: I have serious problems. She didn't. Because if you \nsaid you had a problem, you had to stay at Camp McCoy for 3 more \nmonths. She was so desperate to get home she said: No problems.\n\n  She came home and finally realized that was not true. She had serious \npsychological problems over what she had been through. When she turned \nto the VA and asked for help, they said: You can come in and see a \ncounselor at the VA in 1 year.\n  What happens to these veterans, victims of posttraumatic stress \ndisorder, without counseling at an early stage? Sadly, many of them see \ntheir marriages destroyed. One I met was on his fourth marriage. Many \nof them self-medicate with alcohol, sometimes with drugs, desperate to \nfind some relief from the nightmares they face every night. These are \nthe real stories of real people, our sons and daughters, our brothers \nand sisters, our husbands and wives who go to battle to defend this \ncountry and come home with the promise that we will stand behind them.\n  If we stand behind them, we need to stand by the Murray amendment--$2 \nbillion to make sure these hospitals and clinics have the very best \npeople to treat our soldiers coming home; money as well to make certain \nthat there is family therapy, something that is often overlooked. How \nmany times do you hear the story of the wife who says: Who is this man \nwho came back from battle? He is not the soldier I sent away. He is so \ndistant. He doesn't talk to me. He gets angry in a hurry. He wants to \nbe away from us. That is not the man I sent to battle. The spouses and \ntheir children need help, too.\n  I implore my colleagues. I know it is considered unusual to come in \non a President's request and add money for the Veterans' \nAdministration. But we are not doing our duty as Senators to only \nprovide the money for the troops for the battle. We have to do more. We \nmust do that. But we need to provide the physical and mental medical \nhelp these same soldiers need when they come home.\n  I thank Senator Murray for her leadership on this amendment. I wish \nit were a bipartisan amendment. There is certainly bipartisan support \nfor our troops. But maybe when the vote comes, we will find if the same \nSenators who have said such glowing things about the men and women in \nuniform will stand by them when they come home and need a helping hand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for \nhis heartfelt statement. I know he has worked in his State, talking to \nyoung men and women who are coming home. He has looked them in the eyes \nas I have. I was with him in Kuwait and Iraq a few weeks ago talking to \nsoldiers who are coming home.\n  The No. 1 question was: We are hearing that services are not going to \nbe available for us when we get home. We are hearing that the veterans \nfrom Vietnam and World War II are waiting in line. We have been over \nhere for a year.\n  They fear this country has forgotten them despite all the rhetoric on \nthis floor. The Senator from Illinois is right. This is not a \nRepublican issue. It is not a Democratic issue. This is an American \nissue. This is about our American men and women serving us honorably \nand who deserve to have the services when they come home.\n  The Senator from Illinois is right. To look into the eyes of a young \nfamily where one of them is suffering from posttraumatic stress \nsyndrome affecting their marriage, job, their entire community, and \nwhat are we saying? Wait in lines. You don't get in to be served? That \nis not an emergency?\n  What we have now in front of us is a point of order saying this is \nnot an emergency. If it is not an emergency to take care of our men and \nwomen who are now serving us overseas, who have come home, then I don't \nknow what is. When I am going out and talking to service organizations \nand every single VISN in this country is telling us they are working \nunder debts, they are not hiring doctors and nurses to replace those \nwho are leaving, they have beds that are being held together by duct \ntape--if that is not an emergency, then I can't think of one that is.\n  We have talked to veterans in every single VISN. Every single one of \nthem has given us dramatic stories of the wait lines, of clinics that \nhave been promised and not opened, of service men and women from \nprevious wars who are not getting served. This is not an emergency? I \ndisagree.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Schumer, Johnson, Corzine, \nLincoln, Landrieu, and Dorgan as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent to print two letters of support \nin the Record. They are from the national veterans service \norganizations: The American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nAmvets, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and Disabled American Veterans.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2005.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: Thank you for offering an amendment to \n     the H.R. 1268, FY 2005 emergency supplemental appropriations, \n     to add $2 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \n     medical care. VA medical care is truly the ongoing cost of \n     war. You have The American Legion's full support.\n       VA is not meeting the health care needs of America's \n     veterans. Currently, certain veterans are actually denied \n     access to the VA health care system even though they are \n     willing to make co-payments and have third-party health care \n     insurance, while other face lengthy delays in accessing care. \n     Although providing quality health care, VA cannot meet its \n     own timely access standards simply because it lacks the \n     health care professionals to meet the demand for services.\n       In 2003, the President's Task Force to Improve Health Care \n     Delivery For Our Nation's Veterans cited ``eliminating the \n     mismatch between demand and funding'' as a major obstacle. \n     Last year, VA officials claimed to need between 10 and 14 \n     percent annual increases just to maintain current services \n     because of Federal payraises and medical inflation. VA health \n     care is still the best value for the taxpayer's dollar.\n       As former active-duty service members, especially National \n     Guard and Reservists, transition to their civilian \n     lifestyles, many new veterans will turn to VA to address \n     their health care concerns, especially those with mental \n     health problems associated with combat. VA is a world leader \n     in effective treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder \n     (PTSD) and other readjustments problems. VA must be funded to \n     make sure this newest generation of wartime veterans are \n     properly cared for in a timely manner and not displace other \n     veterans seeking care due simply to limited resources.\n       Once again, thank you for offering an amendment to add $2 \n     billion for VA medical\n\n[[Page S3464]]\n\n     care. Timely access to VA medical care is an earned benefit \n     from a grateful nation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Steve Robertson,\n\n                                                         Director,\n     National Legislative Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       The Independent Budget,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 6, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the co-authors of The \n     Independent Budget, AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, \n     Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Veterans of Foreign \n     Wars, we are writing to express our support for the proposed \n     Murray-Akaka amendment to the FY 2005 Emergency Supplemental \n     that would provide $1.9 billion in much needed funding for \n     veterans' health care.\n       Providing health care to returning servicemembers is an \n     ongoing cost of our national defense. Servicemembers who \n     participate in a theater of combat are eligible for health \n     care from the Department of Veterans Affairs for two years \n     after separation or release from active duty, without regard \n     for strict eligibility rules. VA hospitals are facing budget \n     deficits and moving to reduce services. Neither the \n     Administration's FY 2006 budget request nor the recently \n     passed budget resolution, addressed the costs of providing \n     needed health care. The Independent Budget has recommended an \n     increase for VA health care of $3.5 billion for FY 2006. This \n     amendment would provide the funding needed to care for these \n     returning veterans, as well as provide the resources the VA \n     needs to meet shortfalls that are affecting veterans today.\n       We ask you to support this amendment and to provide the \n     dollars needed to care for servicemembers returning from Iraq \n     and Afghanistan, as well as all veterans who rely upon the VA \n     to provide their health care.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rick Jones,\n       National Legislative Director, AMVETS.\n     Richard B. Fuller,\n       National Legislative Director, Paralyzed Veterans of \n     America.\n     Joseph A. Violante,\n       National Legislative Director, Disabled American Veterans.\n     Dennis Cullinan,\n       National Legislative Director, Veterans of Foreign Wars of \n     the United States.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the VA is not prepared to deal with the \nsoldiers who are coming home. So far 240,000 soldiers have come out of \nour service and are now available or have available to them veterans \nservices; 50,000 already have asked the VA for care. This is an \nemergency.\n  As I talked about this morning, in State after State, in Alaska, \nwhere priority 7 veterans who are not enrolled in VA primary care are \nnot getting appointments to date; in Colorado, where they have a $7.25 \nmillion shortage this year; in California where the VA hospital in Los \nAngeles has closed its psychiatric ward at the exact time we have \ngenerals telling us that at least 30 percent of our soldiers who are \ncoming home from Iraq will need mental health care capacity and we have \npsychiatric emergency rooms being closed; in Florida, where there is \n$150 million deficit; in Idaho, where we have the Boise Idaho VA \nfacility with a hiring freeze; in Kentucky, where we are having \nsoldiers lie on broken tables because there is simply no money to \nreplace any equipment there. In Maine, we have a $12 million deficit; \nin Minneapolis, $7 million shortfall--I remind the Senate, there are \nfour facilities that see the most difficult, complex injuries once they \nhave been discharged. Minnesota is one of them, and they have a $7 \nmillion shortfall.\n  The list goes on and on. This is an emergency. I cannot think of a \nmore important issue facing our country today. I can't go home and look \nat my veterans in north central Washington who have to drive over a \nmountain pass 150 miles to get care today, who have been promised the \nhealth care clinic, and say: Sorry, my colleagues don't see this as an \nemergency.\n  Any one of us who has taken the time to sit down with our soldiers \nwhen they are discharged from the service and out in their \ncommunities--they tell us the stories such as the Senator from Illinois \ntalked about, about the help they need getting through the nightmares, \nthe posttraumatic stress syndrome, getting help with serious injuries \nwhere they have lost arms and legs.\n  We should not say on this Senate floor this is not an emergency. I am \nappalled that that is what the argument has come down to. I believe \nthis vote is about whether we stand with our men and women. It is about \nwhether you are going to vote with our veterans. I am stunned that \nthere are those who say this one issue is not something that is an \nemergency.\n  Any one of us who has been out there working with our veterans--I \ncome to this floor as a daughter of a disabled veteran. I lived with my \nfather who was in a wheelchair most of his lifetime. I worked at a VA \nhospital long before I even thought about being in the Senate. I worked \nat the Seattle VA hospital during the Vietnam war. Any one of us who \nhas taken the time to talk to people who served in wars and have come \nhome know that if we don't have the care for them, we are doing a \ndisservice not only to the men and women who serve today, but to the \nmen and women whom we are going to ask to serve us in the wars to come.\n  This is an emergency. I don't care if the administration is saying \nthe VA hospitals have the money they need. When we talk to them, they \nare all telling us they have a budget deficit, a hiring freeze; they \nare not replacing the doctors and nurses who are leaving, and they have \nequipment that is old, decrepit, falling apart, and dangerous. That is \nan emergency. It is one we have to deal with.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Minnesota on the floor. I \nyield 2 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Washington for \nher leadership on this very important amendment. I share her dismay and \nastonishment that the other side doesn't recognize this is an \nemergency. It is an emergency in Minnesota and to the Minneapolis \nveterans hospital, which has been designated as one of the primary \nrecipients of those returning home injured in the war in Iraq, and \nwhich does not have the money even to meet the needs of veterans \nalready in Minnesota, much less the additional demand.\n  It seems to me incredible that anybody can say they support our \ntroops, as we all do, but then when they come home injured, wounded, \neven maimed, we are not going to provide them with the resources \nnecessary and everything they need to resume healthy and normal lives.\n  This is a fundamental question of priorities for this body and for \nthe administration. If we don't believe that sending soldiers to Iraq \nconstitutes an emergency, if we don't believe that supplying them and \nequipping them, as we will vote to do--as I have supported every time \nand will again here--constitutes an emergency outside of the normal \nbudget processes, but this instance now where we talk about providing \nhealth care to those most in need, in the most emergency-type \nsituations of their lives imaginable, that this is not an emergency \nexpenditure that should be approved unanimously by this body, then I \nfrankly don't see how we can say with any integrity that we support our \ntroops.\n  We support our troops in Iraq and now we need to support them when \nthey return home. This amendment of the Senator from Washington will \naccomplish that. I would be astonished if anyone in this body would \noppose it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time do we have on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 16 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I note that there is nobody from the \nother side on the floor. I am frankly not surprised, because I don't \nsee how anyone can argue against making sure that our service men and \nwomen get the health care they need, whether it is for a mental or a \nphysical need. We sent them to war. We should be there for them when \nthey come home. Regarding this amendment, I have been trying to do this \nsince the beginning of the year and I have been told this is not the \ntime or the place.\n  I let my colleagues know this is our last chance this year to make \nsure our veterans have the care they need. There is no other \nopportunity. We are going to get to the budget at some point and to the \nappropriations cycle, and we are going to get to the point where we \nhave an appropriations bill on the floor, and the budget already says \nthere is no more money. We hear the administration say--when we talk\n\n[[Page S3465]]\n\nabout the VISNs, everyone tells us they don't have the resources. If \nyou look at it, you will see these men and women don't have the care \nthey need.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. The Senator knows this is an emergency supplemental, so \nit is not subject to the normal budget process. In my 4-plus years \nhere, I have not witnessed another occasion where a budget point of \norder has been raised against any part of the emergency supplemental \nappropriations. Is the Senator aware of this happening before, or are \nveterans being singled out in this instance?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have to agree with my colleague from \nMinnesota. I have not seen that done before. What we are going to vote \non is whether our veterans are an emergency so they can be included in \nthe supplemental.\n  Mr. DAYTON. We are talking about an $82 billion supplemental here \nthat the Senator has amended, which fits within the President's \nrequest--or most of it does. It is a small part of this, and it is the \nleast we should be doing on behalf of veterans.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct. Actually, the President sent us \nan $82 billion supplemental. The Senate is considering $80.1 billion. \nWe have the means to still be less than what the President has sent us \nby adding this amendment. I sincerely cannot think of any other issue \nmore important than to make sure that those men and women who served \nus, when they come home, have the services they need.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I first thank the Senator from Washington State. She is \nexactly on the mark. I have joined with her on a number of occasions \nand appreciate her leadership on this issue of veterans health care.\n  Would she not agree that veterans should not have to go through the \nprocess every year, fighting every year to try to get what they need \nand, at the same time, knowing that they give us everything they are \nasked to do in terms of putting their lives on the line, keeping us \nsafe? Our men and women in Iraq right now are doing that and we have \nmade a promise to them. Would she not agree that as a country, every \nyear it seems as though we are back here trying to keep the promise.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Michigan is correct. Frankly, I have \njoined her in trying to make veteran services mandatory so we are not \nhere. It is disturbing to me that we are desperately pleading to our \ncolleagues to call this an emergency. What are we doing to our soldiers \nwhen we tell them we are in a desperate fight on the floor of the \nSenate that we are going to lose on a partisan vote over our veterans? \nThat is the wrong message to send to the men and women in the services. \nIt should be part of our budget, part of the appropriations every year, \nthat if you serve your country, you get your care. We don't have that \nnow, so we are here in our last-ditch effort, last attempt, last \nability to try to provide these services for the men and women in the \nservices.\n  I find that appalling, but I will fight hard because I believe more \nthan anything that we should be making sure if a young man or woman \ncomes home from Iraq or Afghanistan, they are not turned away at their \nVA hospital. We need to make sure that anybody who serves in any war--\nVietnam, Korea, or anywhere--is not turned away at a VA hospital. They \nshould not be put in a bed held together by duct tape. That is wrong. \nThat is why we are here arguing now that this is an emergency, because \nwe have not dealt with it in the past. We now have to deal with it, and \nI urge my colleagues to join with us on the last chance we have this \nyear to keep our word to the men and women who have served this country \nhonorably.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield for a question.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I wanted to share with my colleague--and then ask a \nquestion--the fact that this is an emergency in Michigan. We have a big \nState, 10 million people, a very large State geographically, where \nfolks often have to drive a long way in order to get to VA assistance. \nThey are now in a situation of having to wait up to 6 months oftentimes \nto see a doctor and to get the services they need.\n  I ask my colleague if she is hearing those similar stories around the \ncountry--that we wait 6 months, we drive hours and hours to get to a \nfacility right now? Without the additional dollars, that is only going \nto continue and get worse. I wonder if that is what she is hearing as \nwell.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is exactly right. We are hearing that from \nevery region, including yours. That is why this amendment is before us.\n  I have little time left. I see some colleagues on the other side are \non the floor. They are going to make their arguments. Again, this is an \nemergency; this is part of the supplemental. We should not tell our \nsoldiers that they are not an emergency when they come home.\n  I yield to my colleagues on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield such time as she may consume to \nthe Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to answer some of the concerns \nraised by the Senator from the State of Washington.\n  First, there is not a Senator in the entire Senate who doesn't want \nto make sure that the veterans are taken care of, whether they served \nin World War I, II, Korea, or any other war. I have to say I am \nmentioning World War I because I was at a veterans event about 6 months \nago, and I asked people to stand by the wars in which they served and I \ndidn't mention World War I. This very irate veteran in a wheelchair in \nfront of me suggested that I left out World War I. So I want to say \nthat I am most appreciative of the veterans who are here having served \nin World War I and every other war.\n  We want to take care of our veterans. We want to make sure that we \nhave the money to do it. We do not have a supplemental request from the \nadministration for the Veterans' Administration. This doesn't mean that \nsome veterans hospitals out in our country are not saying they would \nlike to have more money; it doesn't mean that a clinic hasn't been \nbuilt yet that is on the drawing boards to be built. Most certainly, we \nhave areas that we need to address in veterans care, and I want to make \nsure we have the money to do it.\n  But I have to say that the Veterans' Administration is telling us \nthey have the money they need to fulfill this year's budget and, \nspecifically, to fulfill their needs.\n  We asked the Secretary of Veterans Affairs if he needed more money in \nthe 2005 year--the year we are in budgetwise--for returning veterans \nfrom the Iraqi war and from the Afghanistan area. The answer was: No, \nwe have everything we need to cover those veterans. We asked him if he \nneeded more money than was in the current Presidential budget for 2006, \nwhich we will be considering in my subcommittee for those same \nreturning veterans. The answer was: No, we have enough in that budget.\n  Now, I have to say that, as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nSubcommittee in Appropriations, I am going to look at that and I am \ngoing to try to determine for myself if there is enough for 2006. But I \nhave to say in this budget year, 2005, which has about 6 more months to \nrun, the Veterans Affairs Department says they have enough to cover \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  This does not mean everything is going exactly the way I would want \nit in the Veterans' Administration. There is a hospital in Dallas that \nis particularly being noted by the GAO investigators as not performing \nup to the standards we would expect, and I am asking our Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs to address that particular hospital. I am sure there \nare other specific instances.\n  It is not that we do not have the money put in there. It is that we \nhave had a management problem there, and we are seeking to address that \nsituation immediately.\n  I asked the Secretary to put in writing what the situation is, and I \nask\n\n[[Page S3466]]\n\nunanimous consent that the April 5, 2005, letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     The Secretary\n\n\n                                          of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 5, 2005.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans \n         Affairs, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairman: Before I begin the main purpose of \n     this letter, I want to take this opportunity to thank you for \n     the consideration and interest you have shown VA through your \n     leadership in this year's appropriation hearing and many \n     other endeavors on behalf of our veterans. I very much \n     appreciate your proactive involvement and commitment to \n     providing for those who have served this country with such \n     dedication.\n       I write to you today to address certain issues regarding \n     VA's FY 2005 fiscal situation. I know some have said that VA \n     must have emergency supplemental funds to continue providing \n     the services for which veterans depend on us--timely health \n     care and delivery of benefits. Whenever trends indicate the \n     need for refocusing priorities, VA's leaders ensure prudent \n     use of reserve funding for these purposes. That is just \n     simply part of good management. It does not, however, \n     indicate a ``dire emergency''. I can assure you that VA does \n     not need emergency supplemental funds in FY 2005 to continue \n     to provide the timely, quality service that is always our \n     goal. We will, as always, continue to monitor workload and \n     resources to be sure we have a sustainable balance. But \n     certainly for the remainder of this year, I do not foresee \n     any challenges that are not solvable within our own \n     management decision capability.\n       I look forward to continuing to work with you as we strive \n     to provide the very best service possible for those veterans \n     who depend on us the most. Thank you again for your \n     leadership in this important area.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                               R. James Nicholson.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Now, that is the Secretary of Veterans Affairs who \nsays there is reserve funding available if an emergency arises, and the \nVeterans Affairs Department does not need extra funding.\n  One thing has to be determined, and that is the difference between \npeople who are returning who are on active duty, who are at our \nmilitary hospitals, who are being treated in the Department of Defense \nbecause they are active duty. The Veterans Affairs Department is where \nthe people who are going out of our military service go for their \nhealth care. There are fewer coming home in the Veterans Affairs' \ninfluence where they would be giving the service, as opposed to active \nduty where they are going to Bethesda, Walter Reed, and other hospitals \nthat are treating our Active-Duty military.\n  So I think we have to look at where the Veterans Affairs part of this \nbudget is, and do they need more. In fact, of the 240,000 who have gone \nout of our service in the last 3 years, only 48,000 have even come in \nto the Veterans Affairs service capability. Some already have \ninsurance. Some might come later but that is something that we can \nmonitor. Right now, we are told we have the reserve funding to be able \nto handle anyone who is going out of Active-Duty service, out of \nActive-Duty military health care and into the Veterans' Administration, \nand that we have the money to cover it.\n  So I do not want to take the $2 billion that is in this amendment out \nof other areas such as our armed services, our Active-Duty military who \nare on the ground, the equipment we are giving them in this \nsupplemental. That is why I must oppose Senator Murray's amendment, \nalthough I do agree with her overall goal and will continue to work \nwith her as chairman of the subcommittee to monitor the situation. Let \nus get our numbers right. Let us act when it is on the budget with the \nhearings and the anticipation of the needs, rather than adding $2 \nbillion to the emergency appropriations that is before us today and \ntaking it from something else, such as Active-Duty military equipment \nand preventive measures that we must cover for those who are on the \nground today.\n  With all of this said, we will reach our goal of assuring the very \nbest military veterans' care not by adding $2 billion to the funding \nfor the next 6 months but, instead, planning for it since we are told \nby the Secretary of Veterans Affairs we have the money we need for this \nyear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Who yields time? The Senator \nfrom Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia was not \nable to be on the Senate floor when this was initially discussed, and \nin deference to his right to speak on this amendment, I yield 10 \nminutes from our side to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Cochran of Mississippi, for his \ngenerosity and for his very gracious and courteous action in this \nregard. I thank him for the time. I will not use the entire 10 minutes. \nI take it I may yield some of that time, if I wish, to other Senators.\n  The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have strained America. The cost of \nthese wars has strained the Federal budget. The deployments of the \nNational Guard and the Reserves have strained American families. The \ntoll of the wars on our troops and their equipment has strained the \nreadiness of our Armed Forces. But there is no one who bears more of \nthe strains of these wars than the veterans who have served our country \nin combat.\n  According to the Department of Defense, nearly 12,000 troops have \nbeen wounded in Iraq and another 442 have been wounded in Afghanistan. \nThese troops have received the finest medical care our military can \noffer, but untold numbers of service men and women will require long-\nterm care from the Department of Veterans Affairs. However, the VA is \nalso feeling the strains of war. VA hospitals are seeing more and more \nveterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan at the same time the \naging veterans from World War II, Korea, and Vietnam are most in need \nof the VA's health care services, to which they are entitled. However, \nthe administration has not met this growing demand for VA health care \nservices with budget increases.\n\n  Fortunately, Congress has stepped in and added billions in needed \nfunds in recent years. Last year, Congress added $1.2 billion to the \nPresident's request for veterans health care. Two years ago, Congress \nadded $1.57 billion to the President's budget for VA health care. But \nthe shortfalls in the veterans budget continue. The Disabled American \nVeterans, in its independent budget for fiscal year 2006, estimated \nthat the White House budget for VA health care is $3.4 billion less \nthan what is required to care for all veterans who are entitled to \ncare. Clearly, more needs to be done to care for veterans.\n  The Murray-Akaka-Byrd, and others, amendment would increase veterans \nhealth care by $1.98 billion. These funds are targeted to provide care \nfor veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan to increase mental \nhealth services and to support local VA hospitals and clinics. This is \na commonsense amendment to support the men and the women who have borne \nthe wounds of battle. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair and again thank my chairman, Mr. Cochran.\n  May I yield the remaining time to Senator Murray and Senator Akaka?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield some of that time to the Senator \nfrom Hawaii, as much time as he will choose to use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Cochran, and also Senator Byrd and Senator Murray for the time.\n  Mr. President, the amendment before us addresses the costs of \nproviding health care to troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  My colleagues in the Senate have already recognized the need to \nprovide funds that would allow VA to absorb an influx of new patients \nfrom Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom. We recognized that need in \n2003, when Congress added $175 million for VA to the Supplemental \nAppropriations bill. I again point out that this amount was provided \nonly one month after the war in Iraq began and before we knew about the \nlevel of troop commitment.\n  Does this body believe that things are better in VA today or that \nmassive\n\n[[Page S3467]]\n\namounts of troops will not actually come for care? I don't think so.\n  Our amendment allows VA to provide care for returning troops--without \ndisplacing those veterans currently using the system.\n  The amount of this amendment--$1.9 billion--is drawn from what we \nknow about past use of the VA health care system coupled with what we \nknow to be the costs associated with preparing VA for veterans from the \nglobal war on terror.\n  Earlier we shared data and stories from VA hospitals and clinics \nacross the country. My colleagues on the other side refute the fact \nthat facilities are in crisis situation. I urge my colleagues to talk \nto VA personnel in their home States.\n  Perhaps the administration is reluctant to share details of budget \nshortfalls. Or perhaps network directors have not been allowed to \nrequest additional money. But these deficits are real, and they are \ndeficits which will hurt veterans. In my mind that is an emergency.\n  To reiterate: we know of shortfalls in each and every State. The \nworst deficits are occurring in Florida, South Dakota, New Hampshire, \nWashington State, Iowa, and Ohio. These are not fiction.\n  I urge my colleagues to do what is right for VA hospitals and the \nveterans served by them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time is left on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 14\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I do not see anybody on the other side \nwho is going to speak. Let me just reiterate for everyone here. What we \nare talking about is an amendment for veterans, to make sure they have \nthe health care and support they need when they come home from the war \nin Iraq and the war in Afghanistan.\n  What we have been very clear about is in every region across this \ncountry there is a debt and a shortfall. We have facilities that are \ndecaying, and no money is being put in to fix them. We have long \nwaiting lines. We have veterans in rural areas who are being told they \ncannot have health clinics. We are being told that veterans, the men \nand women who served us, have to travel over mountain passes and travel \nlong distances to get the care they need. Most of it is inaccessible.\n  We are telling veterans who live in urban areas that the long lines \nin which they are waiting have to be there. We are telling suburban \nparents if they send their young son or daughter off to war, we are not \ngoing to be there for them when they come home.\n  I believe this is a emergency. I have outlined it this morning. I \nhave outlined it again this afternoon. I heard from our colleagues on \nthe other side that the Veterans Affairs Secretary, Secretary \nNicholson, is saying he has the money he needs. He was on the job for 2 \nweeks when he said that. I invite the Secretary and any one of us to go \nout on the ground, go out to Michigan and Minnesota, go to Kentucky, go \nto Illinois, go to California, go to Texas, go to Idaho, go to any \nveterans facility and look and tell me there is not an emergency. Look \nin the eye of any VA doctor or nurse and tell them there is not an \nemergency. But more importantly, look in the eyes of the young men and \nwomen who served us.\n  I was in Iraq and Kuwait several weeks ago. I had to look in the eyes \nof 150 Guard and Reserve members who had just finished in Iraq for a \nyear. Their No. 1 concern is they are hearing the facilities will not \nbe available for them when they get home. Their No. 1 concern? Stress. \nA year on the ground in Iraq. They had heard from soldiers who had \nalready gone home about the troubles they had with migraines, post-\ntraumatic stress syndrome, reintegrating in the community. They want to \ncome home, and we know the support is not there, and we tell them that \nis not an emergency.\n  I find it outrageous that this body can send to war our sons and \ndaughters, husbands and wives, and say we will not be there for you \nwhen you come home; that we will tell them you will have to wait, your \nbudgets are not a priority, your issues are not a concern to this body. \nI cannot think of a more important issue, I cannot think of a more \nimportant emergency, and I cannot think of anywhere else we are going \nto be able to deal with this this year.\n  If we do not provide the funds on the emergency supplemental before \nus, we will be here a year from now with story after story of young men \nand women who served us and then came home and were told no. That is an \nemergency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we had a full debate of this issue. This \nis not the first time this issue has been presented to the Senate. As a \nmatter of fact, before this fiscal year began, 2005, there was a \nquestion about how much money would be needed by the Veterans' \nAdministration to provide health care benefits and other services to \nveterans.\n  The President had submitted a budget request for this year, but after \nhearings in our Appropriations Committee, the subcommittee recommended \nan increase over and above what the President had requested.\n  As we all know, there is a considerable time gap after the \nPresident's completion of his budget submission. The hearing process \ntakes place in Congress, a budget resolution is developed, and then the \nAppropriations Committee conducts hearings and reviews what the facts \nare and if there have been any changes in the situation that can be \nreflected in the recommendations made in the Appropriations Committee.\n  Last year, the Appropriations subcommittee recommended to the full \ncommittee an increase in funding over and above the request of the \nPresident by $1.2 billion--a substantial increase. That was approved.\n  In this fiscal year's budget which we are now talking about, the \nPresident has already received $1.2 billion that he did not request. As \nwe moved into the year, there have been suggestions that additional \nfunds might be needed. We are already, though, preparing for the next \nfiscal year, 2006. The other day when we had a budget resolution before \nthe Senate, this was again presented as an issue to the Senate. \nSenators offered an amendment and debated it, and we had a vote on that \nresolution. By a vote of 53 to 47, an amendment by the Senator from \nHawaii to add about $3 billion to the budget resolution was defeated by \nthe Senate. It was well debated. It was considered carefully. And here \nwe are again.\n  We have an emergency supplemental now on the floor of the Senate \ndealing with funds needed to successfully complete, we hope, operations \nin Iraq and Afghanistan at the soonest possible date so we can have a \nmore stable and peaceful situation, not only in that part of the world \nbut in the war against terror generally, to protect the security of \nAmerican citizens.\n  This supplemental is directed, in large part, to that concern and to \nthose needs--the needs of the Department of Defense and the Department \nof State for depleted accounts in programs under the jurisdiction of \nthat department.\n  There are some other accounts that are funded in this urgent \nsupplemental, but there are no funds requested by the administration \nfor the Veterans' Administration programs.\n  The other day there was a hearing on this subject. The Secretary, as \nthe distinguished Senator from Texas pointed out, was questioned about \nthe need for additional funds by the Veterans' Administration. The \nanswer was unequivocal. It was clear. It was precise. Then, to clarify \nthat, the Senator from Washington said that was weeks ago, that was \nearly, and all the needs weren't known then. Here is the letter, dated \nApril 5, 2005. This is what the Secretary of the Veterans' \nAdministration said in response to the suggestions being made by the \nproponent of this amendment:\n\n       I can assure you that VA does not need emergency \n     supplemental funds in FY 2005 to continue to provide the \n     timely quality service that is always our goal. We will, as \n     always continue to monitor workload and resources to be sure \n     we have a sustainable balance, but certainly for the \n     remainder of this year I do not foresee any challenges that \n     are not solvable within our own management decision \n     capability.\n\n  That is about as clear and persuasive a statement about the need for \nthe\n\n[[Page S3468]]\n\nfunds at this time, for the remainder of this fiscal year, as you could \npossibly ask for by the person who has the responsibility for carrying \nout these programs and administering these programs for the benefit of \nour Nation's veterans.\n  There is another point I am going to make before my time expires.\n  The Secretary testified not only were the funds sufficient for fiscal \nyear 2005 but that the financial plan is manageable. He said the \nDepartment is not in a crisis requiring emergency appropriations.\n  Then, on the point of the number of servicemen coming back to the \nStates from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the highest projection \nthat has been made, if one looks at the numbers of persons entering the \nVA system in any given 1 year, the highest projection might be 48,000.\n  To put that in perspective with respect to the entire system and the \nentire workload of the Veterans' Administration, returning service \nmembers from the Iraqi war entering the VA system will be less than 1 \npercent of the total VA population.\n  The Senator from Texas made a point that was very persuasive. I think \nit should be repeated; that is, most veterans who are coming back to \nthe States at this point and need medical care are still in the \nDepartment of Defense. They are at Walter Reed. They are at other \nhospitals that are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense. \nThey are not going to the veterans hospitals. People who are coming \nback from Iraq are a small percentage of the population, and they are \nnot as likely as older veterans to need services from the Veterans' \nAdministration. The older veterans in the system are a much larger \ngroup and require more appointments, medical care, and assistance \nmedications than the younger population coming into the system now.\n  For these reasons, I urge the Senate to reject the request of the \nSenators to open this emergency supplemental bill and add the \nadditional $1.9 billion that has been requested.\n  I am prepared to yield the remainder of our time. I think we talked \nabout the vote being scheduled for 3:30. As I understand, there is \nbefore the Chair a motion on the part of the Senator from Washington to \nwaive the Budget Act. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has moved to waive the point of \norder that was raised against her amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask for the yeas and nays on that motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have been ordered on that motion.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I yield the floor and I yield our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I understand the other side yielded this \ntime. Let me simply respond by saying we are talking about a \nsupplemental bill that talks about the cost of the war. Part of the \ncost of war is caring for the men and women when they return home. As \nPresident Lincoln said:\n\n       We all have an obligation to care for him who shall have \n     borne the battle and for his widow and for his orphan.\n\n  That is what this vote is about, whether we carry forward our \nobligations to care for those we sent to war.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote with us to override this motion that says \nthis is not an emergency so our veterans can receive the care they \ndeserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 46, nays 54, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 89 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--54\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez).

On this vote, the yeas are 46, the nays are \n54. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I request 15 minutes to speak on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the fiscal year \n2005 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill. I commend Senator \nCochran, the manager of this bill and the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, for the way he has put together this bill. \nHis leadership was critical in ensuring that provisions in this bill \nare truly emergencies and are vital to our troops in the field.\n\n[[Page S3469]]\n\n  I also acknowledge the work done by Senator Stevens, the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. Most of the funding in this \nbill comes from his subcommittee, and I know he has worked hard to \nensure every penny will be wisely spent.\n  Both Senator Cochran and Senator Stevens have also gone out of their \nway to assist me and Senator McConnell in tackling an important issue \nrelated to our nation's chemical weapons stockpile. I will discuss this \nissue in greater detail in a moment.\n  The bill before us includes critically-needed funding for our men and \nwomen in uniform. It also ensures that the operations against the \nglobal war on terror is not interrupted. It provides certain benefits \nfor our troops, including an increased death gratuity, life insurance \nextensions, and hazardous pay. I strongly support these provisions and \nbelieve they will greatly enhance the effectiveness of our military \nforces.\n  The bill also includes several provisions related to the Department \nof Defense chemical demilitarization program. These provisions seek to \nforce the Department of Defense to move forward with the design and \nconstruction of two chemical weapons destruction facilities at Pueblo, \nCO and Blue Grass, KY.\n  Since the program's inception, the Department of Defense management \nhas been dismal and ineffective. The program is behind schedule and \nover-budget. In 1986, Congress was told that the program was going to \nbe completed before 2007 at a cost of approximately $2.1 billion. And \nnow, we are told the program could possibly cost as much as $37 billion \nand be completed as late as 2030.\n  The Department of Defense has consistently failed to provide \nsufficient funding for this program, forcing those who run it to make \nprogrammatic decisions that pit demilitarization sites against each \nother.\n  The Department of Defense has failed to provide adequate program \nmanagement. It has repeatedly stopped and restarted design work and \noperations, adding huge start-up costs and considerable schedule \ndelays.\n  The department has failed effectively to communicate its intentions \nand plans to the States in which permitting is necessary, nor to local \ncommunities whose support is essential.\n  An example of these failures is the department's handling of the \ndestruction of the chemical weapons stockpile at the Pueblo Depot in \nColorado. In 2002, the department accelerated the destruction of the \nweapons at Pueblo with the goal of completing its work by the 2012 \nChemical Weapons Convention deadline.\n  However, in 2004, the department changed its mind. Without telling \nCongress, the State of Colorado, or the people in Pueblo, the \ndepartment unilaterally decided to cease all design work and assign the \nproject in Pueblo to in care-taker status for the next 6 years.\n  After six months of no activity, the Department of Defense changed \nits mind again. It ordered a study on whether the stockpile in Pueblo \nshould be relocated to an operational incineration site, even though \nsuch an option is illegal under current law and has already been \nstudied at least three times in the past.\n  A month after that, the department changed its mind again by ordering \nthe start of preparatory construction and the redesign of the facility.\n  Today, the future of the project still remains uncertain and judging \nby the department's past performance, it seems likely that the project \nwill be changed many more times.\n  I am frustrated, and the people of Colorado are frustrated. Try as we \nmight, we cannot seem to get straight answers from the department. One \nday I was told by department officials that the stockpile would not be \nrelocated outside of Colorado. The very next day, the department \nordered the study of transportation options.\n  In an Armed Services Committee hearing yesterday, the only answer we \ncould get out of department officials was that they needed to conduct \nmore studies on the technology and more studies on transportation \noptions. From my perspective, we can study this issue into eternity and \nnever get anything done. It is time to move forward with destroying \nthese weapons. It is time to eliminate the danger these weapons pose to \nthe local communities. And, it is time for the department to recognize \nthe necessity of complying with our international obligations.\n  I am very troubled by the Department of Defense's apparent \nwillingness to violate the Chemical Weapons Convention, a treaty this \nbody ratified. I believe the United States has a moral obligation to \ncomply with it. Our Nation's reputation and moral standing are at \nstake.\n  If we are not careful, we will find it impossible to hold others to \nthis treaty and to other treaties as well.\n  The department seems to be on a path towards blaming Congress for its \nfuture non-compliance. Yesterday, a DoD official actually told the \nArmed Services Committee that it would be the fault of Congress if the \ndepartment could not meet the treaty deadline. This official seems to \nbelieve that relocating the stockpiles in Pueblo and Kentucky to \noperational sites would solve the problem.\n  I strongly reject that line of thinking. Congress is not to blame for \nthe department's bungling of this program. The fact is that the \nCongress has been more than willing to provide the funds and political \nsupport to get this program done. Last year alone, the Congress added \n$50 million for the project at Pueblo. I am certain that if the \nDepartment of Defense requested additional funding for the overall \nprogram, Congress would be more than willing to support its request.\n  The fact of the matter is that the department has been trying to \ndestroy these weapons since 1986, nearly 20 years, and has spent \nbillions upon billion of taxpayer's hard-earned dollars. And yet we \nhave destroyed less than 40 percent of our Nation's stockpile, which is \nno where near the 100 percent requirement of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention.\n  Let us also be clear that Congress has been very up front about the \ntransport of chemical munitions across State lines. The law that \nprohibits this activity has been on the books since 1994. Nothing has \nchanged since then. In fact, such a proposal would be dead on arrival \nif the department ever offered it in this Congress.\n  Let there be no mistake about it: I will fight this proposal.\n  The department should heed the words of Congress and get on with the \nbusiness of destroying these weapons. Conducting more studies is a \nwaste of time and money. We need to move forward, and we need to move \nforward now.\n  I believe it is important at this point to mention I am not alone in \nthis fight. The senior Senator from Kentucky, Mitch McConnell has been \npushing the department to destroy our chemical weapons stockpile for \nnearly two decades. Over this time, he has led the fight in forcing the \ndepartment to work with State and local communities to get this program \noff the ground.\n  There is no doubt in Senator McConnell's mind or in my mind that the \ndepartment has been inconsistent and unreliable regarding this program. \nWe both strongly believe that it is past time for Congress to \nintervene.\n  That is why we worked with Senator Cochran and Senator Stevens to \ninclude four provisions related to the Chemical Demilitarization \nprogram in this bill. These provisions will require the department to \nstop dragging its feet and move forward with the design and \nconstruction of the chemical demilitarization facilities in Pueblo, CO, \nand Blue Grass, KY.\n  Specifically, the provisions in this bill will require the Department \nto do the following:\n  transfer within 30 days all previous funding appropriated for the \nPueblo and Blue Grass facilities to the program manager of the ACWA \nprogram;\n  require the Program Manager to spend at least $100 million within 120 \ndays;\n  prevent the department from using the funding appropriated for the \nPueblo and Blue Grass for any other purpose; and\n  prohibit the use of appropriated funding from any study pertaining to \nthe transportation of chemical weapons across state lines.\n  These provisions prevent the department from dragging its feet and \nrequiring more studies. The treaty deadline is fast approaching and \ncannot be ignored. The department must move quickly if we are to comply \nwith the treaty, and I assure you today that we intend to hold them to \nit.\n\n[[Page S3470]]\n\n  I thank the chair for the opportunity to speak on the supplemental \nappropriations bill. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and get \nthis funding to our troops as quickly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, there \nare no other amendments that I know of that will be offered this \nafternoon or this evening. There were two amendments that were offered \nearlier in the day which we set aside to dispose of the amendment of \nthe Senator from Washington. These are offered by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry, amendments numbered 333 and 334. It will \nbe the intention of the manager of the bill to move to table these \namendments when we convene tomorrow. We will be pleased to continue to \nset them aside and have them available for debate during the remainder \nof today's session. So if Senators want to speak on these amendments, \nthis is the time to do it. Tomorrow when we convene and go to the bill, \nit will be the intention to move to table these amendments if there is \nno further debate.\n  In the meantime, we encourage Senators to let the managers know of \ntheir amendments that need to be considered to the bill. We are \nprepared to move forward. We remind Senators that this is an emergency \nappropriations bill. These funds are needed so that the Departments of \nDefense and State can proceed with other agencies that are funded in \nthis bill to carry out their responsibilities.\n  We know that after we complete action on the bill here in the Senate, \nwe will have to confer with the House to work out differences between \nthe House-passed and Senate-passed bills. That will require some time \nas well.\n  This is a matter of some urgency. We encourage the Senate to continue \nto consider the bill and act expeditiously on amendments that may be \noffered so we can complete action on the bill and work with our \ncolleagues in the House to have a final bill presented to the President \nas soon as possible. We appreciate very much having the cooperation of \nall Senators in that regard.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \nbusiness be set aside and I be allowed to file an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 356\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mr. Allen, and Mr. Corzine, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 356.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I have offered this amendment before. It \nhas passed the Senate twice. For some reason, as soon as it passes the \nSenate and goes to a conference committee, it disappears, it dies. I \ndon't understand it. It seems that the Senate by overwhelming numbers \nsupports the concept of this amendment, but somewhere, either in the \nexecutive branch of this Government or in the House of Representatives, \nthere is opposition to this amendment.\n  When I explain the amendment and what it does, you may be as puzzled \nas I am. Here is what the amendment says in a few words: If you are a \nFederal employee who is activated to serve in either a Guard or Reserve \nunit, the Federal Government will make up the difference in pay while \nyou serve.\n  That is it. You understand, I am sure, as we all do, that we have \nthousands of men and women across America who are members of Guard and \nReserve units who are now being activated and deployed overseas for \nextended periods\n\n[[Page S3471]]\n\nof time, interrupting their daily lives and putting some hardship on \ntheir families and their businesses, but they serve their country. We \nfind that many employers have decided to do not only the right thing \nbut the patriotic thing and have said: We will stand behind our \nemployees. If they are going to serve America, we will make up any loss \nof pay which they experience during the period of their service \nactivation.\n  It is something we all applaud. In fact, the President has given \nspeeches about it. There are not too many Senators who have not given \nspeeches applauding those employers who stand behind these Guard \nfamilies and Reserve families.\n  It turns out, when we look at all the employers across America, there \nis one notable omission. The U.S. Government does not make up the \ndifference in pay between the guardsmen and reservists who are \nactivated. So you find many Federal employees going off to serve our \ncountry are serving next to someone from the private sector who has the \nhelping hand of their employer while those employees of our Federal \nGovernment are being disadvantaged.\n  America's Federal employees are a valuable asset to our Nation, not \njust in the public service they perform every day to keep America's \nGovernment going but today about 120,000 Federal employees serve \nAmerica as well in the National Guard or Reserve--120,000. Indeed, \nabout 17,000 have been mobilized and deployed overseas as I speak--\n17,000 Federal employees. Unfortunately, their employer, the U.S. \nFederal Government, lags behind leading businesses and States and local \ngovernments, which provide support to their workers who are activated. \nThe Federal Government does not.\n  The amendment I propose is an opportunity to correct this \nshortcoming, update the Federal Government's support for these workers, \nand keep pace with the high standards set by other employers. For many \nyears now every employer in America has had to consider how to respond \nto having workers activated in the Guard and Reserve. In times of \npeace, companies must accommodate staffing, schedule duties for the \nrequirement for workers to be sent for training or drills. The law \nrequires that they do this, and they follow the law.\n  In wartime, however, workers can be called away for duty for months, \nsometimes even years. It is a big challenge for employers.\n  How are they responding? What we have seen since 9/11 is that \nAmerica's business communities and State and local governments not only \nprovide the employment and reemployment protections required by law, \nbut many of them go above and beyond requirement and patriotically \nprovide even greater benefits and protections for their workers \nmobilized for duty in the Guard and Reserve. Many of these same \nbusinesses and State and local governments continue health insurance \nand fringe benefits for the families of those Guard and Reserve \nsoldiers who are overseas. Some provide continued full salary for a few \nmonths, and more and more employers make up the difference in lost pay \nthat the workers suffered during mobilization.\n  Covering the pay gap is an important benefit because some Reserve \ncomponent members suffer a loss of income during mobilization. A \nrecently released Department of Defense study in May of 2004 reveals \nthat 51 percent of the members of our National Guard and Reserve suffer \na loss of income when mobilized for long periods of active duty because \nmilitary pay is less than pay in their civilian jobs. The average \nreservist loses $368 a month. That calculates out to about $4,300 a \nyear in income. For many families, that $368 a month has a significant \nimpact. Not only must they deal with the absence of someone they love \nbut now on top of it must also tighten the family financial belt a \nnotch or two and endure a decline in perhaps their standard of living, \npressure on the family back home, and certainly more pressure on the \nsoldier who worries about them as they serve our country overseas.\n  While the average monthly income loss was $368, the DOD Status of \nForces Survey found that some reservists were losing a lot more. Eleven \npercent of all reservists report losing income of more than $2,500 a \nmonth, $30,000 a year for the year that they are activated and \ndeployed. That is a huge sacrifice to make in the service of your \ncountry on top of risking your life every single day.\n  The Department of Defense operates a program called Employer Support \nof the Guard and Reserve--ESGR for short. Its purpose is to help \nemployers understand and comply with the new law regarding protections \nfor members of the Reserve. The program highlights and recognizes those \nemployers who do more than the law requires, particularly those who are \nsupportive of the Guard and Reserve.\n  To publicize these outstanding employers, ESGR lists them on their \nWeb site. If you scroll down the Web site, you will see listed more \nthan 1,000 companies across America, nonprofit organizations, State and \nlocal governments, all of which stand behind their Guard and Reserve \nwhile the Federal Government does not. Of those that are listed, more \nthan 900 are saluted for providing pay differential. Think of it: 900 \ncompanies, 900 units of government that say, We will stand behind that \nsoldier, we will make up the difference in pay.\n  On the first page, you will see 3M, A.G. Edwards, Abbot Laboratories, \nADT Security Service, and Aetna. That is just the beginning. If you \nscroll down, you will see ICBM. I am proud to say you will see Sears & \nRoebuck from my State of Illinois, General Motors, United Parcel \nService, and Ford Motor Company. In my State of Illinois, not only \nSears but Boeing, State Farm Insurance, the State of Illinois, the city \nof Chicago, and many other Illinois companies, local governments, and \ninstitutions cover the pay differential for Reserve and Guard members \ncalled to active duty.\n\n  More and more American employers are providing a pay differential \nbenefit to their workers who are mobilized for active duty. The number \nof ``outstanding employers'' recognized on the ESGR Web site for \nproviding pay differential has been steadily growing. Even as the war \ngoes on, more and more companies are stepping up for their people. They \nare stepping up in the private sector for their employees. How can we \nin the Federal Government do anything less? While the major employers \nin America are rushing to support the guardsmen and reservists, our \nFederal Government has not done so.\n  In a recently released DOD survey, they asked Reserve component \nmembers what factors they took into consideration before they decided \nto leave the National Guard and Reserve.\n  Let me show you that list. First, as I mentioned earlier, 51 percent \nof those in the Reserve who are activated lose income when they are \nmobilized, and 11 percent lose more than $2,500 per month.\n  I also mentioned this Web site. The employer-supported Guard and \nReserve Web site based out of Arlington, VA, has a long list of over \n1,000 employers who helped their activated Guard and soldiers, and 900 \nof them have provided pay differential for indefinite periods of time, \nsome for 12 months and some for 6 months. But they are standing behind \ntheir Guard and Reserve units.\n  When you take a look at the number of outstanding employers who are \nmaking a greater sacrifice for their members of Guard and Reserve \nunits, look at what happened since October of 2003. The number of \nemployers making the pay differential for their employees called to \nReserve duty has been increasing. But the U.S. Government is still not \none of them. They ask the members of the Reserve and Guard: Why didn't \nyou re-up, why didn't you reenlist? Here are the reasons they gave in a \nsurvey: 95 percent said it was too great a family burden, 91 percent \nsaid too many activations and deployments, 90 percent said activations-\ndeployments are too long, and 78 percent said income lost.\n  This is a factor in retention and recruitment. It is a factor in the \nlifestyles of these families of Guard and Reserve unit members.\n  How can we come before this Congress asking for additional funds for \nthe soldiers overseas and overlook the obvious? The Federal Government \nis not providing its share of helping these same soldiers. How can we \nthrow bouquets, as we should, to all of these other employers who meet \ntheir responsibility and fail to meet our own?\n  With recruiting numbers falling short in virtually every branch of \nservice, we need to do everything we can to\n\n[[Page S3472]]\n\nlessen the burden. By ensuring Federal employees, if they are \nmobilized, that their families will not have to endure loss of income, \nwe can help reduce one of the major factors that drive people away from \nthe Guard and Reserve.\n  This measure is not only good employee support, it is not only in \nkeeping with the standards established by other leading employers, it \nis not only the patriotic thing to do, it is prudent management of our \nReserve component forces. Reserve component soldiers face different \nfamily and professional situations than Active-Duty soldiers. They must \nnot only perform military duties in addition to their civilian career, \nthey have to shift back and forth between these two responsibilities.\n  Additionally, these Reserve component soldiers bring to their \nmilitary service something special: all of their accumulated civilian \ntime and civilian career experience.\n  In Iraq, thanks to Guard and Reserve forces, we have experienced \nteachers, construction supervisors, civil administrators, engineers, \nprofessionals over a wide range of skills, skills particularly helpful \nin rebuilding that ravaged nation. This derives from the unique nature \nof the Reserve component service and its value to the nation we must \nprotect.\n  This provision has already passed the Senate twice. In October 2003, \nit was agreed to by vote of 96 to 3 as an amendment to the supplemental \nfor fiscal year 2004. In June of 2004, it was agreed to by a voice vote \nas an amendment to the national defense authorization bill. On both \noccasions, I watched as this measure went into the bipartisan \nconference committee and disappeared. Apparently someone is opposed to \nthe Federal Government making up the difference in pay for activated \nGuard and Reserve soldiers. The same Government that is praising \nbusinesses for doing this is deep-sixing this provision when it comes \ntime to consider it in the conference committees.\n  I have just been handed a letter from the Reserve Officers \nAssociation of the United States. I am happy to report it to my \ncolleagues in the Senate.\n\n       The Reserve Officers Association, representing 75,000 \n     Reserve component members, supports your amendment to the \n     emergency supplemental appropriation to provide an income \n     offset for mobilized Federal employees.\n\n  I might add that it goes on to quote an Army Times article dated \nMarch 7, 2005, entitled ``Compensating for lost pay a bad idea, reserve \nhead says.'' It inferred in this article that a Reserve pay \ndifferential would be unfair to Active-Duty troops.\n  This retired Major General Mcintosh goes on to say:\n\n       It is a shame that it is considered OK for Reservists to \n     accept year-after-year pay losses during mobilization on top \n     of the losses from missed promotions, missed contributions to \n     a retirement account, missed incremental pay increases with \n     their civilian job.\n       Helping to maintain the financial health of our military \n     positively affects everyone by ensuring a strong economic \n     position for the country.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                      Reserve Officers Association\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 12, 2005.\n\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: The Reserve Officers Association, \n     representing 75,000 Reserve Component members, supports your \n     amendment to the emergency supplemental appropriation, SR \n     109-052, to provide an income offset for mobilized federal \n     employees.\n       The Guard and Reserve face financial challenges whenever \n     they are mobilized and ROA continues to hear stories of lost \n     businesses, increasing credit card debt, and families forced \n     to sell their homes. Many employees pay the difference \n     between the civilian and military salary for mobilized \n     Reservists; yet one of the largest employers, the federal \n     government, does not.\n       In the Army Times Article, ``Compensating for lost pay a \n     bad idea, reserve head says'', dated March 7, 2005, it was \n     inferred a reserve pay differential would be unfair to \n     active-duty troops. It is a shame that it is considered okay \n     for Reservists to accept year-after-year of pay losses during \n     mobilization on top of the losses from missed promotions, \n     missed contributions to a retirement account, missed \n     incremental pay increases with their civilian job.\n       Helping to maintain the financial health of our military, \n     positively affects everyone by ensuring a strong economic \n     position for the country. Congressional support for our \n     nation's military men and women in the Guard and Reserve is \n     and always will be appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Robert A. McIntosh,\n\n                                       Major General (Ret), USAFR,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. These folks who \npassed this amendment twice recognized reality.\n  Since the end of the Cold War, employment of our Reserve Forces has \nshifted profoundly from being primarily an expansion force to augment \nActive Forces during major war to the situation we face today where the \nDepartment of Defense acknowledges that no significant operation can be \nundertaken without the Guard and Reserve. Today, more than 40 percent \nof the forces fighting the global war on terrorism are members of our \nGuard and Reserve. Our part-time warriors have become full-time \nprotectors of freedom.\n  The Federal Government is the Nation's largest employer. We must set \nan example. We must show the initiative. We must stand behind the men \nand women of the Federal workforce who are risking their lives for us \noverseas. Similar legislation has been enacted in at least 23 other \nStates.\n  The Presiding Officer and I had a rare opportunity not long ago. We \nflew into Baghdad 2 or 3 weeks ago. It was a harrowing trip in the back \nof a C-130. We were strapped into our combat armor, body armor, with \nhelmets on our head, in the C-130 as it made a corkscrew landing into \nBaghdad. We shared a wonderful, unforgettable opportunity to meet not \nonly the leadership in the Green Zone but to meet with the marines and \nsoldiers who are there risking their lives.\n  I sat down across the table from those three marines, recalled the \nguard unit I met the night before, and I thought to myself, we owe them \nsomething, not simply thanks but something significant and something \ntangible.\n  For those who work in the Federal workforce, this is something \ntangible we can do. We can make up the difference in lost pay. We can \nsay to them, worry about coming home safely, but don't worry about \nwhether your family is going to make the mortgage payment and pay the \nutility bills and keep things together while you are overseas.\n  That is what this amendment is all about. We express our gratitude in \nmany different ways for the men and women in uniform, but this \namendment which I have offered with Senator Mikulski, Senator Allen, \nand Senator Corzine, says to my colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, let \nus offer to these men and women in uniform not only our thanks and our \npraise but the financial support they need to give them peace of mind.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the pending Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami \nRelief for 2005, H.R. 1268, as reported by the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations, provides a net $80.582 billion in budget authority and \n$32.790 billion in outlays in fiscal year 2005. Of this amount, $74.763 \nbillion is for defense activities, and the balance of $5.819 billion is \nfor nondefense activities.\n  This bill is $1.299 billion less than the President's request in \nbudget authority, but is $0.699 billion more in outlays. Compared to \nthe House-passed bill, the Senate-reported version is $0.759 billion \nless in budget authority, but is $0.608 billion more in outlays.\n  Nearly every individual appropriation item in the bill is designated \nas an emergency. In total, the bill designates $81.592 billion in \nbudget authority as an emergency, the outlays flowing from that budget \nauthority also have the emergency designation; in fiscal year 2005, the \nassociated outlays are estimated to be $32.790 billion. The bill \nincludes rescission totaling $1.010 billion in budget authority only.\n  For the information of my colleagues, I would like to briefly \nsummarize where the Senate stands in relation to budgetary enforcement \nof appropriation bills in 2005. Although the conference report on the \n2005 budget resolution was not adopted by both the House and Senate, \nenactment of the 2005 Defense Appropriations bill, P.L. 108-287, \nsection 14007, did give effect to some of the provisions in that \nresolution, including a 302(a) allocation to\n\n[[Page S3473]]\n\nthe Appropriations Committee and sections 402 and 403 of the 2005 \nbudget resolution relating to emergency legislation and overseas \ncontingency operations.\n  First, any appropriation for 2005 that is not designated as an \nemergency or as an overseas contingency would be subject to a 302(f) \npoint of order because appropriations enacted to date have already \nexceeded the allocation provided for 2005.\n  Second, of the total amount designated as an emergency in H.R. 1268, \n$74.763 billion in budget authority is designated as an emergency for \ndefense activities, which is exempt from the emergency designation \npoint of order. Section 403 of the 2005 budget resolution provided that \n$50 billion was assumed in the resolution for 2005 appropriations for \noverseas contingency operations, which would not even require an \nemergency designation. The same law that gave effect to sections 402 \nand 403 of the 2005 budget resolution also provided $25 billion for \noverseas contingency operations that were designated an emergency, but \nthe funds were provided in 2004. One way to think about the $74.763 \nbillion in emergency defense funds provided in this bill is that it \nexceeds by almost $25 billion in the amount contemplated for overseas \ncontingency operations for fiscal year 2005 in the 2005 budget \nresolution.\n  Third, the remaining amount that is designated as an emergency in \nH.R. 1268--$6.829 billion--is all for nondefense activities. As a \nresult, any member of the Senate may use the emergency designation \npoint of order under section 402 of the 2005 budget resolution to \nquestion, or strike, the emergency designation attached to each \nindividual nondefense appropriation item in the bill or an amendment \nthereto. Such a point of order can be waived with 60 votes. If the \npoint of order is not waived, the designation would be struck from the \nbill or amendment, leaving only the appropriation, which, absent its \nemergency designation, which would have prevented the item from \n``counting'' for budget enforcement purposes, would then count against \nthe committee's allocation, meaning a 302(f) point of order would lie \nagainst the bill or amendment.\n  May I also point out to my colleagues that the emergency designation \npoint of order requires that if ``a provision of legislation is \ndesignated as an emergency requirement . . . the committee report and \nany joint explanatory statement of managers accompanying that \nlegislation shall include an explanation of the manner in which the \nprovision meets the criteria,'' which are defined as follows: ``Any \nsuch provision is an emergency requirement if the underlying situation \nposes a threat to life, property, or national security and is--(I) \nsudden, quickly coming into being, and not building up over time; (II) \nan urgent, pressing, and compelling need requiring immediate action; \n(III) . . . unforeseen, unpredictable, and unanticipated; and (IV) not \npermanent, temporary in nature'' with the proviso that an ``emergency \nthat is part of an aggregate level of anticipated emergencies, \nparticularly when normally estimated in advance, is not unforeseen.'' I \nnote that the committee report does not include any discussion of how \neach individual item in this bill that is designated as an emergency \nmeets all of these criteria.\n  This supplemental appropriations bill has been requested by the \nPresident, and the Congress has responded.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss last \nWednesday's vote against tabling the Schumer amendment. The Schumer \namendment would call on China to move toward a flexible rate or face \ncorrective tariffs on their exports to the United States. Passing the \namendment would be a responsible way for the Senate to address the \nsignificant problems caused by China fixing the exchange rate of its \ncurrency, known as the renminbi or yuan, to the United States dollar.\n  I have been concerned about China's trade policies for some time. I \nam particularly concerned about the undervaluation of the Chinese \ncurrency caused by China's currency peg. Presently, the yuan is \nundervalued between 15 and 40 percent. This systematic undervaluation \nof China's currency makes China's exports less expensive and puts \nUnited States workers at a severe disadvantage. As a result, the United \nStates has lost thousands of manufacturing jobs due to the unfair \ncompetition with China's exports with prices that are artificially low \non account of the undervaluation of the yuan. This is both unfair and \nit is unacceptable.\n  China's undervalued currency also harms China's economy. The Chinese \npeople pay much higher prices for their imports and China is presently \nforced to keep its interest rates artificially low to support the \ncurrency peg, which is causing inefficient investment and excessive \nbank lending in China. Moreover, this undervaluation of the Chinese \ncurrency is fueling the dramatic rise of the United States trade \ndeficit with China and distorting trade relationships around the globe.\n  Currently, we have a $162 billion trade deficit with China, the \nlargest that we have with any country in the world. Accordingly, \nsupporting efforts to get China to move forward toward a flexible \nexchange rate is consistent with supporting a more open and efficient \nglobal marketplace.\n  I was recently in China and had the opportunity to meet with Premier \nWen Jiabao, member of the Politburo Standing Committee and the Chinese \nCommunist Party's Central Committee. I made precisely these points to \nhim: That it is in China's best interest to move toward a flexible \nexchange rate, and that the Chinese currency peg benefits neither China \nnor the United States. I urged him to support moving China toward a \nflexible exchange rate.\n  One of the primary arguments Chinese officials made to defend China's \ncurrency peg is the banking system is not sufficiently developed for a \nflexible exchange rate, an argument that Secretary of the Treasury John \nSnow makes on occasion when he gives reasons why he is not pushing them \nharder for them to stop fixing their currency.\n  I have an article from The Economist that helps explain in detail why \nexchange rate flexibility is in China's best interest, along with the \nbest interest of the United States. The title of the article from March \n19, 2005 is: ``China Ought to Allow More Flexibility in Exchange Rate, \nSooner Rather Than Later.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S3474]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Economist, Mar. 19, 2005]\n\n                Economics Focus--Putting Things in Order\n\n\n  china ought to allow more flexibility in its exchange rate, sooner \n                           rather than later\n\n       The Chinese government says that it intends, eventually, to \n     make its exchange rate more flexible and to liberalise \n     capital controls. In the past year or so, it has already \n     eased some controls on capital outflows and officials have \n     said recently that they will open the capital account further \n     this year. On the exchange rate, much less has been done. The \n     yuan has been pegged to the dollar for a decade; and the \n     government is loath to change much until the country's \n     banking system is in healthier shape: this week the prime \n     minister, Wen Jiabao, said that a shift would be risky. But \n     is China putting the cart before the horse? Other countries' \n     experience suggests that it is, and that it is better to \n     loosen the exchange rate before, not after, freeing capital \n     flows.\n       Most commentary on the Chinese yuan tends to focus on the \n     extent to which it is undervalued. It has been pegged to the \n     dollar for a decade, and there is a widespread belief that it \n     is unfairly cheap. In fact, this is not clear-cut. For \n     instance, the increase in China's official reserves is often \n     held up as evidence that the yuan is undervalued. Yet this \n     largely reflects speculative capital inflows lured by the \n     expectation of a currency revaluation. Such inflows could \n     easily be reversed. Given the huge uncertainty about the \n     yuan's correct level, it makes more sense for China to make \n     its currency more flexible than to repeg it at a higher rate. \n     Greater flexibility would be in China's interest: it would \n     afford the country more independence in monetary policy and a \n     buffer against external shocks. By fixing the yuan to the \n     dollar, China has been forced to hold interest rates lower \n     than is prudent, leading to inefficient investment and \n     excessive bank lending.\n       The problem is that Chinese officials, along with many \n     foreign commentators, tend to confuse exchange-rate \n     flexibility and capital-account liberalisation. A commonly \n     heard argument is that China cannot let its exchange rate \n     move more freely before it has fixed its dodgy banking \n     system, because that could encourage a large outflow of \n     capital. A recent paper* by Eswar Prasad, Thomas Rumbaugh and \n     Qing Wang, all of the International Monetary Fund, argues \n     that, on the contrary, greater exchange-rate flexibility is a \n     prerequisite for capital-account liberalisation.\n       Flexibility does not necessarily mean a free float. \n     Initially, China could allow the yuan to move within a wider \n     band, or peg it to a basket of currencies rather than the \n     dollar alone. The authors first knock on the head the notion \n     that the banking system must be cleaned up before allowing \n     the exchange rate to move. Although financial reform is \n     certainly essential before scrapping capital controls, the \n     authors argue that with existing controls in place the \n     banking system is unlikely to come under much pressure simply \n     as a result of exchange-rate flexibility. Banks' exposure to \n     currency risks is currently low and flexibility alone is \n     unlikely to cause Chinese residents to withdraw their \n     deposits or provide channels for them to send their money \n     abroad.\n       The authors argue that it is also not necessary to open the \n     capital account to create a proper foreign-exchange market. \n     Because China exports and imports a lot, with few \n     restrictions on currency convertibility for such \n     transactions, it can still develop a deep, well-functioning \n     market without a fully open capital account. A more flexible \n     currency would itself assist the development of such a \n     market. For example, firms would have more incentive to hedge \n     foreign-exchange risks, encouraging the development of \n     suitable instruments. The experience of greater exchange-rate \n     flexibility would also help the economy to prepare for a full \n     opening of the capital account. While capital controls \n     shielded the economy from volatile flows, China would have \n     time for reforms to strengthen the banking system.\n       China instead seems intent on relaxing capital controls \n     before setting its exchange rate free. This ignores the \n     history of the past decade or so: the combination of fixed \n     exchange rates and open capital accounts has caused financial \n     crises in many emerging economies, especially when financial \n     systems are fragile. China would therefore be wise to move \n     cautiously in liberalising its capital account, but should \n     move more rapidly towards greater exchange-rate flexibility.\n\n\n                             yuan at a time\n\n       The Chinese have tried to offset the recent upward pressure \n     on the yuan by easing controls on capital outflows, for \n     instance by allowing firms to invest abroad. While this is in \n     line with the eventual objective of full capital-account \n     liberalisation, it runs the risk of getting reforms in the \n     wrong order. An easing of controls on outflows may even be \n     counterproductive if it stimulates larger inflows. By making \n     it easier to take money out of the country, investors may be \n     enticed to bring more in.\n       Capital controls are not watertight. So although China will \n     continue to be protected from international flows, its \n     controls can be evaded through the under- or over-invoicing \n     of trade. Multinationals can also use transfer prices (the \n     prices at which internal transactions are accounted for) to \n     dodge the rules. Despite extensive controls, a lot of capital \n     left China during the Asian crisis in the late 1990s; \n     recently, lots of short-term money has flowed in. Controls \n     are likely to become even more porous as China becomes more \n     integrated into the global economy. Thus, waiting for \n     speculative and other inflows to ease before changing the \n     exchange-rate regime might not be a fruitful strategy.\n       China ought to move to a flexible exchange rate soon, while \n     its capital controls still work. Experience also suggests \n     that it is best to loosen the reins on a currency when growth \n     is strong and the external account is in surplus. China \n     should take advantage of today's opportunity rather than \n     being forced into change at a much less convenient time.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I also urge my colleagues to read a paper by the staff \nof the International Monetary Fund entitled ``Putting the Cart Before \nthe Horse: Capital Account Liberalization and Exchange Rate Flexibility \nin China.'' That is a January publication by the IMF. I would have \nasked it be printed in the Record, but it is 30 pages long and I do not \nwant to burden the Congressional Record with 30 pages. If my colleagues \nare interested in getting a copy of that article, I would be more than \nhappy to supply it.\n  These papers show how exchange rate flexibility will facilitate \neconomic development in China and why China does not have to wait until \nits banking system is more fully developed to move toward a flexible \nexchange rate.\n  Moreover, they note that China does not need to immediately float its \ncurrency to remedy the problems caused by an undervalued currency. All \nChina needs to do is take steps in that direction, such as adopting a \nwider exchange rate ban or pegging the exchange rate to a basket of \ncurrencies instead of the dollar alone, for example, a basket of \ncurrencies in the ASEAN countries, including Japan. Either of these \npolicies would likely cause an upward revaluation of the yuan. \nUnfortunately, the Bush administration has refused meaningful action to \nget China to move toward a flexible exchange rate.\n  Last year--I remember it well--on September 8--that happens to be my \nwedding anniversary--four of our leaders in this country summarily said \nthere is no problem in terms of the exchange rate and they refused to \ngo forward with something called a 301 investigation. The 301 \ninvestigation is allowable under the WTO. That is the way you bring \ninto question whether somebody is following the rules. They said, no, \nwe are not going to do it. Imagine what kind of a message that sent to \nthe leaders of the Chinese Government, that we were not even willing to \nlook at a 301 investigation. That was a mistake.\n  The United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a \nbipartisan commission established by Congress to examine China's trade \npolicies, has concluded that China's exchange rate policy violates both \nits International Monetary Fund and World Trade obligations. That was a \nbipartisan commission that came together and issued this report. The \ncommission said China is intentionally manipulating its currency for \ntrade advantage in violation of its trading agreements. Yet the \nadministration refuses to act. Unless the United States exerts direct \npressure on China, however, it is unlikely that China will address the \nundervaluation of its currency. When I asked the question of Premier \nWen, he said, We know there is a problem, but we are not sure when we \nwill do it.\n  I can say they will not do it unless we continue to put pressure on \nthem to do it and convince them that, again, it is not only in our best \ninterest but their best interest if they want to be a player in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  That is why Wednesday's vote was important. It showed the Senate is \nwilling to take matters into its own hands and take effective steps to \naddress the serious problem if the administration continues to refuse \nto do so. No one wants to see tariffs imposed on Chinese exports, but \nthe United States needs to take action to address China's unfair \nexchange rate policy. I hope Wednesday's vote will motivate the \nadministration to do more to get China to address the serious market \ndistortions caused by the undervaluation of China's currency.\n  I believe in fair trade and improving our trading relationship with \nChina. I was one of the leaders in the Senate to\n\n[[Page S3475]]\n\napprove normal trade relations with China. I wrote articles in Ohio \nmagazines. In fact, I gave a copy of an article to Premier Wen to prove \nto him I am not a protectionist, I am a free trader.\n  But I also believe in fair trade. It represents a huge potential \nmarket for our exports. If we want to have trade with China, though, \nChina must be a better trading partner, starting with its exchange rate \npolicies. Furthermore, if we want to have a free and fair global \ntrading system, China must take actions to move toward a flexible \nexchange rate. I, therefore, believe Wednesday's vote was a responsible \nstep aimed at advancing global trade and, in particular, America's \nlong-term trading relationship with China.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, as you know, there was an agreement \nmade that it would be pulled down from the foreign relations \nauthorization bill, and this is going to be considered again. There is \nan agreement, in the form of a UC, that we will be bringing it up \nagain. I hope before the Senate considers voting on that amendment with \nan up-or-down vote the administration will get the message that they \nhave to do something to show a little bit of spirit and indicate to us \nthat they understand and know that the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives are serious about moving forward to deal with this \nproblem.\n  I also think the vote on this particular amendment sends a strong \nsignal, a signal to Premier Wen and to President Hu that we are \nconcerned about this issue. I know they are concerned about jobs. We \nare concerned about jobs. They have to understand that. I am hoping \ninstead of the administration looking at this as some kind of a \nnegative action on the part of the Senate, that they will see that we \nare helping them communicate the message to the people over there that \nwe are serious about a problem.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss).

Mr. President, today I continue my series of talks on the \nfour pillars of climate alarmism. Last week I showed the first pillar, \nthe 2001 climate change report by the National Academy of Sciences. It \nwas really a farce, and we documented it very well. The same is true of \nthe 2001 report of the IPCC. That is the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change. It supposedly provides irrefutable evidence of the \nglobal warming consensus. Simply put, it does not, as my speech today \nwill demonstrate.\n  The media greeted the release of the IPCC's Third Assessment Report \nwith the predictable hysteria with which they normally respond to \nthings such as this. From the Independent newspaper of London:\n\n       In a report published today by the United Nations \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), hundreds of \n     the world's leading scientists give their unqualified support \n     to the view that global warming is real and that the release \n     of manmade greenhouse gases is largely responsible.\n\n  It continues:\n\n       The latest three-volume report, amounting to 2,600 pages of \n     detailed analysis, leaves the reader in little doubt that the \n     scientific uncertainties of the previous decade are being \n     resolved in favor of an emerging, and increasingly \n     pessimistic consensus.\n\n  The preceding quotes, and many that followed in the Independent's \nreport, came from the Third Assessment's ``Summary for Policymakers.'' \nIn fact, the media based much, if not all, of its reporting on the \nsummary itself. It did this even though in some respects the summary \ndistorted the actual context of the full report.\n  The National Academy of Sciences, in its 2001 report, criticized both \nhow the summary was written and how the media portrayed it, as in this \nchart No. 1:\n\n       The IPCC Summary for Policymakers could give an impression \n     that the science of global warming is settled, even though \n     many uncertainties still remain.\n\n  This clearly contradicts the claim of the Independent that there is \nlittle doubt that the scientific uncertainties in the previous decade \nare settled.\n  Another claim the media featured prominently was that temperature \nincreases over the last century are unprecedented, at least when \nconsidered on a time scale of the last 1,000 years. According to the \nIPCC, the 1990s were the warmest decade on record, and 1998 was the \nwarmest year since temperature records began in 1861. The basis for \nthis claim is a so-called hockey stick graph, shown in chart No. 2. \nThis is an interesting one because this plots out the temperatures over \na period of time and then shows the blade, when it gets to be the 19th \ncentury, coming up.\n  The graph was constructed by Dr. Michael Mann of the University of \nVirginia and his colleagues using a combination of proxy data and \nmodern temperature records. The hockey stick curve showed a gradual \ncooling period around 1400 A.D., which is the hockey stick handle--that \nis the horizontal line--then a sharp warming starting about 1900, the \nhockey stick blade. Its release was revolutionary, overturning \nwidespread evidence adduced over many years confirming significant \nnational variability long before the advent of SUVs. The IPCC was so \nimpressed that the hockey stick was featured prominently in its Third \nAssessment Report of 2001.\n  As Dr. Roy Spencer, the principal research scientist at the \nUniversity of Alabama, noted:\n\n       This was taken as proof that the major climate event of the \n     last 1,000 years was the influence of humans in the 20th \n     century. One of its authors, Dr. Michael Mann, confidently \n     declared in 2003 that the hockey stick ``is the indisputable \n     consensus of the community of scientists actively involved in \n     the research of climate variability and its causes.''\n\n  The hockey stick caused quite a stir, not just in the scientific \ncommunity but also in the world of politics. It galvanized alarmists in \ntheir push for Kyoto. It is supposedly ironclad proof that manmade \ngreenhouse gas emissions are warming the planet at an unsustainable \ndegree. But here again, one of the essential pillars of the alarmists \nappears to be crumbling.\n  Two Canadian researchers have produced the most devastating evidence \nto date that the hockey stick is bad science. Before I describe their \nwork, I want to make a prediction. The alarmists will cry foul, saying \nthis critique is part of an industry conspiracy. And true to form, they \nwill avoid discussion of the substance and engage in personal attacks. \nThat is because one of the researchers, Stephen McIntyre, is a mineral \nexploration consultant. Dr. Mann already has accused them of having a \nconflict of interest. This is nonsense.\n  First, Stephen McIntyre and his colleague, Ross McKitrick, an \neconomist with Canada's University of Guelph, received no outside \nfunding for their work. They are both very well recognized professional \npeople. Second, they published their peer-reviewed critique in \ngeophysical research letters. This is no organ of big oil, but an \neminent scientific journal, the same journal, in fact, which published \nthe version of Dr. Mann's hockey stick that appeared in the IPCC's \nThird Assessment Report. Apparently the journal's editor didn't see \nmuch evidence of bias. The remarks of one editor are worth quoting in \nfull:\n\n       S. McIntyre and R. McKitrick have written a remarkable \n     paper on a subject of great importance. What makes the paper \n     significant is that they show that one of the most widely \n     known results of climate analysis, the ``hockey stick'' \n     diagram of Mann [and company], was based on a mistake in the \n     application of a mathematical technique known as principle \n     component analysis.\n\n  Further, he said:\n\n       I have looked carefully at the McIntyre and McKitrick \n     analysis, and I am convinced that their work is correct.\n\n  What did McKitrick and McIntyre find? In essence, they discovered \nthat Dr. Mann misused an established statistical method called \nprincipal components analysis, PCA. As they explained, Mann created a \nprogram that ``effectively mines a data set for hockey stick \npatterns.'' In other words, no matter what kind of data one uses, even \nif it is random and totally meaningless, the Mann method always \nproduces a hockey stick. After conducting\n\n[[Page S3476]]\n\nsome 10,000 data simulations, the result was nearly always the same. \n``In over 99 percent of cases,'' McIntyre and McKitrick wrote, ``it \nproduced a hockey stick shaped PCI series.'' Statistician Francis \nZwiers of Environment Canada, a government agency, says he agrees that \nDr. Mann's statistical method ``preferentially produces hockey sticks \nwhen there are none in the data.'' Even to a non-statistician, this \nlooks extremely troubling.\n  But that statistical error is just the beginning. On a public web \nsite where Dr. Mann filed data, McIntyre and McKitrick discovered an \nintriguing folder titled ``BACKTO_1400-CENSORED.'' What McIntyre and \nMcKitrick found in the folder was disturbing: Mann's hockey stick blade \nwas based on a certain type of tree--a bristlecone pine--that, in \neffect, helped to manufacture the hockey stick.\n  Remember, the hockey stick shows a relatively stable climate over 900 \nyears, and then a dramatic spike in temperature about 1900, the \ninference being that man-made emissions are the cause of rising \ntemperatures. So why is the bristlecone pine important? That \nbristlecone experienced a growth pulse in the Western United States in \nthe late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, this growth pulse, as \nthe specialist literature has confirmed, was not attributed to \ntemperature. So using those pines, and only those pines, as a proxy for \ntemperature during this period is questionable at best. Even Mann's co-\nauthor has stated that the bristlecone growth pulse is a ``mystery.''\n  Because of these obvious problems, McIntyre and McKitrick \nappropriately excluded the bristlecone data from their calculations. \nWhat did they find? Not the Mann hockey stick, to be sure, but a \nconfirmation of the Medieval Warm Period, which Mann's work had erased.\n  This is very interesting because the chart will show, if you would \ninclude the calculation--what we refer to as the Medieval Warm Period \nwhich, as everybody now understands, is a reality--then temperatures at \nthat time exceeded the temperatures in the blade of the hockey stick. \nIn fact, when I was over in Milan, Italy, at one of the big meetings, I \npointed this out as evidence it was done, and done intentionally. Why \nwould he start with the year when you have a level line going for 900 \nyears and totally ignore the Medieval Warming Period, at which time the \ntemperatures of the Earth exceeded the temperatures in this century?\n  As the CENSORED folder revealed, Mann and his colleagues never \nreported results obtained from calculations that excluded the \nbristlecone data. This appears to be a case of selectively using data--\nthat is, if you don't like the result, remove the offending data until \nyou get the answer you want. As McIntyre and McKitrick explained, \n``Imagine the irony of this discovery . . . Mann accused us of \nselectively deleting North American proxy series. Now it appeared that \nhe had results that were exactly the same as ours, stuffed away in a \nfolder labeled CENSORED.''\n  McIntyre and McKitrick believe there are additional errors in the \nMann hockey stick. To confirm their suspicion, they need additional \ndata from Dr. Mann, including the computer code he used to generate the \ngraph. But Dr. Mann refuses to supply it. As he told the Wall Street \nJournal, ``Giving them the algorithm would be giving in to the \nintimidation tactics that these people are engaged in.''\n  What we are talking about is he refused to give him the necessary \ncomputerized data to come to the conclusion. There is no way of \nanalyzing it.\n  Who are ``these people''? And what ``intimidation tactics''? Mr. \nMcIntyre and Mr. McKitrick are trying to find the truth. What is Dr. \nMann trying to hide?\n  For many scientists, McIntyre and McKitrick's work is earth-\nshattering. For example, Professor Richard Muller of the University of \nCalifornia at Berkeley recently wrote in the MIT Technology Review that \nMcIntyre and McKitrick's findings ``hit me like a bombshell, and I \nsuspect it is having the same effect on many others. Suddenly the \nhockey stick, the poster-child of the global warming community, turns \nout to be an artifact of poor mathematics.'' Dr. Rob van Dorland, of \nthe Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, and an IPCC lead \nauthor, said, ``The IPCC made a mistake by only including Mann's \nreconstruction and not those of other researchers.'' He concluded that \nunless the error is corrected, it will ``seriously damage the work of \nthe IPCC.''\n  Or consider Dr. Hans von Storch, an IPCC contributing author and \ninternationally renowned expert in climate statistics at Germany's \nCenter for Coastal Research, who said McIntyre and McKitrick's work is \n``entirely valid.'' In an interview last October with the German \nNewspaper Der Spiegel, Dr. von Storch said the Mann hockey stick \n``contains assumptions that are not permissible. Methodologically it is \nwrong: rubbish.'' He stressed that, ``it remains important for science \nto point out the erroneous nature of the Mann curve. In recent years it \nhas been elevated to the status of truth by the U.N. appointed science \nbody, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC. This \nhandicapped all that research which strives to make a realistic \ndistinction between human influences and climate and natural \nvariability.''\n  If McIntyre and McKitrick's work isn't convincing enough, consider \nthe recent paper published in the February 10 issue of Nature. The \npaper, authored by a group of Swedish climate researchers, once again \nundercuts the scientific credibility of the Mann hockey stick. The \npress release for the study by the Swedish Research Council says, ``A \nnew study of climate in the Northern Hemisphere for the past 2000 years \nshows that natural climate change may be larger than generally \nthought.''\n  According to the paper's authors, the Mann hockey stick does not \nprovide an accurate picture of the last 1,000 years. ``The new \nresults,'' they wrote, ``show an appreciable temperature swing between \nthe 12th and 20th centuries, with a notable cold period around AD 1600. \nA large part of the 20th century had approximately the same temperature \nas the 11th and 12th centuries.''\n  In other words, here's evidence of the Medieval Warm Period and the \nLittle Ice Age, demonstrating that climate, long before the burning of \nfossil fuels, varied considerably over the last 2,000 years. The \nresearchers note that changes in the sun's output and volcanic \neruptions appear to have caused considerable natural variations in the \nclimate system. ``The fact that these two climate evolutions,'' they \ncontend, ``which have been obtained completely independently of each \nother, are very similar supports the case that climate shows an \nappreciable natural variability--and that changes in the sun's output \nand volcanic eruptions on the earth may be the cause.''\n  Another important development chipping away at the so-called \nscientific consensus has to do with economics and statistics, and how \nboth are used by the IPCC.\n  To determine how man-made greenhouse gases might affect the climate \nover the next century, the IPCC had to predict 100 years' worth of \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Predicting emissions rates depends on several \nfactors, including population growth, technological advances, and \nfuture economic growth rates in developed and developing countries.\n  Based on these and other factors, the IPCC's Third Assessment Report \nprojected an average global temperature increase by 2100 ranging \nbetween 1.4 to 5.8 degrees Celsius, which is about 2.7 to 10.4 degrees \nFahrenheit. This temperature range was determined from several \ndifferent emission scenarios. In each of those scenarios, the IPCC \narbitrarily assumed that incomes in poor countries and rich countries \nwould converge by the year 2100. According to Warren McKibbin of \nAustralia National University's Center for Applied Macroeconomics and \nthe Brookings Institution, this assumption is unwarranted. Even if it \nwere to happen, McKibbin and his colleagues write:\n\n       The empirical literature suggests that the rate of \n     convergence in income per capita would be very slow.\n\n  Even the IPCC agrees, stating:\n\n       It may well take a century (given all the other factors set \n     favorably) for a poor country to catch up to [income] levels \n     that prevail in the industrial countries today, never mind \n     the levels that might prevail in affluent countries 100 years \n     in the future.\n\n  Nevertheless, the IPCC assumed poor and rich countries would achieve \nparity by the end of the century. To measure that growth over time, the \nIPCC\n\n[[Page S3477]]\n\nhad to compare what income levels look like today. It did that by using \nmarket exchange rates, but this raises a major problem. Relying on \nexchange rates fails to account for price differences between \ncountries. This has the effect of vastly overstating differences in \nwealth. ``This comparison is valid,'' says Ian Castles, formerly head \nof Australia's National Office of Statistics, now with the National \nCenter of Development Studies at Australian National University.\n  Castles and his colleague David Henderson, former chief economist for \nthe Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, now of the \nWestminster Business School, discovered the IPCC's error last year and \nhave published their findings in the distinguished scientific journal \nEnergy and Environment.\n  Castles and Henderson note that using exchange rates is invalid \nbecause it is based on the assumption that ``[a] poor Bangladeshi \nfamily has converted the whole of its income into foreign currency, and \nspent it on goods and services at average world prices rather than [at \nmuch lower] Bangladeshi prices.''\n  Through the use of exchange rates, the IPCC concluded the average \nincome of rich countries right now is 40 times higher than the average \nincome in developing countries in Asia and 12 times higher than the \naverage income in other non-Asian developing countries.\n  As my colleagues can see, there is a huge gap, which raises a \nsignificant point. If the initial income gap is large, then poor \ncountries will have to grow incredibly fast to catch up. According to \nthe IPCC, the greater the economic growth, the greater the emissions \nreleased into the atmosphere, and hence higher temperatures.\n  The IPCC, as the Economist Magazine wrote, is simply wrong. They \nsaid:\n\n       The developing-country growth rates yielded by this method \n     [market exchange rates] are historically implausible, to put \n     it mildly. The emissions forecasts based on those implausibly \n     high growth rates are accordingly unsound.\n\n  Castles and Henderson have shown convincingly that the IPCC's \ntemperature range rests on a majority of major economic error and, \ntherefore, is wildly off the mark. Because of this error, even the \nIPCC's low end emission scenario is implausible. As the Economist \nMagazine wrote:\n\n       But, as we pointed out before, even the scenarios that give \n     the lowest cumulative emissions assume that incomes in the \n     developing countries will increase at a much faster rate over \n     the course of the century than they have ever done before.\n\n  The Economist continued:\n\n       Disaggregated projections published by the IPCC say that--\n     even in the lowest-emission scenarios--growth in poor \n     countries will be so fast that by the end of the century \n     Americans will be poorer on average than South Africans, \n     Algerians, Argentines, Libyans, Turks and North Koreans.\n\n  And I do not think any of us are ready to accept that.\n  Let us get a better sense of why that is odd. Under the IPCC's low-\nend scenario, the amount of goods and services produced per person in \ndeveloping countries in Asia would increase 70-fold by 2100, and \nincrease nearly 30-fold for other developing countries. To put that in \nperspective, the United States only achieved a 5-fold increase in per \ncapita income growth in the 19th century, and Japan achieved a nearly \n20-fold increase in the 20th Century.\n  The IPCC's mistakes are fatal. Jacob Ryten, a leading figure in the \ndevelopment, evaluation, and implementation of the United Nations \nInternational Comparisons Programme, said the IPCC suffers from \n``manifest ignorance of the conceptual and practical issues involved in \ndeveloping and using intercountry measures of economic product.''\n  The Economist said that the IPCC's method proved it was guilty of \ndangerous economic incompetence.\n  Castles and Henderson, along with the Economist and other scientists, \nhave pressed the IPCC to abandon its use of market exchange rates in \nits upcoming Fourth Assessment Report. They say this is essential to \nprovide a more accurate projection of future emissions. Thus far, the \nIPCC has ignored their request, but this is no surprise. The IPCC has \nbecome politicized and appears more intent on pursuing propaganda over \nscience.\n  Consider the case of Dr. Christopher Landsea, the world's foremost \nexpert on hurricanes. Dr. Landsea accepted an invitation to provide \ninput on Atlantic hurricanes for the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report \ndue out in 2007. But over time, Dr. Landsea realized that certain key \nmembers of the IPCC were bent on advancing a political agenda rather \nthan providing an objective, fact-based understanding of climate \nchange. As a result, he resigned from the IPCC process.\n  Dr. Landsea was outraged that Dr. Kevin Trenberth, the lead author of \nobservations for the upcoming Fourth Assessment, and other scientists \nparticipated in a politically charged press conference at Harvard \nUniversity on the supposed causal link between global warming and \nextreme weather events. The press conference was promoted this way:\n\n       Experts to warn global warming likely to continue spurring \n     more outbreaks of intense hurricane activity.\n\n  In other words, they were trying to blame these catastrophes that \ncome up on what they consider to be global warming.\n  As Dr. Landsea explained, the topic was bogus. It has no scientific \nbasis, and none of the scientists who participated had any expertise in \nthe matter.\n  In his resignation letter, Dr. Landsea wrote:\n\n       To my knowledge, none of the participants in that press \n     conference had performed any research on hurricane \n     variability, nor were they reporting on any new work in the \n     field . . . It is beyond me why my colleagues would utilize \n     the media to push an unsupported agenda that recent hurricane \n     activity has been due to global warming.\n\n  What is the real state of the science on this topic?\n\n       All previous and current research in the area of hurricane \n     variability has shown no reliable, long-term trend in the \n     frequency or intensity of tropical cyclones, either the \n     Atlantic or any other basin.\n\n  Dr. Landsea wrote, and this is in the chart:\n\n       Moreover, the evidence is quite strong and supported by \n     most recent credible studies that any impact in the future \n     from global warming upon hurricanes will likely be quite \n     small.\n\n  Dr. Landsea noted that the most recent science shows that ``by around \n2080 hurricanes may have winds and rainfall about 5 percent more \nintense than today. It has been proposed that even this tiny change may \nbe an exaggeration as to what may happen by the end of the 21st \nCentury.''\n  Dr. Landsea concluded that because the IPCC process has been \ncompromised, resigning was his only option. He said:\n\n       I personally cannot in good faith continue to contribute to \n     a process that I view as both being motivated by preconceived \n     agendas and being scientifically unsound.\n\n  As with Castles and Henderson, the IPCC leadership has brushed off \nDr. Landsea's concerns. This is outrageous. In doing so, the IPCC is \nseriously undermining its credibility.\n  One can only hope that the IPCC will change its ways. Otherwise, we \ncan expect yet another assessment report that is unsupported by facts \nand science.\n  It is no surprising that alarmists want to fabricate the perception \nthat there is consensus about climate change. We know the costs of this \nwould be enormous. Wharton Econometrics Forecasting Associates \nestimates that implementing Kyoto would coast an American family of \nfour $2,700 annually. Acknowledging a full-fledged debate over global \nwarming would undermine their agenda. And what is that agenda? Two \ninternational leaders have said it best. Margot Wallstrom, the EU's \nEnvironment Commissioner, states that Kyoto is ``about leveling the \nplaying field for big businesses worldwide.'' French President Jacques \nChirac said during a speech at the Hague in November 2000 that Kyoto \nrepresents ``the first component of an authentic global governance.''\n  Look at this and you realize what is motivating these people. People \nask me if science is not behind this and there is that much damage that \ncan be effected, what is the motive? That is what the motive is.\n  Facts and science are showing that the catastrophic global warming \nconsensus does not exist. The IPCC has been exposed as a political arm \nof U.N.'s Kyoto Protocol, with a mission to prop up its flawed \nscientific conclusions.\n  The Mann hockey stick, the flagship of the IPCC's claims that global \nwarming is real, has now been thoroughly\n\n[[Page S3478]]\n\ndiscredited in scientific circles. Projections of future carbon \nemissions--which drive temperature model conclusions--have been proven \nto be based on political decisions that, by the end of the century, \ncountries like Bangladesh will be as wealthy, or wealthier, than the \nUnited States.\n  A world renowned scientist has just resigned from the IPCC because it \nis too politicized, saying that the IPCC plans to make claims that \ncontradict scientific understanding. Increasingly, it appears that the \nscientific case for catastrophic global warming is a house of cards \nthat will soon come tumbling down.\n  Despite this, there are still some who choose to ignore science.\n  After I spoke about this last week, Duke Energy CEO Paul Anderson \nadvocated a tax on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. In doing \nso, the company has seemingly bought into the spurious notion that the \nscience is settled. But perhaps it is not. Unfortunately, to some \nglobal warming advocates, the science is irrelevant.\n  As Myron Ebell of the competitive Enterprise Institute says:\n\n       Duke Energy has now admitted that the costs will be \n     significant. But the fact is it will only be expensive for \n     their competitors. Nuclear plants don't emit carbon dioxide \n     and Duke is already one-third nuclear generation. Moreover, \n     the company has announced plans to build even more nuclear \n     plants, giving it an even bigger competitive edge.\n\n  This is a lot of scientific stuff. I have said several times since I \nbecame chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee that the \nfirst thing we did was study this because it was assumed that global \nwarming is taking place and anthropogenic gases are causing it, methane \nand CO2, only to find out that is not the case. Virtually \nall the science since 1999 has refuted these assertions. I think we \nhave an obligation to recognize these far-left environmentalist \nextremist groups are huge contributors to campaigns and they have a lot \nof political power, but in the long run we have to be more concerned \nabout America than we are about political campaigns.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated \nmember of the Senate family, Doug Fertig, Human Resources Director of \nthe Senate Sergeant at Arms office, who passed away on April 2, 2005, \nat the age of 54.\n  Doug Fertig came to the Sergeant at Arms in 1996 facing a formidable \nchallenge to standardize processes, establish pay bands and job \nclassifications and a leave accountability system to comply with the \nCongressional Accountability Act. Doug Fertig's dedication, knowledge \nand compassion to the Senate Sergeant at Arms organization turned the \nHuman Resources Department into the professional organization it is \ntoday.\n  Doug Fertig was born in Columbus, OH, received his B.A. from Oberlin \nCollege in 1972, and held Masters Degrees from Stanford University and \nOhio State University. Doug Fertig was a dedicated family man who was \nvery proud of his wife Susan, daughter Emily, and son Andrew. He was \npassionate about education and any sport involving Ohio State \nUniversity.\n  During his tenure with the Senate Sergeant at Arms, Doug Fertig was \nfaced with many challenges, including anthrax in October 2001 and ricin \nin February 2004.\n  Because of Doug's experience and calm demeanor, the challenges of \nrelocating the Human Resources operation and continuing to serve the \nSenate community were met with calm leadership and competent direction \nand stability.\n  Today we honor Doug for his dedication to the Senate, his love for \nhis family, his compassion for the staff in the Human Resources \ndepartment and the Senate Sergeant at Arms organization. His passing \nleaves the Senate community with a profound sense of loss. I hope it is \nof comfort to his family that so many people share their loss at this \nsad time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/12/senate-section/article/S3478-4", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO TOM STONEBURNER\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the life and work \nof Tom Stoneburner, a Nevada labor leader who passed away on February \n21, 2005.\n  A veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, Tom served as a deputy sheriff in \nMono County, CA, before moving to Nevada in 1969. During his 36 years \nin Nevada, he became one of the most effective labor leaders in the \nState, fighting tirelessly on behalf of the working people of Nevada. \nAs a casino security guard, he successfully organized union elections \nfor guards at two Reno hotel casinos and later went on to serve as \npresident of the United Plant Guard Workers.\n  Tom was dedicated to helping all of Nevada's workers. That is why in \n1997 he formed the Alliance for Workers Rights, an organization \nexpressly committed to advocating on behalf of workers in Nevada who \nhad no union representation. Through his leadership of this \norganization, Tom successfully lobbied for strengthened State safety \nprotections after several workers died in industrial accidents in 1998 \nand 2001.\n  His passion and determination in protecting the rights of Nevada's \nworkers belied the soft-spoken and mild-mannered nature that many close \nto him have recalled since his passing. Tom's example has undoubtedly \ninspired many others who will carry on his work, including his wife \nKathy who will continue his important work at the Alliance for Worker's \nRights.\n  Mr. President, please join me in recognizing Tom Stoneburner's \ncontributions to Nevada workers and in sending condolences to Tom's \nfamily for their loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/12/senate-section/article/S3478-5", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3478-S3479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE DEATH OF POPE JOHN PAUL II\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, with the passing of Pope John Paul II, I \ntake this opportunity to pay homage to one of the great spiritual \nleaders of our time. He was a truly gifted religious leader who touched \npeople all over the world: young and old, rich and poor, the powerful \nand the underprivileged, Catholics and non-Catholics.\n  Pope John Paul II defied political labels and was constant in his \nbeliefs. For him, defending life included opposing capital punishment \nand recourse to war as well as opposing abortion. Defending families \nmeant a commitment to faith and moral uprightness, but it also meant \nstanding up for just wages and a social safety net. These beliefs and \nconvictions made him a respected leader all over the world.\n  One of John Paul's strengths was reaching out to young adults. World \nYouth Day was established by the Pope on Palm Sunday, 1984. He invited \nthe Youth of Rome to celebrate the Holy Year of Redemption with him at \nSaint Peter's Square. It was a great success. Building upon this \nsuccess and its popularity, the Pope held this worldwide event every 3 \nyears.\n  Over the last 20 years, millions of young people from hundreds of \ncountries have participated in World Youth\n\n[[Page S3479]]\n\nDay. One young woman who attended said that young people loved the Pope \nbecause the Pope loved them: ``People think that teenagers and young \npeople are just out there and reckless, but he didn't see it that way. \nHe said, `You are the future and I love you for that.' ''\n  The world is now mourning the death of Pope John Paul II. In parishes \nfrom the Americas to Europe to Africa to Asia, millions are paying \ntribute to a leader whose central message was love, respect, faith and \nresponsibility to our fellow man. That example is his legacy, and \nregardless of our individual faiths, it is an example for all of us of \nhow to live and relate to our neighbors. May God grant Pope John Paul \nII eternal rest and peace, and we thank him for a life lived in the \nservice of people everywhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/12/senate-section/article/S3479-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN HONOR OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SUCCESSFUL SALK POLIO VACCINE \n                                 TRIALS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommemorate an historic event that changed the world. Fifty years ago \ntoday, Dr. Thomas Francis, Jr., director of the Poliomyelitis Vaccine \nEvaluation Center and founding chair of the Department of Epidemiology \nat the University of Michigan School of Public Health, announced that \nthe Salk polio vaccine was ``safe, effective, and potent.''\n  That announcement marked the culmination of the most comprehensive \nfield trials ever conducted, unprecedented in scope and magnitude. In \nthe early 1950s, Dr. Jonas Salk, a postdoctoral student of Dr. Francis \nat the University of Michigan, developed a promising vaccine against \npoliomyelitis in his laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. \nSalk returned to the University of Michigan to work with his longtime \nmentor, Dr. Francis, who led the year-long field trials demonstrating \nthat ``the vaccine works.'' More than 300,000 individuals participated \nin the work of the trials, including 20,000 physicians and public \nhealth officers, 40,000 registered nurses, 14,000 school principals, \nand 200,000 volunteers. More than 100 statisticians and epidemiologists \ntabulated data from the approximately 1.8 million children across the \nUnited States, Canada, and Finland who were involved in the trial. \nThese brave children, who stepped forward to receive a shot not knowing \nif it would be the real vaccine or a placebo or whether it would be \nsafe or harmful, are now affectionately known as polio pioneers.\n  While we rarely consider the possibility of contracting polio today, \nlet me remind you that for generations polio was one of the most feared \nchildhood diseases. Poliomyelitis, a neuromuscular disease also known \nas infantile paralysis, is caused by the polio virus. The virus invades \nnerve cells in the spinal cord, resulting in weakness or paralysis of \nthe limbs and muscles. Prior to the successful work of Drs. Salk and \nThomas, no one knew how to prevent polio, and there was no cure for the \ndisease. Hot weather in late summer was ``polio season,'' bringing on a \nrash of new cases of paralytic polio each year. In 1916, a devastating \nepidemic struck New York, killing 9,000 people and leaving 27,000 \ndisabled. For the next 40 years, not a summer passed without an \nepidemic occurring somewhere in the U.S. In the 1940s and 1950s, the \nnumber of cases reported in the U.S. ranged from 40,000 to 60,000 each \nyear. The warmer months of the year were termed ``nightmare summers of \nquarantine and contagion.'' President Roosevelt, who suffered \npersonally from the effects of polio, founded the National Foundation \nfor Infantile Paralysis, now called the March of Dimes, and called upon \nmillions of private citizens to donate dimes to fund the foundation's \nwork to fight polio. Today, polio has been nearly eradicated.\n  Fifty years ago this morning, before more than 500 scientists, \nphysicians, and reporters at Rackham Auditorium in Ann Arbor, Dr. \nFrancis told an anxious world of parents that the Salk vaccine had been \nproven to be effective in preventing polio. Please join me in honoring \nthe success of Drs. Francis and Salk in combating this devastating \ndisease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/12/senate-section/article/S3479-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          COMMENDING THE EFFORTS OF BASKETBALL WITHOUT BORDERS\n\n Mr. DODD.

It is also a chance for them to learn important lessons about \nthe world in which they live.\n  In addition to basketball instruction, the children who participate \nin Basketball without Borders will learn about HIV/AIDS prevention, the \nimportance of education, and ways to lead a healthier life. They will \nalso have the opportunity to meet children whose ethnicities, \nbackgrounds, and cultures are different from their own.\n  I also applaud the NBA and FIBA for the charitable efforts that are \npart of the Basketball without Borders initiative. As part of this \nyear's program, the NBA will be conducting several auctions on its \nwebsite, with the proceeds funding community improvement efforts \nworldwide, particularly in disadvantaged areas.\n  As public figures, professional athletes can send a strong message by \nserving as role models both on and off the playing field. It is my hope \nthat the players who are taking part in Basketball without Borders will \ninspire basketball fans around the world to take a closer look at ways \nthey can extend a hand of friendship to diverse communities around the \nglobe. I salute the athletes who are participating in this worthy \nventure, as well as all those whose hard work has made this initiative \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/12/senate-section/article/S3479-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3479-S3480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO RALPH STURGES, CHIEF OF THE MOHEGAN TRIBE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I honor Ralph Sturges, Chief of the \nMohegan Tribe. On April 13, Chief Sturges will receive the Citizen of \nthe Year award from the Chamber of Commerce of Eastern Connecticut.\n  Chief Sturges is known throughout southeastern Connecticut for his \nleadership, his community involvement, and his humility. Even as he has \nrisen in the ranks of the Mohegan Tribe, from serving as a member of \nthe Tribal Council in the 1980s to becoming lifetime chief in 1991, he \nhas never lost a sense of who he is or what he stands for.\n  Born in 1918, Ralph Sturges served in our armed forces during the \nWorld War II as a security and intelligence officer. He went on to work \nfor the Philadelphia Legal Aid Society and the Salvation Army, as well \nas the Legnos Boat Company.\n  Chief Sturges was renowned for his skills as a craftsman, \nparticularly as a sculptor of traditional Mohegan cultural symbols. \nAmong his many works were a whale sculpture donated to Governor Ella \nGrasso and the carving of a base for the headstone of the Mohegan chief \nSamuel Uncas.\n  When Ralph Sturges was elected lifetime chief of the Mohegan Tribe, \nas he puts it, he ``didn't have a telephone and didn't have an \noffice.'' He devoted a great deal of time and energy over the coming \ndecade to the cause of securing federal recognition for the Mohegans--a \ngoal that was realized on March 7, 1994.\n  Today, the Mohegan Tribe stands as a remarkable success story. So \nmuch of this success is due to the efforts and dedication of Ralph \nSturges, as well as countless others who worked with him over the \nyears.\n  Chief Sturges is an outstanding citizen, a respected leader, and a \ndevoted member of the Mohegan tribe. He has forged strong bonds between \nhis tribe and the State of Connecticut, as well\n\n[[Page S3480]]\n\nas the Federal Government. These bonds have reaped tremendous benefits, \nnot only for the Mohegan Tribe, but all of Southeastern Connecticut. \nThe relationship between Connecticut and the Mohegan Tribe serves as a \nmodel that other states and tribal nations would do well to emulate.\n  The honor Chief Sturges will receive this Wednesday is well-deserved. \nI applaud Ralph Sturges for all of his accomplishments, I congratulate \nhim on this distinguished award, and I wish him continued health and \nhappiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/12/senate-section/article/S3480-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARTIN MACKEY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues \nthe memory of a very special man, Martin Mackey of Marin County, CA, \nwho died on March 25, 2005. He was 87 years old. Martin Mackey was born \nin San Francisco. He earned his engineering degree from Stanford and \nentered the Navy Midshipman Reserve Training Program. He served in the \nNavy during World War II and was trained in antisubmarine warfare.\n  Martin met his wife Mary while on leave in Seattle during World War \nII. They were engaged 5 days later. Martin and Mary just celebrated \ntheir 61st wedding anniversary last December.\n  After the war and after 22 years of steel and concrete sales with a \nmultinational company, Martin retired with a desire to change the \nworld. The year was 1968, and he was deeply disturbed by social \ninjustice and the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert \nKennedy. He went on a weekend retreat with his wife Mary to figure out \nwhat he should contribute to make our world a better place.\n  Martin played a key role in bringing affordable housing to Marin \nCounty. President Lyndon Johnson had just signed the Housing Act into \nlaw. Martin's good friend, Larry Livingston, who was a city and \nregional planner, told Martin that Marin County badly needed low and \nmoderate-income housing. Martin was convinced. As chairman of the \nSocial Concerns Committee at Marin County Unitarian Church, he called \nupon ministers throughout the county to form a social action group to \nrespond to the community's housing needs. They met in a rent-free \noffice in the attic of a convent. Then he called upon other leaders and \nfriends in the community to join their efforts. This social action \ngroup of faith and community leaders began to raise money and became \nthe Ecumenical Association for Housing, EAH, still in existence today.\n  EAH began with 24 organizations, each pledging $200. Martin \nselflessly accepted a salary of $1 to serve as executive director. EAH \nquickly took off and began lending money to architects and regional \ngroups to build affordable housing projects throughout Marin. Their \nfirst project was Pilgrim Park, a 61 unit, low-income housing \ndevelopment in San Rafael.\n  For more than 22 years, Martin devoted himself to EAH and affordable \nhousing. Martin worked to persuade citizens and elected officials to \naccept low and moderate-income housing in their wealthy communities. To \ndevelop his knowledge and save EAH outside consultant fees, Martin went \nto Catholic University in Washington, DC, to take a 2-month course in \nhow to be a housing consultant. He eventually expanded his services and \nconsulted for affordable housing projects in other parts of the Bay \nArea as well as Arizona.\n  From its origins as the fledgling group Martin founded in 1968 to a \n325-person staff and $6 million budget, EAH has completed 62 projects \nand 4,556 housing units in the Bay area and beyond.\n  Martin was a dynamic figure in Marin County. My staff and I always \nknew we could call on him for invaluable information and sound advice. \nHe was a passionate and effective advocate for affordable housing. He \nled EAH with a sense of humor and a deep appreciation for the dedicated \nindividuals who worked with him. His accomplishments in creating \naffordable housing for Marin residents is legendary. He was also a \nrespected member of the Marin community and a wonderful, inspiring man \nwho will be deeply missed. We take comfort in knowing that countless \nfuture generations will benefit from his courage, his vision and his \nleadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/12/senate-section/article/S3480-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3480-S3481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-1596.

He worked for its protection and various designations, \nculminating in its establishment by Congress as a National Conservation \nArea.\n  Starting in the 1950s, Morley Nelson spent decades convincing \nranchers and farmers not to shoot raptors, but rather to accept them as \nan integral part of the ecosystem.\n  Morley Nelson raised public awareness about birds of prey through \nscores of speeches with an eagle on his fist, and through dozens of \nmovies and TV specials starring his eagle or hawks, including seven \nfilms for Disney.\n  Morley Nelson recognized the long-standing problem with raptor \nelectrocution from power lines and the associated power outages and \neven resulting wildfires. In cooperation with Idaho Power, and later \nwith other utilities, he helped develop guards and redesigned power \ntransmission lines to reduce raptor electrocution. This technology has \nsince spread throughout the world.\n  Morley Nelson once said, ``This is where the wind and the cliffs and \nthe birds are. This is where I'll always be.'' It seems only fitting \nthat the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area should \nbear his name.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 761\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to increase the \nminimum allocation provided to states for use in carrying out certain \nhighway programs; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Highway \nFunding Equity Act of 2005. I am joined on a bipartisan basis by \nSenators Levin, DeWine, Stabenow, Cornyn, Alexander, DeMint, Dole, \nVitter, Martinez, Isakson, Nelson of Florida, Lugar, Burr, Cochran, \nLott, Hutchison, Chambliss, Bayh, Allen, and Landrieu.\n  The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21 authorized \nmore than $218 billion for transportation programs and expired in \nSeptember 2003, but has been extended through May 2005. TEA-21 requires \ncertain States, known as donor States, to transfer to other States a \npercentage of the revenue from federal highway user fees. Several of \nthese donor States transfer more than 10 percent of every federal \nhighway user fee dollar to other States. As a result, donor States \nreceive a significantly lower rate-of-return on their transportation \ntax dollars being sent to Washington. Currently, over 25 States, \nincluding my State of Ohio, contribute more money to the Highway Trust \nFund than they receive back.\n  My State of Ohio has the Nation's 10th largest highway network, the \n5th highest volume of traffic, the 4th largest interstate highway \nnetwork, and the 2nd largest inventory of bridges in the country. Ohio \nis a major manufacturing State and is within 600 miles of 50 percent of \nthe population of North America. The interstate highways throughout \nOhio and all the donor States provide a vital link to suppliers, \nmanufacturers, distributors, and--consumers.\n  Maintaining our Nation's highway infrastructure is essential to a \nrobust economy and increasing Ohio's share of federal highway dollars \nhas been a longtime battle of mine. One of my goals when I became \nGovernor 14 years ago was to increase our rate-of-return from 79 \npercent to 87 percent in the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1991, ISTEA. Then, in 1998, as chairman of the \nNational Governors Association, I lobbied Congress to increase the \nminimum rate-of-return to 90.5 percent. The goal of the Highway Funding \nEquity Act of 2005 is to increase the minimum guaranteed rate-of-return \nto 95 percent.\n  The Highway Funding Equity Act of 2005 has two components. First, the \nbill would increase the minimum guaranteed rate-of-return in TEA-21 \nfrom 90.5 percent of a State's share of contributions to the Highway \nTrust Fund to 95 percent. The Minimum Guarantee under TEA-21 includes \nall major Core highway programs: Interstate Maintenance, National \nHighway System, Bridge, Surface Transportation Program, Congestion \nMitigation and Air Quality, Metropolitan Planning, Recreational Trails, \nand any funds provided by the Minimum Guarantee itself.\n  Second, the bill uses the table of percentages now in Section 105 of \nTitle 23 to guarantee States with a population density of less the 50 \npeople per square mile a minimum rate-of-return that may exceed 95 \npercent of that State's share of Highway Account contributions. This \nprovision is intended to ensure that every State is able to provide the \nquality of road systems needed for national mobility, economic \nprosperity, and national defense. Under the 2000 Census, this provision \nwould benefit 15 States: Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, \nMaine, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, \nSouth Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.\n\n  Increasing donor States' rate of return to 95 percent will send more \nthan $60 million back to Ohio for road improvements we sorely need. The \ninterstate system was built in the 1950s to serve the demands and \ntraffic of the 1980s. Today, Ohio's infrastructure is functionally \nobsolete. Nearly every central urban interstate in Ohio is over \ncapacity and plagued with accidents and congestion. Ohio's critical \nroadways are unable to meet today's traffic demands, much less future \ntraffic which is expected to grow nearly 70\n\n[[Page S3485]]\n\npercent in the next 20 years. Like all the donor states, we need these \nfunds in Ohio.\n  States can no longer afford to support others that are already self-\nsufficient. Each State has its own needs that far outweigh total \navailable funding, especially in light of the so called ``mega \nprojects'' coming due in the next decade. For example, the Brent Spence \nBridge that carries Interstates 71 and 75 across the Ohio River into \nKentucky is in need of replacement within the next 10 years at a cost \nof about $500 million. With the inclusion of the approach work, the \ntotal project could cost close to $1 billion.\n  The goal of this legislation is to improve the rate-of-return on \ndonor States' dollars to guarantee that Federal highway program funding \nis more equitable for all States. Donor States seek only their fair \nshare, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to improve \nhighway funding equity during the upcoming surface transportation \nreauthorization process. I am pleased with the strong bipartisan \nsupport this legislation has received. In addition, I am hopeful that \nthe highway bill will be brought to the Senate floor quickly, so that \nwe can move to a conference. It is vital that our Nation's highway \ninfrastructure needs be properly addressed to ensure continued economic \ngrowth.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 762\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I join Senator Voinovich in \nintroducing the Highway Funding Equity Act of 2005.\n  Our bill will allow States to get back a fairer share of what they \ncontribute in gas taxes to the highway trust fund. We do this by \nincreasing the Federal minimum guaranteed funding level for highways to \n95 percent from the current 90.5 percent of a State's share of \ncontributions made to the Federal Highway Trust Fund in gas tax \npayments.\n  Increasing this minimum guarantee to 95 percent will bring us one \nstep closer to achieving fairness in the distribution of Federal \nhighway funds to States.\n  Historically about 20 States, including Michigan, known as ``donor'' \nStates, have sent more gas tax dollars to the Highway Trust Fund in \nWashington than were returned in transportation infrastructure \nspending. The remaining 30 States, known as ``donee'' States, have \nreceived more transportation funding than they paid into the Highway \nTrust Fund.\n  This came about in 1956 when a number of small States and large \nWestern States banded together to develop a formula to distribute \nFederal highway dollars that advantaged themselves over the remaining \nStates. They formed a coalition of about 30 States that would benefit \nfrom the formula and, once that formula was in place, have tenaciously \ndefended it.\n  At the beginning there was some legitimacy to the large low-\npopulation predominately Western States getting more funds than they \ncontributed to the system in order to build a national interstate \nhighway system. Some arguments remain for providing additional funds to \nthose States to maintain the national system and our bill will do that. \nHowever, there is no justification for any State getting more than its \nfair share.\n  Each time the highway bill is reauthorized the donor States that have \ntraditionally subsidized other States' road and bridge projects have \nfought to correct this inequity in highway funding. It has been a long \nstruggle to change these outdated formulas. Through these battles, some \nprogress has been made. For instance, in 1978, Michigan was getting \naround 75 cents on our gas tax dollar. The 1991 bill brought us up to \napproximately 80 cents per dollar and the 1998 bill guaranteed a 90.5 \ncent minimum return for each State.\n\n[[Page S3486]]\n\n  We still have a long way to go to achieve fairness for Michigan and \nother States on the return on our Highway Trust Fund contributions. At \nstake are tens of millions of dollars a year in additional funding to \npay for badly needed transportation improvements in Michigan alone and \nthe jobs that go with it. Based on FHWA data, we calculate that \nMichigan would have received over $55 million in additional funds in FY \n2004 under the Voinovich-Levin 95 percent minimum guarantee bill. \nThat's a critically important difference for Michigan each year. The \nsame is true for other donor States that stand to get back millions \nmore of their gas tax dollars currently being sent to other States. \nThere's no logical reason for some States to be forced to continue to \nsend that money to other states to subsidize their road and bridge \nprojects and to perpetuate this imbalance is simply unfair and \nunjustifiable.\n  With the national interstate system completed, the formulas used to \ndetermine how much a State will receive from the Highway Trust Fund are \nantiquated and do not relate to what a State's real needs or \ncontributions are.\n  The Voinovich-Levin bill is a consensus bill developed with the help \nof donor State Department of Transportation agencies and their \ncoalition working group. This legislation would increase the minimum \nguarantee from 90.5 percent to 95 percent for all States. With this \nlegislation, we intend to send a strong message to our colleagues and \nthe authorizing Committee about the need to address the equity issue in \nthe highway reauthorization bill. We are determined to make progress in \nthis bill to distribute the highway funds in a more equitable manner so \nthat every State gets its fair share.\n  This is simply an issue of fairness and we will not be satisfied \nuntil we achieve it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 763. A bill to direct the Federal Railroad Administration to make \nwelded rail and tank car improvements; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing bipartisan \nlegislation to address improvements that need to be made to the \nNation's rail tracks and tank cars. I am very pleased to be joined on \nthis bill by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison.\n  It is vital that we address this issue of track and tank car safety. \nRail accidents occur in our Nation too frequently, and can cause \ndevastating harm, ranging from economic loss, environmental or health \nhazards, or the worst tragedy, the loss of human life.\n  In my own State of North Dakota a terrible derailment took place in \nMinot, ND in January of 2002. At approximately 1:37 a.m. on January 18, \n2002, an eastbound Canadian Pacific Railway freight train, derailed 31 \nof its 112 cars about \\1/2\\ mile west of the city limits of Minot, ND.\n  Five tank cars carrying anhydrous ammonia, a liquefied compressed \ngas, catastrophically ruptured, and a vapor plume covered the \nderailment site and surrounding area. About 146,700 gallons of \nanhydrous ammonia were released from the five cars, and a cloud of \nhydrolyzed ammonia formed almost immediately. This plume rose an \nestimated 300 feet and gradually expanded 5 miles downwind of the \naccident site and over a population of about 11,600 people. One \nresident was fatally injured, and 60 to 65 residents of the \nneighborhood nearest the derailment site had to be rescued. Over the \nnext 5 days, another 74,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia were released \nfrom six other anhydrous ammonia tank cars.\n  As a result of the accident, 11 people sustained serious injuries, \nand 322 people, including the 2 train crewmembers, sustained minor \ninjuries. Damages exceeded $2 million, and more than $8 million was \nbeen spent for environmental remediation. Imagine the devastation that \ncould have occurred if this accident had happened in a more populated \narea.\n  The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated this \nterrible derailment, and in its report issued important safety \nrecommendations on track inspections and tank car crashworthiness. The \nfindings by the NTSB raised great concern. NTSB estimated that the pre-\n1989 tank cars were insufficiently crashworthy. The cars were estimated \nto make up approximately 60 percent of the pressure tank cars in the \nrail system, and with a 50-year lifespan, could continue operating \nuntil 2039. The risks posed by these cars are significant, and the NTSB \nset forth recommendations on addressing these safety issues.\n  Of further concern is the fact that statistics show that there were \nmore than 1.23 million tank car shipments of hazardous materials in \n2000, the last year for which the study had data available, in the \nUnited States and Canada. Of the top 10 hazardous materials transported \nby tank car, 5 were class 2 liquefied compressed gases, LPG, anhydrous \nammonia, chlorine, propane, and vinyl chloride, that together accounted \nfor more than 246,600 tank car shipments, or about 20 percent of all \nhazardous materials shipments by tank car.\n  Consequently, the NTSB specifically stated concerns about continued \ntransportation of class 2 hazardous materials in pre-1989 tank cars. \nBecause of the high volume of liquefied gases transported in these tank \ncars and the cars' lengthy service lives, the NTSB concluded that using \nthese cars to transport DOT class 2 hazardous materials under current \noperating practices poses an unquantified but real risk to the public. \nThe NTSB also concluded that research was needed on improving the \ncrashworthiness of all tank cars.\n  With regards to track safety, the NTSB also found that improved track \ninspection, such as visual inspections, and additional oversight by the \nFRA was necessary. The accident was caused in part because of \nundetected cracks in the rail tracks, and NTSB concluded that track \ninspections to identify and remove cracked rail components before the \ncracks grow to critical size are the primary preventive measure to \nensure safety.\n  The findings from the NTSB's report are extremely troubling, and \nrequire immediate action by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) \nto implement the safety recommendations. Our legislation incorporates \nthese recommendations and others on track safety, and sets forth time \nframes for the FRA to act so that we ensure that these critical and \npotentially life-saving recommendations will move forward.\n  It is important to note that the terrible tragedy that took place in \nMadrid last year demonstrates that tank and track safety are vital to \nprevent not only against rail accidents, but also against terrorist \nattacks against our rail system. We cannot delay on investigating \nimprovements to tank cars that travel every day across this country, \noften carrying dangerous loads of hazardous material. This is a \nnecessary step in improving rail security.\n  We will now work with the Senate Commerce Committee and the Senate \nleadership to speed enactment of this important legislation. Last year \nsimilar provisions were included in a larger rail security bill that \npassed the Senate, and I am hopeful that we can proceed along the same \nroute this year, as both measures are vital to protect our rail system. \nI invite my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 763\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the coordination of prescription drug coverage provided under \nState pharmaceutical assistance programs with the prescription drug \nbenefit provided under the medicare program, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague, \nSenator Lautenberg, to introduce legislation, the Preserving Access to \nAffordable Drugs (PAAD) Act. This legislation is essential to ensuring \nthat our most vulnerable seniors who have existing prescription drug \ncoverage do not see a reduction or disruption in their coverage once \nthe Medicare prescription drug program goes into effect.\n  Hundreds of thousands of seniors, including 190,000 in my State, \ncurrently enrolled in state pharmacy assistance programs (SPAPs) will \nbe forced out of those programs and into a private drug plan under the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit. Additionally, approximately six \nmillion seniors, including 140,000 in New Jersey, who are dually \neligible for Medicare and Medicaid will lose access to their Medicaid \nprescription drug benefits, which are more generous and provide greater \naccess to a variety of drugs than the Medicare benefit will.\n  No senior should be made worse off by the new Medicare law. The law \nshould expand benefits--not reduce them. The PAAD Act will make \ncritical changes to the Medicare law to ensure that the above-mentioned \nbenefits are safeguarded.\n  The PAAD Act will allow States to automatically enroll SPAP and \ndually eligible Medicaid beneficiaries into one or more preferred \nprescription drug plans to ensure that these beneficiaries are enrolled \nin a Medicare drug plan that maximizes both their Federal and State \nprescription drug coverage and ensures for a seamless transition to the \nnew Medicare Part D drug benefit.\n  The PAAD Act will ensure that New Jersey seniors who currently \nreceive prescription drug benefits under PAAD or through the State's \nMedicaid program are not made worse off by the new Medicare law.\n  The PAAD Act will allow New Jersey to provide supplemental Medicaid \nprescription drug benefits to low-income seniors and disabled who \ncurrently receive generous prescription drug benefits under the \nMedicaid program and who will now receive their prescription drug \nbenefits through Medicare.\n  One of the goals of medicine is to do no harm. The manner in which \nthe Bush Administration has chosen to implement the Medicare law \nviolates that tenet. The Medicare legislation signed by the President \ncreated the State Pharmaceutical Assistance Transition Commission \nspecifically to address the coordination of benefits between SPAPS, \nState Medicaid drug programs, and the new Medicare drug plan. The \nCommission was explicit in its recommendation to CMS that states be \npermitted to automatically enroll these beneficiaries in preferred \nprescription drug plans to ``enhance benefits to enrollees, encourage \nenrollment, and promote coordination between Medicare Part D and \n[states].'' Members of the Commission recognized that many blind, \ndisabled, and aged beneficiaries, those who most need coverage, would \nnot be able to navigate the plan selection process and could face gaps \nin coverage. Yet, CMS recently denied New Jersey's request to \nautomatically enroll those Medicare beneficiaries currently enrolled in \nNew Jersey's PAAD and Medicaid programs into a preferred Medicare \nprescription drug plan. This ruling effectively blocks New Jersey's \nefforts to preserve the generous prescription drug coverage the state \ncurrently provides to the 190,000 seniors enrolled in New Jersey's PAAD \nprogram and the 140,000 seniors and disabled enrolled in the state's \nMedicaid program when the new Medicare prescription drug benefit goes \ninto effect on January 1, 2006.\n\n  Yesterday, I was joined by Senator Lautenberg in writing to the \nPresident to express our sincere dismay over the recent CMS ruling. It \nis clear that permitting states to automatically enroll these \nbeneficiaries would guarantee that these seniors continue to receive \nthe same level of prescription drug coverage, which is more generous \nthan the coverage that will be available under the new Medicare \nbenefit. Furthermore, auto enrollment would relieve beneficiaries from \nthe anxiety of selecting the appropriate plan to ensure that their drug \ncoverage is maximized. Certainly, beneficiaries who prefer to select \ntheir own prescription drug plan should have that choice, but those who \nwant the state to act on their behalf to ensure that they receive the \nmost comprehensive and seamless coverage should be afforded that \noption.\n  This legislation is critical to preserving and protecting existing \nprescription drug coverage while expanding it to those who currently \nlack such coverage. States like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York, \nStates that have well-established, generous prescription drug plans for \nseniors and the disabled, should not be prevented from continuing to \nprovide the same level of coverage under the new Medicare law. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation and \npreserve prescription drug benefits for all seniors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 764\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to preserve mathematics- and science-based industries \nin the United States; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenator Durbin, an important bipartisan bill related to education and \nour national, homeland, and economic security. My good friend and \ncolleague in the U.S. House of Representatives, Congressman Frank Wolf, \nis introducing the same legislation today in the House.\n  Without a doubt, our ability to remain ahead of the curve in \nscientific and technological advancements is a key component to \nensuring America's national, homeland and economic security in the post \n9/11 world of global terrorism.\n  Yet alarmingly, the bottom line is that America faces a huge shortage \nof home-grown, highly trained scientific minds.\n  The situation America faces today is not unlike almost 50 years ago. \nOn October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union successfully launched the first \nman-made satellite into space, Sputnik. The launch shocked America, as \nmany of us had assumed that we were preeminent in the scientific \nfields. While prior to that unforgettable day America enjoyed an air of \npost World War II invincibility; afterwards our Nation recognized that \nthere was a cost to its complacency. We had fallen behind.\n  In the months and years to follow, we would respond with massive \ninvestments in science, technology and engineering. In 1958, Congress \npassed legislation creating the National Defense Education Act, which \nwas designed to stimulate advancement in science and mathematics. In \naddition, President Eisenhower signed into law legislation that \nestablished the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). \nAnd a few years later, in 1961, President Kennedy set the Nation's goal \nof landing a man on the moon within the decade.\n  These investments paid off. In the years following the Sputnik \nlaunch, America not only closed the scientific and technological gap \nwith the Soviet Union, we surpassed them. Our renewed commitment to \nscience and technology not only enabled us to safely land a man on the \nmoon in 1969, it spurred research and development which helped ensure \nthat our modern military has always had the best equipment and \ntechnology in the world. These post-Sputnik investments also laid the \nfoundation for the creation of some of the most significant \ntechnologies of modern life, including personal computers and the \nInternet.\n  Why is any of this important to us today? Because, as the old saying \ngoes--he or she who fails to remember history is bound to repeat it.\n  The truth of the matter is that today America's education system is \ncoming up short in training the highly technical American minds that we \nnow need and will continue to need far into the future.\n  The 2003 Program for International Student Assessment found that the \nmath, problem solving, and science skills of fifteen year old students \nin the United States were below average when compared to their \ninternational counterparts in industrialized countries. While a little \nbit better news was presented by the recently released 2003 Trends in \nInternational Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), it is still \nnothing we should cheer about. TIMSS showed that eighth grade students \nin the U.S. had lower average math scores than fifteen other \nparticipating countries. U.S. science scores weren't much better.\n  Our colleges and universities are not immune to the waning \nachievement in math and science education. The National Science \nFoundation reports the percentage of bachelor degrees in science and \nengineering have been declining in the U.S. for nearly two decades. In \nfact, the proportion of college-age students earning degrees in math, \nscience, and engineering was substantially higher in 16 countries in \nAsia and Europe than it was in the United States.\n  In the past, this country has been able to compensate for its \nshortfall in homegrown, highly trained, technical and scientific talent \nby importing the necessary brain power from foreign countries. However, \nwith increased global competition, this is becoming harder and harder. \nMore and more of our imported brain power is returning home to their \nnative countries. And regrettably, as they return home, many American \nhigh tech jobs are being outsourced with them.\n  Moreover, in the post 9/11 era, it is more important than ever from a \nsecurity perspective to have American citizens performing certain \ntasks. We cannot run the risk of having to out-source the security of \nthis country simply because we don't have enough highly trained U.S. \ncitizens to meet our America's needs.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is a targeted measure that \nwill help America meet its needs by providing strong incentives to \nstudents and graduates to pursue studies and careers in these important \nscientific and technical fields.\n  Our bill simply allows the Federal Government to pay the interest on \nundergraduate student loans for certain graduates of math, science, or \nengineering programs who agree to work in the United States in these \nfields for 5 consecutive years. Priority will be given to those \nstudents with degrees in majors that are key to protecting our \nnational, homeland and economic security as a nation.\n  Almost 50 years ago our Nation learned a lesson about the cost of \ncomplacency in science and technology. While we responded with \nimmediate vigor and ultimately prevailed, today, new dangers are upon \nus.\n  Once again, America must rise to meet a new challenge. In my view, \nthis initiative is an important step forward that will encourage \nAmericans to enter important fields of study that are crucial to the \nnational, homeland, and economic security of this country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 766. A bill to remove civil liability barriers that discourage the \ndonation of fire equipment to volunteer fire companies; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am introducing the ``Good Samaritan \nVolunteer Firefighter Assistance Act of 2005.'' Amazingly, every year \nquality firefighting equipment worth millions of dollars is wasted. In \norder to avoid civil liability lawsuits, heavy industry and wealthier \nfire departments destroy surplus equipment, including hoses, fire \ntrucks, protective gear and breathing apparatus, instead of donating it \nto volunteer fire departments.\n  The basic purpose of this legislation is to induce donations of \nsurplus firefighting equipment by reducing the threat of civil \nliability for organizations, most commonly heavy industry, and \nindividuals who wish to make these donations. The bill eliminates civil \nliability barriers to donations of surplus firefighting equipment by \nraising the liability standard for donors from ``negligence'' to \n``gross negligence.'' By doing this, the legislation saves taxpayer \ndollars by encouraging donations, thereby reducing the taxpayers' \nburden of purchasing expensive equipment for volunteer fire \ndepartments.\n  The Good Samaritan Volunteer Firefighter Assistance Act of 2005 is \nmodeled after a bill passed by the Texas state legislature in 1997 and \nsigned into law by then-Governor George W. Bush which has resulted in \nmore than $10 million in additional equipment donations from companies \nand other fire departments for volunteer departments which may not be \nas well equipped. Now companies in Texas can donate surplus equipment \nto the Texas Forest Service, which then certifies the equipment and \npasses it on to volunteer fire departments that are in need. The \ndonated equipment must meet all original specifications before it can \nbe sent to volunteer departments. Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, \nCalifornia, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Nevada, South \nCarolina, and Pennsylvania have passed similar legislation at the State \nlevel.\n\n[[Page S3489]]\n\n  In the 108th Congress, Representative Castle introduced the Good \nSamaritan Volunteer Firefighter Assistance Act, which had 64 bipartisan \ncosponsors in the House of Representatives. It is also supported by the \nNational Volunteer Fire Council, the Firemen's Association of the State \nof New York, and a former director of the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency, FEMA, James Lee Witt. The legislation passed overwhelmingly in \nthe House by a vote of 397-3. The bill has been reintroduced as H.R. \n1088 in the 109th Congress and already has garnered 64 cosponsors. I \nintroduced the Good Samaritan Volunteer Firefighter Assistance Act of \n2004 in the 108th Congress that also enjoyed support from the National \nVolunteer Fire Council.\n  Federally, precedent for similar measures includes the Bill Emerson \nGood Samaritan Food Act, Public Law 104-210, named for the late \nRepresentative Bill Emerson, which encourages restaurants, hotels and \nbusinesses to donate millions of dollars worth of food. The Volunteer \nProtection Act of 1997, Public Law 105-101, also immunizes individuals \nwho do volunteer work for non-profit organizations or governmental \nentities from liability for ordinary negligence in the course of their \nvolunteer work. I have also previously introduced three Good Samaritan \nmeasures in the 106th Congress, S. 843, S. 844 and S. 845. These \nprovisions were also included in a broader charitable package in S. \n997, the Charity Empowerment Act, to provide additional incentives for \ncorporate in-kind charitable contributions for motor vehicle, aircraft, \nand facility use. The same provision passed the House of \nRepresentatives in the 107th Congress as part of H.R. 7, the Community \nSolutions Act, in July of 2001, but was not signed into law.\n  Volunteers comprise approximately 73 percent of firefighters in the \nUnited States. Of the total estimated 1,078,300 firefighters across the \ncountry, 784,700 are volunteers. Of the more than 30,000 fire \ndepartments in the country, approximately 22,600 are all volunteer; \n4,800 are mostly volunteer; 1,600 are mostly career; and 2,000 are all \ncareer. In 2000, 58 of the 103 firefighters who died in the line of \nduty were volunteers.\n  This legislation provides a commonsense incentive for additional \ncontributions to volunteer fire departments around the country and \nwould make it more attractive for corporations to give equipment to \nfire departments in other States. All of America has witnessed the \nheroic acts of selflessness and sacrifice of firefighters in New York \nCity, Northern Virginia, and Pennsylvania. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting this incentive for the provision of additional safety \nequipment for volunteer firefighters who put their lives on the line \nevery day throughout this great Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Talent, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Coleman):\n  S. 767. A bill to establish a Division of Food and Agricultural \nScience within the National Science Foundation and to authorize funding \nfor the support of fundamental agricultural research of the highest \nquality, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. BOND. I rise today to introduce legislation with Senators \nMikulski, Talent, Harkin, Roberts and Coleman to establish a division \nof food and agricultural science within the National Science Foundation \nto support fundamental agricultural research of the highest quality. I \npresent this to begin a critical discussion that I believe we must have \nover the next several months about how we are going to ensure we \ncapitalize on the technology to maximize the benefits and minimize the \ncosts of our agricultural production.\n  We remain the world leader in food and fiber production. We do it \nsafely and through technology and the hard work of the American farmer. \nIn the past half century, the number of people fed by a single U.S. \nfarm has grown from 19 to 129. We have a tremendously innovative \nagricultural research program. Our farmers, our farm leaders are on the \ncutting edge of developing new technology. And we have seen the \ninnovations continue to come down the pike. This has made it possible \nfor one farmer to feed 129 people.\n  In addition, we export $60 billion worth of agricultural products, \nand we do so at less cost and at less harm to the environment than any \nof our competitors around the world, again, because of new practices, \ndiligence on the part of farmers, and new technology.\n  In a world that has a decreasing amount of soil available for \ncultivation, we have a growing population and we still have 800 million \nchildren who are hungry or malnourished throughout the world. As some \nhave said: A person who is well fed can have many problems. A person \nwho is hungry has but one problem. Unless we maximize technology and \nnew practices, production will continue to overtax the world's natural \nresources.\n  Many people legitimately have raised concerns regarding new diseases \nand pests and related food safety issues. And they are growing. The \nleading competitiveness of our U.S. producers is only as solid as our \nwillingness to invest in forward-looking investments and build upon our \nhistoric successes.\n  Now, we also know from past experience that with new technology the \ndoors are being opened to novel new uses of renewable agricultural \nproducts in the fields of energy, medicine, and industrial products. In \nthe future, we can make our farm fields and farm animals factories for \neveryday products, fuels, and medicines in a way that is efficient and \nbetter preserves our natural resources. Advances in the life sciences \nhave come about, such as genetics, proteomics, and cell and molecular \nbiology. They are providing the base for new and continuing \nagricultural innovations.\n  It was only about a dozen years ago that farmers in Missouri came to \nme to tell me about the potential that genetic engineering and plant \nbiotechnology had for improving the production of food, and doing so \nwith less impact on the environment, providing more nutritious food. \nSince that time, I have had a wonderful, continuing education, not in \nhow it works but what it can do.\n  We know now, for example, that in hungry areas of the world as many \nas half a million children go blind from vitamin A deficiency, and \nmaybe a million die from vitamin A deficiency. Well, through plant \nbiotechnology, the International Rice Research Institute in the \nPhilippines and others have developed Golden Rice, taking a gene from \nthe sunflower, a beta-carotene gene, and they enrich the rice. The \nGolden Rice now has that vitamin A, and that is going to make a \nsignificant difference in dealing with malnutrition.\n  We also know that in many areas of the world, where agricultural \nproduction has overtaxed the land, where drought has cut the \nproduction, where virus has plagued production, the way we can make \nfarmers self-sufficient, where we can restore the farm economy in many \nof these countries, is through plant biotechnology.\n  But this is just the beginning. This legislation I am introducing \ntoday seeks to lay the foundation for tremendous advances in the \nfuture.\n  This legislation stems from findings and recommendations produced by \na distinguished group of scientists working on the Agricultural \nResearch, Economics and Education Task Force, which I was honored to be \nable to include in the 2002 farm bill. The distinguished task force was \nled by Dr. William H. Danforth, of St. Louis, the brother of our former \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Jack Danforth. Dr. Bill Danforth has a \ntremendous reputation in science and in education, with a commitment to \nhuman welfare and is known worldwide. He was joined by Dr. Nancy Betts, \nthe University of Nebraska; Mr. Michael Bryan, president of BBI \nInternational; Dr. Richard Coombe, the Watershed Agricultural Council; \nDr. Victor Lechtenbert, Purdue University; Dr. Luis Sequeira, the \nUniversity of Wisconsin; Dr. Robert Wideman, the University of \nArkansas; and Dr. H. Alan Wood, Mississippi State University.\n  I extend my congratulations and my sincere gratitude to Dr. Danforth \nand his team for providing the basis and the roadmap to ensure we have \nthe mechanisms in place to solve the problems and capitalize on the \nopportunities in agricultural research. The full report of the task \nforce can be found at www.ars.usda.gov/research.htm.\n\n[[Page S3490]]\n\n  In summary, that study concludes that it is absolutely necessary we \nreinvigorate and forward focus our technology to meet the \nresponsibilities of our time. New investment is critical for the \nworld's consumers, the protection of our natural resources, the \nstandard of living for Americans who labor in rural America, and for \nthe well-being of the hungry people and the needy people throughout the \nworld.\n  This legislation is supported by the some 22 Member and Associate \nMember Societies of the Federation of American Societies for \nExperimental Biology, as well as the Institute of Food Technologists, \nAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil \nScience Society of America, the Council for Agricultural Research, the \nNational Coalition for Food and Agricultural Research, the American \nSoybean Association, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, National \nChicken Council, National Corn Growers Association, National Farmers \nUnion, National Milk Producers Federation, National Pork Producers \nCouncil, National Turkey Federation, Association of American Veterinary \nMedical Colleges and the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association.\n  I look forward to pursuing this vision in the 109th Congress. I \ninvite my colleagues who are interested in science and research to \nreview this report, to look at this measure, to join with me and my \ncosponsors in the next session of Congress to talk about moving forward \non what I think will be a tremendous opportunity to improve agriculture \nand its benefits to all our populations.\n  Madam President, this, I hope, will be the start of something really \nbig. Today, Congressman Gutknecht is offering companion legislation in \nthe House. I congratulate him on his leadership in promoting science \nand I am pleased to be working on this with him.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 767\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Agricultural Research, Economics, and \n     Education Task Force established under section 7404 of the \n     Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 3101 \n     note) conducted an exhaustive review of agricultural research \n     in the United States and evaluated the merits of establishing \n     1 or more national institutes focused on disciplines \n     important to the progress of food and agricultural science. \n     Consistent with the findings and recommendations of the \n     Agricultural Research, Economics, and Education Task Force, \n     Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Agriculture in the United States faces critical \n     challenges, including an impending crisis in the food, \n     agricultural, and natural resource systems of the United \n     States. Exotic diseases and pests threaten crops and \n     livestock, obesity has reached epidemic proportions, \n     agriculturally-related environmental degradation is a serious \n     problem for the United States and other parts of the world, \n     certain animal diseases threaten human health, and United \n     States producers of some major crops are no longer the \n     world's lowest cost producers.\n       (2) In order to meet these critical challenges, it is \n     essential that the Nation ensure that the agricultural \n     innovation that has been so successful in the past continues \n     in the future. Agricultural innovation has resulted in hybrid \n     and higher yielding varieties of basic crops and enhanced the \n     world's food supply by increasing yields on existing acres. \n     Since 1960, the world's population has tripled with no net \n     increase in the amount of land under cultivation. Currently, \n     only 1.5 percent of the population of the United States \n     provides the food and fiber to supply the Nation's needs. \n     Agriculture and agriculture sciences play a major role in \n     maintaining the health and welfare of all people of the \n     United States and in husbanding our land and water, and that \n     role must be expanded.\n       (3) Fundamental scientific research that leads to \n     understandings of how cells and organisms work is critical to \n     continued innovation in agriculture in the United States. \n     Such future innovations are dependent on fundamental \n     scientific research, and will be enhanced by ideas and \n     technologies from other fields of science and research.\n       (4) Opportunities to advance fundamental knowledge of \n     benefit to agriculture in the United States have never been \n     greater. Many of these new opportunities are the result of \n     amazing progress in the life sciences over recent decades, \n     attributable in large part to the provision made by the \n     Federal Government through the National Institutes of Health \n     and the National Science Foundation. New technologies and new \n     concepts have speeded advances in the fields of genetics, \n     cell and molecular biology, and proteomics. Much of this \n     scientific knowledge is ready to be mined for agriculture and \n     food sciences, through a sustained, disciplined research \n     effort at an institute dedicated to this research.\n       (5) Publicly sponsored research is essential to continued \n     agricultural innovation to mitigate or harmonize the long-\n     term effects of agriculture on the environment, to enhance \n     the long-term sustainability of agriculture, and to improve \n     the public health and welfare.\n       (6) Competitive, peer-reviewed fundamental agricultural \n     research is best suited to promoting the fundamental research \n     from which breakthrough innovations that agriculture and \n     society require will come.\n       (7) It is in the national interest to dedicate additional \n     funds on a long-term, ongoing basis to an institute dedicated \n     to funding competitive peer-reviewed grant programs that \n     support and promote the highest caliber of fundamental \n     agricultural research.\n       (8) The Nation's capacity to be competitive internationally \n     in agriculture is threatened by inadequate investment in \n     research.\n       (9) To be successful over the long term, grant-receiving \n     institutions must be adequately reimbursed for their costs if \n     they are to pursue the necessary agricultural research.\n       (10) To meet these challenges, address these needs, and \n     provide for vitally needed agricultural innovation, it is in \n     the national interest to provide sufficient Federal funds \n     over the long term to fund a significant program of \n     fundamental agricultural research through an independent \n     institute.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of the Division established \n     under section 4(a) shall be to ensure that the technological \n     superiority of agriculture in the United States effectively \n     serve the people of the United States in the coming decades, \n     and to support and promote fundamental agricultural research \n     of the highest caliber in order to achieve goals, including \n     the following goals:\n       (1) Increase the international competitiveness of United \n     States agriculture.\n       (2) Develop knowledge leading to new foods and practices \n     that improve nutrition and health and reduce obesity.\n       (3) Create new and more useful food, fiber, health, \n     medicinal, energy, environmental, and industrial products \n     from plants and animals.\n       (4) Improve food safety and food security by protecting \n     plants and animals in the United States from insects, \n     diseases, and the threat of bioterrorism.\n       (5) Enhance agricultural sustainability and improve the \n     environment.\n       (6) Strengthen the economies of the Nation's rural \n     communities.\n       (7) Decrease United States dependence on foreign sources of \n     petroleum by developing bio-based fuels and materials from \n     plants.\n       (8) Strengthen national security by improving the \n     agricultural productivity of subsistence farmers in \n     developing countries to combat hunger and the political \n     instability that it produces.\n       (9) Assist in modernizing and revitalizing the Nation's \n     agricultural research facilities at institutions of higher \n     education, independent non-profit research institutions, and \n     consortia of such institutions, through capital investment.\n       (10) Achieve such other goals and meet such other needs as \n     determined appropriate by the Foundation, the Director, or \n     the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 104\n\n       Whereas the United States needs to do a better job of \n     building personal and institutional relationships with \n     peoples and Nations around the world in order to combat the \n     rise in anti-American sentiment that many polls and studies \n     have reported;\n       Whereas a broad bipartisan consensus in favor of \n     strengthening United States public diplomacy emerged during \n     2003 in Congress and was expressed in various reports, \n     including reports of the Council on Foreign Relations, the \n     General Accounting Office, the Advisory Commission on Public \n     Diplomacy, the Heritage Foundation, and the Advisory Group on \n     Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim World;\n       Whereas, in July 2004, the National Commission on Terrorist \n     Attacks Upon the United States released its final report on \n     United States intelligence, which determined that ``[j]ust as \n     we did in the Cold War, we need to defend our ideals abroad \n     vigorously.

If the United States does not act aggressively to \n     define itself in the Islamic World, the extremists will \n     gladly do the job for us.'';\n       Whereas the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 \n     declares the sense of Congress that the United States should \n     commit to a long-term and significant investment in promoting \n     people-to-people engagement with all levels of society in \n     other countries;\n       Whereas international exchange programs, which have \n     assisted in extending American influence around the world by \n     educating the world's leaders, have suffered from a decline \n     in funding and policy priority;\n       Whereas, when students are instructed in their civic and \n     community responsibilities during secondary education, the \n     importance of their participation in global affairs should be \n     underscored as well;\n       Whereas the number of United States university-level \n     students studying abroad in 2002-2003 was 174,629, \n     representing just over 1 percent of United States students;\n       Whereas \\2/3\\ of United States students studying abroad \n     study in Western Europe (18.2 percent in the United Kingdom \n     alone), although 95 percent of the world population growth in \n     the next 50 years is expected to occur outside of Western \n     Europe;\n       Whereas there are 29,953,000 retired workers in the United \n     States as of December 2004, meaning that there are many older \n     Americans who have the talent, maturity, and time to \n     volunteer their services abroad;\n       Whereas the average United States college graduate who has \n     studied 1 of the less commonly taught languages reaches no \n     more than an intermediate level of proficiency in the \n     language, which is insufficient to meet national security \n     requirements; and\n       Whereas there are hundreds of well-established \n     organizations in the United States that implement educational \n     and professional exchanges, international volunteering, and \n     related programs, and the efforts of those organizations \n     could readily be expanded to reach out to more Americans: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This resolution may be cited as the ``People-to-People \n     Engagement in World Affairs Resolution''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Secretary of State should coordinate with \n     implementing partners in creating an online database that \n     provides information on how Americans can take advantage of--\n       (A) international exchange programs of the Department of \n     State, the Department of Education, and other Federal \n     Government and non-government entities;\n       (B) volunteer opportunities with organizations that assist \n     refugees and immigrants in the United States;\n       (C) opportunities to host international students and \n     professionals in the United States;\n       (D) sister-city organizations in the United States;\n       (E) international fairs and cultural events in the United \n     States; and\n       (F) foreign language learning opportunities;\n       (2) Americans should strive to become more engaged in \n     international affairs and more aware of peoples and \n     developments outside the United States;\n       (3) Americans should seize 1 or more opportunities toward \n     this end, by such means as--\n       (A) participating in a professional or cultural exchange;\n       (B) studying abroad;\n       (C) volunteering abroad;\n       (D) working with an immigrant or refugee group;\n       (E) hosting a foreign student or professional;\n       (F) participating in a sister-city program; and\n       (G) learning a foreign language; and\n       (4) Members of Congress should raise the importance of \n     international engagement in the districts and States the \n     Members represent.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit the People-to-\nPeople Engagement in World Affairs resolution with my colleague from \nNebraska, Senator HAGEL.\n  In July 2004, the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the \nUnited States released its final report, which determined that ``just \nas we did in the Cold War, we need to defend our ideals abroad \nvigorously. . . . If the United States does not act aggressively to \ndefine itself in the Islamic world,\n\n[[Page S3492]]\n\nthe extremists will gladly do the job for us.'' The 9/11 Commission \nreport clearly states that in the interests of national security, the \nU.S. must commit to a long-term, global strategy, which includes, among \nother things, effective public diplomacy.\n  Public diplomacy is an essential component of our efforts to define \nand defend America's interests and ideals abroad. But a successful, \nlong-term approach to building solid relationships with the rest of the \nworld is not just the mission of the State Department. It also requires \nthe engagement of the American people.\n  This People-to-People Engagement in World Affairs resolution is a \ncall to Americans to reach beyond our borders to engage with the world \nat an individual level. It encourages Americans to seize opportunities \nto engage in the global arena--through participating in a professional \nor cultural exchange; studying or volunteering abroad; working with an \nimmigrant or refugee group in the United States; hosting a foreign \nstudent or professional; participating in a sister-city program; or \nlearning a foreign language. This resolution also urges the State \nDepartment to coordinate between government agencies and non-\ngovernmental organizations to create a database where Americans can \nlearn of opportunities to become involved in world affairs. \nFurthermore, it encourages all Members of Congress to work to raise the \nimportance of citizen diplomacy in their states and districts.\n  Americans must make a serious investment in reaching across borders \nand reversing the tide of increasing anti-American sentiments abroad. \nAccording to a 2003 Pew Research Center survey, during 1999-2000, more \nthan 50 percent of the people in surveyed countries held a favorable \nview of the U.S., and in at least one country, favorable views of the \nU.S. were held by over 80 percent of those surveyed. More recent \nsurveys reveal a stark contrast with those figures and growing anti-\nAmerican sentiment. Pew found that, by 2003, favorable views of the \nUnited States in these countries plummeted. Additionally, whereas \nnegative public opinion of the U.S. among Muslims was once limited to \nthe Middle East, now it has spread to populations in places like \nNigeria and Indonesia. Pew found that ``the bottom has fallen out of \nArab and Muslim support for the United States.''\n  While these sentiments are most notable in the Muslim world, they \nextend even farther, coloring the views of many others.\n  Growing anti-American sentiment abroad is dangerous and breeds \nmisperceptions in future generations. Our ability to work with allies \nto foster democratic societies and tackle global problems relates \ndirectly to our image abroad. Building an international coalition with \nour allies requires their trust that our efforts are genuine. Success \nin combating terrorism, the greatest global threat, is contingent upon \na unified, global participation. Members of the international community \nmust collaborate to eliminate loopholes that terrorist networks \nmanipulate when intelligence and communication break down between \nborders.\n  Anti-Americanism can feed a steady supply of recruits and supporters \nfor terrorist networks, intent on our destruction. Terrorist networks \ncapitalize on misperceptions about the U.S. to advance their own agenda \nand scapegoat the U.S. as the reason for the poverty, weak and corrupt \nstates, and powerlessness that many experience on a daily basis.\n  International cooperation is also essential for effective progress in \nother important, trans-border issues, such as the proliferation of WMD, \nhuman trafficking, poverty, environmental degradation, and diseases \nfrom HIV/AIDS to polio. We cannot solve these problems alone--we need \nallies to help find and achieve meaningful solutions.\n  Combating anti-American sentiments requires that we engage in a \nconversation with people in all levels of society beyond our borders. \nAnd as Secretary Rice has noted, our dialogue cannot be a monologue. \nTalking at people about what the U.S. image abroad should be is not \nsustainable or effective. Talking with people, and listening to them, \nhowever, can be the start of real understanding and even trust. That \nconversation needs to happen at a governmental level, through public \nand private diplomacy, but it also needs to happen at an individual \nperson-to-person level, through citizen diplomacy.\n  I have met with a number of groups from my State of Wisconsin that \ntell me they are concerned about misperceptions of America abroad, \nwhich they believe discourage people from coming to the U.S. to visit, \nstudy, learn about our wonderful country, and share their knowledge. I \nam so proud of the work people back in Wisconsin have done to overcome \nbarriers to engaging outside our borders, whether by continuing \nWisconsin's strong history of support for the Peace Corps, or by taking \npart in farmer to farmer initiatives and education exchange programs, \nbuilding sister communities, or tirelessly working to ensure that \nWisconsin maintains its success in attracting foreign visitors to our \nremarkable state. In 2004, Wisconsin was awarded the Goldman Sachs \nFoundation Prizes for Excellence in International Education in honor of \nits work to bring international education and skills into its \ncurriculum. In fact, earlier this year, Wisconsin welcomed a group of \nteachers from Azerbaijan to study the workings of our education system \nto create a model for a new curriculum in their country.\n  Wisconsin also works to improve communities abroad. A non-profit \norganization based in Wisconsin helps abused children in Latvia and is \nworking to create the first family shelter there for these children and \ntheir mothers. Another Wisconsinite who is an expert in dairy prices \nparticipated in a farmer to farmer program to assist in building a \npricing system in Armenia's dairy industry. He was able to share his \nexperiences from this program with myself and people back in the state.\n  Citizen diplomacy not only helps the rest of the world to understand \nus, it strengthens this country internally as well. Americans with \ninsight into and understanding of the world beyond our borders become \nenergized constituents who demand wise foreign policy and help all of \nus to understand global events.\n  President Kennedy acknowledged the importance of public diplomacy in \n1960 and challenged Americans to serve their country through building \nstronger communities abroad. His vision is even more relevant today. It \nis our responsibility to connect with people outside our borders. This \nduty can be fulfilled by teachers, students, retirees, and anyone who \ncan share the best of the American people.

Res. 105\n\n       Whereas National Youth Service Day is an annual public \n     awareness and education campaign that highlights the valuable \n     contributions that young people make to their communities \n     throughout the year;\n       Whereas the goals of National Youth Service Day are to \n     mobilize youth as leaders in identifying and addressing the \n     needs of their communities through service and service-\n     learning, to support youth on a lifelong path of service and \n     civic engagement, and to educate the public, the media, and \n     policymakers about the year-round contributions of young \n     people as community leaders;\n       Whereas young people in the United States, and in many \n     other countries, are volunteering more than in any generation \n     in history;\n       Whereas young people should be viewed as the hope not only \n     of the future, but also of today, and should be valued for \n     the idealism,\n\n[[Page S3493]]\n\n     energy, creativity, and commitment they bring to the \n     challenges found in their communities;\n       Whereas there is a fundamental and conclusive correlation \n     between youth service and lifelong adult volunteering and \n     philanthropy;\n       Whereas through community service, young people build \n     character and learn valuable skills, including time \n     management, teamwork, needs-assessment, and leadership, that \n     are sought by employers;\n       Whereas service-learning, an innovative teaching method \n     combining service to the community with curriculum-based \n     learning, is a proven strategy to increase academic \n     achievement and strengthens civic engagement and civic \n     responsibility;\n       Whereas several private foundations and corporations in the \n     United States support service-learning because they \n     understand that strong communities begin with strong schools \n     and a community investment in the lives and futures of youth;\n       Whereas a sustained investment by the Federal Government, \n     business partners, schools, and communities fuels the \n     positive, long-term cultural change that will make service \n     and service-learning the common expectation and the common \n     experience of all young people;\n       Whereas National Youth Service Day, a program of Youth \n     Service America, is the largest service event in the world \n     and is being observed for the 17th consecutive year in 2005;\n       Whereas National Youth Service Day, with the support of 50 \n     lead agencies, hundreds of grant winners, and thousands of \n     local partners, engages millions of young people nationwide;\n       Whereas National Youth Service Day will involve 114 \n     national partners, including 8 Federal agencies and 10 \n     organizations that are offering grants to support National \n     Youth Service Day;\n       Whereas National Youth Service Day has inspired Global \n     Youth Service Day, which occurs concurrently in over 120 \n     countries and is now in its sixth year; and\n       Whereas young people will benefit greatly from expanded \n     opportunities to engage in meaningful volunteer service and \n     service-learning: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Con. Res. 26\n\n       Whereas on September 11, 2001, acts of war involving the \n     hijacking of commercial airplanes were committed against the \n     United States, killing and injuring thousands of innocent \n     people;\n       Whereas 1 of the hijacked planes, United Airlines Flight \n     93, crashed in a field in Pennsylvania;\n       Whereas while Flight 93 was still in the air, the \n     passengers and crew, through cellular phone conversations \n     with loved ones on the ground, learned that other hijacked \n     airplanes had been used to attack the United States;\n       Whereas during those phone conversations, several of the \n     passengers indicated that there was an agreement among the \n     passengers and crew to try to overpower the hijackers who had \n     taken over Flight 93;\n       Whereas Congress established the National Commission on \n     Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (commonly referred \n     to as ``the 9-11 Commission'') to study the September 11, \n     2001, attacks and how they occurred;\n       Whereas the 9-11 Commission concluded that ``the nation \n     owes a debt to the passengers of Flight 93. Their actions \n     saved the lives of countless others, and may have saved \n     either the U.S. Capitol or the White House from \n     destruction.''; and\n       Whereas the crash of Flight 93 resulted in the death of \n     everyone on board: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) the United States owes the passengers and crew of \n     United Airlines Flight 93 deep respect and gratitude for \n     their decisive actions and efforts of bravery;\n       (2) the United States extends its condolences to the \n     families and friends of the passengers and crew of Flight 93;\n       (3) not later than October 1, 2006, the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives, the minority leader of the House of \n     Representatives, the majority leader of the Senate, and the \n     minority leader of the Senate shall select an appropriate \n     memorial that shall be located in the United States Capitol \n     and that shall honor the passengers and crew of Flight 93, \n     who saved the United States Capitol from destruction; and\n       (4) the memorial shall state the purpose of the honor and \n     the names of the passengers and crew of Flight 93 on whom the \n     honor is bestowed.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a concurrent \nresolution to honor the memory of the passengers on flight 93. As we \nreflect on the events of 9/11 and mourn the great loss we suffered, we \nremember the innocent who perished and we are reminded of the valiant \nefforts of those who saved lives, including the passengers and crew of \nUnited Airlines flight 93. Those brave people gave up their lives in \norder to save others that fateful day.\n  Last fall, the 9/11 Commission released its report about the series \nof events that took place on September 11, 2001. The Senate has \nsubsequently undertaken an evaluation of the Commission's findings \nthrough a series of hearings. As the story continues to unfold, it \nbecomes clearer how important the actions of the passengers and crew of \nflight 93 were. We now know that flight 93 was almost certainly headed \nto the U.S. Capitol or the White House. We also know the passengers of \nflight 93 learned through a series of phone calls to loved ones that \nhijackers on three other flights had turned airplanes into flying bombs \nthat morning, crashing them into the World Trade Center and the \nPentagon.\n  Armed only with that knowledge and their own courage and resolve, \nthose brave passengers attacked the hijackers and forced them to crash \nflight 93 into rural Pennsylvania far short of its intended target. The \n9/11 Commission concluded that the Nation owes a debt to the passengers \nof flight 93. Their actions saved the lives of countless others and may \nhave saved either the U.S. Capitol or the White House from destruction. \nThose of us who work here in the Capitol owe a special debt of \ngratitude to those heroes. Their actions saved one of the greatest \nsymbols of our democracy.\n  Today I am resubmitting a resolution honoring and memorializing the \npassengers and crew of United Airlines flight 93. This legislation \nexpresses our deepest respect and gratitude to them, as well as \ncondolences to their families and friends. This bill also calls for an \nappropriate memorial to be placed in the Capitol by the bicameral, \nbipartisan leaders of Congress.\n  Today I bow my head in memory of those who died at the World Trade \nCenter and the Pentagon. I also pay respect to our first responders, \nvolunteers, and average citizens who risked their lives to save others \non that day.\n  Finally, I pay homage to the passengers and crew of flight 93 for \ntaking on those who wished to harm our country and Nation's Capitol. I \nbelieve it is appropriate at this time to acknowledge the actions of \nthe passengers of flight 93 for showing such remarkable heroism and to \ncommemorate them in the very walls that might have crumbled had they \nnot made that ultimate sacrifice. We are forever indebted to them and \nshould never forget their bravery or sacrifice or that of their loved \nones.\n  The Senate unanimously passed an identical resolution last October \n11, within a month of its introduction, but it did not pass the House \nof Representatives before the adjournment of the 108th Congress. The \nbipartisan legislation I am reintroducing today has the\n\n[[Page S3494]]\n\nsupport of 25 of my colleagues, including Senator Santorum from \nPennsylvania, who has joined me in leading this effort. I am also happy \nto report that Congressman Shuster of Pennsylvania will also be \nintroducing companion legislation today.\n  I hope all my colleagues will join me in sponsoring this resolution. \nI hope on a broad bipartisan basis we are able to recognize those brave \npassengers and crew of flight 93 for what they did on that remarkable \nday.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Conrad as a \nproud cosponsor of a resolution which recognizes the immense bravery of \nthe crew and passengers on flight 93. Over 3\\1/2\\ years have passed \nsince September 11, 2001, but we, the American people, have not \nforgotten the bravery and selflessness that was shown by our fellow \ncitizens on that day.\n  During the 108th Congress, the 9/11 Commission investigated the \nevents that took place on September 11, 2001, including flight 93's \ncrash in Somerset County, PA. As a result of a series of Senate \nhearings held to evaluate and gain a clearer understanding of the 9/11 \nCommission's findings, the actions of flight 93's passengers and crew \nhave become increasingly evident. We know with near certainty now that \nthe terrorists had plans of causing severe destruction to either the \nWhite House or the Capitol Building.\n  Having realized through phone calls to loved ones that three other \nplanes had already been crashed that morning by terrorists, the \npassengers on flight 93 acted quickly and collaboratively to overtake \nthe hijackers and force them to crash the plane into a rural part of \nPennsylvania, keeping the plane's intended target safe from harm.\n  As a result of the 9/11 Commission's findings, we conclude that \nAmerica is indebted to the heroic actions of those on flight 93, who \nshowed great bravery so that many other lives could be spared from \nruin.\n  We who work here in the Capitol are particularly indebted to those on \nboard flight 93. In addition to saving the lives of thousands, the \npassengers on flight 93 ensured the preservation of one of the greatest \nsymbols of America's freedom and democracy.\n  In an effort to recognize and honor the heroes on flight 93, I am \nproud to submit this resolution with Senator Conrad. This resolution is \nan expression of our deep gratitude for what those on flight 93 did for \neach of us here in our Nation's Capital, as well as an expression of \nsorrow and condolence to their families and friends. Additionally, this \nresolution provides for a place in the Capitol Building to be \nmemorialized in the name of the crew and passengers of flight 93, with \na remembrance plaque placed at the location.\n  This day presents an opportunity to remember all of those who died on \nSeptember 11, 2001. Additionally, our volunteers, first responders, and \nthe American people deserve a heartfelt ``thank you'' for the strength \nand strong resolve they showed in the face of destructive, cowardly \nacts.\n  I hope that all of my colleagues will join with Senator Conrad and me \nin this bipartisan effort to honor the crew and passengers on flight 93 \nfor what they did on that infamous day in America's history. May their \nselfless actions, taken for us and the American people, never be \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/12/senate-section/article/S3494-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 338.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On July 22, 2004, the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate declared that the atrocities occurring in Darfur, \n     Sudan are genocide.\n       (2) On September 9, 2004, Secretary of State Colin L. \n     Powell stated before the Committee on Foreign Relations of \n     the Senate, ``[w]hen we reviewed the evidence compiled by our \n     team, along with other information available to the State \n     Department, we concluded that genocide has been committed in \n     Darfur and that the Government of Sudan and the [Janjaweed] \n     bear responsibility--and genocide may still be occurring''.\n       (3) President George W. Bush, in an address before the \n     United Nations General Assembly on September 21, 2004, \n     stated, ``[a]t this hour, the world is witnessing terrible \n     suffering and horrible crimes in the Darfur region of Sudan, \n     crimes my government has concluded are genocide''.\n       (4) On July 30, 2004, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Security Council Resolution 1556, calling upon the \n     Government of Sudan to disarm the Janjaweed militias and to \n     apprehend and bring to justice Janjaweed leaders and their \n     associates who have incited and carried out violations of \n     human rights and international humanitarian law and carried \n     out other atrocities in the Darfur region.\n       (5) On September 18, 2004, the United Nations Security \n     Council passed Security Council Resolution 1564, determining \n     that the Government of Sudan had failed to meet its \n     obligations under Security Council Resolution 1556, calling \n     for a military flight ban in and over the Darfur region, \n     demanding the names of Janjaweed militiamen disarmed and \n     arrested for verification, establishing an International \n     Commission of Inquiry into violations of international \n     humanitarian and human rights laws, and threatening sanctions \n     should the Government of Sudan fail to fully comply with \n     Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1564.\n       (6) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1564 \n     declares that if the Government of Sudan ``fails to comply \n     fully'' with Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1564, the \n     Security Council shall consider taking ``additional \n     measures'' against the Government of Sudan ``as contemplated \n     in Article 41 of the Charter of the United Nations, such as \n     actions to affect Sudan's petroleum sector or individual \n     members of the Government of Sudan, in order to take \n     effective action to obtain such full compliance and \n     cooperation''.\n       (7) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1564 also \n     ``welcomes and supports the intention of the African Union to \n     enhance and augment its monitoring mission in Darfur'' and \n     ``urges member states to support the African Union in these \n     efforts, including by providing all equipment, logistical, \n     financial, material, and other resources necessary to support \n     the rapid expansion of the African Union Mission''.\n       (8) On February 1, 2005, the United Nations released the \n     Report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur \n     to the United Nations Secretary-General, dated January 25, \n     2005, which stated that, ``[g]overnment forces and militias \n     conducted indiscriminate attacks, including killing of \n     civilians, torture, enforced disappearances, destruction of \n     villages, rape and other forms of sexual violence, pillaging \n     and forced displacement throughout Darfur'', that such ``acts \n     were conducted on a widespread and systematic basis, and \n     therefore may amount to crimes against humanity'', and that \n     the ``magnitude and large-scale nature of some crimes against \n     humanity as well as their\n\n[[Page S3497]]\n\n     consistency over a long period of time, necessarily imply \n     that these crimes result from a central planning operation''.\n       (9) The Report of the International Commission of Inquiry \n     on Darfur to the United Nations Secretary-General notes that, \n     pursuant to its mandate and in the course of its work, the UN \n     Commission collected information relating to individual \n     perpetrators of acts constituting ``violations of \n     international human rights law and international humanitarian \n     law, including crimes against humanity and war crimes'' and \n     that the UN Commission has delivered to the Secretary-General \n     of the United Nations a sealed file of those named by the UN \n     Commission with the recommendation that the ``file be handed \n     over to a competent Prosecutor''.\n       (10) On March 24, 2005, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Security Council Resolution 1590, establishing the \n     United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) consisting of 10,000 \n     military personnel and 715 civilian police personnel.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) In an effort to provide support to military families, \n     this Act includes an important increase in the maximum \n     payable benefit under Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance \n     from $150,000 to $400,000.\n       (2) In an effort to provide support to military families, \n     this Act includes an important increase in the death gratuity \n     from $12,000 to $100,000.\n       (3) In an effort to provide support to military families, \n     this Act includes an important increase in the maximum \n     Reserve Affiliation bonus to $10,000.\n       (4) The Federal earned income tax credit (EITC) under \n     section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides \n     critical tax relief and support to military as well as \n     civilian families. In 2003, approximately 21,000,000 families \n     benefitted from the EITC.\n       (5) Nearly 160,000 active duty members of the armed forces, \n     11 percent of all active duty members, currently are eligible \n     for the EITC, based on analyses of data from the Department \n     of Defense and the Government Accountability Office.\n       (6) Congress acted in 2001 and 2004 to expand EITC \n     eligibility to more military personnel, recognizing that \n     military families and their finances are intensely affected \n     by war.\n       (7) With over 300,000 National Guard and reservists called \n     to active duty since September 11, 2001, the need for tax \n     assistance is greater than ever.\n       (8) Census data shows that the EITC lifted 4,900,000 people \n     out of poverty in 2002, including 2,700,000 children. The \n     EITC lifts more children out of poverty than any other single \n     program or category of programs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) Congress should take steps necessary to support our \n     troops and their families;\n       (2) it is not in the interests of our troops and their \n     families to reduce the earned income tax credit under section \n     32 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and\n       (3) the conference committee for H. Con.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 105) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 105\n\n       Whereas National Youth Service Day is an annual public \n     awareness and education campaign that highlights the valuable \n     contributions that young people make to their communities \n     throughout the year;\n       Whereas the goals of National Youth Service Day are to \n     mobilize youth as leaders in identifying and addressing the \n     needs of their communities through service and service-\n     learning, to support youth on a lifelong path of service and \n     civic engagement, and to educate the public, the media, and \n     policymakers about the year-round contributions of young \n     people as community leaders;\n       Whereas young people in the United States, and in many \n     other countries, are volunteering more than in any generation \n     in history;\n       Whereas young people should be viewed as the hope not only \n     of the future, but also of today, and should be valued for \n     the idealism, energy, creativity, and commitment they bring \n     to the challenges found in their communities;\n       Whereas there is a fundamental and conclusive correlation \n     between youth service and lifelong adult volunteering and \n     philanthropy;\n       Whereas through community service, young people build \n     character and learn valuable skills, including time \n     management, teamwork, needs-assessment, and leadership, that \n     are sought by employers;\n       Whereas service-learning, an innovative teaching method \n     combining service to the community with curriculum-based \n     learning, is a proven strategy to increase academic \n     achievement and strengthens civic engagement and civic \n     responsibility;\n       Whereas several private foundations and corporations in the \n     United States support service-learning because they \n     understand that strong communities begin with strong schools \n     and a community investment in the lives and futures of youth;\n       Whereas a sustained investment by the Federal Government, \n     business partners, schools, and communities fuels the \n     positive, long-term cultural change that will make service \n     and service-learning the common expectation and the common \n     experience of all young people;\n       Whereas National Youth Service Day, a program of Youth \n     Service America, is the largest service event in the world \n     and is being observed for the 17th consecutive year in 2005;\n       Whereas National Youth Service Day, with the support of 50 \n     lead agencies, hundreds of grant winners, and thousands of \n     local partners, engages millions of young people nationwide;\n       Whereas National Youth Service Day will involve 114 \n     national partners, including 8 Federal agencies and 10 \n     organizations that are offering grants to support National \n     Youth Service Day;\n       Whereas National Youth Service Day has inspired Global \n     Youth Service Day, which occurs concurrently in over 120 \n     countries and is now in its sixth year; and\n       Whereas young people will benefit greatly from expanded \n     opportunities to engage in meaningful volunteer service and \n     service-learning: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. RECOGNITION AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF YOUTH COMMUNITY \n                   SERVICE.\n\n       The Senate recognizes and commends the significant \n     contributions of American youth and encourages the \n     cultivation of a common civic bond among young people \n     dedicated to serving their neighbors, their communities, and \n     the Nation.\n\n     SEC. 2. NATIONAL YOUTH SERVICE DAY.\n\n       The Senate--\n       (1) designates April 15, 2005, as ``National Youth Service \n     Day''; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to--\n       (A) observe the day by encouraging and engaging youth to \n     participate in civic and community service projects;\n       (B) recognize the volunteer efforts of our Nation's young \n     people throughout the year; and\n       (C) support these efforts and engage youth in meaningful \n     decision making opportunities today as an investment in the \n     future of our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/12/senate-section/article/S3502-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I further ask unanimous consent \nthat following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed \nexpired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for \nthe two leaders be reserved, and the Senate then begin a period of \nmorning business for up to 60 minutes, with the first 30 minutes under \nthe control of the majority leader or his designee and the second 30 \nminutes under the control of the Democratic leader or his designee; \nprovided that following morning business the Senate resume \nconsideration of H.R. 1268, the Iraq-Afghanistan supplemental \nappropriations bill; provided further that there be 40 minutes equally \ndivided in relation to Durbin amendment No. 356 prior to the vote in \nrelation to the amendment, with no second degrees in order to the \namendment prior to that vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will not \nobject, I say to my friend, the Republican whip, it is my intention to \ntry to reduce the length of that debate depending on morning business. \nI understand many of our colleagues have a meeting at the White House. \nIf we can expedite this debate time and bring the vote up before the \nSenator leaves, that is my intention.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That would be very good. We would either finish it \nbefore that meeting or do it after. I think we can get the vote in \nbefore that meeting. It would be very good.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We will try to have, as Senator Durbin and I were discussing, the \nfirst vote at 10:50, or before if all debate is used on the Durbin \namendment. As I indicated, if we are unable to vote by that point we \nwill have to delay the vote until sometime shortly after noon.
