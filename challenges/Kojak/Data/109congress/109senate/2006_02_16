Mr. President, within the hour, we will cast our votes \non whether to proceed on the debate on the extension of the PATRIOT \nAct, which I intend to vote for, both to proceed and then finally for \nthat act.\n  I rise this morning to reflect on my strong support for the PATRIOT \nAct and also express some of my frustration with those who have \nquestioned its use with regard to our civil liberties.\n  I was born in the United States of America in 1944. I am 61 years \nold. The inalienable rights endowed by our Creator that our forefathers \nbuilt this Government on, of life and liberty and the pursuit of \nhappiness, have been the cornerstones of my life. They are the \nfoundation of all our civil liberties. They allowed me to pursue a \nbusiness career, a marriage, the raising of a family, the educating of \nchildren, and allowed me to proceed to the highest office I could have \npossibly ever imagined: a Member of the Senate. Because of God's \nblessings and the blessings of this country, last week I was blessed \nwith two grandchildren, born 61 years after I was but into a country \nthat still is founded on the cornerstones of the great civil liberties \nof life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n  But Sarah Katherine and Riley Dianne, my two granddaughters, were \nborn into a totally different world--the same country but a different \nworld.\n\n[[Page S1376]]\n\nToday, terror is our enemy, and it uses the civil liberties that we \ncherish to attempt to do us harm; in fact, to destroy us. In fact, the \nfreedom of access to communication, to employment, to travel, even to \nour borders, are the tools and the weapons of those who would do our \ncivil liberties harm and in fact take them away. Because of this, do we \ngive up our civil liberties? Absolutely not. But because of this, we \nmust watch, listen, and pursue our enemies with the technologies of the \n21st century. The PATRIOT Act does not threaten our civil liberties. It \nis our insurance policy to preserve them.\n  We obviously must be diligent with anything we give Government, in \nterms of a tool or a power to communicate or to watch or to surveil. \nBut do we turn our back on everything we cherish and that has made us \ngreat out of fear we might lose it when, in fact, it is our obligation \nto protect it? We are in the ultimate war between good and evil. Our \nenemy today, terror, is unlike any enemy we have ever had. All our \nprevious enemies wanted what we had--our resources, our wealth, our \ningenuity, our entrepreneurship, our natural resources, our money, our \nwealth. Terror doesn't want that. Terror doesn't want what we have. \nTerror doesn't want us to have what we have. They don't want me to be \nable to speak freely in this body and speak my mind, or my constituents \nin Georgia to do the same, even if what they say is diametrically \nopposed to me. They don't want me to freely carry a weapon and defend \nmyself. They don't want a free press that can publish and write its \nopinion. They don't want any of the inalienable rights and the \nguarantees and the civil liberties that we have because they know it \nstands against the tyranny and the control and the suppression that \ntheir radical views have brought to a part of the world.\n  This place you and I call home and the rest of the world calls \nAmerica is a very special place. You don't find anybody trying to break \nout of the United States of America. They are all trying to break in. \nAnd they are for a very special reason. The civil liberties and the \nguarantees of our Constitution and the institutions that protect our \ncountry--the reasons that you and I stand here today.\n  While I respect the dissent of any man or woman in this Chamber about \nthe PATRIOT Act, I regret that we have delayed our ratification of the \nsingle tool that turned us around post-9/11, in terms of our ability to \nprotect our shores and our people.\n  I remind this Chamber and everyone who can listen and hear what I am \nsaying that when the 9/11 Commission reviewed all that went wrong prior \nto \n9/11, it recognized that what went right post-9/11 was the passage of \nthe PATRIOT Act. It acknowledged, without our ability to connect the \ndots, we could not protect the country.\n  Once again, I cherish our civil liberties. I see the PATRIOT Act not \nas a threat to them but an insurance policy to protect them. As we go \nto a vote in less than an hour, I encourage every Member of the Senate \nto vote to proceed and then debate, as we will, the issues and the \nconcerns. But in the end, we should leave this Chamber, today or \ntomorrow, sending a message to those who would do us harm and sending a \nmessage to those whom we stand here today to preserve and protect, that \nwe will not let any encumbrance stop our pursuit of those who would \ndestroy or injure us, our children or our grandchildren.\n  At the end, at the age of 61 and with the opportunity to serve in the \nSenate, the rest of my life will be about those grandchildren. Riley \nDianne Isakson and Sarah Katherine Isakson are less than a month old. \nThey have a bright future. The PATRIOT Act is going to ensure that the \nvery civil liberties that will allow them to pursue happiness to its \nmaximum extent will still exist because America did not turn its back \nor fear our ability to compete in a 21st century of terror with the \ntype of 21st century laws we need to surveil, to protect, and to defend \nthose who would hurt or those who would harm this great country, the \nUnited States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to address some troubling information \nabout natural gas, energy, and the prices of energy as well as its \navailability. This information came from a hearing held in the Air \nsubcommittee of the EPW Committee last week, and I think it is of \nsufficient importance to all Members and all States in the Nation that \nI rise to speak to my colleagues about it.\n  We all know that American families and workers are suffering from \nhigh energy costs. They will suffer even more if we do not balance our \nenvironmental concerns with their energy needs. That is why the hearing \nheld last week in the Air subcommittee is all the more important. If we \nfail to heed the warning our families and workers are sending us about \nhigh energy costs and their lost jobs, their lost incomes, their lost \nstandards of living, then we risk doing even more harm.\n  The people I am talking about include manufacturing workers who used \nto make chemicals, plastic products, automobile parts or fertilizer. \nMany of them are now out of work because their employer moved to a \nforeign country with cheaper natural gas prices.\n  The pain, obviously, doesn't stop with workers. Families suffer from \nlost wages. Most of those who are lucky enough to get a new job will be \nworking for lower wages. Does that mean that those wages have to move \neven lower? Do they have to live with a broken-down car even longer?\n  In addition, seniors on fixed incomes are particularly vulnerable to \nhigh natural gas prices. Across the Midwest, indeed across the country, \nmany depend on natural gas to heat their homes in the winter and cool \ntheir homes in the summer. What do we tell them: Wear a coat inside \nduring the winter and turn on a fan during the summer? We all know of \nthe tragedies that hit our seniors in summer heat waves. What do we \ntell their families?\n  Some have said we should tell our workers and their families that we \nare going to hurt them even more in order to fight climate change. We \nwill pass proposals to cap carbon emissions which, by the way, will \nraise energy prices even more. For some, I guess today's energy prices \nare not high enough. Some are willing to drive power and heating bills \neven higher in their fight against global warming. Some do not care \nthat there are no technologies currently available to capture and store \ncarbon dioxide. But they are working on finding those. We are not there \nyet.\n  Some are willing to stop using cheap and abundant fuels, such as \ncoal, and force ourselves to use only the expensive and very limited \nsupply of natural gas. Every year, recently, we have had an opportunity \nto vote on the McCain-Lieberman proposal. Every year we hear about how \nit will deliver a $100 billion hit or more to the economy. Thankfully, \nevery year the Senate kills this job killer.\n  Last year, as part of the Energy bill debate, we passed a sense of \nthe Senate stating support for climate change strategies that did not \nhurt the economy. I think we can all agree with that. It sounds simple, \nbut as we consider the ``McCain-Lieberman lite'' proposals, we have to \nlook at whether a second generation of proposals will actually spare \nour families and workers from more pain.\n  Since we still do not have the technologies to capture and store \ncarbon, they will present other dubious arguments. Some will pin their \nhopes on projections that future natural gas prices will fall from \ntriple historic levels, where they are now, to only double historic \nlevels, where they were a few years ago. This will somehow make carbon \ncaps affordable.\n  Not only do I doubt that natural gas prices will return to historic \nlows, States represented by Members advocating these proposals are \nactively trying to block actions necessary to increase natural gas \nsupply and get prices down. Government natural gas projections, which \nwe found very dubious, include a prediction that natural\n\n[[Page S1377]]\n\ngas prices will fall in the coming decades. However, that prediction \ndepends upon liquefied natural gas imports rising by 600 percent by \n2030, a sixfold increase in LNG imports. I find such hopes mind-\nboggling. How could we increase LNG imports by 600 percent at the same \ntime we have coastal States from Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, \nConnecticut, and Delaware opposing or blocking LNG terminals?\n  By the way, these Northeastern States blocking natural gas imports \nthrough their States are the very ones proposing we punish Midwestern \nStates using coal by forcing them to switch to natural gas to make \nelectricity--the natural gas that they will not allow us to get through \nLNG.\n  Others who claim carbon caps will be affordable, pin their hopes on \nrosy economic analyses that say we can buy our way out of the problem. \nThey propose, instead of cutting carbon emissions, powerplants will be \nable to purchase, hopefully, cheap credits from others who, hopefully, \ncut their own carbon emissions elsewhere.\n  They are running models from MIT, Stanford, and Harvard that say the \nprice of buying carbon cuts in other countries will be cheaper than \nforcing U.S. powerplants to reduce their own carbon emissions. I can't \ndispute these are smart people, but I wonder if they are reading the \nnewspaper. Their models show a ton of carbon cuts costing just over $1 \na ton. At that price, they say it would be affordable. Unfortunately, \nlast week the price to purchase a ton of carbon reductions was $31. You \ndo not have to be from Harvard to do that math. That is 31 times more \nexpensive. Do we believe that the cost of carbon credits will drop by \n97 percent after we impose our own cap, when you see the increasing \ndemand for energy from India and China? That I do not believe is \nlikely.\n  Europe's system to cap carbon is certainly in a shambles. European \ncountries are failing miserably to meet their Kyoto carbon-cut \nrequirements. Thirteen of the fifteen original EU signatories are on \ntrack to miss their 2010 emissions targets--by as much as 33 percent in \nSpain and 25 percent in Denmark. Talks to discuss further cuts beyond \nthat, when Kyoto expires, have only produced agreement to talk further. \nIt sounds similar to the Senate these days. We can talk well, but doing \nthings is difficult.\n  If Europe is, for all practical purposes, ignoring their Kyoto carbon \ncommitments and there is no agreement to continue with carbon caps \nafter Kyoto, how can we expect the creation of enough credits? In the \nalternative, if Europeans suddenly decide to rush and meet their \ncommitments by buying up massive amounts of credits to meet their \nshortfalls, how will there be enough credits for a U.S. demand bigger \nthan all of Europe combined?\n  While these questions are complicated, their consequences are simple. \nA mistake on our part could add significantly to the misery of our \nmanufacturing workers. A mistake on our part will add to the hardships \nfamilies face paying their heating and power bills. And one more \nthought: Iran and Saudi Arabia are furiously busy expanding their \npetrochemical industry, based upon their vast supplies of natural gas.\n  I ask unanimous consent an article on that subject be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BOND. This means that not only more cheap foreign chemicals, but \nit means potentially more closed U.S. plants. We must also ask whether \nwe want to add to our oil addiction a new chemical dependency on Iraq, \nIran, and the Middle East.\n  Before we make any hasty decisions, I believe we must have answers to \nthese questions, and we must answer these questions as we begin to \ndebate further carbon cap proposals.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                   [From MEHRNEWS.com, Jan. 2, 2006]\n\n           Iran Striving to Rank First in Ethylene Production\n\n       Iran plans to be number one in producing ethylene in the \n     world--reaching 12 million tons output within the next 10 \n     years--by allocating 17.5 billion dollars in investment for \n     development of petrochemical projects in the Fourth Five-Year \n     Development Plan (2005-2010).\n       The figure stood around 12.5 billion dollars for the first \n     to third development plans (1990-2005) in total.\n       Out of the 25 projects under implementation, the National \n     Petrochemical Company (NPC) have completed 17 and would \n     finish the rest soon, said Hassan Sadat, manager of plans in \n     the NPC.\n       NPC plans to have an output of 25.6 million tons capacity \n     by March 2010 jumping up from 7.3 million tons in 1999, he \n     added.\n       The investment in the sector is forecast to increase by 40 \n     percent in the fourth plan.\n       Sadat said that the output of polymers would reach 10 \n     million tons within the next 10 years. The production of \n     chemical fertilizers, methanol, and aromatic materials would \n     increase to 8 million tons each. NPC has estimated that the \n     country earns some 20 billion dollars from export of \n     petrochemicals only by the date.\n       At present, nearly 52,000 employees work in petrochemical \n     sector that enjoys modern technologies such as ABS, PET--PAT, \n     engineering polymers, isocyanides, DME, and acetic acid.\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Under the previous order, the time until 10:30 \nis equally divided between the two leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, the upcoming cloture vote on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 2271, introduced by my friend Senator Sununu, \nis the first opportunity for my colleagues to go on record on whether \nthey will accept the White House deal on PATRIOT Act reauthorization. \nBack in December, 46 Senators voted against cloture on the conference \nreport. I think it's clear by now that the deal makes only minor \nchanges to that conference report. The Senator from Pennsylvania, \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee and primary proponent of the \nconference report in this body, was quoted yesterday as saying that the \nchanges that the White House agreed to were ``cosmetic.'' And then he \nsaid, according to the AP, ``But sometimes cosmetics will make a beauty \nout of a beast and provide enough cover for senators to change their \nvote.''\n  The Senator from Alabama said on the floor yesterday: ``They're not \nlarge changes, but it made the Senators happy and they feel comfortable \nvoting for the bill today.'' I agree with both of my adversaries on \nthis bill that the changes were minor and cosmetic. I explained that at \nlength yesterday, and no one else other than Senator Sununu came down \nto the floor to defend the deal.\n  Some of my colleagues have been arguing, however, that we should go \nalong with this deal because the conference report, as amended by the \nSununu bill, improves the PATRIOT Act that we passed 4\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  It's hard for me to understand how Senators who blocked the \nconference report in December can now say that it's such a great deal. \nIt's not a great deal--the conference report is just as flawed as it \nwas 2 months ago. No\n\n[[Page S1378]]\n\namount of cosmetics is going to make this beast look any prettier. That \nsaid, let me walk through some of the provisions of the conference \nreport that are being touted as improvements to the original PATRIOT \nAct.\n  First, there's the issue that was the linchpin of the bill the Senate \npassed without objection in July of last year, that of course is the \nstandard for obtaining business records under Section 215. Section 215 \ngives the Government extremely broad powers to secretly obtain people's \nbusiness records. The Senate bill would have required that the \nGovernment prove to a judge that the records it sought had some link to \nsuspected terrorists or spies or their activities. The conference \nreport does not include this requirement. Now, the conference report \ndoes contain some improvements to section 215, at least around the \nedges. It contains minimization requirements, meaning that the \nexecutive branch has to set rules for whether and how to retain and \nshare information about U.S. citizens and permanent residents obtained \nfrom the records. And it requires clearance from a senior FBI official \nbefore the Goverment can seek to obtain particularly sensitive records \nlike library, gun and medical records. But the core issue with section \n215 is the standard for obtaining these records in the first place.\n\n  Neither the minimization procedures nor the high level signoff \nchanges the fact that the Government can still obtain sensitive \nbusiness records of innocent, law-abiding Americans. The standard in \nthe conference report--``relevance''--will still allow Government \nfishing expeditions. That is unacceptable. And the Sununu bill does not \nchange that.\n  Next, let me turn to judicial review of these section 215 orders. \nAfter all, if we are going to give the Government such intrusive \npowers, we should at least let people go to a judge to challenge the \norder. The conference report does provide for this judicial review. But \nit would require that the judicial review be conducted in secret, and \nthat Government submissions not be shared with the challenger under any \ncircumstances, without regard for whether there are national security \nconcerns in any particular case. This would make it very difficult for \na challenger to get meaningful judicial review that comports with due \nprocess.\n  And the Sununu bill does not address this problem.\n  What we have are very intrusive powers, very limited judicial \nreview--and then, on top of it, anyone who gets a section 215 order \ncan't even talk about it. That's right--they come complete with an \nautomatic, indefinite gag order. The new ``deal'' supposedly allows \njudicial review of these gag orders, but that's just more cosmetics. As \nI explained yesterday, the deal that was struck does not permit \nmeaningful judicial review of these gag orders. No judicial review is \navailable for the first year after the 215 order has been issued. Even \nwhen the right to judicial review does finally kick in, the challenger \nhas to prove that the Government acted in bad faith. We all know that \nis a virtually impossible standard to meet.\n  The last point on section 215 is that the conference report, as \namended by Sununu bill, now explicitly permits recipients of these \norders to consult with attorneys, and without having to inform the FBI \nthat they have done so. It does the same thing with respect to national \nsecurity letters. This is an important clarification, but keep in mind \nthat the Justice Department had already argued in litigation that the \nprovision in the NSL statute actually did permit recipients to consult \nwith lawyers. So this isn't much of a victory at all. Making sure that \nrecipients don't have to tell the FBI if they consult a lawyer is an \nimprovement, but it is a minor one.\n  Next let's turn to national security letters or NSLs. These are the \nletters that the FBI can issue to obtain certain types of business \nrecords, with no prior court approval at all.\n  The conference report does provide for judicial review of NSLs, but \nit also gives the Government the explicit right to enforce NSLs and \nhold people in contempt for failing to comply, which was not previously \nlaid out in the statute. In stark contrast to the Senate bill, the \nconference report also would require that the judicial review be \nconducted in secret and that Government submissions not be shared with \na challenger under any circumstances without regard to whether there \nare national security concerns in any particular case. So just like the \nsection 215 judicial review provision, this will make it very difficult \nfor challengers to be successful. Again, the Sununu bill does not \naddress this problem.\n  Of course, NSLs come with gag orders, too. The conference report \naddresses judicial review of these gag orders, but it has the same flaw \nas the Sununu bill with regard to judicial review of the section 215 \ngag rule. In order to prevail, you have to prove that the Government \nacted in bad faith, which, again, would prove to be virtually \nimpossible. The Sununu bill does not modify these provisions at all.\n  Let me make one last point on NSLs. The Sununu bill contains a \nprovision which states that libraries cannot receive an NSL for \nInternet records unless the libraries provide ``electronic \ncommunication services'' as defined by statute. But that statute \nalready applies only to entities that satisfy this definition, so this \nprovision is essentially just restating existing law. It is no \nimprovement at all. Those cosmetics wear pretty thin when you look \nclosely at this deal.\n  Let's turn to sneak-and-peek search warrants. As I laid out in detail \nyesterday, the conference report takes a significant step back from the \nSenate bill by presumptively allowing the Government to wait an entire \nmonth to either notify someone that agents secretly searched their home \nor to get approval from a judge to delay the notice even longer. The \nSenate said it should be 1 week. I have yet to hear any argument at \nall, even in direct debate from the Senator from Alabama, much less a \npersuasive argument, why that amount of time is insufficient for the \nGovernment.\n  The core fourth amendment protections are at stake. This is not like \nflipping a coin: Let's make it 7 days; no, make it 30 days. This \ninvolves people coming into somebody's house without their knowledge \nand how long that should be allowed without telling them you were in \ntheir house. Once again, the Sununu bill does nothing to address this \nissue.\n  Let me talk briefly about roving intelligence wiretaps under section \n206 of the PATRIOT Act. We have not discussed this issue much, in part \nbecause the conference report does partially address the concerns \nraised about this provision. But the conference report language is \nstill not as good as the Senate bill was on this issue. Unlike the \nSenate bill, the conference report does not require that a roving \nwiretap include sufficient information to describe the specific person \nto be wiretapped with particularity. The Sununu bill does not address \nthis problem.\n  Supporters of the conference report say it contains new 4-year \nsunsets for three provisions: section 206, section 215, and the so-\ncalled lone wolf expansion of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nthat passed as a part of the intelligence reform bill in 2004. We \nagree, I am sure, that sunsets are not enough. This reauthorization \nprocess is our opportunity to fix the problems of the PATRIOT Act. Just \nsunsetting bad law again is hardly a real improvement. Of course, \nneither the conference report nor the Sununu bill contains a sunset for \nthe highly controversial national security letter authorities which \nwere expanded by the PATRIOT Act, even though many of us said back in \nDecember that was a very important change we wanted to see made.\n  I have the same response to those who point to the valuable new \nreporting provisions in the conference report: We must make substantive \nchanges to the law, not just improve oversight.\n  I have laid out at length the many substantive reasons to oppose the \ndeal. But there is an additional reason to oppose cloture on the motion \nto proceed; that is, it appears the majority leader is planning to \nprevent Senators from offering and getting votes on amendments to this \nbill.\n  I was on the Senate floor for 9 hours yesterday. I was not asking for \nmuch, just a guarantee that once we moved to proceed to the bill I \ncould offer and get votes on a handful of amendments relavant to the \nbill. There was a time--in fact, I was here--when Senators did not have \nto camp out on the floor to plead for the opportunity to offer\n\n[[Page S1379]]\n\namendments. In fact, offering debate and voting on amendments is what \nthe Senate is supposed to be all about. That is how we craft \nlegislation. But my offer was rejected.\n  It appears as if the other side may try to ram this deal through \nwithout a real amending process. I hope that even colleagues who may \nsupport the deal will oppose such a sham process. It makes no sense to \nagree to go forward without a guarantee that we will be allowed to \nactually try to improve the bill. It is a discourtesy to all Senators, \nnot just me, to try to ram through controversial legislation without \nthe chance to improve it.\n  In sum, I oppose the sham legislative process the Senate is facing, \nand I oppose the flawed deal we are being asked to ratify. \nNotwithstanding the improvements achieved in the conference report, we \nstill have not adequately addressed some of the most significant \nproblems of the PATRIOT Act. I must oppose proceeding to this bill \nwhich will allow this deal to go forward. I cannot understand how \nanyone who opposed the conference report back in December can justify \nsupporting it now. The conference report was a beast 2 months ago, and \nit has not gotten any better looking since then.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on cloture. I reserve the remainder \nof my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Enzi, Lindsey Graham, Jeff Sessions, Saxby \n           Chambliss, John Cornyn, John Thune.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the actions just taken, coupled with the \nagreement we came to last night, set out a sequence I will review later \ntoday. We will have final passage once we get back from the recess. I \nam very disappointed in the fact that on a bill I know will pass \noverwhelmingly, by 90 to 10 or 95 to 5, it has been required of us from \nthe other side of the aisle to be here all day yesterday, today, \ntomorrow, through the recess, Monday when\n\n[[Page S1380]]\n\nwe get back, Tuesday when we get back, and final passage on Wednesday \nmorning, when we know what the outcome will be. It bothers me in two \nregards. First of all, it is a very important piece of legislation. It \nbreaks down and further defines that rough relationship between our law \nenforcement community and our intelligence community. It is an \nimportant tool for the safety and security of the American people and \nthe protection of civil liberties. The bill has been improved and will \nbe overwhelmingly supported.\n\n  Secondly, I am disappointed because it means that we effectively have \nto put off other important business before this body with this \npostponement and this delay, issues that are important, that are \nimmediate, that need to be addressed. The issue of lobbying reform is \nunderway, and we need to address that on the floor sometime in the near \nfuture, such as the issues of LIHEAP and heating, flood insurance, a \nwhole range of bills.\n  It also plays into what has been this pattern of postponement and \ndelay and obstruction. If you look back at what we finished yesterday, \nthe asbestos bill, we were forced to file cloture on the motion to \nproceed, which delays, in essence, for 3 days, consideration of that \nbill. We had debate for a day, with the other side encouraging not to \ntake amendments on that day, allowing 2 days for amendments, but, in \neffect, spending 2 weeks on a bill on which we could have been moving \nmuch quicker.\n  Another example--I mentioned it last night in closing--is the \npensions bill, a bill that passed this body on November 16, 2005, last \nyear, 3 months ago. We asked the Democrats to appoint conferees on \nDecember 15 of last year. We renewed that request on February 1. We \nhave been prepared. We have our conferees ready to go. We know what the \nratio is, but we still have not been able to send that important bill \nto conference. In that regard, I wanted to formally, again, make \nanother request, but we absolutely must begin that conference.\n\n\n                 Unanimous-Consent Request--H. R. 2830\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 357, H.R. 2830, that all after \nthe enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1783, as passed by \nthe Senate, be inserted thereof, that the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nthe Senate insist upon its amendment and request a conference with the \nHouse, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees at a ratio of 7 \nto 5.\n  Mr. REID. Mr President, reserving the right to object, first of all, \non the PATRIOT Act, it is very unusual to bring a bill to the floor and \nallow no amendments.\n  I understand the history of this legislation. We had a cloture vote, \nand cloture was not invoked. It was a bipartisan vote that has now been \nresolved and that Senator Sununu has worked hard to bring it to the \nSenate. I think the majority of the Senate clearly favors this \nlegislation, but Senator Feingold wants to offer amendments. Senator \nLeahy wants to offer an amendment.\n  First of all, we could agree to the motions that are now pending \nbefore the Senate on the PATRIOT Act. The so-called filling the tree \nwas used to block Senator Feingold. We could adopt those amendments \njust like that because they are only date changes and mean very little. \nThey mean nothing, frankly.\n  We could move every bill quickly here if we had no amendments. The \ndistinguished majority leader is saying we are taking time with these \namendments. That is what we do. Senator Feingold has agreed \nreluctantly, but he agreed, and I appreciate that very much. And \nSenator Leahy also agreed that there would be two amendments offered, \none dealing with section 215, the other would deal with the so-called \ngag order. These two amendments would take an extremely limited amount \nof time to debate. We could vote on them today and finish this \nlegislation. The majority leader has decided not to do that. He filled \nthe tree, and that is his right. We understand that. But I think it is \na mistake. I think it sets a bad tone for what we are trying to \naccomplish.\n  In regard to the matter before the Senate now, the unanimous consent \nrequest, which I will respond to, deals with an important piece of \nlegislation. I acknowledge that, and we need to complete it. It will \naffect millions of working Americans. The bill has strong bipartisan \nsupport. It passed out of here by a vote of 97 to 2. As I reminded the \ndistinguished majority leader off microphone, we in the minority worked \nvery hard to get the bill passed. We eliminated amendments that people \nwanted to offer. It was a bipartisan effort by virtue of the extremely \ngood vote we had.\n  We are eager to get to work on producing a conference report that \nwill both strengthen the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and \nprovide certainty to employers who sponsor other types of pensions. The \nvirtual unanimity with which the bill passed the Senate does not mean, \nhowever, that there aren't issues that need to be resolved with the \nHouse.\n  We have 13 titles, and it involves many issues, including changing \nthe myriad of rules that guide employers' pension funding requirements, \nestablishes the proper interest rate for employer funding purposes, and \nfor calculating lump-sum distributions paid to departing employees. \nThere are a couple of other provisions, such as it increases premiums \nof the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, protects older workers who \nare hurt by changes, the so-called cash balance pension plans, and \nfinally, one of the issues is establishing rules to help employees with \n401(k) plans get unbiased investment advice. It expands 401(k) plans to \nmake it easier for employees to be automatically enrolled in these \nplans so they get better savings for their retirements and changes the \nrules to protect spousal benefits.\n\n  Some of these issues are very technical in nature, and there are very \nfew Senators who understand them because they have worked on them. For \nexample, on our side, Senator Harkin is an expert, and all of those \npeople on the Labor Committee acknowledge his expertise in one field. \nSenator Mikulski, the ranking member of the subcommittee, is an expert \nin other areas.\n  So the point I am making is that the majority has said you will have \na conference committee with seven Republicans and five Democrats. I am \nsaying we need eight Republicans and six Democrats. It would allow me \nto offer somebody who I think is vitally important in allowing a better \nproduct to come back from the conference, at least the ability to \ndebate it better.\n  We are not holding up this pension conference. We are not holding it \nup. I say the argument is just as easily made that it is being held up \nby the majority because they refuse to allow us to have 6 members to \nconference, 6 out of 100, on something that will affect hundreds of \nmillions of Americans. I don't think that is asking too much.\n  So we are willing to go to conference in 5 seconds, 5 minutes. I have \nmy conferees ready to go. We need six. It may sound easy putting these \nconference committees together, but it is not. I see on the floor the \nformer majority leader and the former minority leader of the Senate, \nand Senator Frist, the present majority leader, is here. They know how \ndifficult these conference committees are. But I have a unique problem \non this bill, and I need another Democratic member. So I object, unless \nthe ratio is eight Republicans and six Democrats.\n  This is not arm wrestling. This doesn't have to show who is the \ntoughest, that we are all going to hang in there, and we are not going \nto allow this to happen. We are in the minority. We understand that. \nBut we have certain rights also. I don't think it is asking too much to \nincrease the size of this conference. One more Democrat is all we are \nasking for. In exchange for that, of course, you get another \nRepublican.\n  So I hope the ratio--the majority will have two extra Republicans on \nthe conference--is something to which the distinguished majority leader \nwill agree.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, if I can make a \nparliamentary inquiry: First of all, did Senator Reid ask for a \ndifferent UC?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I did, Mr. President. I ask that the request of the \ndistinguished majority leader be amended to allow an eight-to-six \nconference, eight Republicans, six Democrats.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object to that, Mr. President, I \nhesitate\n\n[[Page S1381]]\n\nto tread into these waters because I know how difficult it is to be in \nthe position that these two leaders are in. They have to make tough \nchoices. They have to take into consideration what happens once you get \ninto conference. You have to look at personalities. But frankly, I \nthink seven and five is too big. That is, to me, a pretty large number \nof Senators to be going to conference. I understand that Senator Reid \nhas other Senators who would like to be conferees, and I am sure \nSenator Frist has other Senators who would like to be conferees. In \nfact, most Senators would like to be a conferee on everything, \nparticularly coming out of their committee. That is what this is all \nabout. I wanted to be a conferee on the tax reconciliation bill. I \nworked on it for a year, but I am not. The leader made the choice to go \nwith two others, and I am off. I am not happy about that, and I have \nexplained it to him. It is called leadership. It is called tough \nchoices.\n  By the way, this has been hanging around since December 10. I believe \nthat is when our leadership first said: Let's go to conference. I \nremind my colleagues and our leaders, this is a bipartisan bill. This \nis a bill that passed the Senate overwhelmingly. This is a bill that \npassed the House overwhelmingly. But it is a complex area. We need time \nto work out the difficulties and disagreements on pensions and how it \naffects aviation. None of it is going to be easy. I would think some \nSenators might want to take second thoughts about whether to be on this \nconference because it will be difficult.\n  But we have a time problem. If we don't appoint these conferees this \nweek in the Senate and the House, we won't be able to begin when we \ncome back, and then another week will be frittered away. When you look \nat the calendar, we will have something like maybe 25 days to reach an \nagreement because there is a drop-dead date on this.\n  First of all, at least two airlines are hanging in the balance of \nbankruptcy. They could very easily dump their pensions on the PBGC and \nsay we are out of here. They are trying not to do that. They are trying \nto do the responsible thing for themselves, the taxpayers, and \neverybody.\n  Secondly, the reason why April 15 is a very serious date is because \nthat is when the next quarterly payment is due. Within 2 weeks, \ncompanies are going to have to make a decision: Do I comply or not? Do \nI dump my pension on PBGC or do I go into bankruptcy?\n  We have a time problem. So I know it is not easy, but we need to get \nthis done. I know the leaders have been talking back and forth trying \nto reach an agreeable number to deal with all this, but I say to my \nfriends, it is time to make a decision, and we all have to understand \nwe don't all get to be conferees. I understand that. I don't like it, \nbut I understand it.\n  So I object to a larger number for a lot of reasons, and I urge the \ntwo leaders to come to a quick agreement. Let's get this done in the \nnext 24 hours. Let's show for the first time this year that we can deal \nwith something, as hard as it may be, in a bipartisan way. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to modifying the unanimous \nconsent request. Is there objection to the basic request?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I say to my \nfriend, the junior Senator from Mississippi, this is the first request \nwe have had for a conference. The majority and minority staffs have \nworked on this. They have made significant headway, and I appreciate \nthe work they have done. The House has not appointed their conferees, \nand they are certainly not going to today or tomorrow. So I think what \nwe need to do is understand the importance of this and understand that \nwe are ready to go to conference. We are ready to go to conference. It \nis a question of how many conferees we have.\n  I hope that my friends on the other side of the aisle would agree \nthat it is important to go to conference and that we move forward as \nquickly as we can, allowing people from the Finance Committee--this \nisn't one committee. One reason it is complicated is that there are \nissues dealing with finance and the HELP Committee. So I object to the \ndistinguished majority leader's request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the issue is an important one because of \nthe time constraints that were outlined by my colleague from \nMississippi. This is something we have to work through. It is pretty \nsimple, pretty straightforward, as my colleague from Mississippi said. \nWe just went through appointing the conferees for the tax \nreconciliation bill. I had on the floor here a few minutes ago three \ndifferent people who passionately wanted to be conferees--who worked on \nit, who deserve to be, yet they are not. Part of leadership is \nbasically saying no. Seven to five is a reasonable number that many \npeople think is too large. Seven to five is what it will be. I am \nhopeful that over the next few hours we can come to some resolution and \nappoint conferees. The House is ready to go to conference. We are \nready. We asked to go to conference on December 15 of last year, yet we \nare not to conference.\n  This is a specific problem. Both the Democratic leader and I have \ntalked about this for days, that we both have challenges, but it is \nsomething that is pretty straightforward. The bill has been passed, it \nis ready to go to conference, is addressing a major problem facing \npeople across America, and we need to address it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so I may offer an amendment which is at the \ndesk, amendment No. 2892.\n  Mr. REID. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I should have done this. I have people sending me notes. \nAre we having anymore votes today?\n  Mr. FRIST. Let's decide within the next hour. With the schedule, I \nknow there is still going to be an effort to offer amendments and the \nlike. Why don't we get together and have some sort of announcement \nshortly to our colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside so I may offer an amendment at the desk, No. \n2892.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we can obviously see what is going on \nhere when the majority leader offered those two amendments earlier. He \nwas filling the amendment tree. That means he is trying--in fact, he is \ngoing to do everything he can, and he will succeed, if he wishes--to \nrefuse to allow Senators to improve this bill. Those amendments are \nnothing more than meaningless amendments, the amendments he has \noffered, that have to do with the effective date of the bill. They are \nnothing other than an attempt to prevent me or any other Senator from \ntrying to amend this legislation.\n  Not only was this a take-it-or-leave-it deal from the White House, \nbut now the majority leader and perhaps other Senators are apparently \nafraid of what happens if the Senate actually does its work on this \nissue and has open votes on the merits of these issues.\n  I want everyone to know that is the game that is being played here, \non a bill that has major implications for the rights and freedom of the \nAmerican people. Obviously, when the majority leader talks about how \nurgent it is that this be passed, he is conveniently ignoring the fact \nthat this current law is in effect until March 10, and there is no risk \nwhatsoever that the bill would not be renewed.\n  I am going to speak for a few minutes about the various amendments I \nhave filed and that the majority leader is preventing me from offering.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2892\n\n  Amendment No. 2892 is the amendment that would implement the standard \nfor obtaining section 215 orders that was in the Senate bill the \nJudiciary Committee approved by a vote of 18 to 0 and that was agreed \nto in the Senate without objection. I hope my colleagues remember that. \nWhen the majority leader fills the tree, he is not preventing some type \nof esoteric amendments nobody has ever seen or heard of. Every member \nof the Judiciary Committee already voted for that\n\n[[Page S1382]]\n\nvery provision and no Senator in the entire Senate, including the \nmajority leader, objected to that being in the Senate bill. So this is \nnot some kind of a last-minute deal. This is something the majority \nleader himself never objected to. It is a reasonable amendment that \nevery Senator in one way or another has basically supported.\n  Of all the concerns that have been raised about the PATRIOT Act since \nit was passed in 2001, this is the one that has received the most \npublic attention, and rightly so. This is the one that is often \nreferred to as the ``library provision.'' A reauthorization bill that \ndoesn't fix this provision, in my view, has no credibility.\n  Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act allows the Government to obtain secret \ncourt orders in domestic intelligence investigations to get all kinds \nof business records about people, including not just library records, \nbut also medical records and various other types of business records. \nThe PATRIOT Act allowed the Government to obtain these records as long \nas they were ``sought for'' a terrorism investigation. That is a very \nlow standard. It didn't require that the records concern someone who \nwas suspected of being a terrorist or spy, or even suspected of being \nconnected to a terrorist or spy. It didn't require any demonstration of \nhow the records would be useful in the investigation. Under section \n215, if the Government simply said it wanted records for a terrorism \ninvestigation, the secret FISA court was required to issue the order--\nperiod. To make matters worse, recipients of these orders are also \nsubject to an automatic gag order. They cannot tell anyone that they \nhave been asked for records.\n  Because of the breadth of this power, section 215 became the focal \npoint of a lot of Americans' concerns about the PATRIOT Act. These \nvoices came from the left and the right, from big cities and small \ntowns all across the country. So far, more than 400 State and local \ngovernment bodies have passed resolutions calling for revisions to the \nPATRIOT Act. And nearly every one mentions section 215.\n  The Government should not have the kind of broad, intrusive powers \nthat section 215 provides--not this Government, not any government. The \nAmerican people shouldn't have to live with a poorly drafted provision \nthat clearly allows for the records of innocent Americans to be \nsearched, and just hope that Government uses it with restraint. A \nGovernment of laws doesn't require its citizens to rely on the good \nwill and good faith of those who have these powers--especially when \nadequate safeguards can be written into the laws without compromising \ntheir usefulness as a law enforcement tool. Not one of the amendments I \nam offering would threaten the ability of law enforcement to do what is \nneeds to do to investigate and prevent terrorism.\n  After lengthy and difficult negotiations, the Judiciary Committee \ncame up with language that achieved that goal. It would require the \nGovernment to convince a judge that a person has some connection to \nterrorism or espionage before obtaining their sensitive records. And \nwhen I say some connection, that's what I mean. The Senate bill's \nstandard is the following: No. 1, that the records pertain to a \nterrorist or spy; No. 2, that the records pertain to an individual in \ncontact with or known to a suspected terrorist or spy; or No. 3, that \nthe records are relevant--just relevant--to the activities of a \nsuspected terrorist or spy. That's the three-prong test in the Senate \nbill and I think it is more than adequate to give law enforcement the \npower it needs to conduct investigations, while also protecting the \nrights of innocent Americans. It would not limit the types of records \nthat the Government could obtain, and it does not go as far to protect \nlaw-abiding Americans as I might prefer, but it would make sure the \nGovernment cannot go on fishing expeditions into the records of \ninnocent people.\n\n  The conference report did away with this delicate compromise. It does \nnot contain the critical modification to the standard for section 215 \norders. The Senate bill permits the Government to obtain business \nrecords only if it can satisfy one or more prongs of the three-prong \ntest. This is a broad standard with a lot of flexibility. But it \nretains the core protection that the Government cannot go after someone \nwho has no connection whatsoever to a terrorist or spy or their \nactivities.\n  The conference report replaces the three-prong test with a simple \nrelevance standard. It then provides a presumption of relevance if the \ngovernment meets one of the three-prongs. It is silly to argue that \nthis is adequate protection against a fishing expedition. The only \nactual requirement in the conference report is that the Government show \nthat those records are relevant to an authorized intelligence \ninvestigation. Relevance is a very broad standard that could arguably \njustify the collection of all kinds of information about law-abiding \nAmericans. The three-prongs now are just examples of how the Government \ncan satisfy the relevance standard. That is not simply a loophole or an \nexception that swallows the rule. The exception is the rule, rendering \nbasically meaningless the three-prong test that we worked so hard to \ncreate in the Senate version of the bill.\n  This issue was perhaps the most significant reason that I and others \nobjected to the conference report. So how was this issue addressed by \nthe White House deal to get the support of some Senators? It wasn't. \nNot one change was made on the standard for obtaining section 215 \norders. That is a grave disappointment. The White House refused to make \nany changes at all. Not only would it not accept the Senate version of \nsection 215, which, no member of this body objected to back in July--\nincluding the majority leader--it wouldn't make any change in the \nconference report on this issue at all.\n  So today I offer an amendment to bring back the Senate standard on \nsection 215. It simply replaces the standard in the conference report \nwith the standard from the Senate bill. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis change, which we all consented to 6 months ago, and which was one \nof the core issues that many of us stood up for in December when we \nvoted against cloture on the conference report.\n  I know that some will say they must oppose this amendment because it \nwould disrupt a delicate agreement that has been achieved with the \nWhite House. I disagree. There is no reason we can't reauthorize the \nPATRIOT Act and fix section 215--in fact, there is every reason we \nshould do so. This body has expressed its strongly held views on this \nissue before, and it should do so again. If this issue went to a vote \nin the House I'm confident we would have strong support because the \nHouse has already indicated a willingness to modify section 215 to \nprotect the privacy of innocent Americans. That is the first amendment \nI wanted to offer. Let me next turn to amendment No. 2893.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2893\n\n  The second one is amendment No. 2893. This amendment would ensure \nthat recipients of business records orders under section 215 of the \nPATRIOT Act and recipients of national security letters can get \nmeaningful judicial review of the gag orders that they are subject to.\n  Recipients of both section 215 orders and national security letters \nare subject to automatic, indefinite gag orders. This means both that a \nrecipient cannot tell anyone what the section 215 order or NSL says, \nand that the recipient can never even acknowledge that he or she \nreceived a section 215 order or NSL. Now I understand there may very \nwell be a need to protect the confidentiality of these business records \norders and NSLs in many cases, particularly with regard to the identity \nof the people whose records they seek. But I do not understand why even \nthe fact of their existence must be a secret, forever, in every case. \nEven classified information can undergo declassification procedures and \nultimately become public, when appropriate.\n  So I think that meaningful judicial review of these gag orders is \ncritically important. In fact, these automatic, permanent gag rules \nvery likely violate the first amendment. In litigation challenging the \ngag rule in one of the national security letter statutes, two courts \nhave found first amendment violations because there is no \nindividualized evaluation of the need for secrecy.\n  So what does the reauthorization package do about this serious \nproblem? Under the conference report, as modified by the Sununu bill, \nrecipients would theoretically have the ability to challenge these gag \norders in court, but\n\n[[Page S1383]]\n\nthe standard for getting the gag orders overturned would be virtually \nimpossible to meet. It is not the meaningful judicial review that the \nsponsors of the SAFE Act and so many others have been calling for.\n\n  Let me start with the NSL provision of the conference report. In \norder to prevail in challenging the NSL gag order, the recipient would \nhave to prove that any certification by the Government that disclosure \nwould harm national security or impair diplomatic relations was made in \nbad faith.\n  There would be what many have called a ``conclusive presumption'' the \ngag order stands--unless the recipient can prove that the Government \nacted in bad faith. We all know that is not meaningful judicial review. \nThat is just the illusion of judicial review.\n  Does the White House deal address this problem? It does not. In fact, \nit applies that same very troubling standard of review to judicial \nreview of section 215 gag orders.\n  The conference report that was rejected back in December did not \nauthorize judicial review of the gag order that comes with a section \n215 order at all. That was a serious deficiency. But the White House \ndeal does not solve it. Far from it. Under the deal, there is judicial \nreview of section 215 gag orders, but subject to two limitations that \nare very problematic. First, judicial review can only take place after \nat least a year has passed. And second, it can only be successful if \nthe recipient of the section 215 order proves that the Government has \nacted in bad faith, just as I have described with the NSL provision.\n  My amendment would eliminate the ``bad faith'' showing currently \nrequired for overturning both section 215 and NSL gag orders. And it \nwould no longer require recipients of section 215 orders to wait a year \nbefore they can challenge the accompanying gag orders.\n  That is not everything I would want to address with regard to this \nissue. I am also concerned that the judicial review provisions allow \nthe Government to present its evidence and arguments to the court in \nsecret. But this amendment which I would like to offer is a good solid \nstart. At a time when the Government is asserting extraordinary powers \nand seeking to exercise them without any oversight by the courts, \njudicial review of Government assertions that secrecy is necessary more \nessential than ever.\n  We cannot face the American people and claim that overreaching by the \ngovernment under the PATRIOT  Act cannot happen because the courts have \nthe power to stop it--and then turn around and prevent the courts from \ndoing their job. The illusion of judicial review is almost worse that \nno judicial review at all. In America, we cannot sanction kangaroo \ncourts where the deck is stacked against one party before the case is \neven filed. Obviously, I hope that my colleagues will support this very \nreasonable amendment, if we are given a chance to vote on it. I think \nmany would find it quite pervasive and particularly some of the people \nwho were part of the White House negotiations.\n\n\n                      amendment to add nsl sunset\n\n  The third amendment I would like to offer, No. 2891, would  add to \nthe conference report one additional 4-year sunset provision. It would \nsunset the national security letter  authorities that were expanded by \nthe PATRIOT Act. It would be simply add that sunset to the already \nexisting 4-year sunsets that are in the conference report with respect \nto section 206, section 215, and the lone wolf provision. \n  National Security Letters, or NSLs, are finally starting to get the \nattention they deserve. This authority was expanded by sections 358 and \n505 of the PATRIOT Act. The issue of NSLs has flown under the radar for \nyears, even though many of us have been trying to bring more public \nattention to it. I am gratified that we are finally talking about NSLs, \nin large part due to a lengthy Washington Post story published last \nyear about these authorities.\n  What are NSLs, and why are they such a concern? Let me spend a little \ntime on this because it really is important.\n  National security letters  are issued by the FBI to businesses to \nobtain certain types of  records. So they are similar to section 215 \norders, but with one very critical difference. The Government does not \nneed to get any court approval whatsoever to issue them. It doesn't \nhave to go to the FISA court and make even the most minimal showing. It \nsimply issues the order signed by the special agent in charge of a \nfield office or an FBI headquarters official.\n  NSLs can only be used to obtain certain categories of business \nrecords, While section 215 orders can be used to obtain ``any tangible \nthing.'' But even the categories reachable by an NSL are quite broad. \nNSLs can be used to obtain three types of business records: subscriber \nand transactional information related to Internet and phone usage; \ncredit reports; and financial records, a category that has been \nexpanded to include records from all kinds of everyday businesses like \njewelers, car dealers, travel agents and even casinos.\n  Just as with section 215, the PATRIOT Act expanded the NSL \nauthorities to allow the Government to use them to obtain records of \npeople who are not suspected of being, or even of being connected to, \nterrorists or spies. The Government need only certify that the \ndocuments are either sought for or relevant to an authorized \nintelligence investigation, a far-reaching standard that could be used \nto obtain all kinds of records about innocent Americans. And just as \nwith section 215, the recipient is subject to an automatic, permanent \ngag rule.\n\n  The conference report does nothing to fix the standard for issuing an \nNSL. It leaves in place the breathtakingly broad relevance standard. \nAnd the White House deal doesn't do anything about this either.\n  It is true that the Senate bill does not contain a sunset on the NSL \nprovision. But the Senate bill was passed before the Post brought so \nmuch attention to this issue by reporting about the use of NSLs and the \ndifficulties that the gag rule poses for businesses that feel they are \nbeing unfairly burdened by them. At the very least, I would think that \na sunset of the NSL authorities is justified to ensure that Congress \nhas the opportunity to take a close look at such a broad power. And let \nme emphasize, the sunset in this amendment would only apply to the \nexpansions of NSL authorities contained in the PATRIOT Act, not to pre-\nexisting authorities.\n  I suspect that the NSL power is something that the administration is \nzealously guarding because it is one area where there is almost no \njudicial involvement or oversight. It is the last refuge for those who \nwant virtually unlimited Government power in intelligence \ninvestigations. And that is why the Congress should be very concerned, \nand very insistent on including a sunset of these expanded authorities. \nA sunset is a reasonable step here. It helps Congress conduct oversight \nof these authorities, and requires us to revisit them in 4 years. \nIdeally we could go ahead and actually fix the NSL statutes now, but \nsunsetting the expanded powers would at least be a step in the right \ndirection.\n  Adding this sunset does not change the law in any way. I cannot \nimagine that adopting this amendment would blow up the White House \ndeal. This is a reasonable amendment, and again I want my colleagues to \nhave a chance to vote on it.\n\n\n                        sneak and peek amendment\n\n  The fourth amendment that I have, No. 2894, concerns so-called \n``sneak and peek'' searches, whereby the Government can secretly search \npeople's houses. The Senate bill included compromise language that was \nacceptable to me and the other proponents of the SAFE Act. The \nconference report departs from that compromise in one very significant \nrespect, and the White House deal doesn't address this at all. My \namendment would restore the key component of the Senate compromise by \nrequiring that subjects of sneak and peek searches be notified of the \nsearch within 7 days, unless a judge grants an extension of that time \nbecause there is a good reason to still keep the search secret. It \nmakes no other change to the conference report other than changing 30 \ndays to 7 days.\n  Let me take a little time to put this issue in context and explain \nwhy the difference between 30 days and 7 days is necessary to protect \nan important constitutional right.\n  One of the most fundamental protections in the Bill of Rights is the \nfourth amendment's guarantee that all citizens have the right to ``be \nsecure in\n\n[[Page S1384]]\n\ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects'' against ``unreasonable \nsearches and seizures.'' The idea that the Government cannot enter our \nhomes improperly is a bedrock principle for Americans, and rightly so. \nThe fourth amendment has a rich history and includes in its ambit some \nvery important requirements for searches. One is the requirement that a \nsearch be conducted pursuant to a warrant. The Constitution \nspecifically requires that a warrant for a search be issued only where \nthere is probable cause and that the warrant specifically describe the \nplace to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.\n  Why does the Constitution require that particular description? Well, \nfor one thing, that description becomes a limit on what can be searched \nor seized. If the magistrate approves a warrant to search someone's \nhome and the police show up at the person's business, that search is \nnot valid. If the warrant authorizes a search at a particular address, \nand the police take it next door, they have no right to enter that \nhouse. But here is the key. There is no opportunity to point out that \nthe warrant is inadequate unless that warrant is handed to someone at \nthe premises. If there is no one present to receive the warrant, and \nthe search must be carried out immediately, most warrants require that \nthey be left behind at the premises that were searched. Notice of the \nsearch is part of the standard fourth amendment protection. It's what \ngives effect to the Constitution's requirement of a warrant and a \nparticular description of the place to be searched and the persons or \nitems to be seized.\n\n  Over the years, the courts have faced claims by the Government that \nthe circumstances of a particular investigation require a search \nwithout notifying the target prior to carrying out the search. In some \ncases, giving notice would compromise the success of the search by \ncausing the suspect to flee or destroy evidence. The two leading court \ndecisions on so-called surreptitious entry, or what have come to be \nknown as ``sneak and peek'' searches, came to very similar conclusions. \nThey held that notice of criminal search warrants could be delayed, but \nnot omitted entirely. Both the Second Circuit in U.S. v. Villegas and \nthe Ninth Circuit in U.S. v. Freitas held that a sneak and peek warrant \nmust provide that notice of the search will be given within 7 days, \nunless extended by the court. Listen to what the Freitas court said \nabout such searches:\n\n       We take this position because surreptitious searches and \n     seizures of intangibles strike at the very heart of the \n     interests protected by the Fourth Amendment. The mere thought \n     of strangers walking through and visually examining the \n     center of our privacy interest, our home, arouses our passion \n     for freedom as does nothing else. That passion, the true \n     source of the Fourth Amendment, demands that surreptitious \n     entries be closely circumscribed.\n\n  So when defenders of the PATRIOT Act say that sneak and peek searches \nwere commonly approved by courts prior to the PATRIOT Act, they are \npartially correct. Some courts permitted secret searches in very \nlimited circumstances, but they also recognized the need for prompt \nnotice after the search unless a reason to continue to delay notice was \ndemonstrated. And they specifically said that notice had to occur \nwithin 7 days.\n  Section 213 of the PATRIOT Act didn't get this balance right. It \nallowed notice to be delayed for any ``reasonable'' length of time. \nWhat is ``reasonable''? Information provided by the administration \nabout the use of this provision since 2001 indicates that delays of \nmonths at a time are now becoming commonplace. Those are hardly the \nkind of delays that the courts had been allowing prior to the PATRIOT \nAct. \n\n  I know that the conference report requirement of notice within 30 \ndays was a compromise between the Senate and House provisions. And so, \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania and others will strongly oppose this \namendment, if I ever get to offer it. But let me point out that the \nHouse passed the Otter amendment to completely eliminate the sneak and \npeek provision by a wide bipartisan margin. I hardly think the House \nwill balk at this reasonable amendment that allows these sneak and peek \nreviews but says that after 7 days you have to go back and get an \napplication for more time, or you have to give notice to the persons \nwhose house is intruded upon.\n  More importantly, here is the crucial question that no one has been \nable to answer so far. Listen carefully to the arguments made by the \nopponents of the amendment and see if they answer it this time, if we \never get a chance to debate it. What possible rationale is there for \nnot requiring the Government to go back to a court within 7 days after \na sneak and peek search and demonstrate a need for continued secrecy? \nWhat is the problem here? Why insist that the Government get 30 days of \nsecrecy, instead of 7 days, without getting an extension from the \ncourt? Could it be that they think that the courts usually won't agree \nthat continued secrecy is needed after the search is conducted, so they \nwon't get the 90-day extension? If they have to go back to a court at \nsome point, why not go back after 7 days rather than 30? From the point \nof view of the Government, I don't see the big deal.\n  It amazes me to hear Senators on the floor saying 7 days, 30 days. \nWhat is the difference? This is about big government coming into your \nhome without your knowledge and saying it doesn't matter that you are \nnot given notice in 7 days as opposed to 30 days. I tell you that it \nmatters to people in my State, and it would matter to me. Government \nshouldn't be in your house without notice except for very narrowly \nidentified circumstances that are consistent with the court decisions \nthat allowed the sneak-and-peek provisions in the first place. There is \na big difference between 1 week and 1 month when it comes to something \nlike the Government secretly coming into your home.\n  Suppose, for example, that the Government actually searched the wrong \nhouse. As I mentioned, that is one of the reasons that notice is a \nfourth amendment requirement. The innocent owner of the place that had \nbeen searched might suspect that someone had broken in his house, and \nhe might be living in fear that someone has a key or some other way to \nenter his house. The owner might wonder: When is the intruder going to \nreturn? Do the locks have to be changed?\n  I implore my colleagues to look at this issue from the point of view \nof an innocent person in their own home somewhere in their own home \nState. Why would we make that person wait a month to get an explanation \nrather than a week? Presumably, if the search revealed nothing, and \nespecially if the Government realized the mistake and does not intend \nto apply for an extension, it will be no hardship other than a little \nembarrassment for notice to be given within 7 days.\n  If, on the other hand, the search was successful and revealed illegal \nactivity and notifying the subject would compromise an ongoing \ninvestigation, the Government should have no trouble at all getting a \n90-day extension of the search warrant. All they have to do is walk \ninto the court and tell the judge: Judge, we found something, and we \nare now keeping the place under surveillance because there is ongoing \ncriminal activity taking place there, so give us more time before we \nserve the search warrant.\n  That is all you have to say. What is so hard about that? We all know \nthe judges will give them that. It is perfectly reasonable.\n  The Senate bill is already a compromise on this very controversial \nprovision. There is no good reason not to adopt the Senate's position. \nI have pointed this out repeatedly and no one has ever come to the \nSenate and come up with any explanation of why the Government cannot \ncome back to the court within 7 days of executing the search. The \nSenate provision was what the courts required prior to the PATRIOT Act. \nIt worked fine then. It can work now.\n  Let me make one final point about sneak-and-peek warrants. Do not be \nfooled for a minute that this power has anything to do with just \ninvestigating terrorism or espionage. It does not. Section 213 is a \ncriminal provision that applies in any kind of criminal investigation. \nIn fact, most sneak-and-peek warrants are issued for drug \ninvestigations. So why do I say they are not needed in terrorism \ninvestigations? Because FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct, can also apply to these investigations. FISA search warrants are \nalways executed in secret and never require notice--not in 7 days, not \nin 30 days, not in 180 days, not ever. So\n\n[[Page S1385]]\n\nif you do not want to give notice of a search in a terrorism \ninvestigation, you can get a FISA warrant. So any argument that \nadopting this amendment will interfere with sensitive terrorism \ninvestigations is false. It is false, plain and simple.\n  I look forward to hearing the response of the opponents on this \nissue. I am beginning to lose faith I will ever hear from them. But I \nalso urge my colleagues to listen carefully: Will anyone come forward \nand argue convincingly that 7 days, which the entire Senate approved in \nJuly, is too short of a period of time? If not, we should adopt this \namendment.\n  I have had the opportunity the last few minutes to describe the four \nremaining amendments I have filed. I have tried to explain them \nclearly. These are provisions that are either consistent with or the \nsame as provisions that we approved in the Senate last year by \nunanimous vote in the Judiciary Committee and in a unanimous consent \nagreement in the Senate, which not one single Senator, including the \nmajority leader, objected to. Or they were central to the concerns \nraised by so many Senators late last year. So these are obviously not \nextreme ideas. They are very reasonable ideas.\n  The idea that right after the motion to proceed was approved the \nmajority leader would come and ``fill up the tree,'' which means \npreventing me from offering these amendments on the Senate floor, is a \ndisservice to the Senate and it is a disservice to the American people. \nThe American people are concerned about this legislation. Whether \nMembers of this Senate want to admit it, there is a lot of concern \nabout this legislation. The goal should be to make sure that the law \nenforcement in our country has the tools it needs to fight those who \nare involved in terrorism or spying. But the goal should also be to \nreassure the American people that we are not somehow trying to take \naway the rights and freedoms and privacy of perfectly innocent \nAmericans. I would think all of us would want that to be the way this \nlegislation is perceived.\n  The act of preventing reasonable amendments, under a limited \ntimeframe, on provisions that have already been approved by the Senate \nor that so many Senators have raised concerns about, is a guarantee of \ncausing anxiety and concern on the part of the American people that \nsomething is wrong, that somehow the power grab by this administration \nis out of control.\n  I implore my colleagues to join me in imploring the majority leader \nto allow us to offer these reasonable amendments. That is not only the \nright thing to do, it is our responsibility, as Members of this Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor this \nafternoon to speak for a few minutes about a specific provision, a \nsignificant provision in the PATRIOT Act, the Combat Meth Act. This is \nthe most comprehensive antimethamphetamine legislation ever to be \nintroduced, much less passed, in the Senate. I am hopeful that it will \nbe passed in the Senate, of course, in this legislation and be sent to \nthe President's desk for his signature and then for implementation.\n  Methamphetamine is the worst drug threat that I have confronted in my \n20 years in public life. When I say that, I hope it has some impression \non people. But when career law enforcement officers stand up in various \nforums and say that, I hope people are afraid because this drug should \nmake us afraid. It is almost the ``perfect storm'' of drugs. It is \nalmost immediately addictive.\n  Most people who try methamphetamine get addicted the first time they \ntry it. There is no such thing as casual or recreational use of this \ndrug. It is very damaging to the person who uses it. It changes the \nstructure of the brain. It turns people who use it into more \naggressive-type individuals. Other drugs, as bad as they are, tend to \nmake people more passive. Methamphetamine makes them paranoid. I was \nspeaking with another Senator about this bill a few minutes ago over \nthe telephone, and he mentioned to me that in his State one woman who \nhad been a meth user told him that when she was high on meth, she \nthought her 3-year-old was trying to kill her. This is not uncommon. \nThere is almost no known medical cure for it.\n  Our substance abuse counselors do a heroic job and people have gotten \noff of methamphetamine, but I do want to state that we don't have a \nmethadone for methamphetamine. On top of all of these things, as bad as \nthey are by themselves, this is a drug which, to this point, has not \nonly been consumed and sold in our neighborhoods, as other drugs are, \nit has been primarily, in many States, made in our own neighborhoods in \nlocal labs.\n  The process for making methamphetamine is highly dangerous and toxic. \nSo in addition to all of the problems that go with addiction to deadly \ndrugs, we have, on top of that, a whole set of other problems that you \ndon't have with other drugs that are caused by the fact that \nmethamphetamine is actually made in our neighborhoods. Since the \nprocess for making it is toxic, homes in which methamphetamine is made, \nor in cars--because sometimes they make it in vans--they become toxic \nwaste dumps, huge environmental waste problems for local officials to \nclean up. The fact that the drug is made in home labs creates a whole \nnew set of problems for kids. It is bad enough for a kid if they are \ngrowing up in a home where drugs are being used, but if methamphetamine \nis being cooked, the children become contaminated with toxins.\n  When they pull kids out of those environments, they have to \ndecontaminate them. It can cause permanent health problems. I had a St. \nLouis County firefighting officer tell me that half of the vehicle \nfires they were fighting were methamphetamine related. Those are \nchemical fires. It has strained local budgets to the breaking point \nbecause our counties, in addition to all of the other law enforcement \nactivity, have had to try to knock down, in some cases, hundreds of \nlabs in rural counties. In many cases, there are more rural counties \nwhere they have 5, 6, 8, 10 or 12 deputies trying to patrol the whole \ncounty. It is the ``perfect storm'' of drugs.\n  The only silver lining in the cloud is the fact that in order to make \nmethamphetamine, you must have pseudoephedrine. There are lots of ways \nto make it, but you need pseudoephedrine for making it. For local \ncooks, the only way to get pseudoephedrine is through cold medicines, \nantihistamines. This opened up the possibility for stopping the local \nlabs that take advantage of this.\n  Before going any further--I only have a few minutes--I have to stop \nand congratulate and pay tribute to Senator Feinstein. This bill that \nwe are going to pass--I hope and believe--within the next week or 2, \nstands on the shoulders of the work that she has put in since the mid-\n1990s, when she recognized the danger of pseudoephedrine. She and I are \nthe chief cosponsors of the measure in the Senate. She has been a \npleasure to work with, and her knowledge and expertise were important \nin getting the bill this far. I think she can accurately regard this \nbill as a personal triumph.\n  What does the legislation do? It is a comprehensive approach. There \nare a number of things in it. It will put pseudoephedrine behind the \ncounters in pharmacies and stores. Legitimate consumers will still be \nable to get it, but if you are buying medicines containing \npseudoephedrine without a prescription, you are going to have to show \nan ID and sign a log book, and you won't be able to buy more than 3.6 \ngrams of cold medicine at a time, and 9 grams in one month, which is \nfar more than the average use of any adult for cold medicine anyway. \nThe States that have experimented and have had measures such as this--\nand Oklahoma is a leader, and Iowa has been a leader, and they deserve \ncredit. My home State of Missouri also has a law. The States that have \npassed laws such as this have experienced anywhere from a 70- to an 80-\npercent reduction in local labs.\n  Senator Feinstein and I and all the cosponsors of the bill are \nhopeful that we will get the same results nationally, and we will \nprotect our people, moreover, from people crossing State lines\n\n[[Page S1386]]\n\nto buy the pseudoephedrine in jurisdictions that don't have this \nlegislation. We had a case in Missouri recently when a couple of meth \ncooks left Franklin County, MO, in eastern Missouri, drove across \nIllinois into Indiana and bought over 100 packages of cold medicine in \nIndiana, which is about 140 to 150 grams of pseudoephedrine; they were \nin the process of driving it back to Franklin County to support the \nlocal lab structure there, when they were caught by the Indiana \ntroopers. We are grateful for those troopers.\n\n  That is what is going to go on until we have a national standard. \nThis bill provides a national standard that will be effective 30 days \nafter Presidential signature, and we can expect a 70- to 80-percent \nreduction in local labs around the country as a result of this.\n  There are a number of other provisions in the Combat Meth Act that \nare important, which will provide critical resources to local law \nenforcement to do the cleanup. When you cook meth in a home, it becomes \na toxic waste dump, costing thousands of dollars to clean up. Thousands \nof our deputies and sheriffs and police officers have had to become \ntrained in environmental cleanup because of this drug. We are going to \nprovide additional resources to help them. It will enhance enforcement \nof meth trafficking by requiring additional reporting and certification \nfrom countries that export large amounts of pseudoephedrine. It is \ngoing to help local social services help the kids who are tragically \ntrapped in this environment. There is money for drug-endangered \nchildren rapid response teams. We can help localities with that. We \nprovide extra tools to prosecute meth cooks and traffickers.\n  It is a comprehensive measure, but it is by no means all that we need \nto do. This is a significant first step, and Senator Feinstein and I \nbelieve it will at least substantially eliminate these labs, which then \nwill eliminate a whole set of enormous problems above and beyond the \nproblems caused by addiction to methamphetamine.\n  We are continuing to work with the State Department, the DEA, and \nother agencies to try to interdict shipments of methamphetamine or \npseudoephedrine from abroad. We need to work with relevant committees \nto come up with a new kind of methamphetamine technical assistance \ncenter in Washington, which can help develop better protocols and \nassistance to help those people who are on meth and want to get off of \nit. I think it is an important part of the drug war to say to people: \nLook, if you are addicted to a drug and you want help, we want to help \nyou. If what you want to do is cook this drug or make it and sell it to \nour kids, we are going to stop you.\n  That is a piece that we need to work on, and I think we will work on \nit. We have had assurances from the relevant Committee chairs and \nranking members that we can do that. We need to pass this bill now. I \nam grateful--and I know Senator Feinstein is as well--to the leaders in \nboth parties for their bipartisan leadership and to the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Specter and Senator Leahy, for allowing us to put \nthis bill on the PATRIOT Act. We are grateful, also, to the Senate for \nits unanimous support of this bill over the last few months.\n  Mr. President, we can do important things. We can do good things for \npeople, and we can do them the right way. That is how I look at the \nCombat Meth Act. It is going to make a difference immediately in \nneighborhoods and communities around the country, and it has been done \non a thoroughly bipartisan basis from the beginning, when Senator \nFeinstein and I cosponsored it.\n  So I am pleased to be here to speak on behalf of the bill as a whole \nand also on behalf of this specific provision. I hope we can move \nexpeditiously to final passage so that this important legislation can \nbe signed by the President and can become law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about S. 2271, Senator \nSununu's bill to amend the PATRIOT Act. I commend Senator John Sununu \nof New Hampshire for his extraordinary efforts on this bill.\n  For over 2 years he has been part of a bipartisan coalition, which I \nhave been happy to join him in, working to reform the PATRIOT Act. We \nsupport the PATRIOT Act. We want it to include checks and balances to \nprotect the constitutional rights of Americans. In other words, we want \nto improve the PATRIOT Act, not abandon it.\n  We came together across party lines for this effort because our \nnational security and constitutional rights are important to every \nAmerican. The PATRIOT Act should not be a political football.\n  When we launched this effort 2 years ago, the administration said \nchanging even one word in the PATRIOT Act was unacceptable. I have said \nthat when it comes to writing laws, with the exception of the Ten \nCommandments which were handed down on stone tablets, there are no \nperfect laws; we should always try to improve them.\n  Now, with Senator Sununu's bill and the PATRIOT Act conference \nreport, we will reauthorize the PATRIOT Act with significant reforms, \nreforms we proposed as long as 2 years ago.\n  Let me say up front this outcome is far from perfect. There is still \na lot of work to be done.\n  But the administration was willing to let the PATRIOT Act expire \nrather than accept some of the reforms we proposed. We will not let \nthat happen. The PATRIOT Act will not expire on our watch.\n  We are going to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act with new checks and \nbalances that will help protect innocent Americans, but we will not \nstop our fight for additional necessary reforms.\n  Let me take a few minutes to review the history of the PATRIOT Act. \nDuring a time of national crisis, shortly after September 11, the \nPresident came to us, asking Congress for new tools and new authority \nto fight terrorism. While the ruins of the World Trade Center were \nstill smoldering, Congress responded on a bipartisan basis, with \ndispatch, to give this administration what they wanted to be able to \nfight terrorism. We passed the PATRIOT Act with overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport.\n  We understood it was a unique moment in history. We had to act \nquickly. Even then we were concerned that perhaps the PATRIOT Act went \ntoo far. So we included sunsets so we could review this law after four \nyears and reflect on whether we had made the right decision.\n  There is now a widespread, bipartisan consensus that the PATRIOT Act \nwent too far in several specific areas. The vast majority of the \nprovisions of the PATRIOT Act are not controversial. But in a few \nspecific areas, there is broad agreement that the PATRIOT Act does not \ninclude adequate checks and balances to protect the civil liberties of \ninnocent Americans.\n  As a result, Senator Larry Craig and I introduced the Security and \nFreedom Enhancement Act, also known as the SAFE Act, to address these \nspecific areas of concern. We were joined by our colleagues Senators \nSununu, Feingold, Murkowski, and Salazar.\n  We crossed a broad and wide political divide to come together. This \nis really the gathering of political odd fellows, but we all shared the \nsame goal: protecting constitutional freedoms while still protecting \nthe security of America.\n  The administration threatened to veto the SAFE Act if it ever came \nbefore them. They claimed that it would ``eliminate'' some PATRIOT Act \npowers. In fact, the SAFE Act would not repeal a single provision of \nthe PATRIOT Act. It would retain the expanded powers created by the \nPATRIOT Act but place important limits on these powers.\n  The bill attracted an enormous amount of support from across the \npolitical spectrum, from the most conservative to the most liberal \ngroups in Washington. I have never seen another bill like our SAFE Act \nthat attracted that kind of support.\n  It also was supported by the American Library Association because it \nwould prevent the Government from snooping through the library records \nof innocent Americans.\n  I thank America's librarians for their efforts and tell them that it \npaid off.\n\n[[Page S1387]]\n\nThey were not taking a hysterical position, as some in the \nadministration branded it. They were taking the right position--\nstanding up for the freedoms we hold dear in this country.\n  The conference report, as amended by the Sununu bill, includes a \nnumber of checks and balances that are based on provisions of the SAFE \nAct.\n  Under the PATRIOT Act, the FBI is now permitted to obtain a John Doe \nroving wiretap, a sweeping authority never before authorized by \nCongress. A John Doe roving wiretap does not specify the person or \nphone to be wiretapped. In other words, the FBI can obtain a wiretap \nwithout telling a court whom they want to wiretap or where they want to \nwiretap.\n  Like the SAFE Act, the PATRIOT Act conference report would continue \nto allow roving wiretaps, but it places a reasonable limit on these so-\ncalled John Doe roving wiretaps. In order to obtain a John Doe roving \nwiretap, the Government would now be required to describe the specific \ntarget of the wiretap to the judge who issues the wiretap order. This \nwill help protect innocent Americans.\n  Under the PATRIOT Act, the FBI can search your home without telling \nyou until some later date. These sneak-and-peek searches are not \nlimited to terrorism cases.\n  Like the SAFE Act, the conference report would require the Government \nto notify a person who is subjected to a sneak-and-peek search within a \nspecific period of time, 30 days, rather than the undefined delay \ncurrently permitted by the PATRIOT Act. The court could allow \nadditional delays of notice under compelling circumstances.\n  Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act is often called the library records \nprovision. This section has been the focus of much of our efforts.\n  Under section 215, the FBI can obtain your library, medical, \nfinancial, or gun records simply by claiming they are seeking the \nrecords for a terrorism investigation. If the FBI makes this claim, the \ncourt must issue an order. It has no ability to even question the FBI \nabout why they want to look into your sensitive personal information. \nThis type of court approval is nothing more than a rubberstamp.\n  Defenders of this section often compare to it a subpoena by a grand \njury in a criminal case, but it couldn't be more different. A person \nwho receives a grand jury subpoena can challenge it in court. A person \nwho receives a section 215 order cannot go to a judge to challenge the \norder, even if he believes his rights have been violated.\n  Courts have held that it is unconstitutional to deny someone the \nright to go to court to challenge an order like this.\n  Also, unlike a person who receives a grand jury subpoena, the \nrecipient of a section 215 gag order is subject to an automatic \npermanent gag order.\n  And a person who receives a Section 215 order has no right to go to a \njudge to challenge the gag order. Courts have held that gag orders that \ncannot be challenged in court violate the first amendment.\n  Like the SAFE Act, the PATRIOT Act conference report, as amended by \nSenator Sununu's bill, will place some reasonable checks on section \n215.\n  In order to obtain a section 215 order, the Government will now have \nto convince a judge that they have reasonable grounds to believe the \ninformation they seek is relevant to a terrorism investigation. The \ncourt will have the ability to question the FBI before issuing a \nsection 215 order.\n  This is an improvement, but I'm still concerned that the Government \nis not required to show a connection to a suspected terrorist in order \nto obtain section 215 order. I will speak more about this later.\n  The FBI will also be required to follow so-called minimization \nprocedures. These procedures should help to protect innocent Americans \nby limiting the retention and dissemination of information obtained \nwith section 215 orders.\n  The recipient of section 215 order will now have the ability to \nconsult with an attorney.\n  Judicial oversight will also be enhanced. The recipient of a section \n215 order will now have the right to challenge the order in court on \nthe same grounds as he could challenge a grand jury subpoena.\n  And, if Senator Sununu's bill passes, the recipient of a section 215 \norder will also have the right to challenge the gag order in court.\n  The PATRIOT Act expanded the Government's authority to use national \nsecurity letters which are also known as NSLs.\n  An NSL is a type of administrative subpoena. It is a document signed \nby an FBI agent that requires businesses to disclose the sensitive \npersonal records of their customers.\n  An NSL does not require the approval of a judge or a grand jury. A \nbusiness that receives an NSL is subject to an automatic, permanent gag \norder.\n  As with section 215 orders, a person cannot go to a judge to \nchallenge an NSL or the NSL's gag order, and he can't consult with an \nattorney.\n  Like the SAFE Act, the PATRIOT Act conference report, as amended by \nSenator Sununu's bill, will place some reasonable checks on NSLs.\n  Most important, the Sununu bill clarifies that the government cannot \nissue a national security letter to a library that is functioning in \nits traditional role, which includes providing computer terminals with \nbasic Internet access.\n  As with section 215 orders, the recipient of an NSL will now have the \nright to consult with an attorney, and the right to challenge the NSL \nor the NSL's gag order in court.\n  Like the SAFE Act, the conference report will also require public \nreporting on the use of PATRIOT Act authorities, including the number \nsection 215 orders and NSLs issued by the Government.\n  Finally, the conference report includes a sunset on three provisions \nof the law, including section 215, so Congress will again have an \nopportunity to review the PATRIOT Act at the end of 2009.\n  As I said earlier, the conference report is not perfect. That's the \nnature of a compromise.\n  I am especially concerned about the need for additional checks on \nsection 215 and national security letters.\n  The conference report would allow the Government to use section 215 \norders or NSLs to obtain sensitive personal information without showing \nsome connection to a suspected terrorist. I fear that this could lead \nto Government fishing expeditions that target innocent Americans.\n  In this country, you have the right to be left alone by the \nGovernment unless you have done something to warrant scrutiny.\n  When the FBI is conducting a terrorism investigation they shouldn't \nbe able to snoop through your library, medical, or gun records unless \nyou have some connection to a suspected terrorist.\n  I am also very concerned about unnecessary limits on judicial review \nof section 215 national security letter gag orders. The conference \nreport requires the court to accept the Government's claim that a gag \norder should not be lifted, unless the court determines the Government \nis acting in bad faith. This will make it difficult to get meaningful \njudicial review of a gag order.\n  As I said earlier, our bipartisan coalition is going to keep working \nfor additional reforms to the PATRIOT Act.\n  In fact, Senator Craig, Senator Sununu and I plan to introduce an \nupdated version of the SAFE Act to address the problems that still \nexist with the PATRIOT Act.\n  Our great country was founded by people who fled a government that \nrepressed their freedom in the name of security. The Founders wanted to \nensure that the United States Government would respect its citizens' \nliberties, even during times of war. That's why there is no wartime \nexception in the Constitution.\n  The 9/11 Commission said it best: The choice between security and \nliberty is a false one. Our bipartisan coalition believes the PATRIOT \nAct can be revised to better protect civil liberties. We believe it is \npossible for Republicans and Democrats to come together to protect our \nfundamental constitutional rights and give the Government the powers it \nneeds to fight terrorism. We believe we can be safe and free.\n  That's why we're going to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act with new checks \nand balances. And that's why we'll keep fighting for additional reforms \nto the PATRIOT Act.\n  Senators Craig, Sununu, and others have joined me in improving the \nPATRIOT Act as originally written. There\n\n[[Page S1388]]\n\nare still serious problems with the PATRIOT Act, but I think this \nconference report, as amended by Senator Sununu's bill, is a positive \nstep forward. That is why I am supporting it.\n  I promise, as they say, eternal vigilance, watching this \nadministration and every administration to make certain they don't go \ntoo far. If they overstep, if they step into areas of privacy and \nconstitutional rights, I will speak out and do my best to change the \nPATRIOT Act and make it a better law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                 Report on Fda Approval Process for Vns\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to address my fellow Senators, in \ncooperation with my friend, Senator Baucus from Montana, on an issue \nthat our respective staffs have been working on together for a long \ntime. As chairman of the Finance Committee and as ranking member, we \nare releasing today a report. We come to the floor with our duties in \nmind to our constituents, to Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries, and \nto all Americans, to speak of urgent matters that should concern all of \nus.\n  For more than 2 years, I have followed, with increasing concern, the \nperformance of the Food and Drug Administration. It seems as though \nevery week, if not every day, some new danger or risk is brought to \nlight about an FDA-approved drug or device. As chairman and ranking \nmember of the committee, Senator Baucus and I have a responsibility to \nAmerican taxpayers to ensure that Medicare and Medicaid programs pay \nfor medical products that have been appropriately approved in \naccordance with all laws and regulations. Whether a product is safe, \nwhether a product is effective is not only a major public safety \nconcern; it also has important financial concerns.\n  We understand there is a human element to the Food and Drug \nAdministration's approval process. As a society, we recognize the \nanguish of families who must rely on the development of innovative, \nexperimental, new medical products and treatments that may or may not \nsave the life of a loved one. Our Nation is lucky to have a private \nmarketplace that is incredibly resourceful and prolific in the field of \nmedicine. An integral role of the Food and Drug Administration is to \nget these potentially lifesaving products to the market without undue \ndelay. We also have a Government-regulated system where patients have \nthe option to receive potentially lifesaving but unproven products by \nparticipating voluntarily in clinical trials. In the end, however, our \nNation's well-founded medical system, despite its weaknesses, must \nalways rest on sound science.\n  The report we are releasing today focuses on the FDA's approval \nprocess for medical devices. It is indisputable that all medical \ndevices carry risks, but Food and Drug Administration approval is still \nconsidered the gold standard for safety and effectiveness. However, our \ncommittee staff report raises legitimate questions about the FDA's \ndecision to approve a specific medical device. Last February, a number \nof concerns were raised to our committee about an implantable device \ncalled the vegus nerve stimulator or VNS, as I will refer to it. This \nproduct, VNS, is manufactured by a company called Cyberonics. Senator \nBaucus and I asked our committee staff to review the concerns that were \ngiven to us and report their findings. This report has three major \nfindings which I will summarize briefly.\n  First, the Food and Drug Administration approved VNS for treatment-\nresistant depression, a new indication for this surgically implanted \ndevice. That was based upon a senior manager overruling more than 20 \nFood and Drug Administration scientists, medical, and safety officers, \nas well as managers, who reviewed the data on VNS. The high-level \nofficial approved the device despite a resolute conclusion by many at \nthe FDA that the device did not demonstrate a reasonable assurance of \nsafety and effectiveness.\n  Second, the Food and Drug Administration has not made public the \nlevel of internal dissent involved in this device approval, despite the \nfact that the FDA has publicized differences of scientific opinion \nwithin the agency when it has announced other controversial regulatory \ndecisions.\n  Third, the Food and Drug Administration has not ensured that the \npublic has all the accurate, science-based information on the safety \nand effectiveness of the VNS for treatment-resistant depression. So \nhealth care providers, relying on the FDA's information about this \ndevice, may not be able to convey complete risk information to each \npatient.\n  In the end, this senior Food and Drug Administration official not \nonly overruled more than 20 Food and Drug Administration employees, but \nhe stated to our committee staff that the public would not be made \naware of the scientific dissent over whether the device is reasonably \nsafe and effective. Until today, this official's detailed conclusions \nremain confidential and unavailable to the public. We are releasing \nthese confidential conclusions in the appendix to the report. Some of \nhis own conclusions raise serious questions in our minds. For example, \nI quote from his override memorandum:\n\n       I think it needs to be stated clearly and unambiguously \n     that [certain VNS data] failed to reach, or even come close \n     to reaching, statistical significance with respect to its \n     primary endpoint. I think that one has to conclude that, \n     based on [that] data, either the device has no effect, or, if \n     it does have an effect, that in order to measure that effect \n     a longer period of follow-up is required.\n\n  The events and circumstances surrounding the Food and Drug \nAdministration's review and approval of VNS for treatment-resistant \ndepression, which you will find detailed in this report we are \nreleasing, raises critical questions about the Food and Drug \nAdministration's so-called ``authoritative'' approval process. I am \ngreatly concerned that the Food and Drug Administration standard for \napproval may not have been met here. If that is the case, it raises \nfurther difficult questions, including whether Medicare and Medicaid \ndollars should be used to pay for this device now.\n  Accordingly, we are forwarding the report to Secretary Leavitt, \nAdministrator McClellan, and Acting Commissioner von Eschenbach for \ntheir consideration and comment. These are difficult matters that \ndeserve their full attention.\n  Before I close, I commend the commitment and dedication of the more \nthan 20 FDA scientists who tried to do the right thing in this case, as \nthey probably do in every case, and not stray from evidence-based \nscience. I applaud their effort on behalf of the American people.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the executive summary of the report be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          I. Executive Summary\n\n       The United States Senate Committee on Finance (Committee) \n     has exclusive jurisdiction over the Medicare and Medicaid \n     programs. Accordingly, the Committee has a responsibility to \n     the more than 80 million Americans who receive health care \n     coverage under Medicare and Medicaid to oversee the proper \n     administration of these programs, including the payment for \n     medical devices regulated by the Food and Drug Administration \n     (FDA). Given the rising health care costs in this country, \n     and more importantly, in the interest of public health and \n     safety, Medicare and Medicaid dollars should be spent on \n     drugs and devices that have been appropriately deemed safe \n     and effective for use by the FDA, in accordance with all laws \n     and regulations.\n       In February 2005, Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) and \n     Senator Max Baucus (D-MT), Chairman and Ranking Member of the \n     Committee, initiated an inquiry into the FDA's handling of \n     Cyberonics, Inc.'s (Cyberonics) pre-market approval \n     application to add a new indication--treatment-resistant \n     depression (TRD)-to Cyberonics's Vagus Nerve Stimulation \n     (VNS) Therapy System, an implanted pulse generator. The \n     Chairman and Ranking Member initiated the inquiry in response \n     to concerns that were raised regarding Cyberonics's VNS \n     Therapy System for TRD. On July 15, 2005, the FDA approved \n     the device for TRD.\n       The investigative staff of the Committee reviewed documents \n     and information obtained and received from the FDA and \n     Cyberonics and found the following:\n       As the federal agency charged by Congress with ensuring \n     that devices are safe and effective, the FDA approved the VNS \n     Therapy System for TRD based upon a senior official \n     overruling the comprehensive scientific evaluation of more \n     than 20 FDA scientists, medical officers, and management \n     staff who reviewed Cyberonic's application over the course of \n     about 15 months. The official approved the device despite the \n     conclusion of the FDA reviewers that the data provided by \n     Cyberonics in support of its application for a\n\n[[Page S1389]]\n\n     new indication did not demonstrate a reasonable assurance of \n     safety and effectiveness sufficient for approval of the \n     device for TRD.\n       The FDA's formal conclusions on safety and effectiveness do \n     not disclose to doctors, patients or the general public the \n     scientific dissent within the FDA regarding the effectiveness \n     of the VNS Therapy System for TRD. The FDA has publicized \n     differences of scientific opinion within the agency when it \n     has announced other controversial regulatory decisions. \n     Throughout the review of Cyberonics's application, the team \n     of FDA scientists, medical officers, and management staff \n     involved recommended that the device not be approved for TRD. \n     However, at every stage of the review, the team was \n     instructed by the FDA official, who ultimately made the \n     decision to approve the device, to proceed with the next \n     stage of pre-market review.\n       The FDA has not ensured that the public has all of the \n     accurate, science-based information regarding the VNS Therapy \n     System for TRD it needs. Health care providers relying on the \n     FDA's public information on the safety and effectiveness of \n     this device may not be able to convey complete risk \n     information to their patients, because not all of the \n     relevant findings and conclusions regarding the VNS Therapy \n     System have been made available publicly.\n       The FDA has an important mission:\n       The FDA is responsible for protecting the public health by \n     assuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and \n     veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our \n     nation's food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit \n     radiation. The FDA is also responsible for advancing the \n     public health by helping to speed innovations that make \n     medicines and foods more effective, safer, and more \n     affordable; and helping the public get the accurate, science-\n     based information they need to use medicines and foods to \n     improve their health.\n       As part of that mission, the FDA weighs the risks and \n     benefits of a product, in this case a medical device, to \n     determine if the product is reasonably safe and effective for \n     use.\n       The facts and circumstances surrounding the FDA's approval \n     process for the VNS Therapy System for TRD raise legitimate \n     questions about the FDA's decision to approve that device for \n     the treatment of TRD. While all implantable medical devices \n     carry risks, it is questionable whether or not the VNS \n     Therapy System for TRD met the agency's standard for safety \n     and effectiveness. The FDA's approval process requires a \n     comprehensive scientific evaluation of the product's benefits \n     and risks, including scientifically sound data supporting an \n     application for approval. Otherwise health care providers and \n     insurers as well as patients may question the integrity and \n     reliability of the FDA's assessment of the safety and \n     effectiveness of an approved product. In the case of VNS \n     Therapy for TRD, the FDA reviewers concluded that the data \n     limitations in Cyberonics's application could only be \n     addressed by conducting a new study prior to approval. \n     However, in the present case, instead of relying on the \n     comprehensive scientific evaluation of its scientists and \n     medical officers, it appears that the FDA lowered its \n     threshold for evidence of effectiveness. Contrary to the \n     recommendations of the FDA reviewers, the FDA approved the \n     VNS Therapy System for TRD and allowed Cyberonics to test its \n     device post-approval.\n       In addition, given the significant scientific dissent \n     within the FDA regarding the approval of the VNS Therapy \n     System for TRD, the FDA's lack of transparency with respect \n     to its review of the device is particularly troubling. The \n     FDA has limited the kind and quality of information publicly \n     available to patients and their doctors and deprived them of \n     information that may be relevant to their own risk-benefit \n     analysis. Patients and their doctors should have access to \n     all relevant findings and conclusions from the comprehensive \n     scientific evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the \n     VNS Therapy System for TRD to enable them to make fully \n     informed health care decisions.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor for my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I join the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley, in commending our Finance Committee staff \non the report that we release today. This report deals with an \nimportant public safety matter. The Food and Drug Administration \napproval process has long been considered the gold standard in this \ncountry. We rely on the FDA to review drugs and to review medical \ndevices. We rely on the FDA to tell us, by providing a seal of \napproval, that drugs and devices are safe and that they are effective.\n  While all drugs and devices carry some risk, some are more risky than \nothers. But if the FDA determines a drug or device is safe to bring to \nthe market, Americans generally feel we can use the treatment without \nundue concern. We Americans rely on the FDA to ensure that \nmanufacturers provide sufficient warnings of their products' risks so \nthat health care providers and patients can make informed health care \ndecisions.\n  The FDA has a complex approval process. A review team, including \nscientists, doctors, and specialists, surveys all the data and makes a \nrecommendation regarding whether to approve a drug or device. The \nreview team then forwards its recommendation to management for review. \nThis process can be lengthy and intense.\n  Last year, concerns were brought to the Finance Committee regarding \nhow the review process had unfolded in the case of a device known as \nthe VNS Therapy system. Cyberonics makes the VNS system and was seeking \napproval of the device for use in patients with treatment-resistant \ndepression. Chairman Grassley and I asked our committee staffs to look \ninto what had gone on.\n  The Finance Committee has the responsibility for the Medicare and \nMedicaid Programs and the millions of Americans who receive health \ncare, including the use of safe and proper medical devices. Medicare \nand Medicaid only pay for drugs and devices which FDA has approved. So \napproval affects patients' budgets and the Federal budget, as well.\n  In the case of the VNS Therapy system, the FDA review team was \ncomprised of more than a dozen FDA staff, including doctors, \nscientists, safety officers, and statisticians. This review team \nunanimously recommended against FDA approval. The team argued that the \ndata were insufficient to justify approval and that additional \npremarket testing was in order. Three levels of management concurred \nwith the team's recommendation. The uppermost manager--the Director of \nthe Center for Devices--disagreed. With the stroke of a pen, he \noverruled the analysis and conclusions of his staff, and he approved \nthe device. Now the FDA seal of approval has been attached to that VNS \nTherapy system by one person, over the objections of several technical \nexperts who studied the device.\n  Without this report from the Finance Committee, the public would not \nknow that the team of scientists and doctors who reviewed this device \ndid not believe it should be approved. Without this report, there would \nbe no way for providers and patients to make fully informed health care \ndecisions because they would not be aware of all of the risks.\n  In short, we present this report out of a concern for public safety. \nWe believe that doctors and patients considering this device should \nknow that it was approved over the objection of a team of seasoned \nscientists. It is important for the public to know what the FDA \nscientists and doctors thought about the risk to which patients would \nbe exposed. The FDA has not made public any information regarding the \nlevel of scientific dissent. So I am glad we have this report.\n  I am greatly concerned about this unusual turn of events at the FDA. \nI hope this is not a sign of things to come. I hope that FDA approval \ncan remain the gold standard, and I hope Medicare and Medicaid can \ncontinue to pay for FDA-approved products knowing they are safe.\n  I thank Chairman Grassley for his work. He has worked diligently, as \nhe always does, particularly when wrongs should be exposed. I \nappreciate it when we can work together to improve the efficacy and \nsafety of American health care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Baucus and Mr. Durbin pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2303 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at this moment, I wish to address the bill \npending before the Senate, and that is S. 2271.\n  I commend Senator John Sununu of New Hampshire, who is here in the \nChamber. Were it not for his hard work, we would not be here today. For \nweeks, while many of us were doing other things back home, Senator \nSununu was working assiduously with the White House to find a way to \naddress some very vexing and challenging issues when it came to \nmodifying the PATRIOT Act. He has done an excellent job. I commend him \nand tell him that I have enjoyed working with him\n\n[[Page S1390]]\n\nover the last 2 years, where we have crossed party lines and tried to \nfind ways to keep the PATRIOT Act as a tool to make America safe but \nalso at the same time to protect our basic liberties.\n  Every step of the way, as we considered changes to the PATRIOT Act, \nwe have been supported by our Nation's librarians. These are wonderful \nmen and women--professionals--who are dedicated to the libraries across \nAmerica, which are such rich resources. I thank the librarians of \nAmerica, especially for their heroic efforts to amend the PATRIOT Act \nin a responsible way and, equally as important, to defend our \nConstitution.\n  I understand that section 5 of Senator Sununu's bill, S. 2271, will \nhelp protect the privacy of Americans' library records. I ask the \nindulgence of the Chair that I might enter into a colloquy with Senator \nSununu relative to section 5. I would like to ask Senator Sununu, \nthrough the Chair, if he could explain to me what section 5 will \naccomplish.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I am pleased to be on the floor today and \npleased to be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel on PATRIOT \nreauthorization, thanks to the work of Senator Durbin and others. We \nhave legislation before us that will make the adjustments to the \nPATRIOT Act reauthorization conference report mentioned by the Senator \nfrom Illinois. He specifically mentioned section 5 of our legislation. \nAs he began to describe, section 5 is intended to clarify current law \nregarding the applicability of National Security Letters to libraries.\n  A National Security Letter is a type of administrative subpoena, a \npowerful tool available to law enforcement officials, to get access to \ndocuments. It is a document signed by an FBI agent that requires a \nbusiness to provide certain kinds of personal records on their \ncustomers to the Government. These subpoenas are not approved by a \njudge before being issued.\n  What we did in this legislation is add clarifying language that \nstates that libraries operating in their traditional functions: lending \nbooks, providing access to digital books or periodicals in digital \nformat, and providing basic access to the Internet would not be subject \nto a national security letter. There is no National Security Letter \nstatute existing in current law that permits the FBI explicitly to \nobtain library records. But, as was indicated by the Senator from \nIllinois, librarians have been concerned that existing National \nSecurity Letter authority is vague enough so that it could be used to \nallow the Government to treat libraries as they do communication \nservice providers such as a telephone company or a traditional Internet \nservice provider from whom consumers would go out and get their access \nto the Internet and send and receive e-mail.\n  Section 5 clarifies, as I indicated, that a library providing basic \nInternet access would not be subject to a national security letter, \nsimply by virtue of making that access available to the public.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. It is my \nunderstanding that most public libraries, as he explained, offer \nInternet access to the public. Because of this, they are concerned that \nthe Government might consider them to be communications service \nproviders similar to the traditional providers, such as AT, Verizon, \nand AOL.\n  So if I understand it correctly, your bill clarifies that libraries, \nsimply because they provide basic Internet access, are not \ncommunications service providers under the law and are not subject to \nnational security letters as a result. I ask the Senator from New \nHampshire, through the Chair, is that a correct conclusion?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I absolutely believe that the conclusion \nof the Senator from Illinois is correct. A library providing basic \nInternet access would not be subject to a National Security Letter as a \nresult of that particular service and other services that are very much \nin keeping with the traditional role of libraries.\n  Some have noted or may note that basic Internet access gives library \npatrons the ability to send and receive e-mail by, for example, \naccessing an Internet-based e-mail service. But in that case, it is the \nWeb site operator who is providing the communication service--the \nInternet communication service provider itself--and not the library, \nwhich is simply making available a computer with access to the \nInternet.\n  So I certainly share the concerns of the Senator from Illinois and \nothers who have worked very long and hard on this and other provisions. \nI think it does add clarity to the law as he described, in addition to \nproviding other improvements to the PATRIOT Act as they relate to civil \nliberty protections. All along, this has been about providing law \nenforcement with the tools that they need in their terrorism \ninvestigations while, at the same time, balancing those powers with the \nneed to protect civil liberties. I think, in the legislation before us, \nwe have added clarity to the law in giving access to the courts to \nobject to section 215 gag orders and, of course, striking a very \npunitive provision dealing with counsel and not forcing the recipient \nof a National Security Letter to disclose the name of their attorney to \nthe FBI.\n  All of these are improvements to the underlying legislation, and I \nrecognize that we had a overwhelming, bipartisan vote today to move \nforward on this package. I anticipate that we will have similar \nbipartisan votes in the days ahead to conclude work on this legislation \nand get a much improved PATRIOT Act signed into law.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire, as well, because \nthat clarification is important. So if a library offers basic Internet \naccess, and within that access a patron can, for example, send and \nreceive e-mail by accessing an Internet-based e-mail service such as \nHotmail, for example, that does not mean the library is a \ncommunications service provider and, therefore, it does not mean that a \nlibrary could be subject to these national security letters of \ninvestigation.\n  By way of comparison, a gas station that has a pay phone isn't a \ntelephone company. So a library that has Internet access, where a \nperson can find an Internet e-mail service, is not a communications \nservice provider; therefore, it would not fall under the purview of the \nNSL provision in 18 U.S.C. 2709. It is a critically important \ndistinction. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for making that \nclear and for all of his good work on this bill.\n  Libraries are fundamental to America. They symbolize our access to \neducation. They are available to everyone, regardless of social or \neconomic status.\n  When we first introduced the SAFE Act, I went to the Chicago Public \nLibrary to make the announcement. The library was established in 1873, \nand for over 130 years it has given the people of the City of Chicago \nthe ability to read and learn and communicate. Here is what the mission \nstatement says at that public library:\n\n       We welcome and support all people and their enjoyment of \n     reading and pursuit of lifelong learning. We believe in the \n     freedom to read, to learn, and to discover.\n\n  We have to ensure, in the Senate and in Congress, in the bills that \nwe pass, including the PATRIOT Act, that this freedom to read, learn, \nand discover is preserved for our children and our grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Unfunded Mandates\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the National Governors Association \nmeeting will be held in Washington during the week we return from \nrecess. That brings back some fond memories for me because I remember \nthe 8 years I served as Governor. Each time we came here, and the \nhighlight of it every year, was a dinner in the White House with the \nChief Executive of the United States and the chief executive of each of \nour States.\n  While the Governors are in town, or as they are coming to town, I \nwant to take the opportunity to wave the lantern of federalism on a few \nissues under discussion here in the Senate that will affect strong \nState and local governments. I know the Presiding Officer cares deeply \nabout the same issues because his service as mayor made him\n\n[[Page S1391]]\n\naware of those issues, just as I was as Governor.\n  During the year after I came to the Senate, when we were debating the \nInternet tax issue, someone said in exasperation that I had appeared \nnot to have gotten over being a Governor. I hope that can be said on \nthe day I leave here, because most of our politics here in the Senate \nis about how we resolve conflicts of principles. One of the most \nimportant principles upon which our country is founded is the principle \nof federalism, the idea that we are a big, diverse, complex country and \nthat we need strong States and strong cities and strong counties and \nstrong communities to absorb all of our differences. We are not a \nsmall, homogeneous nation and our federalism is absolutely key to our \nsuccess as a country.\n  I have not gotten over being Governor. It causes me especially to \nremember how the Republican majority came to power in 1994, a majority \nof which I am proud to be a part. There was a Contract with America. I \nwasn't part of the Congress at that time, but I remember it very well. \nI remember one of the most important aspects of the Contract With \nAmerica was: no more unfunded Federal mandates. I remember also that a \nlarge number of Republicans, along with Leader Gingrich, stood on the \nCapitol steps and said: If we break our promise, throw us out.\n  Since I wish to make sure our majority doesn't get thrown out, I want \nto remind all of us, including many who serve in the Senate, who voted \nin 1995 to stop unfunded Federal mandates, this still is an important \npart of our responsibilities here. I have three examples of that in our \ndiscussions.\n  The Senate recently reaffirmed its commitment to the idea of avoiding \nunfunded Federal mandates. I suppose I should stop for a moment and \nexplain what I mean by ``unfunded Federal mandate.'' That is a \nWashington phrase we throw around. Here is the way I understand it. \nNothing used to make me madder as Governor--and I daresay it might also \nbe true of the Presiding Officer, who was a mayor--than for some \nSenator or Congressman to come up with a big idea in Washington, pass \nit into law, hold a press conference and take credit for it, and send \nthe bill to me to pay at the State capitol. Then the next thing you \nknow, that same politician would be back somewhere in Tennessee making \na big speech about local control. That is an unfunded Federal mandate--\nwhen the big idea is here and the law is passed here and then the bill \nis sent down to the county commissioner or to the mayor or to the \nlegislature or to the Governor and it is said: It was our idea but you \npay for it.\n  Ten years ago when Bob Dole was the majority leader, the first thing \nthe new Republican Congress did--it was called S. 1 at that time--was \nto pass the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. It created a new point of \norder that could be raised against legislation imposing unfunded \nFederal mandates on State and local governments. Everyone felt pretty \ngood about that because they said this new law will create a so-called \npenalty flag that can be thrown when some Federal official came up with \na good idea, passed it into law, and sent the bill back to us in the \nStates. However, until recently that penalty flag has never been \nthrown, not in the first 10 years of its existence. However, last year, \nin our Budget Act, that point of order was given some more teeth. In \nthe budget resolution under which we operate today, an unfunded mandate \npoint of order raised in the Senate requires 60 votes in order to be \nwaived instead of the simple majority required under the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act.\n  In October of last year, 2005, this 60-vote point of order was raised \nfor the first time in the Senate against two amendments to an \nappropriations bill that would have raised the minimum wage. That would \nhave been an unfunded Federal mandate. This new provision was put into \nthe Budget Act by Senator Gregg, who had been the Governor of New \nHampshire. It had my support as well as that of a number of other \nSenators. So I would like to call to the attention of my colleagues, \nand the Governors as they are coming to town, three issues that are \ncurrently under discussion here that raise the specter of unfunded \nFederal mandates.\n  No. 1 is the taxation of Internet access issue. State and local \ngovernments and members of the telecommunications industry, I believe, \nneed to come up with a solution to that question before the current \nmoratorium expires in 2007.\n  No. 2, the Federal Government needs to fully fund the implementation \nof the so-called REAL ID Act, which we passed last year and which has \nto do with border security.\n  No. 3, the Federal Communications Commission needs to exempt colleges \nand universities from expensive new requirements that will require \ncolleges to modify their computer networks to facilitate surveillance, \nwhich will have the effect of adding about $450 to every tuition bill \nacross this country.\n  Let's take those one by one. First is the Internet access tax \nmoratorium. My colleagues will remember that after we had a spirited \ndebate that went on for about a year and a half, President Bush signed \ninto law the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act. There was a lot of \ndiscussion, a lot of compromise, a lot of negotiation. What we were \narguing about was, on one hand we wanted to increase the availability \nof high-speed Internet access to all Americans--that is a national \ngoal--but at the same time we didn't want to do harm to State and local \ngovernments by taking away from them, as a part of our act, billions of \ndollars upon which they relied for paying for schools, paying for \ncolleges, paying for other local services.\n\n  The bill we came out with at the end of 2004 was a good compromise \nfor several reasons. First, it was temporary, not permanent. It called \nfor a 4-year extension of the Internet access tax moratorium that was \nalready in place, so this one will expire in a year and a half.\n  Second, our agreement allowed States already collecting taxes on \nInternet access to continue to do so. That was a part of the ``do no \nharm'' theory that many of us championed.\n  Finally, it made clear that State and local governments could \ncontinue to collect taxes on telephone services even if telephone calls \nare made over the Internet, which they increasingly are.\n  In January of this year, the General Accounting Office released a \nreport interpreting the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act. The GAO \ninterpreted the moratorium in a more limited way than what I, and I am \nsure many of the other Senators, intended when we were drafting the \nbill.\n  While the interpretation may suit me fine because it goes in the \ndirection I was arguing, the GAO interpretation may demonstrate very \nclearly how important it is to deal with this complex issue in some \nother way. That is why it needs to be resolved by representatives of \nindustry and by mayors and Governors working together to suggest to us \na path for the future. I understand the National Governors Association \nhas convened meetings with representatives of the telecommunications \nindustry and State and local governments. I hope all the parties will \ntake those negotiations seriously, reinvigorate those efforts, and \npresent us with a workable compromise we can then consider and enact.\n  Let me suggest again the principles that I believe should guide this \ndiscussion. No. 1, separate the issue of taxation and legislation. Both \nare very complex issues that can have serious implications for industry \nand State and local governments and consumers, but they are not the \nsame effects. The goal should be simplicity. Regulations surely ought \nto be streamlined to allow new technology to flourish. Voice over \nInternet protocol or, in plain English, making telephone calls over the \nInternet, is very different than plain old telephone service, and our \nregulatory structure needs to recognize that and be welcoming to this \nchange. The goal in taxing the industry should also be simplicity and \ncertainty. For example, a company that operates in almost 11,000 State \nand local jurisdictions, all of whom might tax telecommunications, \nmight have to file more than 55,000 tax returns a year. No one wants to \nsee that happen and that is far too big a burden for a large company, \nmuch less a small startup company. But in searching for a solution, we \ndo not want to do harm to State and local governments.\n  The Senator from California, the Senator from Delaware, the Senator\n\n[[Page S1392]]\n\nfrom Ohio--many Senators pointed out that State and local governments \nrely heavily today on telecommunications taxes as a part of their tax \nbase.\n  In our State of Tennessee, our Governor said it is a matter of $300 \nmillion or $400 million in State revenues. That would be as much money \nas we would raise from instituting an income tax. It is a lot of money. \nSo we should not take an action in Washington, even for a good purpose, \nthat has the effect of undercutting State and local decisionmaking. My \npoint very simply is, deregulate voice over Internet protocol? Yes. We \nabsolutely should do it. But we must find a way to do it that doesn't \nforce States and local governments to provide subsidies to the \ntelephone companies. If the Federal Government wants to provide a \nsubsidy to the telephone companies, the Federal Government ought to pay \nfor it and not create an unfunded Federal mandate.\n  The second example of the possibility of an unfunded Federal mandate \ncame with the passage of the REAL ID legislation. We are about to enter \ninto a debate about immigration. We hear about it all the time. It is a \nserious problem. We have 10 million to 15 million people living in our \ncountry who are illegally here. That is not right for a country that \nhonors the rule of law, and we have to fix it. One way some have \nsuggested to fix it was the so-called REAL ID law. But the effect of \nthat was basically to turn driver's license examiners in Tennessee and \nevery other State into CIA agents by making State driver's licenses \nnational ID cards, and then forcing the States to pay for it.\n  I don't want to talk today about whether it is a good idea or a bad \nidea to turn State driver's license employees into CIA agents, or \nwhether we should have a national ID card. The fact is the law says \nthat is what they are going to do and that is what we are going to \nhave. What I want to talk about today is how do we pay for that.\n  REAL ID, according to the National Conference of State Legislators, \nwill cost States $500 million over 5 years to implement. That is $100 \nmillion a year. This is not technically an unfunded mandate because the \nlaw actually gives States a choice, but here is the choice: In \nMinnesota or Tennessee or any other State, either upgrade your driver's \nlicenses according to the Federal rules, or your residents will not \nhave the ability to collect their Social Security check or board an \nairplane. So that is not much of a choice.\n  All across the country, because of the REAL ID law, this is a new \nresponsibility for States and it is going to cost a half billion \ndollars. Yet in fiscal year 2006, only $38 million was appropriated for \nStates to cover the cost of REAL ID. In fiscal year 2007, the \nPresident's budget contains no funding for REAL ID, even though $33.1 \nbillion is to be spent on homeland security.\n  I intend to work this year to see that REAL ID does not become an \nunfunded mandate. If the Federal Government wants to create a national \nID card and they want to force the States to do it, then the Federal \nGovernment ought to pay for it.\n  My final example: the Federal Communications Commission needs to make \nsure that compliance with the Communications Assistance for Law \nEnforcement Act, called CALEA, does not become an unfunded Federal \nmandate on colleges and universities.\n  This CALEA law is a law that communications systems have to be \nengineered in such a way as to make it easy for Federal agents to \nsubject phone calls to surveillance. In August of last year, the \nFederal Communications Commission, recognizing that more and more \ntelephone calls are being made over the Internet, extended the \nrequirements of this law to colleges and university computer networks.\n  Implementing this order, according to technology experts, could cost \n$5 billion to $6 billion, a figure that translates into a $450 increase \nin annual tuition at most American universities.\n  The pages here who are listening to this are already looking forward \nto tuition increases when they go to college that are high enough, and \nthey don't need another $450 on top of it.\n  Over the last several years, tuition college costs have increased \nfaster than inflation. Public school tuition jumped 10 percent in 1 \nyear--in 2004. Even though Federal funding for colleges and university \nhas gone up, State funding has been fairly flat. So we have seen a big \nincrease in tuition, and this is another $450.\n  Given these concerns, even though the FCC might have a laudable \nobjective in making it easier to overhear or keep track of phone calls \nin computer networks on college campuses, if the Federal Government \nwants to order that, the Federal Government ought to pay for it.\n  I have written to the FCC urging it to exempt colleges and \nuniversities from the requirement of August 2005 in order to allow time \nfor the development of an alternative to this $450 tuition increase.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter to the FCC on this issue be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 2006.\n     Hon. Kevin Martin,\n     Chairman, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Martin: I am writing to urge the Commission \n     to exempt private telecommunications networks operated by \n     colleges, universities, and research institutions from \n     coverage under the Communications Assistance for Law \n     Enforcement Act (CALEA). Requiring these networks to come \n     into compliance with the provisions of CALEA, according to \n     the American Council on Education (ACE), could cost billions \n     of dollars for new equipment alone. These compliance costs \n     would constitute an enormous unfunded federal mandate and \n     would more than likely be passed on to students in the form \n     of increased college tuition.\n       According to the statute, private communications networks \n     are not subject to CALEA. The Commission's order states that \n     higher education networks ``appear to be private networks for \n     the purposes of CALEA.'' However, other language in the order \n     suggests that to the extent that these networks are connected \n     to the Internet they are subject to CALEA. In considering how \n     to resolve this apparent conflict, the Commission should take \n     into account the enormous costs to higher education that \n     would result if these private networks are not exempted. \n     According to technology experts employed by higher education \n     institutions, compliance costs could amount to billions of \n     dollars for new switches and routers. Additional costs would \n     be incurred for installation and the hiring and training of \n     staff to oversee the operation of the new equipment. Cash-\n     strapped schools--particularly state-funded, public schools--\n     would be faced with the choice of bearing these additional \n     costs or, according to ACE, increasing annual tuition by an \n     average of $450. Coming on the heels of ten years of college \n     costs increasing faster than inflation, such a tuition \n     increase would make it even more difficult for students to \n     take advantage of higher education in the United States.\n       At this time, no evidence has been presented that the \n     current practice with regard to wiretaps within college and \n     university networks has proven problematic. In 2003, only 12 \n     of 1,442 state and federal wiretap orders involved computer \n     communications. According to the Association of \n     Communications Technology Professionals in Higher Education, \n     few, if any, of those wiretaps involved college and \n     university networks.\n       With the explosive growth of voice over Internet Protocol \n     (VoIP) services in recent years, the number of wiretaps \n     involving computer communications is likely to increase. \n     However, before sending a multi-billion dollar bill to U.S. \n     college students, I would urge the Commission to consider an \n     exemption for these private networks. Such an exemption could \n     give colleges and universities more time to work with the FCC \n     to come up with a cost effective way to support law \n     enforcement efforts with regard to computer communications. I \n     appreciate your consideration of this request.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                  Lamar Alexander.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, these are some of the big ideas in \nWashington, all of which may be laudable. The idea of freeing high-\nspeed Internet from overregulation and subsidizing it, the idea of \nnational ID cards administered when you get your driver's license so \nthat we can do a better job of protecting our borders, and the idea of \nreengineering computer systems on college campuses so that it will be \neasier for us to fight the war against terrorists--all three may be \nwonderful ideas, but all three amount to unfunded Federal mandates, if \nthey are done the wrong way.\n  I began my remarks by reminding all my colleagues--and especially our \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle, those in the majority--that the \nRepublican Party came to a majority in 1994 on a platform of no more \nunfunded mandates. Republican leaders said: If we break our promise, \nthrow us out. I don't want us thrown out any more than I want any more \nunfunded Federal mandates.\n  So my purpose today, as the Governors begin to come to town, is to\n\n[[Page S1393]]\n\nwave the lantern of federalism a little bit and raise a red flag to \nremind my colleagues that there is now a 60-vote point of order for any \nunfunded Federal mandates going through here and that I and others will \nbe watching carefully to make sure that we keep our promise.\n  This is a body in which we debate principles, and one of the most \nimportant principles that we assert is the principle of federalism. It \ndoes not always trump every other principle that comes up, but my \nfeeling is it has been too far down. I want to raise it up higher, and \nI intend to use that 60-vote point of order to assert the principle of \nfederalism when unfunded Federal mandates appear on this floor.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a moment, first of all, \nabout the process we are going through and then about the substance of \na couple of amendments that our colleague from Wisconsin would have \nliked to have introduced and have a vote on it with respect to the \nPATRIOT Act.\n  Our constituents might be wondering why we are on the floor of the \nSenate on this Thursday afternoon discussing the PATRIOT Act. After \nall, haven't we passed it? Of course, the answer is, in a sense, we \nhave passed it now several times. But there are colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle who have decided that rather than let the will of the \nSenate be carried out with adoption of the PATRIOT Act so this bill can \nbe sent to the President so he can then sign it, thus reauthorizing the \nact for another 4 years and giving the tools to fight terrorism to our \nintelligence and law enforcement officials that, rather, they are going \nto make us comply with all of the procedural technicalities which they \ncan throw in our way which accomplishes absolutely nothing but requires \nus to take several more days to finish the process.\n  What can be gained from this? Nothing at all except that we waste \nmore time thus making it more likely that we will not have time to do \nother business of the Senate, especially as it gets toward adjournment \nlater on in the year.\n  What we are seeing is taking something very important for the \nprotection of the American people--the PATRIOT Act--and using it for \nwhat I believe are improper purposes and simply delay action in the \nSenate so that we will have less time to act on other items.\n  There is no basis for delaying the PATRIOT Act. The votes are there \nto go to the conference and have the House of Representatives approve \nit, again, as it already has, so it can be sent to the President. There \nare no amendments that are going to be brought up. We are going to have \na final vote on Tuesday--and that is it. But rather than being able to \naccomplish that result today, we are having to waste all of this time.\n  What kind of a message does this send to our allies who are, first of \nall, a little skittish about some of the news leaks about our \nsurveillance programs in which they participate, to some extent. We get \ngood information from our intelligence service, and I suspect they are \nworried about the lack of control over our intelligence process. They \nare not sure, I suspect, what to make of this debate about the PATRIOT \nAct. They thought we had it resolved so they could work with it on the \nbasis of the laws they understood. They are not sure.\n  I often wonder what Osama bin Laden is thinking. I suspect he is not \ngetting live coverage, but he is probably getting reports somehow or \nother, and he must be shaking his head: I thought I was pretty clear, I \nam really making threats against these guys, and they are playing \naround. They are not taking my threats seriously.\n  I, for one, am taking his threats very seriously--and so does the \nDirector of the CIA and so does Ambassador Negroponte.\n  Our intelligence officials and the people we have asked to do this \njob for us take this threat dead serious. They have asked the Congress \nto give them the tools they need to fight this terrorist threat. Part \nof the tool is this PATRIOT Act, which has now been revised and \nreformed and amended and gone over again, and, finally, there are now \nthree more changes to it--and it is done.\n  We have the ability now to simply pass it on to the President so he \ncan sign it, and for 4 more years everybody knows exactly what we have \nto work with here.\n  Remember the 9/11 Commission following the tragedy of September 11, \nwhen we asked this commission to analyze what we could have done better \nand what went wrong, part of what they said was wrong was that there \nwas confusion in our law enforcement intelligence community about what \nthey could and should do.\n  In fact, legal interpretations differed so much they felt there was a \nwall that separated the intelligence agencies and the law enforcement \nagencies from even talking to each other.\n  One of the things the PATRIOT Act does is makes clear that there is \nno such wall; that at least our law enforcement and intelligence folks \ncan talk to each other about these terrorists.\n  It is most distressing that we can't simply get this bill passed on \nto the President so that everybody knows we have it reauthorized again \nfor another 4 years.\n  As I said, if there were any rationale behind this, other than simply \ndelaying so that we can't do other business, you might have something \nto bite your teeth into and debate on the floor. But in truth, this \nthing, when it passes, is going to be overwhelming. I doubt that we \nwill have a handful of votes against it. In fact, we may have less than \na handful, which would be 5 votes against this when we vote on it. But \nI thought at least it would be interesting to see what some of the \nobjectives posed by some of the most vociferous critics of the PATRIOT \nAct are, what those criticisms are, to examine them so we can see \nexactly what the complaints are about, about what the President has \ncalled an essential tool in the war on terrorism.\n  When you look at the suggested amendments--again, amendments which we \nare not going to be voting on because we have already been through that \nprocess three times and that has thankfully come to an end--I wanted to \nexamine a couple of amendments our colleague from Wisconsin would have \noffered to illustrate it is not something we should be wasting our time \non. One of them has to do with something that has been in existence for \n40 years, called national security letters. It is essentially a \nsubpoena for records that is just like a grand jury subpoena.\n\n  The county attorney or the district attorney goes to the grand jury \nand says: I think we need the following documents in order to see \nwhether we can make our case. They write up this piece of paper, it is \ndelivered, say, to a hotel, and it asks for the business records: We \nwant to know everyone who checked in and out of the hotel for the last \n3 days because we think maybe this person we are after may have checked \ninto this hotel--that would verify his presence on the night of the \nmurder, or whatever the case--so the hotel gives them the records.\n  There is no expectation of privacy in the records. When the hotel \nclerk says: Here, sign in--and he turns it over, you can see exactly \neveryone else who has signed into the hotel. There is nothing private \nabout it.\n  These national security letters have been used for many different \ngovernment agencies. If you are investigated for Medicare fraud, for \nexample, your doctor might get one of these security letters asking for \ninformation.\n  Back when the security letters were authorized, we did not have \nterrorism. Now we have terrorism in a big way in the last decade or \ndozen years. Law enforcement authorities say: You know that process we \nhave of getting business records through the security letters is a good \nprocess, and we ought to apply that to terrorism, too. Why not? If we \ncan investigate drug dealers or bank fraud criminals or people like \nthat with this kind of a subpoena for records, why shouldn't we be able \nto do it for terrorists? That is a much bigger deal.\n\n[[Page S1394]]\n\n  Now for the first time our colleagues are saying maybe we should have \na court process to review this. That process exists in a totally \ndifferent context. If we want a much more formal procedure, there is \nsomething called a Section 215 warrant. That is court supervised. This \nis the sort of light version. If it is contested, of course, you have \nto go to court. Most of the time the records are easily given because \nthey are not private records.\n  For the first time in the context of terrorism our colleagues are \nsaying this is an invasion of privacy and we need a court to review \nthis. My point is, it must be very confusing to law enforcement to have \nCongress debating something like this when there is no rationale for \nchanging the law of 40 years that has been applied in everyday context \nthroughout the country, and all of a sudden where we would want the \nmost streamlined procedure, where we would care most about the cops, \nwhere we need speed because we do not know whether an attack is \nimminent, for example, in the situation that is much more serious, now \nwe are saying we need to throw some roadblocks in the way of the law \nenforcement tool. It does not make sense.\n  I thought I would take two of the amendments--we are not going to be \ndebating the amendments, but this is the kind of thing raised as an \nobjection to the PATRIOT Act--the kind of amendments that would be \noffered. It shows how unnecessary this approach is.\n  Let me note one other thing. There have been a lot of unnecessary \namendments attached to the PATRIOT Act. It is getting to the point \nwhere I wonder whether we can really do the job, our law enforcement \ncommunity can really do the job that our constituents want it to do. \nFor example, by my count, the final bill that we will send to the \nPresident requires 12 different reports or audits of our Nation's \nantiterror investigators. Obviously, oversight is important. Reports to \nthe Congress are important. But it seems to me this is overkill. Our \nintelligence agencies should be devoting their resources primarily to \ninvestigating suspected terrorists, not to investigating each other. \nAll of these reports simply add to the burden they already have.\n  And we wonder sometimes after the fact, when a September 11 \ncommission reports that they were too burdened to do their job, how \nthat could possibly be. Congress sometimes can be part of the problem \nas well as part of the solution.\n  All of the changes have been negotiated and renegotiated, as I said. \nAt some point, we need to complete the bill. There are other amendments \nI would like to add, but I had my chance and this is not the time to be \nreopening the process for yet another round of amendments. It seems to \nme we ought to be moving on.\n  I will mention this one amendment. It is actually an amendment \nnumbered 2893 that would have been offered by the Senator from \nWisconsin. This amendment would strip away the protections for \nclassified information about suspected terrorists and terrorist \norganizations in the manner I discussed a moment ago. The amendment not \nonly risks revealing our level of knowledge of our data collection \nmethods to those who would do us harm, but it also threatens to \nundermine our relations with allies who supply us with a lot of \ninformation in this war or terror. They do not do that so it can be \ngiven out to the public. The purpose of classification is to see that \nthe information remains secret. But this particular amendment would \nallow classified information to be compromised during the challenge to \na nondisclosure order for national security letters or a FISA business \nrecords order. FISA is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It \nserves no substantial interest but, as I said, can be very damaging to \nour national security.\n\n  Let me put this in perspective. A section 215 order--which I \ndiscussed before, which is a FISA order and is always accompanied by a \nnondisclosure requirement--already is judicially reviewed, as I said. \nThere has to be a court action on it before it can be issued. And under \nthe amendment that was offered by the Senator from New Hampshire, a \nthird party recipient of a section 215 order also would be able to have \nthe courts review the section 215 order after its issue, which is a \nsecond round of review. We have added that in. To my mind this is \nredundant and unnecessary, but that has been added. That is one of \nthose compromises to enable us to get to this point.\n  Let me put this issue in perspective. A section 215 order, which \nprovides that second round of review, is much different than a national \nsecurity letter which, as I said earlier, has been around since the \n1970s. They have always been accompanied by a nondisclosure \nrequirement. In other words, when the third party is served with this \nsubpoena that says: Would you please give us these records, you are not \nsupposed to tell the person that a law enforcement entity is seeking \nthe records. Obviously, you do not want to tip them off that you are \ninvestigating them. There is a nondisclosure requirement. You cannot \ntell the person that the Government has come asking for the records. \nThat requirement has always been automatic, and there has never been \nany provision for any judicial review of that nondisclosure \nrequirement.\n  The national security letters, like virtually all other subpoenas, \nare also not judicially reviewed before they are issued. The conference \nreport, for the first time in the history of these national security \nletters, authorizes judicial review of the need for the nondisclosure \nof the subpoenas. That was another compromise that was added. You not \nonly have it in the formal section 215 requirement but also in the less \nformal security letter process. It allows the recipient to challenge \nthe nondisclosure requirement, and it ensures the automatic nature of \nthe nondisclosure requirement.\n  Now the FBI will have to evaluate each national security letter. The \nnondisclosure of the NSL and the nondisclosure requirement can only \napply if the FBI certifies that the public disclosure of the service of \nthe NSL will harm national security. In other words, before it is \nissued, the FBI has got to have a certification that the recipient of \nthe letter may not disclose it because to do so would be to harm \nnational security. That certification is based upon a very solemn \njudgment exercised by the Attorney General.\n  Critics condemn this provision as giving only the illusion of \njudicial review. When they say that, it bears mention that what they \nare condemning is language that is being added to a statute that never \nprovided any kind of judicial review before that. For over a quarter of \na century there has been none whatsoever, and yet there is a complaint \nthis judicial review is not good enough. The sponsor of the amendment \nargues that the standard employed for the review of the security letter \nand the section 215 nondisclosure requirement is too high and can never \nbe met.\n  It is high, but it is very high for a reason. If a challenge is made, \nthe FBI needs to reevaluate whether there is a continued need for the \ndisclosure. But if the FBI certifies that disclosure of the NSL would \nharm national security, that reclassification is conclusive. Now, when \nyou say ``conclusive,'' that is a very high standard.\n  In this respect, the proponents of the amendment are correct; that is \na high standard. But it is the only way the determination can work.\n  Think about it for a moment. Only the FBI, the people who are \ninvestigating the matter, not individual district judges, are in a \nposition to determine when the disclosure of classified information \nwould harm national security. Obviously, that is not something that a \nFederal district judge has any expertise on. You have to have, \nliterally, a trial to determine whether that proposition were true in \neach particular case.\n  The reason nondisclosure might be necessary should be obvious. If a \nsuspected terrorist or his associates, for example, are funneling money \nthrough a particular bank in a city, and if that bank were to make \npublic the fact that it had received a security letter requesting \nrecords in a terrorism investigation, that disclosure would easily tip \noff the terrorists and their associates that they are under \ninvestigation. You do not want to do that.\n  It is also important that the FBI make the final determination \nwhether the disclosure would harm national security. And only the \nagents in charge of these counterterrorism investigations will be able \nto evaluate how the\n\n[[Page S1395]]\n\ndisclosure of a particular piece of information could potentially, for \nexample, reveal sources and methods of intelligence and who, therefore, \nmight be tipped off as a result of the disclosure.\n  We are all aware of this current controversy regarding the briefing \nof select members of the Intelligence Committee over a particular \nsurveillance activity involving international communications with \nmembers of al-Qaida or people suspected of being with al-Qaida. The \nreason not every member of the Intelligence Committee is briefed is \nbecause of what we would call ``sources'' in this case. Methods of \nsurveillance are so secret, so classified, that it has been determined \nthat even some members of the Intelligence Committee should not be \nfully briefed on exactly how this methodology works.\n  So you can imagine when the FBI has sources of intelligence to \nprotect or certain methods of intelligence gathering to protect, the \nlast thing you want is for a judge to decide that those should simply \nbe made public.\n  That is why this conclusive presumption is in the law, why it is so \nimportant, and why we cannot have this section amended to open that to \npublic disclosure of that sensitive information. Yet this amendment \nnumbered 2893 would allow every one of the 800 Federal district judges \nin the country, in fact, to be their own director of national \nintelligence and decide for themselves whether exposing classified \ninformation would inappropriately reveal the sources and methods I \ndiscussed, whether that might tip off terrorists to what we already \nknow about them, and whether it would harm relations with our allies \nwho, perhaps, have provided us with the information. Obviously, that \ncannot be allowed. We cannot expect our allies in the war on terror to \ncooperate with us if we treat this sensitive information that they \nprovide to us with anything other than the most careful consideration. \nAnd we cannot expect our agents to be successful in detecting terrorist \nplots if every step of the way, every time they gather information \nthrough either a security letter or the more formal section 215 \nprocess, they can be sued and forced to divulge classified information \nabout whom and where they are looking and what methods they are using.\n\n  This amendment would do serious harm to U.S. national security. And \nto what end? What powerful privacy interest or civil rights interest \ndictates a third party asked to produce business records in its \npossession must be allowed to disclose the existence of the \ninvestigation or must be given access to other classified information \nin order to plead that matter before the judge?\n  When the FBI is investigating organized crime in the United States \nand grand juries compel testimony or require the production of records, \nwe do not let those witnesses or the parties holding the records \npublicize the fact that they had been subpoenaed or publicize that \nthere was an ongoing investigation. We recognize that secrecy is \nimportant in an organized crime investigation and it outweighs any \ninterest that third parties might have in talking about the \ninvestigation.\n  Why wouldn't we recognize the same realities in a terrorism \ninvestigation, an area where the safety and security of the American \npeople are much higher? That is the kind of amendment that would be \noffered. Thankfully, as I said, we decided to go forward with the \nprocess and not have any more amendments and have the vote next week \nwhich will enable us to send this bill to the President.\n\n  My point in discussing this is to demonstrate there is no reason to \nhave further debate or amendments, and we could have gotten done this \nafternoon and known we had reauthorized the act for another 4 years.\n  The only other amendment I want to discuss is amendment No. 2892, \nblocking these section 215 orders even where relevance is shown. This \namendment is highly problematic because it would bar antiterrorism \ninvestigators from obtaining some third party business records even \nwhere they can persuade a court that those records are relevant to a \nlegitimate antiterrorism investigation. We all know the term \n``relevance.'' It is a term that every court uses. It is the term for \nthese kinds of orders that are used in every other situation in the \ncountry. Yet the author of the amendment argues that relevance is too \nlow a standard for allowing investigators to subpoena records.\n  Consider the context. The relevance standard is exactly the standard \nemployed for the issuance of discovery orders in civil litigation, \ngrand jury subpoenas in a criminal investigation, and for each and \nevery one of the 335 different administrative subpoenas currently \nauthorized by the United States Code. These national security letters \nhave existed since the 1970s, and they have always employed a relevance \nstandard.\n  Why now that we are faced with a terrorism threat, and we decide this \nsame investigative tool should be available to investigate terrorists \nwould we impose a higher standard to get the information? If anything, \nyou would be talking about applying a lower standard because of the \nimportance of the threat and the fact that sometimes speed is of the \nessence.\n  As the Department of Justice Office of Legal Policy recently noted in \na published report--I want to quote this--``Congress has granted some \nform of administrative subpoena authority to most Federal agencies, \nwith many agencies holding several such authorities.'' The Justice \nDepartment ``identified approximately 335 existing administrative \nsubpoena authorities held by various executive-branch entities under \ncurrent law.''\n  As I said, 215 orders already are harder to get than regular \nsubpoenas, even though the subject matter would suggest that perhaps \nthey ought to be easier to get. In the case of these section 215 \norders, the law requires that the FBI first seek a determination of \nrelevance from a judge, which makes it harder to get a 215 order than \nit is to get any other grand jury subpoena or virtually any other kind \nof administrative subpoena because none of them require preapproval \nfrom a judge. Even a grand jury subpoena is not approved or reviewed by \na judge or the grand jury before it is issued. It is issued directly by \nthe prosecutor.\n  It is interesting; there was a recent online article in National \nReview Online by Ramesh Ponnuru, a very good writer and student of this \nissue, who made the following comments. This is a quotation. He noted \nthat critics say:\n\n     that investigators shouldn't be able to get business records \n     merely by convincing a judge that the records are \n     ``relevant'' to an ongoing terrorism investigation. Yet that \n     relevance standard, from Section 215 of the law, is the exact \n     same standard employed for discovery orders in civil \n     litigation, for grand-jury subpoenas in criminal \n     investigation, and for each of the 335 different \n     administrative subpoenas currently authorized by the U.S. \n     Code. Getting a 215 order is harder than getting a grand-jury \n     subpoena or almost any kind of administrative subpoena, since \n     judges don't have to review the latter [before they are \n     issued].\n\n  Again, this is the current law. So even without an amendment, which \nwould make it even more difficult, the law we are talking about with \nregard to terrorism investigations makes it more difficult in a \nterrorism investigation to get a subpoena than in any other situation. \nYet the proponents of this amendment would make it even more difficult \nthan that.\n  Now, let's imagine what this means. Here is a scenario:\n\n       Let's imagine that intelligence agents have discovered that \n     suspected Al Qaida agent Mohammed Atta is in the United \n     States and that he has hired another individual to work for \n     him. Under the Patriot Act legislation being considered now, \n     it will be easier for the federal government to subpoena \n     records in order to make sure that Atta is paying that \n     individual the minimum wage than it will be to obtain records \n     to find out if Atta is using him to engage in international \n     terrorism.\n\n  That is not right. I was going to say something else. I will just say \nthat is not right. This is the existing law. This is before we would \nmake it even more difficult with the amendment I discussed a minute \nago.\n  So without making further arguments on this point, I think you can \nsee that we have girded this PATRIOT Act with levels of civil rights \nprotection and privacy rights protection that we do not have in any \nother part of the code, even though the need for speed and the need for \nagility to get after these terrorists is, I would argue, a much more \nimportant matter than investigating Medicare fraud or bank fraud or \nmoney laundering of whatever it might be.\n\n  We have not imposed all of those civil rights or privacy protections \nin those sections of the code, but here we\n\n[[Page S1396]]\n\nare going to add them and make it even more difficult for the FBI and \nother law enforcement and our intelligence agencies to do the job we \nwant them to do. Then, of course, if something happens, we will haul \nthem before Congress and say: Why couldn't you get your job done? And \nwhen they say: Well, the statute was a little tough for us to comply \nwith, we will say: That will be no excuse.\n  So we need to be very careful what we do in considering further \namendments to the law.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that the other amendments \nthat would have been offered are in the same vein, making it \nunnecessarily difficult for our intelligence agents and our law \nenforcement officers to do the job we have asked them to do.\n  When my colleagues and I have had before us on the floor of the \nSenate amendments to add armor to humvees or to have better bulletproof \nvests or to have other kinds of equipment or tools for them to carry \nout the missions we ask them to perform when we send them into harm's \nway, we do not hesitate long to give our military everything they need \nbecause we want them to succeed in their mission. We do not want them \nto be left vulnerable in any way. Why? Because we want to be protected \nand we want them to be protected.\n  Yet when it comes to giving our intelligence agencies the tools to \nfight terrorism, we shirk back and say: Well, we are going to do it, \nbut first we are going to add several layers of additional requirements \nto make it more difficult for you to do your job.\n  In the law and in this fight against terrorism, we are generally not \nfighting with airplanes and ships and the like. This is a different \nkind of war. This is a war against a very secretive enemy all over the \nglobe. There is really only one way to get to this enemy, and that is \nwith good intelligence to find out who they are, where they are, and \nwhat they are up to.\n  So the equipment we are giving to them, the tools for them to fight \nterror are these provisions of the PATRIOT Act and FISA and the other \nactivities that have been discussed. This is what enables them to \nperform their missions. We cannot load these tools up with so many \nrestrictions and legal loopholes that it is impossible for them to do \ntheir job. If we expect them to be able to protect us, we have to write \nthese laws in clear, understandable, fair, and effective ways, \ncertainly protecting our civil rights. But I think I have demonstrated \nwe have done that.\n  If you do not need all these protections if you are investigating \nbank fraud, then I would say, as the lawyers say: A fortiori. They are \nless necessary in an investigation of terrorism, where speed may be \nrequired, where secrecy is absolutely critical, and therefore where the \nkind of protections that have been offered are very problematic to \nthese folks doing their job.\n  So the bottom line is this: We have a good act, the PATRIOT Act. It \nis going to be reauthorized for another 4 years. We have already added \nnumerous protections of civil liberties to it. It is, therefore, quite \nappropriate that the time for amendments has come to an end, that we \nnot have any more of these amendments brought before us--I think I have \ndemonstrated the harm those amendments would do--that we get on to the \njob of getting this legislation reauthorized so we can say to our \nconstituencies we were able to provide the tools to fight terrorism \nthat will protect them and their families.\n  That is our charge. There is only so much we as legislators can do, \nbut this is something we can do, and we need to get about doing it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Akaka pertaining to the introduction of S. 2305 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am sorry we are now facing another \nfilibuster and delay of efforts to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act. We have \ntaken 3 days this week to deal with legislation Senator Sununu \nintroduced to assuage concerns he and others had about the bill. \nSenator Sununu's proposed bill guaranteed that at least four more \nMembers of the Senate were on board to completely support a cloture \nvote on and final passage of the Conference Report. It certainly \nbrought on board all the Republicans who expressed concern over the \nbill. But we are still going through the process of grinding down \ncertain provisions to get an up-or-down vote on reauthorizing the \nPATRIOT Act. That is all we are asking for, an up-or-down vote, to \ndetermine whether we want to extend the provisions of the PATRIOT Act. \nThat is being held up. We have many other things that are important for \nus to do for our country, but we have been forced to spend an \nextraordinary amount of time on this.\n  If you look around, you will see that people are not engaging the \nissue. The complaints--Senator Kyl talked about some of them--are \ninsubstantial. They are not the kind of serious concerns people have \nportrayed them to be. The act itself provides quite a number of \nprovisions that simply allow investigators to use the same tactics to \ninvestigate terrorists, people who want to kill us, that they use to \ninvestigate wage-and-hour disputes, to investigate your taxes, to \ninvestigate drug dealers and pharmacists and drug dispensers and \ndoctors. It is important that investigators continue to have these \ntools at their disposal.\n  It is unfortunate we have had this obstruction. We have seen a \npattern of it, frankly. The more time we spend on delaying these kinds \nof provisions, means that at the end of the year there will be a \njammed-up calendar. We will have appropriations bills that have to \npass, and other bills that need to pass. All the days we had at the \nbeginning of the year have now been frittered away on rearguing things \nthat we have argued and settled before.\n  I don't mind debate. Senator Feingold has come down and spent a \nnumber of hours expressing his concerns. I respect him. He is a most \narticulate opponent of the act. He has certainly studied the act. We \ndon't agree, but I respect that. But we went through all this in \nDecember for days on the floor of the Senate, debating these same \nissues. With Senator Sununu's compromise and suggestions for \nimprovement that have been accepted, the basis for many of those \ncomplaints have gone away. Now we are taking another big, long time to \nreargue settled issues. I believe the majority leader, Senator Frist, \nis justified in his frustration that something that has been debated \ncompletely and fully and that now has a clear majority of Senators \nprepared to support it is being held up, delaying all the processes of \nthe Senate.\n  Let's talk about the merits of the bill and how the law deals with \ncertain issues for which we have heard objections. One of the biggest \nitems and perhaps the biggest issue that Senator Feingold and opponents \nhave raised has been the delayed search warrants. The bill that came \nout of the Senate was passed by unanimous consent. We moved the PATRIOT \nAct reauthorization out of the Judiciary Committee by a unanimous vote. \nWe moved it out of the Senate by a unanimous vote. The House passed a \nbill by an overwhelming majority. The House and the Senate bills went \nto conference, and they discussed it. We made concessions on each side.\n  Senator Specter, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, a man who \ncertainly has been respectful to civil liberties, has stated that he \nbelieves about 80 percent of the compromise that was reached favored \nthe Senate version, not the House version. The House conceded on more \nissues than the Senate. They gave more than the Senate did. The bill \nthat came out of conference was very close to the Senate bill. Then we \nhit the Senate floor, after having a unanimous vote, and now we have a \nfilibuster. It is, indeed, frustrating.\n  Let me talk about the delayed search warrants. What the PATRIOT Act \ndoes is to codify, to make a part of the law of the country, provisions \nfor delayed notice search warrants. Delayed notice search warrants are \nnot, as some have said in the Senate, an unusual procedure. Delayed \nnotice search warrants have been in use for decades, long before we \npassed the PATRIOT Act. This act did not create any new authority or \nclose any gap because there was no gap to close. The PATRIOT Act simply \ncreated a nationally uniform process and standard for obtaining a \ndelayed notice search warrant.\n\n[[Page S1397]]\n\n  Some have said: The court said 7 days is what you ought to delay \nnotice. That is the maximum time you should delay notice. That is not \nquite accurate. The Ninth Circuit, the most liberal circuit in the \nUnited States, the most reversed circuit in the United States by the \nSupreme Court, has held in one case that delayed notice search warrants \nthat explicitly provided for notice within a reasonable period of time \nby the judge issuing the warrant pass constitutional muster under the \nfourth amendment. They said a delayed notice search warrant does pass \nconstitutional muster. Then they went on to ask, though, what is a \nreasonable period of time? They defined it as 7 days, absent a strong \nshowing of necessity. That is what the Ninth Circuit said, the most \nliberal circuit in America. But other courts, such as the Fourth \nCircuit, have upheld much longer initial delays as constitutional. For \nexample, the Fourth Circuit has determined that a 45 day period for \ndelayed notice is constitutional. The Fourth Circuit did not even \nsuggest that 45 days was the upper limit. They simply concluded it was \nreasonable in those circumstances. The truth is, there is no standard \nset under current law by the courts that would mandate a specific \nperiod of time for a delayed notice.\n  When the House of Representatives passed its version of PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization, it called for 180 day delayed notification period. The \nvote in the House was 257 to 171, a bipartisan vote of Republicans and \nDemocrats, to approve overwhelmingly a delay of 180 days. The bill we \nsent to conference had a 7 day delayed notification provision in it. \nWhen the conference reported the bill, it tilted much closer to the \nSenate bill. It came out with 30 days, less than the 45 that the Fourth \nCircuit had approved, more than the Ninth Circuit had said. And it was \na perfectly logical process we went through.\n  About the importance of delayed search warrants in terrorist \ninvestigations, I can't express how strongly I believe that this has \nthe potential to be the most significant provision in our legislation, \nthe PATRIOT Act. Time and time again, Federal investigators, working \nwith State and local investigators, determine that groups are involved \nin terrorist activities. They don't know all the people who are \ninvolved. They don't know the full extent, but they have probable cause \nto establish that they are violating or planning to attack the United \nStates or are participating in a conspiracy to kill people to further \ntheir terrorist goals. So what do you do then?\n  Under the PATRIOT Act--not the National Security Act or what we have \ntalked about, the national security intercepts you have heard so much \nabout in the paper; those are international and involve the President's \ninherent authority--under the traditional law of America, what do you \ndo if you have probable cause to believe these groups are meeting, that \nthere is some sort of sleeper cell in existence, you have proof, not \njust suspicion, proof to the level of probable cause that they are \nparticipating in this scheme?\n  One of the most potentially beneficial things would be to get a \nsearch warrant for that house. But if you do it under normal \nconditions, when you have to conduct a search warrant if the defendant \nis not there, you provide him notice that you have conducted a search \nwarrant. When you come to the door and before you go in, if no one is \nthere, you have to leave a return on the door showing that you searched \nthe place and any items you seized and who to contact. That is what you \nnormally do in a search warrant.\n  Police officers do that every day. But first they go to a judge and \nthey swear under oath that they have probable cause, and not only say \nthey have it, they spell it out. And judges, on appeal, can review it. \nIf the judge who approved the search warrant was in error, they can \nreverse it or the evidence can be excluded from trial. So you go to a \njudge. We are not in any way changing that great principle that a U.S. \nFederal judge or a State judge would have to approve a search warrant. \nYou are not changing in any way the principle that they have to have \nprobable cause under oath that evidence exists at the scene of the \nplace searched which would be relevant to an investigation. All of that \nis the same as it has always been.\n  But the one critical thing--and this has been legitimated by courts \nand approved by the U.S. Supreme Court--is that you can, in certain \ncases, ask that the notice which you would normally give to the owner \nof the residence or the person who has custody and control of that \nlocation be delayed.\n  Now, this can be absolutely critical in a case of national security. \nIt is so important. Please, I want you to understand that. You may be \nable to go in that area and find names, phone numbers, records, or bank \ndeposits that would identify a whole group of other people, and you are \nnot ready to arrest them that moment because you don't know where they \nare located. You need to check this out and follow up on it. If you \narrest that bad guy and give notice to the people right there, the \nwhole world will know it, and they will spread the word and they will \nscatter. That is exactly what will happen. So that is why, in certain \ninstances, law enforcement officers have sought, and courts have \napproved without the PATRIOT Act, delayed notice search warrants.\n  So then when do you notify the person? All the PATRIOT Act says is \nthat the police officers can delay notification for 30 days. At the end \nof that 30 days, if they don't come back to the court and show a legal \nbasis to continue to delay to notify the defendant, they have to notify \nthe defendant on the 30th day. That is all this Conference Report says. \nThat is reasonable. It is not an abuse of the power of the Congress. It \nis not in any way contradictory to the great traditions of law \nenforcement in America. It has nothing to do with the President's \nExecutive powers to fight a war. This is under the criminal law aspect \nof American justice.\n  I asked for delayed notices on rare occasions when I was a Federal \nprosecutor. I am telling you, whether investigating a big drug gang or \na Mafia group, these are the kinds of things which can make all the \ndifference in the world. And it is even more important in terrorist \ninvestigations because these people will scatter and because it is a \nmatter of life and death. That is all I am saying. There is nothing \nunusual or strange about it.\n  The Department of Justice wrote a letter which said that a delayed \nnotice warrant differs from an ordinary search warrant only in that the \njudge authorizes the officer executing the warrant to wait for a \nlimited period before notifying the subject of the search because \nimmediate notice would have an adverse result, as defined by statute, \nthat could undermine the investigation. So this is all this is about. I \nthink few people would dispute it. Yet we have a filibuster because \nsome Senators apparently believe that 30 days destroys the \nConstitution. They believe that it violates the Constitution to ask the \npolice officer to wait 30 days before they notify the defendant.\n  The House of Representatives, by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of \n257 to 174, voted to allow the officers to delay 180 days. So now we \nhave been here 3 days debating this issue this week. This is the No. 1 \ncomplaint they have about the bill. I don't know what it is that got us \nto this point.\n  The conference report before us today eliminates the possibility of \nan open-ended delayed notice. It requires notice within 30 days unless \nthe court grants an extension. Current law allows for simply a \nreasonable delay, which is whatever the judge may decide in a given \ncase. Well, they say, why do you need 30 days? Well, the Fourth Circuit \nfound that 45 days is good enough. I will give this example which the \nDepartment of Justice gave: Operation Candy Box. A delayed notice was \npermitted in a multijurisdictional investigation targeting a Canadian-\nbased ecstasy and marijuana-trafficking organization. The delay allowed \nfor a successful, uninterrupted, month-long investigation that resulted \nin the arrest of over 130 people. Without delayed notice, agents would \nhave been forced to reveal the existence of the investigation \nprematurely.\n  As a Federal prosecutor myself, I want to tell you, one of the \nbiggest decisions in any investigation of any organized criminal group \nor terrorist group is the decision of when to conduct the takedown. \nWhen do you arrest them? Do you run out as soon as you know there is a \ngroup and you have\n\n[[Page S1398]]\n\nevidence on one of them--do you run out and grab that one? How stupid \ncan you be? If you grab one, the rest will know it and know you are \ngoing to come after them; they are going to scatter or they will \ndestroy evidence. They will run and hide, and they may create a sleeper \ncell in a different city and continue their plans to kill Americans or \nto sell dope or whatever it is they are doing illegally. So you have to \nplan the takedown.\n  When you are dealing with cases involving life and death, you have to \nbe very careful about it. Don't think the agents don't work with \nprosecutors and staff people and plan out these takedowns to the most \nminute detail. When do you do it? Do you catch six low-level flunkies \nand let the big guys get away? No. Someone might say the big guy is \ncoming into town the next day, so we will have a team there and we will \nhave probable cause to arrest him. Then you get a search warrant. When \ndo you execute the warrant? You want to execute it at a time of your \nchoosing so you can wrap up as many of the members of the organization \nas possible at one time. That is what it is all about.\n\n  Sometimes you need to know more about this organization. You don't \nknow all the people who are involved. That is where a delayed notice \nwarrant can allow you to obtain information about other people who are \ninvolved and do further investigations and find out, maybe, that two or \nthree dangerous criminals should also be arrested at or about the same \ntime. They will provide you the probable cause to arrest them because \nyou cannot arrest people without probable cause in America. You have to \nhave evidence. You cannot just arrest somebody on suspicion.\n  So where do you get the evidence? Some people in this Senate forget \nthat police officers are not magicians; they have to gather evidence. \nHow do you get it? One way you find out the evidence is to conduct a \nlawful search on a warrant approved by a Federal judge or a State \njudge. If it is a Federal crime, it would be a Federal judge. Then you \nmay execute a delayed notice warrant, and you may find more evidence of \nother people that can be corroborated and you can build up probable \ncause. And instead of having probable cause to arrest just 2 \ndefendants, you may have probable cause to arrest 8 of them, and maybe \nyou take down the whole sleeper cell. Maybe there are 8 in this town \nand 4 more in Boston and some more in San Diego or in Washington, DC. \nYou can arrest all three or four cells at the same time. Would that not \nbe the ideal thing?\n  I am telling you that this is what law enforcement officers attempt \nto do every day. They do it according to the laws that we require.\n  In 2002, the issuance of a delayed notice search warrant helped break \na massive multistate methamphetamine ring. The delayed notice allowed \ninvestigators to locate illegal drugs, which provided further leads, \neventually resulting in the seizure of mass quantities of drugs and the \nidentification of those involved in the criminal organization. More \nthan 100 people were charged with drug-trafficking offenses, and a \nnumber of them have been convicted.\n  In another case, a delayed warrant was issued to search an envelope \nwhich was sent to the target of an investigation. An envelope had been \nsent to the person, and they got a warrant to search the envelope. The \nsearch confirmed that the target was operating an illegal money \nexchange and was funneling money to the Middle East, including to an \nassociate of an Islamic jihad operative. Delayed notice allowed the \ninvestigators to conduct a search without compromising an ongoing \nwiretap they had been carrying on based on probable cause, and with the \napproval of a U.S. District judge. But they didn't just conduct a \nwiretap; they were conducting this wiretap and they needed to find out \nif money or drugs were moving so they could seize that or allow the \npackage to continue and then arrest the person who received it.\n  That is what we are talking about here. That is why there is nothing \nextreme in any way about the delayed notice search warrant law.\n  Well, what about the national security letters? You have heard a lot \nabout that issue. The complaint is that Senators have said this will \nallow you to obtain information from people not connected to terrorists \nor spies. The national security letters, which existed long before the \nPATRIOT Act, can only be in a certain specific and limited number of \ncircumstances.\n  Now, I will talk about those in a moment, but they are listed in 5 \nstatutes, so it is not an open-ended provision. It only deals with \nnational security issues. The procedures set forth in this act which \nallow those letters to issue are in no way extreme. They in no way \nthreaten the great liberties all of us share but indeed are essential \ntools in this age of national security threats to our country, and they \ncan be critical, critical, critical facts for investigators to enable \nthem to identify those cells which may be in this country trying to \nattack and kill American citizens, as we saw on September 11.\n  I want to emphasize that national security letters existed long \nbefore the PATRIOT Act and can be used in only very limited \ncircumstances for national security issues. In fact, it is a \nparticularly valuable tool that is utilized frequently by \ninvestigators. The New York Times said there have been a lot of \nnational security letters issued since 9/11. Well, we are doing a lot \nmore investigation. Every FBI office in America is pursuing every lead \nthat pops up, unlike what we were doing before 9/11, and are verifying \nand checking out and determining the kinds of things that are necessary \nto find out, such as if someone may be connected to a terrorist \norganization and may be planning an attack on the United States. Isn't \nthat what we demanded after 9/11? But the numbers that have been \npublished are clearly exaggerated. They are not accurate, and they have \nbeen criticized by the officials who are involved. I add that \nparenthetically.\n  The PATRIOT Act originally made very few changes to the national \nsecurity letter procedure. It merely made relevance the standard for \nobtaining a national security letter and allowed special agents in \ncharge to issue them. The special agent in charge would be the special \nagent in charge of the FBI office in New York City, for example, or in \nBoston or in Birmingham, AL, and those special agents in charge \nsupervise everyone in the office. They are considered to be high-\nranking FBI officials responsible for the law enforcement issues \nrelating to their agency in that district. So this was what we \noriginally passed.\n  However, now under this conference report, the national security \nletters are to be used only for investigations involving terrorism and \nespionage, and they must pertain to ``an authorized investigation'' \ninvolving ``national security.''\n  These are national security investigations. National security letters \ncannot be used to obtain unlimited categories of material. They can \nonly be used to obtain very limited categories of material in the \npossession of third parties, not the defendant. The great protections \nagainst the searching of your home have not been undermined. What we \nare talking about here are records that are under the dominion and \ncontrol of a third party. You can say they are your bank records, but \nthey are the bank's records. You can say they are your telephone \ncompany records, but they are the telephone company's records.\n  The law has always made a big distinction between the kind of proof \nyou have to have for someone to come in and search your desk, to search \nyour automobile, to search your home, than the kinds of procedures they \nhave to go through to get the record at the local motel that might have \nyour name on it. It is not your record, it is the motel's record. You \nhave a diminished expectation of privacy. The courts have consistently \nheld this view ever since the issue has been discussed. It is a \nfundamental part of daily law enforcement in America.\n  So they can be used only to obtain these kinds of records, not \nrecords you have under your control that would require a search warrant \napproved by a judge on probable cause, as I discussed earlier, as you \nwould in a delayed search warrant case. It is a big deal. I am telling \nyou, in a case such as this, I bet you search warrants would be 30 \npages of affidavits to justify what they are searching for. But these \nare simply subpoenas, basically, for these records.\n  These records, as I said, belong to companies, and the individuals to\n\n[[Page S1399]]\n\nwhom they refer have a reduced privacy interest in them. These national \nsecurity letters cannot be used to obtain ``content information'' that \ninvolve any communications you may have made or the words of those \ncommunications with the phone company, but simply what the billing \nrecord said and the phone numbers you called. But you can't get, \nthrough a national security letter, the words of your phone call or \nintercept or record your phone call in any way, or your e-mails. The \ncontent of your e-mails can't be obtained with a national security \nletter. The national security letter is simply a request by a national \nsecurity investigator for records.\n  If the recipient such as the bank, for example, objects, the FBI \ncannot compel production without going to court. The conference report \nspecifically allows the recipient, however, of a national security \nletter to move to quash or dismiss or modify the national security \nletter and to challenge the nondisclosure order that accompanies the \nnational security letter, and to talk to their attorneys about it if \nthey choose, and other people who may be necessary to comply with the \nnational security letter.\n  Some people say the nondisclosure requirement can keep you from \nspeaking with your attorney. This legislation specifically allows you \nto talk to your attorney or anybody else who is related to it before \nyou decide to utilize a motion to quash.\n  Let me share this with you. Imagine, now, you are an investigator, an \nFBI agent, and you have serious cause to believe that an individual may \nbe connected to a terrorist organization. You want to find out if they \nhave been calling Kabul, Baghdad or Islamabad. It is critically \nimportant, at a preliminary stage in an investigation such as this--\ncritically important, I emphasize--that the people being investigated \nnot know that they are being investigated, that the investigators are \non to them. That is why we placed in the law the limitation that the \nperson or entity subpoenaed should not go and tell the people that the \nFeds are out there asking for your bank records or your telephone \nrecords. How can you conduct an investigation? From these records is \nthe way the police officers and FBI agents get the probable cause to \nconduct a search warrant.\n  How do you get probable cause to conduct a search warrant? You take \nlesser steps to obtain information that is available to you, and it \nbuilds up until you get enough to have probable cause to go a judge to \nget a search warrant to search the home and you may even want to delay \nnotice to the people at the home until you can be sure that everybody \nin this organization is known to you and they can all be arrested \nbefore they can get away. So that is what this is all about. It is \nperfectly logical and part of our law enforcement heritage.\n  In the conference report that is before us, it also provides an \nexpress right to judicial review for all types of national security \nletters, allowing courts to modify or quash the order if compliance \nwould be unreasonable, oppressive or otherwise unlawful. It also \nchanged the certification requirement. It requires a higher level of \ncertification before you can ask for nondisclosure in the issuance of a \nnational security letter. The nondisclosure requirement is not \nautomatic. Local FBI cannot ask it. The local special agent in charge \ncan't ask for it. Now it has to be invoked by one of the top officials \nof the DOJ in Washington, an official who must certify that disclosure \nwould ``endanger the national security of the United States.''\n  I want to say that is too high a standard. We are going to fail to \nexecute requests for mere documents in control of banks and telephone \ncompanies and motels and records of that kind because a DOJ official in \nWashington is going to be nervous about whether he has enough proof to \ncertify that this matter would endanger the security of the United \nStates. That is too high a standard. But it is in this bill because the \ncivil libertarians wanted to put it in here.\n  Any county district attorney in America this very day can issue a \nsubpoena to a bank or to a telephone company to get your phone records \nor the records from your doctor. This is not unusual that investigators \ncan obtain documents in the possession of third parties. Please hear \nme. I know Senator Kyl made the comment that it is easier for an \ninvestigator to obtain your business records relating to whether you \nhave paid withholding tax than it is for an investigator, under this \ncase, to get records of whether you are connected to a terrorist \norganization.\n  I would add a few other examples. A Federal drug officer, a DEA \nagent, can walk into any pharmacy in America today and examine the \npharmacy records that exist to see if somebody has submitted false \ndocuments, is overpurchasing drugs or the pharmacist is failing to keep \nrecords. He can examine all the records that are there. He doesn't have \nto have a warrant or a national security letter.\n  The IRS agents investigating whether you paid your taxes can subpoena \nyour bank records by an administrative subpoena that does not require a \ngrand jury approval or approval of any prosecutor. He can do it as an \npart of an administrative subpoena because they are not your records. \nBut if he goes into your house and tries to take your personal \ndocuments, that is not so because he has to have a search warrant. A \nprovision requiring this high level of certification is important \nprotection for sure, and the standard imposed on the top FBI official I \nbelieve is too high. I believe one day we are going to regret it.\n  An express right to challenge the nondisclosure requirement is \nincluded in the conference report. An express right to disclose the \nreceipt of a subpoena to a attorney is protected. There is the \nrequirement that the Department of Justice Inspector General must audit \ncertain past and future uses of national security letters and provide a \npublic report on the aggregate number of national security letters \nissued concerning U.S. persons. But IRS agents out there in every \ncommunity in America are issuing subpoenas for your records by the \nthousands every week. They don't have to maintain these records.\n  Senator Feingold and others, I am sure, would be pleased to note that \nthe House passed a 1-year misdemeanor for knowing and willful \ndisclosure of a national security letter with no intent to obstruct the \ninvestigation, which the Senate dropped in conference. The House of \nRepresentatives' bill said if you violate the requirement that you not \ndisclose, and run out and tell the people whose records have been \nsubpoenaed, you would be subject to a misdemeanor. But, oh, no, they \nobjected to that. So now, apparently, there is no penalty if someone \nviolates the act and tells the terrorists that you are investigating \nthem. That ought to make people happy. We ought to feel a lot better \nthat our liberties are being protected.\n  Under the conference report, recipients of a national security letter \ncan challenge the nondisclosure requirement after 2 years, a time \nperiod where the national security interests involved will be \ndissipated. The Sununu bill on the floor today, that was designed to \ncomplement the conference report and to alleviate some concerns a few \nSenators had, allows nondisclosure to be challenged after 1 year and \neach and every year thereafter. Some opponents of the report wish to \nsee sunsets placed on National Security Letters. National security \nletters have never been subject to sunset. They are currently governed \nby six permanent statutes in the code already. No abuses of national \nsecurity letters have surfaced, and a New York Times article that \nsuggests these large numbers have been issued contains many \ninaccuracies and that is not accurate.\n  I want to emphasize that. Nondisclosure is absolutely critical in \nnational security cases. Frankly, in reality, bankers and medical \ndoctors and others who may have records subpoenaed or requested by the \nnational security letter, for the most part, do not desire to tell the \nperson if the FBI agent asks them not to. But they go to their lawyers, \nand we have gotten so lawyerly today, the lawyer may tell them: Well, I \nthink you have an obligation to tell this bad guy that the FBI came by \nand picked up his records. If you don't tell him, maybe he can sue you.\n  So this is a protection for the bank, for the phone company, for the \ndoctor who gets these records subpoenaed because then he can rightly \ntell anybody who complains after the fact: I would have told you, but \nthe Federal Government told me not to.\n\n[[Page S1400]]\n\n  Section 215, the FISA Court business record production orders, is \nanother matter of importance. Section 215 orders for the production of \nbusiness records allows the FBI to go to the FISA Court and seek these \norders. You have to go to court now and seek a judicial order of the \nFISA Court for ``the production of tangible things, including books, \nrecords, papers, documents and other items'' for an investigation to \nobtain foreign intelligence information. It doesn't allow the FBI to go \nout and do it on their own. They have to go to court and present \nevidence that would justify production--basically, a form of subpoena \nauthority. Section 215 orders must be preapproved by a judge and cannot \nbe used to investigate ordinary crimes or even domestic terrorism, only \nforeign terrorism.\n  Orders for the production of business records under the USA PATRIOT \nAct, section 215, are not and cannot be used for so-called fishing \nexpeditions. The fishing expedition complaint is wrong--wrong--wrong--\nfor three reasons. First, section 215 orders are court orders that must \nbe authorized by Federal judges prior to issuance. Judicial review will \ncull out fishing expedition requests. Second, section 215 orders are \navailable only for authorized national security investigations, not \nyour run-of-the-mill investigation, a category that certainly does not \ninclude fishing expeditions. And the conference report clarifies that \nthe orders cannot be used for threat assessments. Third, rigorous \nguidelines issued by the Attorney General govern when the FBI may use a \nsection 215 order.\n  There has also been uproar over the three-part relevance test. The \nSenate bill included an unworkable and burdensome three-part relevance \ntest. You recall--relevance plus. I opposed it. It was not good. I \nsteadfastly believe that it was the kind of confusion that blocks \nlegitimate action under this law and would undermine the ability for \nthe investigators to do what we intended to authorize them to do. The \ntest would have compromised the ability of the Government to get \nsection 215 orders. The language of the three-prong test was ambiguous \nand would inevitably have resulted in major complications in terrorist \ninvestigations.\n  As we saw by the attacks on 9/11, seemingly small or technical \nbarriers can make a critical difference to the success of a terrorism \ninvestigation. That is exactly what the three-prong test would have \ndone.\n  Senator Kyl, who spoke earlier this afternoon, Senator Roberts, who \nis chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and I sent a letter to \nChairman Specter, expressing our strong concerns with the three-prong \ntest and asking him not to include it in the conference report. He did \nas we suggested. The conference report retains the three-part test only \nas a way to prove relevance. The conference report lists the three \nprongs of the Senate test as ways the materials sought are presumed to \nbe relevant.\n  No. 1, the records pertain to a foreign power or an agent of a \nforeign power; No. 2, the records are relevant to the activities of a \nsuspected agent of a foreign power who is the subject of such \nauthorized investigation; or, No. 3, the records pertain to an \nindividual in contact with or known to a suspected agent of a foreign \npower.\n  As Senator Patrick Leahy explained in 2001, the ranking Democrat on \nour committee:\n\n       The FBI has made a clear case that a relevance standard is \n     appropriate for counterintelligence and counterterrorism \n     investigations as well as for criminal investigations.\n\n  Let me just say this. Your county attorney in every county in America \ncan issue a subpoena for your bank records, your telephone records, on \nthe basis of relevance to an ongoing investigation.\n  That is how subpoenas are issued. It has always been a relevance \nstandard. I don't see anything unusual about this at all. We provided \nadditional protection for relevance.\n  The conference report also requires the application for a 215 order \nto include a statement of fact which shows ``reasonable grounds to \nbelieve that the records are relevant to an authorized national \nsecurity investigation.'' The original PATRIOT Act simply required a \nshowing that the records ``were sought'' for an authorized \ninvestigation. This is a Senate provision which was included in the \nconference report which certainly made it more difficult to obtain \nthese national security letters, and I assume it made colleagues who \nhave been objecting happy to see this higher burden of proof placed on \nthe investigators. Frankly, I believe that was unnecessary.\n  Both the conference report and bill we are currently debating--\nSenator Sununu's PATRIOT Act Amendments bill--imposed new civil rights \nsafeguards on the use of section 215 orders contained in the PATRIOT \nAct as it currently exists. So by blocking the PATRIOT Act which \npresently exists from being reauthorized by the Conference Report, \ncivil rights are being diminished since the report provides enhanced \nprotection.\n  The conference report clarifies and makes clear that a recipient of a \n215 order has an explicit right to disclose or seek an order through an \nattorney and to challenge the order in court. Senator Sununu's bill \nwhich we are debating today and which I am certain will pass goes a bit \nfurther. I do not know that it is critical, but I am willing to accept \nthings that are not perfect by my standards because I know we need to \nreauthorize the PATRIOT Act, and this is a condition of reauthorizing \nit. Senator Sununu's bill lays out the process by which a person \nreceiving a section 215 production order may challenge the legality of \nthat order. They can file a petition with the FISA Court, and that \npetition is ``immediately'' assigned to a judge who, in 72 hours after \nthe assignment, ``shall conduct an initial review of the petition.''\n  The conference report also retains a 4-year sunset on section 215. In \nother words, this provision will expire in 4 years unless reauthorized. \nI don't know why that is necessary, but people apparently believed it \nwas, and so we put it in there.\n  The conferees added a requirement that the Justice Department \ninstitute ``minimization procedures'' limiting the retention and \ndissemination of information obtained through a section 215 order for \ncertain particularly sensitive material. The FBI request for these \norders must be approved by one of three top officials at the FBI: the \nDirector, the Deputy Director, or the Executive Assistant Director. One \nof those three top officials in the FBI has to sign off on it if it \nincludes library records, medical records that would identify a person, \nlibrary patron lists, book sales records, firearms sales records, tax \nreturn records, or educational records. This is a Senate provision that \nwas accepted by the conference.\n  The IRS agents can walk in any time and get your tax records, for \nheaven's sake, but we can't get a terrorist's tax records without going \nthrough the FISA Court. A DEA agent can go into a pharmacy and examine \nevery record in there to find out how many drugs you may have bought or \nanybody else may have bought. The IRS can subpoena your bank records by \nadministrative subpoena without even the approval of a Federal \nprosecutor. This is not any erosion of American liberties, is the only \npoint I am making.\n  Again, this does not allow them to go into your house, into the desk \nyou own at your office, and search your personal belongings. It does \nnot allow any Federal agent to open the trunk of your automobile, to go \nin your automobile, open your glove compartment, and seize anything you \nmay have that is in your personal custody and control. You still have \nto have a search warrant approved by a judge on probable cause. This \ninvolves materials held by third parties.\n  Documents which can be obtained in this fashion are limited to the \ntypes of tangible things which could be obtained under grand jury \nsubpoena or other Federal court orders, and the FBI must craft \nprocedures to minimize retention and dissemination of materials \ngathered under this provision. OK. We will try to destroy them in so \nmany months to minimize the danger that somebody will have a file on \nyou. I am telling you, if you like those shows on television, the real-\nlife cold-case files, you see where the records held for 10, 15 years \nturn out to be the key documents in convicting some murderer 15 years \ndown the road. I really do not like this idea that a properly obtained \ndocument or record kept as part of a confidential investigative file \nhas to be destroyed prematurely. But that is what we have here so \npeople's liberties won't be undermined.\n  Under the conference report, the Department of Justice must conduct \ntwo\n\n[[Page S1401]]\n\naudits of the FBI's use of 215 orders, enhanced congressional and \npublic reporting is required, and the inspector general is required to \nconduct an audit of all section 215 requests since the passage of the \nPATRIOT Act. The ironic thing is if those who support a filibuster \nsucceed in preventing a vote on the bill, these additional civil \nliberties safeguards won't become law.\n  The language about the libraries included in Senator Sununu's bill is \nalso a concern of mine. Opponents of section 215 have tried to create \nthe impression that the FBI is using section 215 to visit libraries \nnationwide to check the reading records of ordinary Americans. How \noften have you heard that?\n  Rebecca Mitchell, director of the Alabama Public Library Service, has \na different point of view. She wrote me a letter on August 15 and said:\n\n       I want to personally thank you for your strong leadership \n     to stand on the PATRIOT Act. Our libraries should not be used \n     as a tool for terrorism. I know you have received negative \n     comments from the American Library Association on your stand, \n     but this is not the opinion of most librarians in our State. \n     Please continue to fight to keep our Nation free.\n\n  The point I tried to make was that there is no special protection for \na library record which would bar a Federal terrorist investigator from \nobtaining those records. Your local county attorney can subpoena them \nthe same as any Federal investigator to try to stop a terrorist.\n  Neither section 215 nor any other provision of the PATRIOT Act \nspecifically mentions libraries or is directed at libraries. \nNevertheless, as Director Mitchell points out, it is important that \nlibrary records remain obtainable as one of the kinds of ``tangible \nrecords'' a section 215 order can reach. Intelligence or investigators \nmay have good and legitimate reasons for extending to library/bookstore \nrecords.\n  I would just point out that I prosecuted a number of cases. I \nprosecuted one guy--they made a television show about it--and we got \nhis records and got a search warrant and seized items he had. He had a \nbook called ``Death Dealers Manual.'' He had a book called ``Deadly \nPoisons.'' That was relevant evidence to help convict him of a crime.\n  So we are not going to allow a prosecutor access to this information. \nA guy may say: I don't know anything about medicine; I have never \nstudied it. If the prosecutor goes down and checks with the library and \nsubpoenas the records and sees that he bought three books on medicine, \nthat may be relevant evidence to an important case. So to say that \nsomehow library records can't be subpoenaed as part of an investigation \ngoes beyond the pale, frankly. But because the Library Association had \na fit and they complained, we have put in special protections for \nlibraries, virtually like the spousal privilege or the priest-penitent.\n  I will conclude my remarks by saying that I do remain frustrated--not \nat the good intentions of my colleagues. They are well intentioned. Our \ncolleagues really want to improve liberty in America. But the truth is, \nthey have gotten off base. We have let outside groups with agendas \nconfuse people about this legislation--confuse them as to whether \nhistoric civil liberties are being undermined when they are not--and as \na result, we have had more difficulty passing this bill than we should \nhave.\n  I see the Senator from Texas is presiding. I appreciate his patience \nin listening to me. As a former attorney general of Texas and a former \nmember of the Supreme Court of Texas, he is a thorough scholar in these \nissues. I am proud to say that though he wouldn't agree with everything \nI have said, but in general he agrees with my view that this act is \nsound. He has been a steadfast advocate for it and understands the \nnecessity of it and that it does not undermine any of the classical \nliberties we as Americans take for granted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, 4 years ago, following one of the most \ndevastating attacks in our Nation's history, Congress passed the USA \nPATRIOT Act to give our Nation's law enforcement the tools they needed \nto track down terrorists who plot and lurk within our own borders and \nall over the world--terrorists who, right now, are looking to exploit \nweaknesses in our laws and our security to carry out even deadlier \nattacks than we saw on September 11th.\n  We all agreed that we needed legislation to make it harder for \nsuspected terrorists to go undetected in this country. Americans \neverywhere wanted that.\n  But soon after the PATRIOT Act passed, a few years before I ever \narrived in the Senate, I began hearing concerns from people of every \nbackground and political leaning that this law didn't just provide law \nenforcement the powers it needed to keep us safe, but powers it didn't \nneed to invade our privacy without cause or suspicion.\n  Now, at times this issue has tended to degenerate into an ``either-\nor'' type of debate. Either we protect our people from terror or we \nprotect our most cherished principles. But that is a false choice. It \nasks too little of us and assumes too little about America.\n  Fortunately, last year, the Senate recognized that this was a false \nchoice. We put patriotism before partisanship and engaged in a real, \nopen, and substantive debate about how to fix the PATRIOT Act. And \nRepublicans and Democrats came together to propose sensible \nimprovements to the Act. Unfortunately, the House was resistant to \nthese changes, and that's why we're voting on the compromise before us.\n  Let me be clear: this compromise is not as good as the Senate version \nof the bill, nor is it as good as the SAFE Act that I have cosponsored. \nI suspect the vast majority of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nfeel the same way. But, it's still better than what the House \noriginally proposed.\n  This compromise does modestly improve the PATRIOT Act by \nstrengthening civil liberties protections without sacrificing the tools \nthat law enforcement needs to keep us safe. In this compromise:\n  We strengthened judicial review of both national security letters, \nthe administrative subpoenas used by the FBI, and Section 215 orders, \nwhich can be used to obtain medical, financial and other personal \nrecords.\n  We established hard-time limits on sneak-and-peak searches and limits \non roving wiretaps.\n  We protected most libraries from being subject to national security \nletters.\n  We preserved an individual's right to seek counsel and hire an \nattorney without fearing the FBI's wrath.\n  And we allowed judicial review of the gag orders that accompany \nSection 215 searches.\n  The compromise is far from perfect. I would have liked to see \nstronger judicial review of national security letters and shorter time \nlimits on sneak and peak searches, among other things.\n  Senator Feingold has proposed several sensible amendments--that I \nsupport--to address these issues. Unfortunately, the Majority Leader is \npreventing Senator Feingold from offering these amendments through \nprocedural tactics. That is regrettable because it flies in the face of \nthe bipartisan cooperation that allowed the Senate to pass unanimously \nits version of the Patriot Act--a version that balanced security and \ncivil liberty, partisanship and patriotism.\n  The Majority Leader's tactics are even more troubling because we will \nneed to work on a bipartisan basis to address national security \nchallenges in the weeks and months to come. In particular, members on \nboth sides of the aisle will need to take a careful look at President \nBush's use of warrantless wiretaps and determine the right balance \nbetween protecting our security and safeguarding our civil liberties. \nThis is a complex issue. But only by working together and avoiding \nelection-year politicking will we be able to give our government the \nnecessary tools to wage the war on terror without sacrificing the rule \nof law.\n  So, I will be supporting the PATRIOT Act compromise. But I urge my \ncolleagues to continue working on ways to improve the civil liberties \nprotections in the PATRIOT Act after it is reauthorized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today the Senate will take up the \nconference report on the USA-PATRIOT Reauthorization and Improvement \nAct, as modified by an agreement reached last week.\n  I am the original Democratic cosponsor of the unanimously passed \nSenate bill, as well as a cosponsor of the Combating Methamphetamine \nEpidemic\n\n[[Page S1402]]\n\nAct and the Reducing Crime and Terrorism at America's Seaports Act, \nboth of which are incorporated into the conference report.\n  I will vote in favor of cloture on this bill, and will vote in favor \nof the bill when and if it comes to a vote.\n  At the end of last year, after careful consideration, I voted against \ncloture on the conference report. I took this step because of two basic \nconcerns, both of which have been substantially diminished by the \nagreement which is before us today. These changes, and the fact that a \nconsensus agreement has been reached, are the reason I am changing my \nposition.\n  My first concern was with some of the provisions of the conference \nreport. Specifically, the conference report did not provide adequate \njudicial review of so-called gag orders associated with the issuance of \nnational security letters, and required those who wanted to contest \nthese orders before a court to disclose information about their legal \ncounsel to the FBI. This was unnecessary and inappropriate, and it has \nbeen changed.\n  The revised conference report clarifies that a gag order will be \nreviewed by a Federal court and ensures that this review will include \nan inquiry into whether the Government is acting in bad faith. The \ncompromise also eliminates the onerous requirement of prior \nnotification to the FBI about legal counsel.\n  On the other hand, the revised conference report does not go as far \nas I would have preferred. It does not adopt the original Senate \nlanguage with respect to the standard to be applied for granting a \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant for physical items, \nincluding business records. This issue, usually referred to by its \nPATRIOT Act section number, 215, remains very controversial, and I \nbelieve the language could permit inappropriate fishing expeditions if \nnot carefully monitored. However, the agreed-upon language does make \nclear that libraries performing traditional functions are largely \nexempt from the more intrusive aspects of the law.\n  Importantly, the conference report retains and extends sunset \nprovisions on the most controversial provisions, including section 215. \nThis is critical, as these sunset provisions, which expire in 2009, are \nan important element of the continued vigorous oversight necessary to \nensure this law is carried out in an appropriate manner.\n  The second concern I had was that it appeared that efforts to forge a \ncompromise bill had fallen apart, with acrimony and rancor marking the \nprogress of negotiations. This was, in my view, tragic.\n  I have long been a supporter of the USA-PATRIOT Act. I believe it is \na critical tool in defending the Nation against terrorism. But I \nbelieve that it is a tool that is most effective when it is accepted as \na bipartisan, nonpolitical, effort. Simply put, if there is one area \nwhere partisan debate and petty politics have no place, it is in the \narea of national defense against terrorism.\n  So I believed strongly that a compromise bill supported by Members of \nboth parties was essential. I recognize that achieving consensus means, \nalmost by definition, that nobody will be completely happy with the \noutcome. As I noted, there are changes I would have made to this law, \nand I am sure most of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, would \nlike other changes. But compromise and consensus require concessions \nand flexibility. That is why I will vote today against cloture, and why \nI plan to vote for the bill itself.\n  I explained my views in a letter I sent to the Attorney General in \nDecember. In that letter I explained, and I quote:\n\n       It was clear to me that Senate and House negotiators had \n     come very close to reaching agreement on the Conference \n     Report. I believe this was critical, because only through \n     such a consensus approach can we ensure that the Patriot Act \n     does not continue to be polluted with partisan rancor. This \n     law is extremely important to the safety of America, and its \n     effectiveness depends in large part on ordinary Americans \n     believing it is a product not of partisan politics, but of \n     reasoned debate and compromise. Because I believed consensus \n     was so close at hand, and so important, I voted to provide \n     Congress additional time to resolve the last points of \n     disagreement.\n       Thus I was disheartened to hear that the Administration has \n     determined not to encourage further discussion on improving \n     and refining the Conference Report--rather, to stand fast, \n     and urge Senators to change their votes. I hope that this is \n     not the case. . . .\n       With that hope, I ask that you direct your staff to work \n     with both Republicans and Democrats to address the few \n     remaining issues. I am confident that good-faith discussion, \n     honest debate, and careful drafting can reduce, perhaps even \n     eliminate, some of the points of disagreement. . . .\n       It is critical that the Congress and the Administration \n     demonstrate our ability to work towards consensus and \n     agreement. I hope you will work with me to that end.\n\n  The USA-PATRIOT Act has come to be terribly misunderstood. Some think \nit is related to Guantanamo Bay and the detention of prisoners. Others \nare convinced that it authorizes torture or the secret arrest of \nAmericans. It does none of these things.\n  At the same time, some have irresponsibly sought to characterize \nanyone who seeks to improve, or criticize, the law as somehow ``playing \ninto the hands of the terrorists.'' They have implied that the USA-\nPATRIOT Act would expire in its entirety, and that we would be left \nwith no defenses against terrorist attacks. This, too, is untrue.\n  When I spoke on this floor in December, advocating working together, \nI said, ``Congress has a long, and honorable, tradition of putting \naside party politics when it comes to national security . . . it is \ncritical that this approach be carried forward to the end, and that \nCongress reauthorize the USA-PATRIOT Act in a way that Americans can be \nconfident is not the product of politics.''\n  I am pleased that we followed that tradition and that we put aside \nour differences and reached agreement. The fact that the White House \nand the Attorney General backed down from their intransigence and were \nwilling to discuss and compromise is also a welcome change, and \nhopefully a sign of a more open approach to these issues in the future.\n  I expect this bill will pass into law. I believe it will make America \nsafer. It is the responsibility of the Congress to ``provide for the \nCommon Defense,'' and I believe we live up to that duty in this bill.\n  But our job will not end here. We must immediately turn to our \noversight responsibilities. For instance, I understand that Senator \nSpecter will be continuing his inquiry into the NSA Surveillance \nProgram, and tomorrow the Senate Intelligence Committee will hopefully \nagree to take up their oversight responsibilities with respect to this \nprogram. The Judiciary Committee will also soon be holding a hearing \ndesigned to look at the FBI's progress in accepting its newly expanded \nintelligence missions and assess whether these efforts have been \nsuccessful and whether they conform with the rule of law.\n  I look forward to expanding on the spirit of compromise that this \nbill represents.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter to the Attorney General dated \nJanuary 9, 2006, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 2006.\n     Hon. Alberto Gonzales,\n     Attorney General of the United States, Department of Justice, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Attorney General, Last month the Senate decided to \n     continue debate on the USA-Patriot Act Reauthorization and \n     Improvement Act conference report, and extended the sixteen \n     provisions of the USA-Patriot Act until February 3, 2006. \n     Although I am the original Democratic co-sponsor of the \n     unanimously passed Senate bill, I voted to continue debate. I \n     explained my reasons at length on the floor, but in summary \n     they are simple.\n       It was clear to me that Senate and House negotiators had \n     come very close to reaching agreement on the Conference \n     Report. I believe this was critical, because only through \n     such a consensus approach can we ensure that the Patriot Act \n     does not continue to be polluted with partisan rancor. This \n     law is extremely important to the safety of America, and its \n     effectiveness depends in large part on ordinary Americans \n     believing it is a product not of partisan politics, but of \n     reasoned debate and compromise. Because I believed consensus \n     was so close at hand, and so important, I voted to provide \n     Congress additional time to resolve the last points of \n     disagreement.\n       Thus I was disheartened to hear that the Administration has \n     determined not to encourage further discussion on improving \n     and refining the Conference Report--rather, to stand fast, \n     and urge Senators to change their votes. I hope that this is \n     not the case.\n\n[[Page S1403]]\n\n       With that hope, I ask that you direct your staff to work \n     with both Republicans and Democrats to address the few \n     remaining issues. I am confident that good-faith discussion, \n     honest debate, and careful drafting can reduce, perhaps even \n     eliminate, some of the points of disagreement.\n       As I understand it, the key remaining points involve: (1) \n     the standard to be applied by courts in determining whether \n     to issue a so-called ``gag order'' in the context of National \n     Security Letters; (2) the time limitations applicable to \n     delayed-notice search warrants; and (3) the legal standard \n     applicable to orders to permit seizure of physical items \n     pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n     (Section 215).\n       Although I am not an appointed conferee, I have asked my \n     staff to work with representatives from the Department of \n     Justice (including the Federal Bureau of Investigation) and \n     the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. I ask \n     you to facilitate that work.\n       It is critical that the Congress and the Administration \n     demonstrate our ability to work towards consensus and \n     agreement. I hope you will work with me to that end.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                  Dianne Feinstein\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as the Senate considers legislation to \nreauthorize the PATRIOT Act, I am concerned that these efforts fall far \nshort in protecting the constitutional rights of American citizens.\n  Last December, a bipartisan group of Senators, including myself, was \nrightly concerned about the PATRIOT Act conference report's failure to \nsafeguard civil liberties, and the Senate rightly rejected that \nconference report.\n  Now we have a bill that purports to address those earlier concerns \nbut in fact fails to do so.\n  It is unfortunate that valiant efforts by Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle have not produced more meaningful changes to the PATRIOT Act. \nNow we are faced with an alternative that is weak and unacceptable. \nThis bill does not make the essential adjustments needed to protect the \nrights of the American people.\n  While this bill makes some changes, such as clarifying that \nrecipients of national security letters do not have to disclose to the \nFBI whether they consult an attorney, most of the so-called \nimprovements are anemic. Worse still, section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, \nwhich casts the net of surveillance so wide as to ensnare virtually any \nlaw-abiding citizen's business or medical records, has remained \nuntouched and unimproved.\n  This bill pays lip service to judicial review of gag orders placed on \nrecipients of section 215 business records and the national security \nletters. However, the bill goes on to set a nearly insurmountable \nbarrier to Americans who wish to challenge the gag order or the seizure \nof their records. The bill requires that the recipient prove that the \nGovernment acted in bad faith in obtaining the information. An \nindividual may not challenge a gag order for a year, infringing on that \nindividual's right to seek redress in their own defense.\n  Under the current ``improvement'', the Government may conduct ``sneak \nand peek'' searches, without notifying individuals for 30 days. This is \nmore than a three-fold increase in the time period for notification \nthat the Senate bill allowed.\n  Safety, the American people are told, involves a trade. They are told \nthey must surrender their liberty in order to preserve their safety. \nThis Orwellian compact is an insult to the constitutional liberties \nguaranteed to American citizens.\n  Let me be clear. No one in this Chamber discounts the responsibility \nof government to keep the American people safe in their homes. Keeping \nthe homeland safe obviously must be of the utmost concern for the \nNation and this Congress. But such efforts cannot come at the expense \nof civil liberties. Freedom and safety are not mutually exclusive.\n  All Americans know the threat that al-Qaida poses to our country. \nOsama bin Laden and his ilk must be prevented from executing another \nterrorist attack on our country. But there are many ways to fight al-\nQaida.\n  One of the ways is to protect those same freedoms that the Taliban \ntook away from the people of Afghanistan living under their tyrannical \nrule. When Americans are free to speak our minds, when we are free from \nthe intrusions of Big Brother, when we are free to exercise--rather \nthan sacrifice--our most prized protections, that is a blow against \nthose who seek to denigrate our country and our Constitution.\n  If there is any question about the seriousness with which we as a \nbody hold our Nation's security, let us recall last July, when 100 \nhundred Senators stood together--something virtually unheard of in the \ncurrent divisive and partisan climate. On July 29, 2005, the Senate \ncame together to protect the Constitution and the basic rights it \naffords our citizens. Senators from every State of the Union, from \nevery political persuasion, agreed to a version of the PATRIOT Act that \nwould reauthorize the provisions that were set to expire and which \nprovided the Government with the tools to aggressively pursue the war \non terror, while protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens. We \ndemonstrated that as a bipartisan body, we could stand strong against \nthe enemy while preserving the privacy of our citizens. Sadly, the \nstrength and zeal with which we once came together have languished, and \nthe hopes of meaningful improvement of the PATRIOT Act have been \nabandoned.\n  We must continue to make national security our top priority, as it \nalways has been, but we can do that without sacrificing sacred \nliberties. I cannot support this watered-down version of an improved \nPATRIOT Act. The safeguards in this bill are regrettably thin, and we \nmust not claim that such shabby protections of the constitutional \nrights of our people are the best that we can do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Democratic leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/16/senate-section/article/S1403-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1403-S1406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PENSION CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. REID. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I hope we have the opportunity as soon as we get back to move forward \non the pension conference. I hope we can do it even tonight. I don't \nwant to see this pension bill, which is a matter that has been moved to \nthis point on our legislative calendar on a very bipartisan basis, \nturned into a partisan issue. There has been too much work on a \nbipartisan basis to advance this bill, and it is very important to the \nAmerican business community and to American workers. Billions and \nbillions of dollars are at stake.\n  In fact, once the majority got serious about pension reform, \nconsideration of this bill in the Senate has been a model of bipartisan \ncooperation. It would not have passed late last year without the \nSenate's Democratic caucus pushing for its consideration and working \nwith Republicans to create a process by which a bipartisan consensus \ncould be forged and acted upon by the Senate in a reasonable amount of \ntime.\n  I agree that there have been unnecessary delays with regard to this \nlegislation, and I regret that the full Senate could not act on this \nlegislation until late last year. Consideration in the House and Senate \nwas delayed last year for two reasons.\n  First of all, the administration pension proposal was narrowly \nfocused on improving the solvency problems at the PBGC and failed to \nstrike the necessary balance between improving pension funding and \ncontinuing the attractiveness of defined benefit pension plans to \nemployers. It would have hastened the demise of defined pension plans, \nwhich today cover about one in five workers and provide workers greater \nretirement security because they provide a guaranteed stream of \nretirement income. The administration proposal generated little support \namong Republicans, but they weren't willing to buck the White House on \npolicy grounds and instead deferred action on this legislation. That \nwas unfortunate, but that is the way it is.\n  Consideration of the bill was also delayed by the decision of the \nHouse Republican leadership to hold pension reform hostage in order to \nadvance their failed Social Security privatization plan. The House \nRepublican leadership, as late as June of last year, was still delaying \neven committee consideration of the pension bill and wanted to couple \npension reform with the proposal to privatize Social Security. It \nwasn't fair to hold this important bill hostage in order to advance the \npolitically unpopular Social Security privatization plan. The political \nmessage to all those who cared about fixing the pension system was: Get \nbehind our privatization plan for Social Security or you won't get your \npension bill.\n\n[[Page S1404]]\n\n  For example, the San Francisco Chronicle reported on April 30 of last \nyear that ``House Republican leaders vowed Friday to push through \nCongress an overhaul not just of Social Security but `retirement \nsecurity,' grabbing the baton President Bush handed them at his \nprime.'' In fact, Mr. President, not only prime time but at a news \nconference he held promising to run with it.\n\n  The prime is past.\n\n       The savvy legislative tactician who thrives on complex \n     issues, Thomas outlined a much broader legislative front than \n     President Bush has proposed. Thomas suggested changes to \n     private savings and pensions outside of Social Security as \n     well as to the 70-year-old program, saying he would deliver a \n     ``retirement package for aging Americans.''\n       Chairman Thomas suggested this wide ranging proposal could \n     splinter the Democrats.\n\n  The Boston Globe reported months later in June:\n\n       Republicans in Congress want to turn aging baby boomer \n     fears of pension defaults heightened by the well-publicized \n     failure of the United Airlines plan to their advantage with \n     plans to link broad-based pension overhaul with elements of \n     President Bush's plan for personal Social Security accounts, \n     a move GOP leaders hope will break a logjam on Capitol Hill.\n       The strategy reflects a realization by GOP leaders that \n     their Democratic colleagues and even some Republicans are \n     steadfastly opposed to private accounts funded by a portion \n     of Social Security payroll tax.\n       Republican leaders hope to build on momentum generated by \n     the pension defaults and the shaky state of the federal \n     agency that insures pensions to make a case that retirement \n     security needs an across-the-board makeover and the type of \n     personal security accounts Bush has talked about should be \n     part of the solution.\n\n  Consequently, pension legislation languished in the Senate until the \nend of July. The inability of Senate Republicans on the Committee on \nFinance to produce a majority in favor of Social Security \nprivatization, pressure by Senate Democrats to move ahead separately on \npension reform, and high profile bankruptcies in the airline industry \ncreated enough pressure to break this logjam in the Senate.\n  Again, it was on a bipartisan basis. There was no filibuster, no \nobstruction, just inaction by the majority.\n  Despite these delays, Senators Grassley, Enzi, Boxer, and Kennedy, \nthe chairman and ranking members of the Committees on Finance and HELP, \nworked through the committee and on the floor to draft and pass a \nbipartisan pension bill. The Committee on Finance reported its bill at \nthe end of July. The HELP Committee reported its bill at the beginning \nof December. Committees agreed on a bipartisan basis to a compromise \nbill that merged the two approaches at the end of September.\n  The actual legislative work on this was relatively short, certainly, \nfor something as complex as this. The bill passed the full Senate on \nNovember 16. At that time, I commended Members on both sides for the \ndiligent work in hammering out a consensus bill, and again questioned \nwhy the Senate waited until November to address this important issue. \nIn fact, I worked with the distinguished majority leader in making sure \nthere were not a lot of extraneous amendments, and we could move \nforward.\n  There is no reason the Senate cannot move forward on this. We need to \nagree on a reasonable number of conferees. This is a bill, a very \ncomplex bill. What I am asking is there be three people from our HELP \nCommittee who are Democrats, and four from the Committee on Finance, a \ntotal of seven. This is a very important bill. The reason we are not \ngoing to conference is the majority is not willing to give the \nDemocrats another member--that is, they refuse to go with the ratio \nwhich the Republicans get, the best of that deal; they get two extra \nSenators. Now they say we have to do it with--I assume they want me to \ndo two from HELP and three from the Committee on Finance. That is \nunfair.\n  I need, the country needs, a pension reform bill. That can only be \ndone by going to conference. I plead with the majority, let's work this \nout. There is no reason we should not have a ratio of 8 to 6 that \nallows me to have three people from the HELP Committee who are experts \nin this field. They will move quickly. They are willing to work \nunending hours to resolve this matter.\n  A report in this morning's Congressional Quarterly suggests that \noutside interests are pushing for a very small conference, the smaller \nthe better, in order to prevent some Senators who have positions on \nthis most important issue, Senators who have worked on it for many \nyears, from participating in the conference. That is too bad.\n  This legislation has reached this point and we are here today because \nof strong bipartisan support for moving forward. It has not been a \npartisan process thus far and I hope it will not become a partisan \nprocess. I expect the conference to be conducted in a bipartisan \nmanner, no matter who gets appointed on what side. I am afraid the \nRepublican majority has decided they want to create a political issue \ninstead of trying to find a way around the impasse. The way around it \nis easy, 7 to 5 or 8 to 6. I hope we can continue working in a \nbipartisan way in order to get this bill to conference and enacted into \nlaw. It is an important piece of legislation.\n  It does not seem to me to be asking too much that the HELP Committee, \nwhich is so vitally important to the moving of this legislation, have \nthree Democrats on the HELP Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 12 minutes in order to introduce a bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the introduction of S. 2311 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Katrina Emergency Assistance\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to express my \nappreciation to my friend from Maine, Ms. Collins, for the passage of \nthe Katrina Emergency Assistance Act of 2005. This important \nlegislation passed the Senate by unanimous consent on Wednesday, \nFebruary 16, after several months of negotiations. I commend her \nefforts and the efforts of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs to take the initiative to address the recovery \nissues still facing the gulf coast.\n  Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman have both visited Mississippi \nand Louisiana and have seen the devastation and the progress that has \nbeen made and the work still left to be done.\n  Hurricane Katrina was certainly one of the deadliest and costliest \nnatural disasters in United States history.\n  On Monday, August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in \nLouisiana as a category 4 hurricane, with winds up to 145 mph, then \nturned eastward towards Mississippi, making landfall at 9 a.m., with \nwinds of 125 mph and with a storm surge over 20 feet high. At its peak, \nthe storm stretched 125 miles across the gulf coast\n  Almost 6 months later, the Congress and numerous Federal departments \nand agencies are still working to help those affected by the hurricane.\n  The Katrina Emergency Assistance Act will help people in a variety of \nimportant ways.\n  This legislation provides an additional 13 weeks of Federal Disaster \nUnemployment Assistance for those who lost their jobs as a result of \nHurricane Katrina, extending the duration of benefits from 26 weeks to \n39 weeks.\n  Thousands of residents of the gulf coast lost their jobs as a result \nof Hurricane Katrina. It is important to continue to provide this \nassistance while businesses, both large and small, reopen and expand.\n  The Katrina Emergency Assistance Act authorizes the Federal \nGovernment to reimburse local communities and community organizations \nfor purchasing and distributing essential supplies during a disaster \nsituation. Mayors, supervisors, local emergency managers, first \nresponders, and others in\n\n[[Page S1405]]\n\nthe disaster area should be free to purchase necessities such as food, \nice, clothing, toiletries, generators, and other essential items.\n  These individuals are often the first to respond to a disaster, and \nthey should be assured that their city, county, or organization will be \nreimbursed for these essential services.\n  This legislation also requires the Department of Homeland Security to \nestablish new guidelines for inspectors determining the eligibility of \nindividuals for Federal disaster assistance. This provision will help \nensure the timely delivery of assistance, while prohibiting conflicts \nof interest.\n  This legislation also expresses the sense of the Congress that the \nBureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement should refrain from \ninitiating removal proceedings against international students due to \ntheir inability to complete education requirements as a result of a \nnational disaster.\n  Numerous students from around the world are studying in this country \nat any given time. These students should not be punished as a result of \ndisaster that interferes with their legitimate educational plans.\n  Senators Collins and Lieberman and the members of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee have worked hard to provide \nassistance and respond to Hurricane Katrina.\n  The committee is close to completing its exhaustive investigation of \nthe response of the entire Federal Government will soon begin the \nprocess of drafting legislation to improve future Federal response \nefforts.\n  I look forward to working with them to address the concerns of \nMississippians and to improve the process of response and recovery.\n  I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to give every \nconsideration to this important legislation. The Katrina Emergency \nAssistance Act is the result of months of drafting and negotiating by \nSenators Collins and Lieberman and has the full backing of the United \nStates Senate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Pension Reform\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, a few moments ago the minority leader was \non the floor following up on a discussion that we had had earlier \ntoday. I would like to take a moment to respond to his request \nregarding the pension reform bill conference committee.\n  It looks as though we will have to continue to discuss this over the \nnext 24 hours because we have not made very much progress on a bill \nthat is critically important to the safety and security of the American \npeople. It is being postponed for no good reason. That is what it boils \ndown to.\n  These feeble attempts to explain why we keep putting the bill off are \nunacceptable at this point. We have to go back to the time line because \nthe facts do speak for themselves.\n  The Senate passed the pension reform bill on November 16 of last \nyear. So that is--November, December, January, February--almost 3 \nmonths ago exactly, or close to it. It was passed by a vote of 97 to 2. \nAlmost all of our colleagues in here, 97 to 2, voted for this bill. The \nHouse passed its bill about a month later, on December 15. They passed \nit overwhelmingly, 294 to 132. Shortly after the House passed the bill, \nwe proposed going to conference with a ratio of 7 to 5. That was back \nin December. It took the other side of the aisle until yesterday to \nrespond.\n  It looks as if it is, again, a pattern of delay and obstruction. They \nhave had over 2 months to broach this concern and resolve the dispute \nwithin their caucus as to who would serve on this conference. Our side \nhad to make tough choices, as we talked about this morning. My \ncolleague from Mississippi and another colleague who wasn't on the \nfloor spoke to me thereafter and said: Why wasn't I on that tax \nreconciliation bill conference?\n  Yesterday, we appointed conferees--two from our side of the aisle and \none from their side of the aisle, a total of three. To make these \ndecisions, it takes leadership and calls for leadership just to say \nthis is going to be the number, and let's proceed ahead, and with both \nthe Republican and Democratic caucuses we have to make tough choices \nand tell our colleagues that not everybody can serve on every \nconference committee.\n  It may be that there is a legitimate dispute on the other side of the \naisle about who should get to serve. But, again, I question this \npattern of obstruction and delay and postponement. This may well be \nanother instance of election year delays to slow down the legislative \nprocess and try to attempt to keep us from governing in a responsible \nway.\n  If there is a legitimate disagreement about who they should get to \nserve on their side of the aisle, I have a proposal that might resolve \nthat matter. We can talk about it tomorrow. I would propose appointing \nsix Democratic conferees, which would address their problem, and nine \nRepublican conferees. This should more than accommodate the request of \nthe Democratic leader, while allowing us to maintain equal \nrepresentation of the two committees, the HELP Committee and the \nFinance Committee, which have jurisdiction of this bill.\n  In the meantime, as we discuss and debate this issue, the clock is \nticking. We need to appoint conferees right away because, as was \nexplained earlier on the floor today, the first quarter of the fiscal \nyear ends on March 31. Within 2 weeks of that happening, companies have \nto make contributions to their pension plans. If we don't go ahead and \npass comprehensive pension plan reform before then, those contributions \nmay result in bankrupting those companies.\n  So I close with simply saying that time is of the essence. We cannot \ndelay. We need to act now to once and for all get this done, to get to \nconference so that we can resolve the issues on this particular bill.\n  Mr. President, in direct response to a number of issues that have \nbeen raised on the bill on the floor right now, the PATRIOT Act, I have \na few comments to make. Once again we have a slow-walking of the \npolicymaking process on the floor. We are slow-walking the PATRIOT Act, \na bill that we absolutely know will make this country safer and more \nsecure--an improved bill.\n  Tuesday night, cloture was filed on the motion to proceed to S. 2271, \nwhich is a stalling tactic or a filibustering tactic. On the USA \nPATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006, which is \nthe formal name of this important bill, we had to file cloture because \notherwise this bill will continue to be filibustered and postponed \nindefinitely. Today, we invoked cloture. I think the vote was 96 to 3; \nI believe that is correct. That shows there is overwhelming support for \nthis bill. I think that reflects what should be the reality, and that \nis that this bill is going to pass with overwhelming majority support. \nYet we have, in essence, wasted yesterday and today, tomorrow, Monday, \nand Tuesday, until we are allowed to vote on this bill Wednesday \nmorning following the break.\n  Once again, the other side seems to be throwing up roadblock after \nroadblock, demanding unnecessary procedural steps to slow down, to \nhinder reauthorization of what law enforcement has described as its No. \n1 terrorist-fighting tool, the PATRIOT Act.\n  If the delays in any way would change the outcome or alter the \noutcome, I could understand it, but that is simply not the case. The \noutcome of this bill is not in any doubt. The PATRIOT Act will pass \nwith overwhelming bipartisan support. It is just being delayed for \ndelay's sake and, to me, that is simply unacceptable. The American \npeople, unfortunately, pay a price for all of this in two ways.\n  First of all, the improved PATRIOT Act, which strengthens that \nability to remove those burdens between the law enforcement and \nintelligence act, is one dimension.\n  Second is, all the pressing issues of securing America's freedom, \nAmerica's health, improving education, promoting progrowth policy to \nincrease and promote the prosperity of America, all of that gets pushed \noff to the future.\n  The original PATRIOT Act passed with overwhelming, near unanimous \nsupport in its original version. We know it has been instrumental in \nthe\n\n[[Page S1406]]\n\nsuccessful tracking and arrest of key terrorist figures.\n  Just last week, we learned how, in 2002, a terror plan to hijack a \ncommercial airliner and fly it into the Los Angeles Library Tower was \nthwarted. Authorities discovered that Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the \nmastermind of 9/11, had recruited a suicide hijacking cell to bring \ndown the 73-story skyscraper--the tallest building on the West Coast.\n  Authorities were able to hunt down and capture Khalid Sheik Mohammed, \nalong with his accomplice, Hambali, the leader in al-Qaida, in \nSoutheast Asia, the leader of the terrorist cell, and three of its \nterrorist members.\n  It was a tremendous victory in the war on terror, and it saved \ncountless innocent lives. But it also reminded us that our enemies are \nruthless. It reminded us that they are determined to kill scores of \nAmericans, hundreds of Americans, right here on American soil. They are \ndetermined to exploit any weakness or slip through any potential \nloophole.\n  We cannot let our guard down. We must never, ever let our guard down. \nWe have to stay on the offensive. On \n9/11, the enemy was able to allude law enforcement, in part, because \nour agencies weren't able to share key intelligence information. That \nis why, within 6 weeks of the attacks on America, Congress passed the \nUSA PATRIOT Act with overwhelming bipartisan support. It was near \nunanimous. The vote was 98 Senators voting in favor.\n  The PATRIOT Act went to work immediately, tearing down the \ninformation wall between agencies, and it allowed the intelligence \ncommunity and law enforcement to work more closely in pursuit of \nterrorists and their activities. Since then, it has been highly \neffective in tracking down terrorists and making America safer. Because \nof the PATRIOT Act, the United States has charged over 400 suspected \nterrorists. More than half of them have already been convicted. Law \nenforcement has broken up terrorist cells all across the country, from \nNew York to California, Virginia, down to Florida.\n\n  In San Diego, officials were able to use the PATRIOT Act to \ninvestigate and prosecute several suspects in an al-Qaida drug-for-\nweapons plot. The investigation led to several guilty pleas. The \nPATRIOT Act also allowed prosecutors and investigators to crack the \nVirginia jihad case involving 11 men who had trained for jihad in \nNorthern Virginia in Pakistan and in Afghanistan. We need to continue \nto provide these tools to track and foil terrorist plots before harm \ncan be done to innocent Americans.\n  The PATRIOT Act has been debated thoroughly. It has been negotiated. \nIt has been drafted, and it has been redrafted again. It is time to \nbring this process to a close. The bill before us is the result of \nsincere, good-faith efforts and builds on the work that was \naccomplished last year to renew the PATRIOT Act. It strengthens our \ncivil liberties protections as well as the core antiterrorist \nsafeguards that have been so critical in fighting the war on terror.\n  In 2006, the USA PATRIOT Act, as written, once passed, will help us \nto combat terrorist financing and money laundering, protect our mass \ntransportation systems and railways from attacks such as the one on the \nLondon subway last summer, and to secure our seaports. It will help us \nfight methamphetamine drug abuse, America's No. 1 drug problem today, \nby restricting access to the ingredients used to make that poisonous \ndrug, methamphetamines.\n  So the question before us now is pretty straightforward. It is \nsimple. Why delay all of these provisions any longer? Why wait to move \nforward to make America safer? Why wait to give law enforcement the \nsame tools they already use against white-collar criminals and drug \noffenders? It doesn't make sense to postpone, to delay, to wait.\n  Those who are delaying the bill claim they are taking a stand for \nstronger civil liberty protections. Yet they admit that the renewal of \nthe PATRIOT Act is a vast improvement over current law. Again, why wait \nto enact the dozens of civil liberties protections in this bill that \nthey have supported for so long. We have a duty and responsibility to \nprotect our fellow Americans. Indeed, it is our highest duty as \nSenators.\n  I urge my colleagues to move forward to renew the PATRIOT Act. The \ntime to act is now. It is the only, the best, and the right thing to \ndo.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen).

Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments to speak \nvery briefly about heart disease. Many people might not know but \nFebruary is American Heart Month, and heart disease, as we certainly \nknow, is the Nation's leading cause of death.\n  Many women believe heart disease is a man's disease. Unfortunately, \nthere are many women in this country who do not view this as a serious \nhealth threat. Yet every year since 1984, cardiovascular disease has \nclaimed the lives of more women than men. In fact, cardiovascular \ndisease death rates have declined in men since 1979, which is great \nnews, but the death rate for women during that same period has actually \nincreased. The numbers are disturbing.\n  Cardiovascular diseases claim the lives of more than 480,000 women \nper year. That is nearly a death a minute among females and nearly 12 \ntimes as many lives as claimed by breast cancer. One in four females \nhas some form of cardiovascular disease. Again, these are statistics \nmany of us would find alarming, certainly, but also find that it is new \ninformation, something we didn't know.\n  I am pleased to join with my colleague from Michigan, Senator \nStabenow, to introduce important legislation we have entitled the HEART \nFor Women Act, or Heart Disease Education, Analysis, and Research, and \nTreatment For Women Act. This important bill improves the prevention, \ndiagnosis, and treatment of heart disease and stroke in women.\n  In Alaska, we have some very troubling statistics as they relate to \nheart disease. In Alaska, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause \nof death, totaling nearly 800 deaths per year. Women in Alaska have \nhigher death rates from stroke than do women nationally. Mortality \namongst Native Alaskan women is dramatically on the rise, whereas it is \nappearing to decline among Caucasian women in the lower 48. So these \nstatistics, again, should cause us concern.\n  Despite being the No. 1 killer, many women and their health care \nproviders do not know the biggest health care threat to women is heart \ndisease. In fact, a recent survey found that 45 percent of women still \ndo not know heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women.\n  Perhaps even more troubling is the lack of awareness amongst our \nhealth care providers. According to the American Heart Association \nfigures, less than one in five physicians recognize more women suffer \nfrom heart disease than men. Only 8 percent of primary care \nphysicians--and even more astounding--only 17 percent of cardiologists \nrecognize that more women die of heart disease than men. Additionally, \nstudies show women are less likely to receive aggressive treatment \nbecause heart disease often manifests itself differently in women than \nin men.\n  This is why this HEART Act is so important. Our bill takes a three-\npronged approach to reducing heart disease death rates for women \nthrough education, research, and screening.\n  First, the bill would authorize the Department of Health and Human \nServices to educate health care professionals and older women about the \nunique aspects of care and prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of \nwomen with heart disease and stroke.\n\n[[Page S1407]]\n\n  Second, the bill would require disclosure of gender-specific health \ninformation that is already being reported to the Federal Government. \nWe already have many agencies that are collecting the information based \non gender, but they don't disseminate or analyze the gender \ndifferences. This bill would release that information so it could be \nstudied and important health trends in women could be detected.\n  Lastly, the bill would authorize the expansion of the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention's WISEWOMAN program. WISEWOMAN is the \nacronym for the Well-Integrated Screening and Evaluation For Women \nAcross the Nation program. The WISEWOMAN program provides free heart \ndisease and stroke screening to low-income, uninsured women. But the \nprogram currently is limited to 14 States. In the State of Alaska, we \nare fortunate to have two WISEWOMAN program sites, and these programs \nscreen for high blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose in Native \nAlaskan women, and they have been providing invaluable counseling on \ndiet and exercise. One program in Alaska has successfully screened \n1,437 Native Alaskan women and has provided them with culturally \nappropriate intervention programs that have truly produced lifesaving \nresults.\n  Heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases cost \nAmericans more than any other disease--an estimated $403 billion in \n2006, including more than $250 billion in direct medical costs. We as a \nNation can control these costs. Prevention through early detection is \nthe most cost-effective way to combat the disease.\n  A few days ago we celebrated Valentine's Day, and we saw images of \nhearts then and we are still seeing them around now. We shouldn't \nforget that the heart is more than a symbol--it is a vital organ that \ncan't be taken for granted. Coronary disease can be treated \neffectively, and sometimes even prevented. It does not have to be the \nNo. 1 cause of death in women, and that is why I encourage my \ncolleagues to support the HEART for Women Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/16/senate-section/article/S1407-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMMONSENSE GUN SAFETY LAWS SAVE LIVES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, an analysis by the Violence Policy Center, \nVPC, of the most recent data available from the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, CDC, revealed that the national per capita \ndeath rate from guns was 10.36 people per 100,000 in 2003. In addition, \n10 States had per capita gun death rates of more than 15 gun deaths per \n100,000 people. Not coincidentally, the States with the highest per \ncapita gun death rates also have some of the most lax gun safety laws \nin the country. This is further evidence that commonsense gun safety \nlaws do save lives.\n  Each year the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence produces a ``Gun \nViolence Report Card'' in which it assigns individual States a grade on \ntheir gun safety laws of A through F. In its analysis, the Brady \ncampaign evaluates State gun safety laws on factors such as: whether it \nis illegal for a child to possess a gun without supervision; whether it \nis illegal to sell a gun to a child; whether gun owners are held \nresponsible for leaving loaded guns easily accessible to children; \nwhether guns are required to have child-safety locks, loaded-chamber \nindicators and other childproof designs; whether cities and counties \nhave authority to enact local gun safety laws; whether background \nchecks are required at gun shows and between private parties; and, \nwhether it is legal to carry concealed handguns in public.\n  When the analysis of the CDC gun death data for 2003 is compared with \nthe Brady campaign's report card for the same year, we find that the \nStates with the lowest rates of gun deaths also received the highest \ngrades from the Brady campaign. In fact, four of the five States with \nthe lowest gun death rates received an ``A-,'' the highest grade \nawarded by the Brady campaign that year, and the fifth received a \n``B-.'' These five States had an average rate of 3.81 gun deaths per \n100,000 people, less than half of the national average. Conversely, \nfour of the five States with the highest rates of gun deaths received \nan ``F,'' while the fifth received a ``D-.'' These five States had an \naverage rate of 17.9 gun deaths per 100,000 people.\n  According to the Brady campaign, none of the top 15 States with the \nhighest rates of gun deaths have laws requiring background checks on \nguns purchased at gun shows or from private sellers. Under current \nFederal law, when an individual buys a firearm from a licensed dealer, \nthere are requirements for a background check to ensure that the \npurchaser is not prohibited by law from purchasing or possessing a \nfirearm. However, this is not the case for all gun purchases. For \nexample, when an individual wants to buy a firearm from a private \ncitizen who is not a licensed gun dealer, there is no Federal \nrequirement that the seller ensure that the purchaser is not in a \nprohibited category. This creates a loophole in the Federal law, \nproviding prohibited purchasers, including convicted criminals, with \npotential easy access to dangerous firearms. Fortunately, some States, \nincluding the five with the lowest rates of gun deaths, have enacted \nlaws to help close this loophole.\n  Congress should work to enact national gun safety standards, \nincluding mandatory background checks on all gun sales, to help reduce \nthe high rate of gun deaths across the country. The States who have \nalready enacted commonsense gun safety legislation have shown that \ntheir laws make a difference and we should follow their lead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/16/senate-section/article/S1407-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1407-S1409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RELIGIOUS FREEDOM\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, Thomas Jefferson called religious \nfreedom the ``first freedom.'' As founder and leader over the last 3 \nyears of the Congressional Working Group on Religious Freedom, I wanted \nto take this opportunity to pay tribute to this pivotal liberty. Last \nmonth, President Bush also recognized this important freedom by \ndeclaring ``Religious Freedom Day,'' observed on January 16.\n  Americans are among the most religious peoples on Earth and are of \nmany faith traditions. Nearly 80 percent of Americans state they pray \nregularly. Within a few blocks of this Capitol, there are churches, \nmeeting houses, synagogues, mosques, temples, and house of worship of \nevery variety.\n  The free exercise of religion is a hallmark of our Nation. It is the \nreason many of our ancestors came here. It is the reason we are able to \nlive peacefully together as a religiously diverse people. Cherished by \nthe American people as the most precious of those rights given by God, \nreligious freedom has been given the pride of place in our \nConstitution, in the first clause of the first amendment of the Bill of \nRights.\n  Freedom of thought, conscience, and religious belief, as Jefferson \nand the American Founders recognized, is the prerequisite for the \nexercise of other basic human rights. Freedom of speech, press, and \nassembly depend on a free conscience. No basic freedom can be secure \nwhere religious freedom is denied.\n  But these rights do not just belong to Americans. They are universal; \nthey belong to every person in this world. No one, from the worst \ndictator to the most powerful government, can take away the right for a \nperson to believe as he or she wishes. However, the expression of this \nbelief is too often repressed through the imposition of persecution and \ndeath.\n  Since the Nazi Holocaust against the Jewish people, the principle of \nreligious freedom has gained recognition in foreign policy. The right \nto religious freedom found worldwide acceptance in the 1948 Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, to which many nations have agreed. \n``Everyone,'' the declaration asserts, ``has the right to freedom of \nthought, conscience and religion.'' As the declaration makes explicit, \n``this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and \nfreedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or \nprivate, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, \nworship and observance.''\n  The declaration's article 18 thus provides for the acceptance of \nreligious pluralism; the freedom to convert to another faith; the right \nto express unorthodox beliefs in one's individual capacity; the right, \nnot only to worship in private or behind the walls of a building but to \nexpress one's faith in society. These are powerful concepts that \nchallenge many societies, including at times our own.\n  For example, I have introduced the Workplace Religious Freedom Act, a\n\n[[Page S1408]]\n\nbill which would restore a balanced approach to religious freedom in \nthe workplace. It would clarify current law, which requires employers \nto accommodate the religious beliefs of their employees, unless doing \nso would cause significant difficulty or financial hardship for the \nemployer. While most employers recognize the value of respecting \nreligion in the workplace, sometimes employees are forced to choose \nbetween dedication to the principles of their faith and losing their \njob because their employers refuse to reasonably accommodate certain \nneeds. It is supported by a broad spectrum of groups, liberal and \nconservative, who share this Nation's commitment to the freedom of \nconscience.\n  The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, which I supported, \ninstitutionalized religious freedom as a guiding doctrine in America's \nforeign relations. The act established within the State Department an \noffice, headed by an Ambassador-at-Large, to monitor and report \nannually on the status of religious freedom in every country; and it \ncreated the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom as an \nindependent Government agency to study and propose new policies to \nadvance religious freedom abroad.\n  Because of this legislation, regular reports are being issued by the \nState Department on the status of religious freedom in every country. \nCitizens now have access to information not easily available \npreviously. The U.S. Government is now designating countries as being \nof particular concern solely because of their records on religious \nfreedom. While more actions can be taken, our Government is making this \nfreedom a priority.\n  The founder of Pennsylvania, William Penn, and many others fled to \nthis land seeking religious freedom. Centuries later, the United States \nremains a beacon for the religiously repressed around the world. Our \nCongressional Working Group on Religious Freedom includes persons from \ndiverse countries and faith backgrounds who have found religious \nfreedom in America and who now dedicate their lives to speaking out for \nthe persecuted around the world.\n  A regular participant in our Working Group is Ali Alyami. Dr. Alyami \nis a Muslim from Saudi Arabia, but he is not a follower of Wahhabism, \nthe extremist, state-sanctioned brand of Islam in Saudi Arabia, and so \nhe faces marginalization and repression in his homeland.\n  Another is Bob Fu, an evangelical Christian leader who was arrested \nin his native China for praying in an unauthorized house-church before \nfinding refuge in the United States and moving to Philadelphia.\n  Eden Naby, an Assyrian Christian, spoke at our ``Christmas under \nSiege'' meeting last month about the accelerating attrition rate of \nreligious minorities fleeing ethnic cleansing and extremism in Iraq,\n  Seung-Woo Kahng attested to the cruelties suffered by an underground \nchurch-leader in North Korea.\n  Michael Muenir, a Copt originally from Egypt, reported to our group \nabout the failure of Egyptian justice when Copts are murdered by \nIslamic fanatics, discrimination against the Copts in the upper \nechelons of government and military, and the obstacles to getting \ngovernment permission to build or even repair churches in Egypt.\n  Bat Ye'or, a Jewish author originally from Egypt, spoke of the rising \ntide of anti-Semitism throughout Europe.\n  These and many more like them are grateful to have the freedom in the \nUnited States to speak out about the need for religious freedom in many \ncountries throughout the world.\n  When we look at the overall state of religious freedom in the world, \nstate-sponsored religious persecution of the harshest severity--\ntorture, imprisonment, and even death--occurs today under three types \nof regimes: the remnant communist regimes; repressive Islamist states; \nand nationalist authoritarian states. Many of the countries represented \nin these categories are those that have been officially designated by \nthe U.S. State Department as ``countries of particular concern,'' or \n``CPCs,'' for their ``egregious, systematic, and continuing'' \nviolations of religious freedom.\n  The first type of regime is that of the remnant communist states, \nsuch as China, North Korea, and Vietnam. For example:\n  North Korea systematically crushes public expressions of religion and \nputs in harsh concentration camps those accused of being religious, \nalong with up to three generations of their family members.\n  China seeks to control all religion and punishes religious leaders \nwho worship without authorization with fines, ``reeducation'' camp, and \nother forms of incarceration. It also harshly treats Falun Gong \npractitioners, who have reported to us about torture and murder at the \nhands of authorities.\n  Vietnam beats and tortures its Hmong and tribal Christians until they \nrecant their faith.\n  A second main type of regime fostering state-sponsored persecution is \nthat of repressive Islamic states. For example:\n  In recent years, the Sudanese Government prosecuted a genocidal war \nin its south in which over 2 million Christians and followers of \ntraditional African religions were killed and thousands enslaved for \nresisting the forcible imposition of Islamic law. Khartoum is now \nemploying the genocidal tactics honed in the religious conflict with \nthe south in a race-based conflict in its western Darfur region.\n  Iran's fanatical regime has tortured and killed many thousands of its \nown nationals for religious reasons. One Iranian political dissident, a \nMuslim professor named Hashem Aghajari, aptly protested at his July \n2004 blasphemy trial that he was being punished for ``the sin of \nthinking.''\n  Saudi Arabia continues to indoctrinate its students in an ideology of \nreligious hatred and exports such propaganda to other Muslims \ncommunities throughout the world, including here in the United States; \nSaudi researchers themselves found that the state's curriculum \n``misguides the pupils into believing that in order to safeguard their \nown religion, they must violently repress and even physically eliminate \nthe `other.' ''\n  The third type of regime where religious persecution is prevalent is \nthat of nationalist authoritarian states, such as Burma and Eritrea. \nFor example:\n  In Burma, the government subjects all publications, including \nreligious publications, to control and censorship. The government \ngenerally prohibits outdoor meetings of more than five persons, \nincluding religious meetings.\n  In Eritrea there are reports that police have tortured those detained \nfor their religious beliefs, including using bondage, heat exposure, \nand beatings. Also, some detainees were required to sign statements \nrepudiating their faith or agreeing not to practice it as a condition \nfor release.\n  Lastly, we have unfortunately seen a global trend of growing anti-\nSemitism which has also been brought before our working group. It has \nbeen seen in Iran where the President has notoriously denied the \nHolocaust and threatened the existence of Israel, in the streets of \nRussia, in the capitals of Europe, and even on the campuses of American \nuniversities. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an abominable anti-\nSemitic forgery of a Russian czar, is resurfacing at Iranian \ngovernment-sponsored book fairs, on Egyptian-controlled television \nbroadcasts and in Saudi-published textbooks. This precise work was used \nby Hitler to indoctrinate Nazi youths. We must take this threat \nseriously.\n  Natan Sharansky, himself once a Soviet religious prisoner, a ``Jewish \nrefusenik,'' states that a test of a free society is whether ``people \nhave a right to express their views without fear of arrest, \nimprisonment, or physical harm.'' None of the CPCs cited above are free \nsocieties. It is no coincidence that regimes that pose the gravest \nthreats to our national security--Iran and North Korea today--are also \nones that tyrannically crush freedom of belief. The protection and \npromotion of religious freedom is as fundamental to our national \ninterest, as it is to our ideals.\n  When we promote religious freedom for these countries and others, \nwhen we as members of the Senate speak publicly on religious freedom, \nwhen we raise the issue on our trips abroad and in our meetings with \nforeign officials, when we make sure that members of\n\n[[Page S1409]]\n\nthe administration and embassy officials around the world raise these \nvalues regularly with foreign governments, when we speak on behalf of \npersecuted dissidents, and when we act consistently in our own country, \nwe will not only be working to ensure every person can worship as they \nsee fit. We will also be ensuring a safer, peaceful, more secure world \nwhere the rights of all--the freedoms of all--are respected and \ncelebrated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/16/senate-section/article/S1409-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RENT RELIEF TO FEDERAL JUDICIARY\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss S. 2292, a bill to \nprovide rent relief to the Federa1 judiciary. Our Federal judges and \ncourt administrators have expressed serious concerns about the rental \ncharges assessed by the General Services Administration, GSA, in \ncourthouses and other space occupied by the courts around the country. \nIf enacted, this legislation would require the administrator of general \nservices to charge the judicial branch no more rent than that which \nrepresents the actual costs of operating and maintaining its \nfacilities. Specifically, it prohibits the General Services \nAdministration from including amounts for capital costs, real estate \ntaxes, except for those taxes actually paid by the administrator of \ngeneral services to lessors, or administrative fees in rental charges.\n  The current budgetary problems caused by the judiciary's rental \npayments must be addressed. In fiscal terms, since 1986, the Federal \nCourts' rental payments to GSA have increased from $133 million to $912 \nmillion. The percentage of the judiciary's operating budget devoted to \nrent payments has escalated sharply from 15.7 percent in 1986 to about \n22 percent in 2004. During this same time, the share of the Federal \nbudget provided to the judiciary has dwindled as Congress has sought to \ntackle our Nation's increasing budget deficit. Even as overall \nresources available to the judiciary dwindle, analysts project that \nrental payments will reach approximately $1.2 billion by 2009, which \nwill be an estimated 25 percent of the judiciary's annual operating \nbudget.\n  I believe that the courts are doing everything they possibly can to \ncontain their costs without adversely affecting the administration of \njustice. The Federal judiciary has imposed a 24-month moratorium on the \nconstruction of any new courthouses and has stopped planning for many \nprojects. If rent relief is not granted to the judiciary, more \npersonnel cuts will be required in the near future, including the loss \nof another 4,000 jobs over the next 4 years.\n  In my view, this constitutes a near crisis in the Federal judiciary. \nSpace and appropriate personnel play a significant role in our judicial \nsystem. The ready availability of appropriate courtrooms, jury \ndeliberation and assembly rooms, and workspace for support staff all \nfacilitate the administration of justice. Appropriate space for drug \ntesting and monitoring of persons under supervision by Federal \nprobation officers is of the utmost importance. It is critical that the \ncourts have all the tools they need to carry out their mission. \nProviding this relief to the judiciary will allow them to improve the \nadministration of justice for all Americans.\n  Additionally, serious building-related security problems in existing \ncourthouses are also a key consideration. Courthouses should have \nsecure passage for detainees to be transported, separating public \npassageways from these individuals. Unfortunately, this is not the case \nin many courthouses, including several courthouses in my home state of \nTexas. As an example, I recently wrote to Attorney General Gonzales to \nurge him to ensure that funding is granted to fix security concerns \nidentified at the Midland Federal Courthouse as soon as possible. \nAffording the judiciary rent relief so they can devote more money to \ncourthouse security is a good first step.\n  Finally, I think it is important to point out that this bill \naddresses the unequal treatment generally afforded the lower Federal \ncourts. Many of the buildings used by other agencies and branches of \nthe Federal Government are exempt from rent. For example, the \nDepartment of Defense pays no rent to GSA on the Pentagon or on \nmilitary bases. The Treasury Department, which once housed GSA, pays no \nrent on the main Treasury building or on its Mints. The Supreme Court--\nunlike the lower Federal courts--pays no rent. Likewise, the Federal \nReserve Board, the FDIC, and many other quasi-federal agencies do not \npay rent to GSA. There is no rent paid on Federal prisons, embassies, \nNIH facilities, nuclear facilities, VA hospitals, EPA labs, or national \nparks and national forest facilities. Congress does not pay rent on the \nCapitol Building we're deliberating in today. Nor does Congress pay \nrent on the Senate or House office buildings or surrounding structures. \nCongress is charged rent by GSA only for a small amount of space for \ncongressional State and district offices. The Federal judiciary--\nspecifically, the lower Federal courts--lack that same advantage. This \nbill takes a step towards granting the judiciary equal treatment.\n  It is important that all who enter our Nation's courts are ensured \nfair and equitable treatment. This bill is a critical component in \nachieving this goal. I will work with Senator Specter and the other co-\nsponsors to get this bill moving through the judiciary committee as \nsoon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/16/senate-section/article/S1409-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PROVIDING RELIEF FOR THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY FROM EXCESSIVE RENT CHARGES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday Chairman Specter introduced a \nbill I cosponsored to provide relief for the Federal judiciary from \nexcessive rent charges assessed by the General Services Administration, \nGSA, for the use of courthouses and other spaces occupied by the courts \nacross the Nation. Since 1986, the Federal courts' rental payments to \nGSA have increased dramatically, with the percentage of the judiciary's \noperating budget devoted to rent payments escalating from 15.7 percent \nin 1986 to approximately 22 percent in 2004. If no changes are made, \nthis percentage is expected to continue to rise sharply. This \nlegislation brings these rent charges under control by capping the rent \ncharges at GSA's actual costs of operating and maintaining \naccommodations provided to the judicial branch, by specifying that \ncertain capital costs, taxes, and administrative fees shall not be \nincluded in GSA's rent charges, and by establishing a means for \nrepayment over time for the future costs of repair and alteration \nprojects performed by GSA.\n  As the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have been \nconcerned about the adverse effect of these rent payments on the \nadministration of justice. On May 13, 2005, a bipartisan group of 11 \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee, including Chairman Specter and \nmyself, sent a letter to GSA asking it to exercise its authority to \nexempt the judicial branch from all rental payments except those \nrequired to operate and maintain Federal court buildings and related \ncosts. GSA's response has not been adequate. As set forth in that \nletter, the excessive rent paid by the judiciary will exacerbate severe \npersonnel shortages by forcing more cuts and could also have impacts on \ncourthouse security. The rent relief provided in this bill will help \nensure that the judiciary continues to have the tools it needs to carry \nout its unique and vital function.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/16/senate-section/article/S1409-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1409-S1410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         KATRINA ON THE GROUND\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina tore \nthrough the gulf coast States leaving in its wake death and destruction \nthat none of us will soon forget. In the immediate aftermath, graphic \nimages of people struggling to escape the flooding in New Orleans and \ndigging through the rubble of their homes in Mississippi and Alabama \nfilled our television sets and newspapers. People were outraged at the \nGovernment's response. They volunteered their time to aid in rescues. \nThey donated their money to help the victims. But many soon moved on.\n  The problems faced by the residents of the gulf coast, however, have \nnot gone away. Rebuilding is underway, but it will take years. We \ncannot forget the work that still needs to be done or the people who \nare still struggling.\n  That is why I am so impressed with a new volunteer initiative called \nKatrina on the Ground. Katrina on the Ground, or KOTG, will bring \ntogether students from across the country to help rebuild\n\n[[Page S1410]]\n\nthe hurricane-ravaged cities of Mobile, AL, Biloxi, MS, and New \nOrleans, LA, during their spring break vacations. Each student will \nprovide at least one week of assistance in the region after receiving a \nday of training in Selma, AL. This is a stunning commitment of time and \nenergy given that many students spend their spring breaks at the beach \nor on vacation.\n  Choosing the 21st Century Youth Leadership camp in Selma, AL, as a \ntraining site was not a coincidence. Selma, as we all know, is where \nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. led his last great march in 1965--the march \nthat led to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. KOTG's founders hope to \nbuild on the spirit of the civil rights movement, invigorating a new \ngeneration of leaders to effect change. As Kevin Powell, one of the \nfounders points out, ``There has been nothing like this since the \nstudent-led anti-apartheid movement of the 1980s or . . . the student \nsit-ins and freedom rides of the 1960s.'' A student army, 500 to 700 \nstrong, sends a powerful message to residents of the gulf coast and the \nrest of the Nation that we care and we have not forgotten.\n  I commend these students, KOTG's partner organizations, and its \nfounders KOTG for their creativity, their compassion, and their \ncommitment to public service. KOTG gives us hope for the future and \ndemonstrates that the leaders of tomorrow are already here, ready, and \nwilling to face the toughest challenges of our time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/16/senate-section/article/S1410-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMITTEE TESTIMONY OF LYNETTE MUND\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Earlier this month, Lynette Mund, a teacher and coach \nfrom West Fargo, ND, testified before the Senate Commerce Committee \nabout the importance of women's athletics.\n  Lynette is a great athlete in her own right. She was a three-time \nnational champion in basketball. Her home State of North Dakota has \nalways been proud of her and is lucky to have her contributions at West \nFargo High School.\n  Her excellent statement laid out the struggles of providing the \nopportunity for young women to participate in sports. I ask unanimous \nconsent that her statement be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Testimony of Lynette Mund--Promoting Women in Sports, February 1, 2006\n\n       Good morning, Chairman Stevens, Senator Inouye and Members \n     of the Committee. On behalf of the state of North Dakota, I \n     would like to thank the Commerce Committee for hearing my \n     testimony.\n       My name is Lynette Mund and I am a teacher and head girls \n     basketball coach at West Fargo High School in West Fargo, \n     North Dakota. I am here today to testify to the importance of \n     women's athletics and the struggles of providing athletic \n     opportunities to young girls in rural communities. I will \n     also discuss what I am doing to encourage more young girls to \n     participate in sports in North Dakota.\n       Girls and women being involved in athletics has been a long \n     discussed issue. Many questions have been asked, such as \n     ``Can girls' bodies handle it?'' ``Are girls mentally tough \n     enough?'' ``Does it really make a difference in a girl's \n     life?'' I am here as evidence that the answers to the \n     previous questions are all ``Yes''. The fact that I am in \n     Washington, DC, testifying in front of the U.S. Senate \n     Commerce Committee shows what a difference sports can make in \n     a girl's life. Twenty years ago, I was a 12-year-old girl who \n     was milking cows on my parent's dairy farm in rural North \n     Dakota, and now I am here in our nation's capital with some \n     of the most influential people in our country listening to \n     what I have to say. I have always loved sports, but I had no \n     idea where they would take me and the confidence they would \n     give me.\n       At age 13, I was a skinny 8th grader who was stepping out \n     on the basketball court to start my first varsity game, and \n     by age 23, I was a 3-time NCAA Division II National Champion \n     and a college graduate from North Dakota State University who \n     had the confidence to leave North Dakota and move to the \n     ``big city'' of St. Louis, MO. However, while I was in St. \n     Louis, I always had a desire to move back to North Dakota and \n     give back part of what I had been given. That opportunity \n     presented itself when I was offered the head girls basketball \n     coaching position at West Fargo High School. Being back in \n     North Dakota not only afforded me the chance to work with \n     female athletes in West Fargo, but I was also able to \n     continue working with young girls back near my hometown of \n     Milnor, ND, which has a population of 700 people.\n       As I stated earlier, I grew up on a dairy farm. I was a \n     relatively naive young lady without much self-confidence. I \n     had always dreamed of going to college, but I knew it would \n     not be affordable without a college scholarship. I remember \n     standing out in the milk barn and hearing on the radio that a \n     local basketball star, Pat Smykowski, had gotten a college \n     scholarship to play basketball, and right then and there I \n     knew that was what I wanted to do. Thankfully, due to the \n     efforts of many great women before me, the chance to \n     participate in college athletics was available; something my \n     mother and many women from her generation never had an \n     opportunity to do. My mom used to talk about wanting to play \n     sports but not having the chance to compete. I sometimes sit \n     and wonder how different my life would be without athletics. \n     I wonder if I would have had the money to attend college, if \n     I would have had the confidence to move away from my home \n     state, and if I would have had the nerve to fly to \n     Washington, DC, all by myself and speak in front of U.S. \n     Senators. However, all of these things happened because I \n     participated in athletics. As a result, I want to inform and \n     inspire other young girls from rural North Dakota.\n       One of the biggest challenges in rural North Dakota is that \n     there are very few opportunities for athletes to improve \n     their skills. That is why over the last 12 years, I have \n     offered over 40 basketball camps in North Dakota and \n     Minnesota. I am proud to have given over 800 young women the \n     opportunity to participate in their first basketball camp. \n     For many of these young girls, my camps are the only exposure \n     they will have to an athletic camp for the whole year. Over \n     the years, I have had the chance to see some of my former \n     campers continue their careers in high school athletics, some \n     of which I have actually had to coach against! However, it \n     was always worth it to see how far these young ladies have \n     come and the confidence they now carry. At the time they \n     attended camp, you should have seen their eyes when I told \n     them they could have the chance to play in high school or \n     college someday. Some of these girls did not even realize \n     this was an option for them. By exposing these young girls to \n     athletics at an early age, it allows them to see that sports \n     is an option. This is relevant to the future of women's \n     athletics because equal access to sports in college only \n     works if girls have the opportunity to get involved in \n     athletics at an early age.\n       Getting these young ladies involved is even more evident \n     when I look at athletic participation numbers for girls in \n     North Dakota. According to figures from the 2004-2005 North \n     Dakota High School Activities Association, females made up 49 \n     percent of the student population in North Dakota. However, \n     only 40 percent of the student-athletes were females. It is \n     one of my goals to bring this number closer to 49 percent. \n     This is important to me because I have first hand knowledge \n     of how athletics can have a positive effect on a young woman.\n       I have been very fortunate to coach camps along with a high \n     school basketball team. This year, I have 3 seniors at West \n     Fargo who will be receiving athletic scholarships and playing \n     college basketball next fall. I have had the chance to watch \n     these young ladies grow and mature since their freshman year. \n     They exude a confidence that was not there 3 years ago. They \n     know they have the ability to do whatever they want in life \n     and the self-assurance they will be successful.\n       By providing my basketball camps and coaching high school \n     basketball, I hope that other young girls from my home state \n     realize that there are many opportunities to participate in \n     athletics, and even a young girl from a town of less than \n     1000 people can be a National Champion, a college graduate, \n     and a successful, confident professional.\n       Thank you very much for your time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/16/senate-section/article/S1410-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1410-S1411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              IN MEMORY OF FEMINIST PIONEER BETTY FRIEDAN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the life \nof one of the late 20th century's most influential feminists, Betty \nFriedan. Friedan died on February 4, 2006, at her home in Washington, \nDC, at the age of 85.\n  At her Smith College 15-year reunion, she famously prepared a survey \nof her classmates, the results of which eventually became her landmark \nbook, ``The Feminine Mystique.'' With this book, published in 1963, \nFriedan helped ignite the second wave of the feminist movement, and the \nbook is now regarded as one of the most influential American books of \nthe 20th century.\n  Friedan was the cofounder of three groundbreaking women's \norganizations which have greatly improved women's economic, personal, \nand political lives. In 1966, Friedan cofounded the National \nOrganization for Women, NOW, and served as its first president until \n1970. She also helped found what is now NARAL Pro-Choice America and \nthe National Women's Political Caucus.\n  Friedan fought tirelessly for equal pay, safe and legal abortion, \nmaternity leave, childcare for working parents, and an end to sex \ndiscrimination.\n\n[[Page S1411]]\n\n  Friedan's survivors include her sons, Daniel Friedan and Jonathan \nFriedan; daughter Emily Friedan; nine grandchildren; a sister, Amy \nAdams; and a brother, Harry Goldstein. Her former husband Carl Friedan \ndied in December 2005.\n  Like other strong, outspoken women, Betty Friedan was widely and \nloudly criticized in the 1960s and 1970s for being too strong, vocal, \nand unrealistic. Betty Friedan endured that criticism to make her mark \nin the world.\n  Women have made tremendous strides since ``The Feminist Mystique'' \nwas first published. We have a stronger voice in our communities and in \nour workplaces. I am proud to serve as 1 of 14 women in the Senate, and \nwe now have 68 women in the House of Representatives. We have made \nprogress, but much more needs to be done.\n  As we remember the life and accomplishments of Betty Friedan, let us \nrededicate ourselves to achieving full equality for women in \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/16/senate-section/article/S1411-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING ROY PALMER VARNER\n\n 1Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I wish to remember the life \nof Roy Palmer Varner of Marietta, GA. Like many of his generation, Roy \nVarner bore witness to some of the most important moments and changes \nin our Nation's history. But Roy Varner wasn't merely a passing \nobserver of the events of the 20th Century, he was an active and \ninfluential participant in them.\n  A native son of Georgia, Roy Varner possessed a deep sense of duty \nand service, which was tested on December 7, 1941. Without hesitation, \nhe joined the effort to defend freedom by enlisting in the Army and \nsoon found himself in the 101st Airborne Division. On June 6, 1944, Mr. \nVarner joined thousands of his brothers in parachuting ahead of the \nAllied invasion at Normandy. A few months later, the effort to liberate \nEurope turned toward Holland, and when his name was called again, Mr. \nVarner did not hesitate to reenter the fray as a part of Operation \nMarket Garden. For men like Roy Varner, there was no question of the \nrighteousness of their task. They knew it would be a difficult journey, \nand that not all of them would live to see it through. But they were \nloyal, patriotic men of faith who understood the weight of their \nresponsibility and never questioned their belief that their mission \nwould be successful. And that, is why we call them the Greatest \nGeneration.\n  After the war, Mr. Varner returned to his home in Cobb County, GA, \nand married Mary Munro, who would stand loyally by his side for the \nnext 56 years. In the early 1950s, Mr. Varner began what would become a \nlong and successful career as a commercial real estate developer. \nAlthough his work took him all over the Southeast, the mark that he \nleft on the early development of Cobb County was his most lasting. As a \nreal estate businessman in Atlanta for over 30 years, I knew him \npersonally and saw the product of his vision and hard work take shape \nin the projects he developed. Mr. Varner's influence on the community \nwas also evident in his work as the chairman of the industrial \ncommittee for the Cobb County Chamber of Commerce and his service as a \nmember of the Marietta Rotary Club.\n  As a businessman, Roy Varner personified the values of honesty and \nhard work, but he was also a man of intellect and faith, and, above \nall, a family man. The son of a minister, Mr. Varner embarked on his \nlife with a certain zeal that only comes with a belief in God, and he \nactively served his church community as a lay leader and fundraiser. A \nfirm believer in the value of education, Mr. Varner attended Woodrow \nWilson Law School after being honorably discharged from the Army and \nremained a scholar of history, art, literature, and world events for \nthe rest of his life. He lived by his ideals and passed his principles \non to his four children and ten grandchildren, who have continued his \nwork and his legacy and who are the living embodiment of the values and \nbeliefs that shaped his life and influenced the lives of so many \nothers.\n  On February 8, 2006, Mary Varner lost her husband and the world lost \na truly great man. He deeply influenced his family and community, left \nan indelible mark on the landscape of Cobb County and, as a member of \nthe Greatest Generation, helped influence the course of history. He \nfought for our country and he helped to build our Nation. But, as is \noften the case with men like Roy Varner, his contributions cannot \neasily be measured. He will be remembered by many different people for \nmany different reasons, but Roy Varner should be remembered by this \nbody as nothing less than an American hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/16/senate-section/article/S1411-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 1:17 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 1989.

A bill to authorize a military construction project for the \nconstruction of an advanced training skills facility at Brooke Army \nMedical Center, San Antonio, Texas; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President I am reminded daily of the sacrifice of the \nmen and women of this country who serve or have loved ones who serve in \nour armed forces. As a Tennessean I often think of the courage and \nhonor displayed by members of the 101st Airborne out of Fort Campbell \nand the many Guardsmen and Reservists from my State who have served in \nboth Iraq and Afghanistan. These soldiers, many of whom call Tennessee \nhome, make great sacrifices for our Nation. I am saddened to think \nabout those who have been wounded in recent military operations and in \nsome cases are so severely injured that they require extensive medical \ncare, along with years of treatment and rehabilitation. Their future \nquality of life and ability to provide for their families depends on \nthe treatment and rehabilitation they receive from the country they \nhave served.\n  As a physician I marvel at the great work of my colleagues in the \nArmed Services Medical Commands who treat the most severely injured \nmilitary personnel. The use of improvised explosive devices in Iraq has \nresulted in many injuries including amputations, head trauma, and in \nsome cases partial and full paralysis. We must meet the care and \nrehabilitation needs of the soldiers who have sacrificed so much for \nour country.\n  With this in mind I have joined with Senator Lieberman to sponsor a \nbill to authorize the construction of a world-class state-of-the-art \nadvanced training skills facility at Brooke Army Medical Center. This \ncenter will not only serve military personnel disabled in operations in \nIraq and Afghanistan, but will also provide care to those severely \ninjured in other operations and in the normal performance of their \nduties, both combat and non-combat related.\n  This center will provide necessary space and facilities for the \nrehabilitation needs of the patients and their caregivers. It will be \nconstructed on a site sufficient in size to meet the needs of the \ncenter's patients and caregivers and will include top of the line \nindoor and outdoor facilities, a child care center, and other needed \nsupport facilities. I am proud of the service of our military personnel \nboth past and present, and this new facility will go a long way in \nhelping to meet their needs both now and into the future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2294. A bill to permanently prohibit oil and gas leasing off the \ncoast of the State of California, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, with my friend and colleague from \nCalifornia, Dianne Feinstein, I introduce the ``California Ocean and \nCoastal Protection Act.'' This bill will permanently protect \nCalifornia's coast from the dangers of new offshore drilling.\n  In California, there is strong and enduring public support for the \nprotection of our oceans and coastlines. Many years ago, my State \ndecided that the potential benefits that might be derived from future \noffshore oil and gas development were not worth the risk of destroying \nour priceless coastal treasures. Regular chronic leakage associated \nwith normal oil and gas operations, as well as catastrophic spills such \nas the horrific Santa Barbara rig blowout in 1969, irreparably \ncontaminate our ocean, beaches, and wetlands.\n  The beauty of California's coast is so important that California \npassed legislation permanently prohibiting oil and gas exploration in \nState waters in 1994. This protection is limited, however, to \nCalifornia's territorial waters--only three nautical miles out from \nshore.\n  The Federal waters off the coast of California, which extend beyond \nState waters to 200 nautical miles out, are increasingly at risk of \ndrilling. Despite years of bipartisan support for the moratoria on new \noffshore drilling in Federal waters, recent efforts are threatening our \ncoasts. Some recent proposals would immediately lift the moratoria and \nallow for drilling within 20 miles off our coasts. Last year's energy \nbill included provisions to conduct\n\n[[Page S1416]]\n\nan inventory of oil and gas resources on the outer Continental Shelf \n(OCS). This inventory would be performed with seismic guns that could \nhave devastating impacts on marine life.\n  Because of these threats, I am introducing legislation to provide \npermanent protection for California's coast from future drilling. It \nwould also prohibit the harmful inventory of OCS resources from being \nconducted off California's coast.\n  The people of California agree that we must do everything we can to \nprotect our coasts. This bill will finally provide the permanent \nprotection against future drilling that Californians have demanded for \na generation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nCalifornia Ocean and Coastal Protection Act, introduced by Senator \nBoxer and myself, to permanently protect California's coast from oil \nand gas drilling.\n  We simply cannot gamble away California's majestic coastline. An oil \nspill would scar our coastline, costing billions and destroying \necosystems. We cannot allow this to happen. The time has come to \npermanently protect this treasure.\n  California is virtually unified in its opposition to lifting the \nmoratoria on drilling the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  Governor Schwarzenegger has publicly opposed offshore oil drilling \nand has called for the Federal Government to buy back the remaining 36 \nundeveloped Federal offshore oil and gas leases on the Outer \nContinental Shelf off the coast of central California.\n  The Governor has said that he ``oppose(s) any efforts to weaken the \nfederal moratorium for oil and gas leasing off the coast of California \nand I support efforts to make the moratoria and the Presidential \ndeferrals for California permanent.'' Letter to Congressman Pombo, 11/\n3/05.\n  That is what the bill we are introducing today would do--permanently \nprotect California's coast from oil and gas drilling.\n  California's Resources Secretary Mike Chrisman, the secretary of \nCalifornia Environmental Protection Agency, Alan Lloyd, and the \nLieutenant Governor, Cruz Bustamante, have also been on record opposing \nany effort to lift the congressional moratorium on offshore oil and gas \nleasing activities.\n  Secretary Chrisman, who is also the chairman of the California Ocean \nProtection Council, has in fact stated ``Any pending federal \nlegislation regarding Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) oil and gas leasing \nmust retain all protections from the Congressional leasing moratorium \nand should seek to make these protections permanent.'' Letter to \nCongressman Pombo, 9/27/05.\n  Californians are all too familiar with the consequences of offshore \ndrilling. An oil spill in 1969 off the coast of Santa Barbara killed \nthousands of birds, dolphins, seals, and other animals. We know this \ncould happen again.\n  A healthy coast is vital to California's economy and our quality of \nlife. Ocean-dependent industry is estimated to contribute $17 billion \nto California each year.\n  Californians have spoken loud and clear that they do not want \ndrilling on the Outer Continental Shelf. This bill will provide the \ncoast of California with the permanent protection needed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 2295. A bill to require the Secretary of the Army to conduct a \nsurvey and monitoring of off-shore sites in the vicinity of the \nHawaiian Islands where chemical munitions were disposed of by the Army \nForces, to support research regarding the public and environmental \nhealth impacts of chemical munitions disposal in the ocean, and to \nrequire the preparation of a report on remediation plans for such \ndisposal sites; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation aimed \nto address the disposal of chemical weapons by the military from World \nWar II until 1970. A report titled, Off-Shore Disposal of Chemical \nAgents and Weapons Conducted by the United States, lists possible sites \nand types of munitions that may be found in Hawaii.\n  The Department of Defense has made tremendous strides in protecting \nthe health and welfare of our citizens. However, it still is working on \nbeing better stewards of our environment. I am pleased the Army has \ntaken preliminary steps to investigate these munition disposal sites in \nand around Hawaii. Given the health and safety threats that these \nmunitions may pose, I am introducing legislation to ensure the Army \nwill obtain a full accounting of the munitions found and the state of \ntheir condition. Furthermore, it requires the Army to monitor these \nareas for any health, safety, and environmental risks that these \nweapons may pose. Lastly, and more important, the Army will provide a \nreport on remediation plans for these areas.\n  Sadly the issue of disposing hazardous ordnance and waste is not new \nto the State of Hawaii. Our citizens are keenly aware of the dangers \nthat hazardous waste poses to the health and safety of the public and \nthe environment. In fact, Departments of Defense installations are \nresponsible for generating half of all hazardous waste in Hawaii. For \nthese reasons, it is important for Congress to send the right message, \nspecifically in this case, and ensure that the Army completes its \nsurvey, monitors the sites, and provides a plan for remediation. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in passing this important legislation to \nensure that, if the Department of Defense is responsible for disposing \nof hazardous materials, wherever it may be, then it should be held \naccountable for monitoring and providing a plan for remediation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Levin, and Mr. \n        Leahy):\n  S. 2296. A bill to establish a fact-finding Commission to extend the \nstudy of a prior Commission to investigate and determine facts and \ncircumstances surrounding the relocation, internment, and deportation \nto Axis countries of Latin Americans of Japanese descent from December \n1941 through February 1948, and the impact of those actions by the \nUnited States, and to recommend appropriate remedies, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nCommission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Latin Americans of \nJapanese Descent Act. I am introducing this bill today in commemoration \nof February 19, 1942, the day that President Roosevelt signed a \ndocument that authorized the internment of about 120,000 persons of \nJapanese ancestry. Each year, on the anniversary of this date, the \ninternment is remembered both for the pain it caused, and the civics \nlessons that can be learned. I am certain that these lessons will \npropel this great Nation forward toward more equal justice for all.\n  The story of U.S. citizens taken from their homes in the west coast \nand confined in camps is a story that was made known after a fact-\nfinding study by a Commission that Congress authorized in 1980. That \nstudy was followed by a formal apology by President Reagan and a bill \nfor reparations. Far less known, and indeed, I myself did not initially \nknow, is the story of Latin Americans of Japanese descent taken from \ntheir homes in Latin America, stripped of their passports, brought to \nthe U.S., and interned in American camps.\n  This is a story about the U.S. government's act of reaching its arm \nacross international borders, into a populous that did not pose an \nimmediate threat to our nation, in order to use them, devoid of \npassports or any other proof of citizenship, for hostage exchange with \nJapan. Between the years 1941 and 1945, our government, with the help \nof Latin American officials, arbitrarily arrested persons of Japanese \ndescent from streets, homes, and workplaces, and brought approximately \n2,300 undocumented persons to camp sites in the U.S., where they were \nheld under armed watch, then used for prisoner exchange. Those used in \nan exchange were sent to Japan, a foreign country that many had never \nset foot on since their ancestors' immigration to Latin America.\n  Despite their involuntary arrival, Latin American internees of \nJapanese descent were considered by the Immigration and Naturalization \nService as illegal entrants. By the end of the war, many Japanese Latin \nAmericans had been sent to Japan. Those who were not used in a prisoner \nexchange were cast out into a new and English-speaking country, and \nsubject to deportation proceedings. Some returned to Latin\n\n[[Page S1417]]\n\nAmerica, but some remained in the U.S., where their Latin American \ncountry of origin refused their re-entry because they were unable to \npresent a passport.\n  When I first learned of the wartime experiences of Japanese Latin \nAmericans, it seemed unfathomable, but indeed, it happened. It is a \npart of our national history, and it is a part of the living histories \nof the many families whose lives are forever tied to internment camps \nin our country.\n  The outline of this story was sketched out in a book published by the \nCommission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians formed in \n1980. This Commission had set out to learn about Japanese Americans. \nTowards the close of their investigations, the Commissioners stumbled \nupon this extraordinary effort by the U.S. government to relocate, \nintern, and deport Japanese persons living in Latin America. Because \nthis finding surfaced late in its study, the Commission was unable to \nfully uncover the facts, but found them significant enough to include \nin its published study, urging a deeper investigation.\n  I rise today to introduce the Commission on Wartime Relocation and \nInternment of Latin Americans of Japanese Descent Act, which would \nestablish a fact-finding Commission to extend the study of the 1980 \nCommission. This Commission's task would be to determine facts \nsurrounding the U.S. government's actions in regards to Japanese Latin \nAmericans subject to the program of relocation, internment, and \ndeportation. I believe that examining this extraordinary program would \ngive finality to, and complete the account of federal actions to detain \nand intern civilians of Japanese ancestry.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2296\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Commission on Wartime \n     Relocation and Internment of Latin Americans of Japanese \n     Descent Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Based on a preliminary study published in \n     December 1982 by the Commission on Wartime Relocation and \n     Internment of Civilians, Congress finds the following:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States--\n       (A) expanded its internment program and national security \n     investigations to conduct the program and investigations in \n     Latin America; and\n       (B) financed relocation to the United States, and \n     internment, of approximately 2,300 Latin Americans of \n     Japanese descent, for the purpose of exchanging the Latin \n     Americans of Japanese descent for United States citizens held \n     by Axis countries.\n       (2) Approximately 2,300 men, women, and children of \n     Japanese descent from 13 Latin American countries were held \n     in the custody of the Department of State in internment camps \n     operated by the Immigration and Naturalization Service from \n     1941 through 1948.\n       (3) Those men, women, and children either--\n       (A) were arrested without a warrant, hearing, or indictment \n     by local police, and sent to the United States for \n     internment; or\n       (B) in some cases involving women and children, voluntarily \n     entered internment camps to remain with their arrested \n     husbands, fathers, and other male relatives.\n       (4) Passports held by individuals who were Latin Americans \n     of Japanese descent were routinely confiscated before the \n     individuals arrived in the United States, and the Department \n     of State ordered United States consuls in Latin American \n     countries to refuse to issue visas to the individuals prior \n     to departure.\n       (5) Despite their involuntary arrival, Latin American \n     internees of Japanese descent were considered to be and \n     treated as illegal entrants by the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service. Thus, the internees became illegal \n     aliens in United States custody who were subject to \n     deportation proceedings for immediate removal from the United \n     States. In some cases, Latin American internees of Japanese \n     descent were deported to Axis countries to enable the United \n     States to conduct prisoner exchanges.\n       (6) Approximately 2,300 men, women, and children of \n     Japanese descent were relocated from their homes in Latin \n     America, detained in internment camps in the United States, \n     and in some cases, deported to Axis countries to enable the \n     United States to conduct prisoner exchanges.\n       (7) The Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians studied Federal actions conducted pursuant to \n     Executive Order 9066 (relating to authorizing the Secretary \n     of War to prescribe military areas). Although the United \n     States program of interning Latin Americans of Japanese \n     descent was not conducted pursuant to Executive Order 9066, \n     an examination of that extraordinary program is necessary to \n     establish a complete account of Federal actions to detain and \n     intern civilians of enemy or foreign nationality, \n     particularly of Japanese descent. Although historical \n     documents relating to the program exist in distant archives, \n     the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians did not research those documents.\n       (8) Latin American internees of Japanese descent were a \n     group not covered by the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (50 \n     U.S.C. App. 1989b et seq.), which formally apologized and \n     provided compensation payments to former Japanese Americans \n     interned pursuant to Executive Order 9066.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a \n     fact-finding Commission to extend the study of the Commission \n     on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians to \n     investigate and determine facts and circumstances surrounding \n     the relocation, internment, and deportation to Axis countries \n     of Latin Americans of Japanese descent from December 1941 \n     through February 1948, and the impact of those actions by the \n     United States, and to recommend appropriate remedies, if any, \n     based on preliminary findings by the original Commission and \n     new discoveries.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to facilitate remediation of perchlorate \ncontamination in water sources in the State of California, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I'm pleased to introduce this bill \ntoday to help California drinking water providers address the growing \nproblem of perchlorate contamination.\n  The California Perchlorate Contamination Remediation Act authorizes \nfunds for perchlorate remediation of contaminated water sources.\n  The bill provides: $50 million in grants for cleanup and remediation \nof perchlorate in water sources, including groundwater wells; and $8 \nmillion for research and development of new, cheaper, and more \nefficient perchlorate cleanup technologies.\n  The bill also expresses the sense of Congress that the Environmental \nProtection Agency should promulgate a national drinking water standard \nfor perchlorate as soon as practicable.\n  The Defense Department and NASA use perchlorate in rocket fuel, \nmissiles, and at least 300 types of munitions.\n  The Defense Department has used perchlorate since the 1950s. \nPerchlorate has a short shelf-life, and must be periodically replaced \nin the country's rocket and missile inventories.\n  Perchlorate readily permeates through soil and can spread quickly \nfrom its source. Over the last half century, improper disposal has \nallowed perchlorate to seep into surface and groundwater supplies.\n  Perchlorate contamination of drinking and irrigation water is a \nserious threat to public health.\n  Perchlorate interferes with the uptake of iodide into the thyroid \ngland. Since iodide helps regulate thyroid hormone production, \nperchlorate disrupts normal thyroid function. In adults, the thyroid \nhelps regulate metabolism.\n  Infants and children are especially susceptible to the effects of \nperchlorate because the thyroid plays a critical role in proper \ndevelopment. Even unborn babies can be affected by perchlorate. \nInsufficient thyroid hormone production can severely retard a child's \nphysical and mental development.\n  Perchlorate first appeared in drinking water wells in Rancho Cordova, \nCA in 1964. In 1985, the Environmental Protection Agency discovered \nperchlorate in several wells in the San Gabriel Valley in Southern \nCalifornia.\n  By 1997, it was detected in 4 counties in California and in the \nColorado River, and by 1999 perchlorate was discovered in the water \nsupplies of 12 States.\n  According to the California Department of Health Services at least \n350 water sources in California, operated by 84 different local water \nagencies, now have perchlorate contamination.\n  But perchlorate is not just a California problem. A study by \nGovernment Accountability Office found perchlorate in the water \nsupplies of 35 States.\n  The scope and magnitude of the perchlorate problem is still being \ndefined and we are only beginning to discover the extent to which \nperchlorate has penetrated the food supply.\n  Recent sampling by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nfound perchlorate in people living in States without contaminated \ndrinking water. This suggests people all over the country are exposed \nto at least trace levels of perchlorate.\n  In November 2004, the Food and Drug Administration released the \nresults of its recent evaluation of perchlorate in the Nation's food. \nThe FDA detected perchlorate in 90 percent of the lettuce samples taken \nfrom 5 different States, including California.\n  The FDA also found perchlorate in 101 out of 104 milk samples taken \nfrom retail stores around the country. Samples labeled as organic also \ncontained perchlorate.\n  Last February, a study by researchers from Texas Tech University \nfound perchlorate in all 36 samples of breast milk they tested. The \nmilk was collected from women in 18 States, including California.\n  With such widespread contamination in my State and across the \ncountry, I have serious concerns about the health and well-being of the \nmost vulnerable among the population--infants, toddlers, pregnant \nwomen, and those with compromised immune systems.\n  Let me speak for a moment about the challenges our water agencies are \nfacing. As the population grows, so do the\n\n[[Page S1419]]\n\ndemands on our water supply. During times of drought, these demands are \nparticularly challenging.\n  States and communities rely upon their local water supplies, but are \nincreasingly finding that these supplies are contaminated with \nperchlorate and other pollutants.\n  When Federal agencies fail to protect adjacent water supplies from \nperchlorate contamination, the problem falls to local and regional \nwater agencies to fix.\n  These agencies already face staggering challenges both in delivering \ndrinking water and managing wastewater services. Compounding these \nchallenges with cleanup responsibilities for Defense Department \nactivities is unfair, unreasonable, and unacceptable.\n  Perchlorate contamination in California is primarily the result of \nreleases from 12 defense sites and several government contractor sites.\n  I applaud those contractors that have taken an active role in the \ncleanup of perchlorate. Unfortunately, clean up has only begun at a \nhandful of contaminated sites.\n  In many cities and counties around California, wells are being taken \nout of service because of perchlorate contamination. Sometimes cities \nand water agencies are forced to bring in water from other sources, \noften at a much higher price. Other times, they must install costly \nperchlorate removal equipment.\n  This bill will provide much needed funds to water agencies for \nperchlorate remediation projects.\n  Now that perchlorate has been detected in the water sources of 35 \nStates, it has become a national problem requiring a national solution.\n  I've approached several of my colleagues with a proposal that would \naddress perchlorate contamination on a national level. My hope is that \nthose representing States facing this problem will work with me on this \nissue.\n  Today there is no Federal drinking water standard for perchlorate. In \nthe absence of a Federal standard, States have acted independently to \nestablish health-related guidance or regulatory limits for perchlorate \nin drinking water.\n  The result is that each State has adopted a different preliminary \nguideline for perchlorate.\n  Let me give you a few examples: California established a Public \nHealth Goal of 6 parts per billion; Texas has a Drinking Water Action \nLevel of 4 part per billion; Nevada has a Public Notice Standard of 18 \nparts per billion; New York has a Drinking Water Planning Level of 5 \nparts per billion; Arizona has a Health-Based Guideline of 14 parts per \nbillion; and Massachusetts has an interim public health goal of 1 part \nper billion.\n  Each of these States has adopted a different kind of regulatory \nguideline for perchlorate sending a confusing message to the public \nabout what level is safe. It also frustrates the water agencies that \nstrive to provide safe drinking water to consumers.\n  Clearly, it is time for the Federal Government to establish a \nnational standard for perchlorate.\n  This bill would assist California water providers in their efforts to \nremove perchlorate from contaminated drinking water sources by \nproviding $50 million dollars for 50 percent federally matched grants.\n  To address the challenge of removing perchlorate from all of our \nwater supplies, we must invest in costeffective and timely remediation \nsolutions. To underwrite this effort, $8 million will be authorized for \ngrants for research and development of new, cheaper, more efficient \nperchlorate cleanup technologies.\n  It is time for the EPA to fulfill its obligation to protect public \nhealth. This bill expresses the sense of Congress that the EPA should \npromulgate a national drinking water standard for perchlorate under the \ntimeline of the Safe Drinking Water Act as soon as practicable.\n  Perchlorate contamination has placed an enormous financial burden on \nthe water agencies who strive to provide high quality, safe drinking \nwater to the citizens of California. Cleaning up contaminated water \nsources is equivalent to creating new water, a growing need in my state \nand throughout the West.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2298\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``California Perchlorate \n     Contamination Remediation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) because finite water sources in the United States are \n     stretched by regional drought conditions and increasing \n     demand for water supplies, there is increased need for safe \n     and dependable supplies of fresh water for drinking and \n     agricultural purposes;\n       (2) perchlorate, a naturally occurring and manmade compound \n     with commercial and national defense applications, is used \n     primarily in military munitions and rocket fuels, and also in \n     fireworks, road flares, blasting agents, and automobile \n     airbags;\n       (3) perchlorate has been detected in fresh water sources \n     intended for drinking water and agricultural use in 35 States \n     and the District of Columbia;\n       (4)(A) perchlorate has been detected in the food supply of \n     the United States; and\n       (B) many fruits and vegetables, including lettuce, wheat, \n     tomato, cucumber, and cantaloupe, contain at least trace \n     levels of perchlorate, as do wine, whiskey, soy milk, dairy \n     milk, and human breast milk; and\n       (5) if ingested in sufficient concentration and for \n     adequate duration, perchlorate may interfere with thyroid \n     metabolism, the effects of which may impair normal \n     development of the brain in fetuses, newborns, and children.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide grants for remediation of perchlorate \n     contamination of water sources and supplies (including \n     wellheads) in the State;\n       (2) to provide grants for research and development of \n     perchlorate remediation technologies; and\n       (3) to express the sense of Congress that the Administrator \n     should establish a national drinking water standard for \n     perchlorate.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act to restore Federal aid for the repair, \nrestoration, and replacement of private nonprofit educational \nfacilities that are damaged or destroyed by a major disaster; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise provide a bit of background \nregarding legislation that I am introducing today. The bill that I am \nsending to the desk would provide independent colleges and universities \nwith direct, immediate aid through the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency, FEMA. Additionally, the bill would assist the recovery of non-\nprofit education institutions from the extensive damage they sustain \nduring natural disasters.\n  During crises, the critical role that small colleges and universities \nplay in our communities is often overlooked or underestimated. In \nLouisiana, many of our colleges and universities are not only important \nin educating our students, but also in bolstering our economy.\n  In my home State, this legislation would benefit Delgado Community \nCollege, Dillard University, Loyola University New Orleans, Nunez \nCommunity College, Our Lady of Holy Cross College, Southern University \nat New Orleans, Sowela Technical Community College, Tulane University \nof Louisiana, University of New Orleans, McNeese State University and \nXavier University of Louisiana.\n  Under current law, ``education'' has been omitted from the list of \n``critical services'' for which facility repair assistance can be \nawarded directly and immediately. Until 2000, when Congress changed the \nlaw, education was always eligible for direct FEMA assistance for \nfacility damages. This legislation simply restores education to its \nrightful position as a recognized critical service.\n  This is the only place in Federal law governing disaster assistance \nthat makes this distinction between non-profit and public colleges and \nuniversities. This equity must be restored. This legislation is not a \ndemand for the start of a new program, but the restoration of these \ninstitutions long-held position under Federal law.\n  Recent media reports in the New York Times and USA Today have \nfeatured stories depicting the massive backlog of applications for aid \noptions for those institutions not eligible for immediate, direct FEMA \nassistance. When disasters strike these institutions, which often \nalready have limited resources, they incur an extensive range of costs \nfor which they cannot secure any immediate Federal reimbursement or \nresources. These institutions cannot afford to lose a semester and \nneither can their students. They should be able to go directly to FEMA \nimmediately, just as others do.\n  Congressman Kendrick Meek introduced a companion bill, H.R. 4517, in \nDecember and I look forward to working with him on this legislation. \nOur colleges and universities are something we cannot afford to ignore \nand they are vital to rebuilding the State of Louisiana. I hope that my \ncolleagues will come together in support of this important legislation \nto support our colleges and universities in this time of need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Mr. Lott):\n  S. 2300. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \nwith respect to market exclusivity for certain drugs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Lower \nPRICED Drugs Act. I want to thank Senator Trent Lott for joining me on \nthis important legislation, and for his leadership in increasing the \navailability of affordable generic drugs.\n  I am very pleased that our legislation is supported by AARP, General \nMotors Corporation, AFL-CIO, Alliance for Retired Americans, Families \nUSA, the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, the Pharmaceutical Care \nManagement Association, PCMA, the National Association of Chain Drug \nStores, and the Coalition for a Competitive Pharmaceutical \nMarketplace--an organization including large national employers and \ninsurers.\n  We know that greater availability of generic drugs translates into \ndramatic savings for consumers, manufacturers, businesses, and \ntaxpayers. Of the 25 top selling drugs in 2004, the only one that did \nnot increase in price was a drug available both in generic and over-\nthe-counter form. And, according to the National Association of Chain \nDrug Stores, while the average retail price for a brand drug in 2004 \nwas $96.01 the average retail price for a generic was $28.74, a savings \nof nearly 70 percent.\n  It's a very well known principle of economics: competition lowers \nprices.\n  But we don't need to rely on economic theory; we only have to look at \nwhat is happening with drug prices. Of the top five brand name drugs, \nby retail sales, the average price for 1 month's use of the cheapest \namong them is just over $76, and the 3rd most popular drug--zocor--is \nmore than $140 per month. That's $1,680 per year for an important drug \nto lower cholesterol levels. The average price of the most popular five \ndrugs--none of which faces generic competition--is over $114.\n  There is nothing to hold down the prices of these drugs, and in fact, \neven though many of them have been on the market for years and years, \ntheir prices continue to increase. I first checked the prices of these \ndrugs last November, and then again on Monday of this week. The prices \nthis week are higher, by several dollars in many cases, than they were \nlast year.\n  However, consider the prices consumers pay for drugs for which there \nare generic equivalents. The most frequently dispensed generic drugs \nare hydrocodone, lisinopril, atenolol, amoxicillin and \nhydrocholorothiazide. Not only are these important drugs, used to treat \npain, high blood pressure, and bacterial infections, considerably more \naffordable than their brand name equivalents, the average generic price \nis $9.34, representing a savings of more than 60 percent from the \naverage brand price of $24.74, but the presence of competition has \nanother important effect: The average price of these brand name drugs \nis a lot lower than the average price of brand drugs that don't face \ncompetition.\n  While the generic provisions in the Medicare Modernization Act, MMA,\n\n[[Page S1421]]\n\nmade important progress, there still isn't timely competition in the \npharmaceutical market.\n  New loopholes have been found to keep generics off the market, and \nkeep prices higher than they need to be. In fact, in 2004, a year after \nAMA passed, brand name prescription drug prices rose by 7.1 percent, \nthe biggest single-year price hike in 5 years.\n  Our bill would close several loopholes that prevent and delay \ngenerics from coming to market. It will increase access to affordable \ngeneric drugs and save consumers, businesses and Federal health \nprograms billions of dollars annually.\n  The Lower PRICED Drugs Act would prevent abuse of the current \npediatric exclusivity provision. It would ensure that pediatric \nexclusivity is used as intended, to generate information about the use \nof drugs in children, and prevent brand drug companies from keeping \nmore affordable generic alternatives of drugs not suitable for \nchildren, or never studied in children, off the market.\n  For example, Pravigard PAC contains two widely used medications: \npravastatin, used to lower cholesterol, and aspirin. Despite the fact \nthat aspirin isn't safe in children, the manufacturer received a six-\nmonth pediatric extension. What sense does that make?\n  The manufacturer of Pravigard PAC even includes the following warning \nin the patient information they put out:\n\n       Who should not (manufacturer's emphasis) take PRAVIGARD \n     PAC?\n       Do not take PRAVIGARD PAC if you: Are 18 years of age or \n     younger. Children younger than 18 years should not use any \n     product with aspirin in it.\n\n  Pediatric marketing extensions should not be given for products not \nsuitable for children, like those containing aspirin.\n  Using pediatric marketing protections to extend brand name monopolies \nshould be reserved for studies that help us learn more about drugs for \nkids, not to keep lower-cost generic alternatives of drugs for adults \noff the market.\n  Our bill would also remove an arbitrary roadblock to the entry of \ngeneric versions of certain antibiotics, close a loophole that allows \ndrug companies to use the current complex rules for challenging drug \npatents as a delaying tactic against the introduction of generics and \nprevent abuses of the citizen petition process.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Lott to create more \ncompetition, more choices, and more savings for American consumers of \nprescription drugs, and I urge colleagues to join us in this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the bill and the letters \nof support we have received at this time printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2300\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lower Prices Reduced with \n     Increased Competition and Efficient Development of Drugs \n     Act'' or the ``Lower PRICED Drugs Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Stabenow and Lott: On behalf of the Generic \n     Pharmaceutical Association, I would like to commend you on \n     your efforts to making life-saving medicines more affordable \n     and accessible. Your commitment to improving access to \n     generic drugs will ensure that more patients receive and \n     utilize the prescription drug treatments they need. \n     Additionally, generic drugs are an essential cost containment \n     tool for public health programs such as Medicaid and \n     Medicare, and your efforts will allow for these programs to \n     cover more treatments and help more beneficiaries.\n       As you know, despite continued efforts to close unintended \n     loopholes that delay generic competition, unnecessary \n     barriers to market entry remain. These loopholes delay the \n     timely introduction of affordable medicines, forcing \n     consumers, insurers, and the government to pay brand prices \n     for years to come. Your proposed legislation, the Lower \n     Priced Drugs Act, includes important provisions to facilitate \n     greater access to generic antibiotics, combat against \n     frivolous patent abuse by brand companies, provide greater \n     accountability into the citizen petition process, and bring \n     meaningful reform to the pediatric exclusivity period.\n       The Generic Pharmaceutical Association supports the Lower \n     Priced Drugs Act, and the industry applauds your efforts to \n     control the rising costs of prescription drugs. We strongly \n     encourage consideration and passage of this legislation to \n     bring meaningful reform to the system and increase the \n     quality and affordability of healthcare for all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Kathleen Jaeger,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                             AARP,\n                                                February 15, 2006.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: AARP is pleased to endorse the \n     ``Lower Prices Reduced with Increased Competition and \n     Efficient Development of Drugs Act,'' which we believe will \n     help bring lower priced generic drugs to the marketplace.\n       Prescription drug therapies have become more prevalent in \n     modern medicine. However, the cost of these therapies has \n     skyrocketed in recent years. Brand name prescription drugs \n     continue to rise at more than double the rate of inflation. \n     Consumers, governments, and health care payers cannot \n     continue to shoulder these costs. More must be done to make \n     drug therapies more affordable.\n       Brand name prescription drug manufacturers are rewarded for \n     their innovation and research in the form of patent \n     exclusivity. Unfortunately oftentimes some brand name \n     manufacturers seek to artificially extend the life of their \n     patents by utilizing legal loopholes or engaging in \n     unnecessary litigation. AARP believes the legislation \n     sponsored by you and Senator Lott takes a necessary step \n     towards closing some of these loopholes.\n       Generic drugs cost far less than their brand name \n     equivalents. Your proposal would close an FDA loophole by \n     allowing a generic drug manufacturer to bring certain \n     antibiotics to market, thereby providing the ability to take \n     advantage of these lower-priced drugs. In addition, your \n     legislation seeks to prevent brand name manufacturers from \n     abusing the current 30-month stay-of-effectiveness period by \n     engaging in unnecessary litigation as a means to artificially \n     extend the life of their patents. Equally important is the \n     requirement that in order to be granted a patent extension \n     under the pediatric exclusivity rules, a brand name \n     manufacturer must engage in meaningful research into \n     pediatric use. Finally, your legislation would prevent the \n     filing of citizen petitions solely as a means to halt the \n     approval of generic drugs.\n       This bill makes some important strides in helping to make \n     lower cost drugs available and we look forward to working \n     with you and your colleagues to advance this initiative. If \n     there are any further questions, please do not hesitate to \n     call me, or have your staff call Anna Schwamlein of our \n     Federal Affairs staff at (202) 434-3770.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              David P. Sloane,\n\n                                            Sr. Managing Director,\n     Government Relations and Advocacy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                         CCPM,\n\n                                                February 15, 2006.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lott and Stabenow: On behalf of the Coalition \n     for a Competitive Pharmaceutical Market CCPM, we commend you \n     for your commitment to increase timely access to affordable \n     generic medications for all Americans. We greatly appreciate \n     your work and applaud you for the introduction of The Lower \n     Prices Reduced with Increased Competition and Efficient \n     Development of Drugs Act The Lower Priced Drugs Act.\n       CCPM is an organization of employers, insurers, generic \n     drug manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers and others \n     committed to improving consumer access to safe, affordable \n     pharmaceuticals. CCPM members strongly support public \n     policies that help manage soaring prescription drug costs, \n     which have increased by double-digit rates annually and are \n     unsustainable. Continuing to obtain and provide prescription \n     drug coverage is a tremendous challenge, with the \n     skyrocketing costs pressuring reductions in benefits and \n     undermining the ability of CCPM members to compete in the \n     global marketplace. The Lower Priced Drug Act will help CCPM \n     members in this effort.\n       We have made significant strides working with congress to \n     close some of the loopholes that keep generic drugs off the \n     market even after brand drug patents have expired. However, \n     other abuses and misuses of the Hatch-Waxman law still exist \n     and need to be fixed. The Lower Priced Drugs Act addresses \n     several remaining obstacles to generic drugs while ensuring \n     patient safety.

GM \n     believes that the leadership role that you are playing makes \n     an important contribution toward sound policies that will \n     help bring more affordable generic drugs to the market and \n     save consumers billions of dollars.\n       GM supports ``The Lower Priced Drugs Act'' as it would \n     increase access to safe, effective and affordable drugs for \n     our 1.1 million beneficiaries and all other Americans. We \n     commend you for your leadership and bipartisan efforts to \n     improve our health care system. We look forward to working \n     with you to pass this important piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ken W.

A bill to ensure that the one half of the National Guard \nforces of each State are available to such State at all times, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to support one of our Nation's most \nimportant domestic policy issues--national security. I understand that \nsome would expect me to say competitiveness or health care or farms or \nthe environment or education, but what is happening with national \nsecurity today greatly concerns me.\n  In the future, I will continue to address different aspects of this \nissue of national security. I will address the war on terror and future \nthreats to our Nation. But today I will focus on the primary point of \nfailure in keeping the United States safe: how we are meeting our \nresponsibility to the troops.\n  The support of our troops is at the core of every national security \nissue we face. I urge Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle \nto join me in providing our troops with the tools they need to succeed.\n  We are so fortunate to have such a vast number of Americans who are \ncommitted to fighting for our country, to laying their lives on the \nline every day to protect the freedoms we enjoy. The first thing we \nmust do for our warfighters is to keep them safe.\n  I want to know why, after 4 years of fighting the war on terror, our \nsoldiers do not have the very best that they need to get the job done.\n  Last week, President Bush presented his fiscal year 2007 budget to \nthe Congress. Even though the defense budget accounts for most of the \ndiscretionary budget, we still have service members without the \nequipment they need.\n  Last month, a Pentagon study revealed that dozens of American lives, \nsoldiers' lives, would not have been lost in Iraq if soldiers had the \nproper side body armor. To make matters worse, the military is already \noperating with an equipment shortage. When troops deploy overseas, \noften most of their equipment is left behind, left in the theater and \nnot replaced at armories and air wings. This leaves us vulnerable at \nhome and dangerously affects national security. How will we be \nprotected if our soldiers are not?\n  The administration proposes to spend $439 billion on national \nsecurity this year. That is 45 percent more Pentagon funding than when \nPresident Bush took office 5 years ago.\n  There is a war supplemental on the way--more money. Let me make it \nclear that I do not oppose the defense budget. I respect that it is the \njob of the Secretary of Defense to assess the needs of the military in \nthe coming year. I commend him. For example, I commend him on \nincreasing the funding for special operations. But despite this vast \nbudget, our troops are still taking a hit.\n  The funding for high-tech weapons systems doubled in current dollars \nfrom $42 billion in 1996 to $84 billion in 2007. In order to pay for \nthese big-ticket items, the 2007 budget reins in personnel costs.\n  The military pay raise is only 2.2 percent. Previous years, it has \nbeen between 3 and 4 percent. During the Clinton administration, we saw \nmilitary pay raises as high as 4.8 percent. It is unacceptable to me \nthat the President proposes an increase in pay for our military that is \nless than the current rate of inflation, which is 3.4 percent. Our \nmilitary personnel are losing ground with this so-called increase, and \nthis at a time when we are asking so much of them--a time when we are \nat war. Troops have had multiple and lengthy deployments.\n  Haven't we all heard the stories of 18-year-olds swiftly driving \nhumvees down the roads of Iraq, praying that they will avoid roadside \nbombs and shoulder-fired missiles? Some of these young men and women \njoined the military after 9/11 seeking retribution; others joined \nintent on finding a way to college. They are all patriots who should be \nhonored.\n  I am concerned that we are in a fight right now between force \nstructure and weapons systems. Our troops are caught in the crossfire. \nIf they lose, we lose--at a time when we desperately need boots on the \nground, particularly here at home.\n  We are well aware that our National Guard has risen to the challenges \nof the war on terror in an unprecedented way. Our national security, \nhowever, is compromised on the homefront. Our States do not have the \nability to respond with sufficient combat structure to domestic \nsecurity missions, natural emergencies, and disasters.\n  Former Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird noted last week:\n\n       When you call out Guard and Reserve units, you call out \n     America.\n\n  Our Active-Duty Forces have fought bravely on our behalf, and the \nGuard has fought with them.\n  Montana is just one of the States with an infantry battalion that is \nfacing major changes due to the Army's proposal to reduce 34 combat \nbrigades to 28. We have based much of our State's military strategy on \nthe capabilities and equipment our infantry battalion provides.\n  The combat brigades provide a balance of combat force structure to \nthe combat service support units already in the State. This balance is \nessential to ensure that we have the full spectrum of capabilities \nwithin Montana for homeland defense and national security.\n  I am introducing a bill today which will ensure that each adjutant \ngeneral will have the resources of 50 percent of their National Guard \ntroops available to them at all times in the State. Deployments \noverseas will not be allowed to exceed that number. This bill \nrecognizes the national security contribution of the Air National Guard \nand the Army National Guard, in particular the brigade combat teams and \ntheir subordinate units. This will help the country to achieve a \nstandard level of emergency preparedness.\n  When those troops come home, Active and Reserve, they must come home \nto jobs and veterans' benefits. That is the only right thing to do. In \nits 2007 budget for the Department of Veterans Affairs, the \nadministration calls for a 6-percent increase in total veterans \nspending to $36 billion. Much of this increase, however, depends on the \nadoption of new health care fees. For example, the budget proposes a \n$250 enrollment fee and an increase in prescription drug copayments to \n$15, from $8, for higher income, less disabled veterans. If these new \nfees are adopted, they would dissuade 200,000 veterans from even \nenrolling in the VA health care system. The veterans themselves are \npaying for the increase to the veterans budget. That is what is \nhappening.\n  I frequently hear that questioning issues of national security \nundermines the missions of our troops and that some Members of Congress \njust criticize and do not have a plan. Well, here is the plan: It is \nimperative that we provide everything possible for our troops in order \nto keep the United States safe. We have a responsibility to speak up on \ntheir behalf because I firmly believe that when we neglect our troops--\nincluding our National Guard men and women--we are gambling with the \nnational security of our Nation.\n  We have the best soldiers, airmen, marines, and sailors in the world. \nI have tremendous respect for all of them, and I am committed to \nhelping them succeed. We are engaged in a war now, and we must give our \ntroops the tools to win overseas while simultaneously protecting our \nhomefront.\n  I urge my colleagues to pay close attention to this bill I am \nintroducing. I hope that at the appropriate time, we can get it \nenacted, basically get some more balance to our force structure, and \nalso make sure our National Guard and Army and Air Guard have the \nsupport they need, not only for themselves but to keep our country safe \nand secure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I commend my colleague for raising this \nimportant issue which affects every State in the Union. Of our National \nGuard in Illinois, 80 percent have been deployed overseas, and more \nthis year. At this point, they have come home to empty parking lots \nwhere they used to have vehicles and equipment which they trained on \nand would use at times of national emergency.\n  We cannot allow this Guard to become a hollow Army. It must be a \nviable force. I look forward to reviewing the bill the Senator \nintroduced to see if I can join him in this effort to strengthen our \nGuard nationwide.\n\n[[Page S1424]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURR (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Lott, and Mr. \n        Menendez):\n  S. 2304. A bill to recognize the right of the Commonwealth of Puerto \nRico to call a constitutional convention through which the people of \nPuerto Rico would exercise their right to self-determination, and to \nestablish a mechanism for congressional consideration of such decision; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join Senator Burr and \nother colleagues in supporting the Puerto Rico self-determination act.\n  Puerto Rico and its four million residents have enjoyed a positive \nrelationship with the United States since the island's commonwealth \nstatus was established over 50 years ago. But it's important for all of \nus to protect the right of the Puerto Rican people to self-\ndetermination, and this legislation will do so.\n  Our bill calls for a constitutional assembly in Puerto Rico composed \nof delegates elected by the Puerto Rican people. The delegates will \ndetermine the appropriate options for inclusion in a referendum to \nenable the Puerto Rican people to decide the future status of the \nisland.\n  Congress will have the final say on the referendum, but the process \nshould start with the people of Puerto Rico and not in Washington. A \nconstitutional assembly will best serve their interest by letting us \nknow their wishes.\n  The people of Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens, and many of them have \nserved our Nation with great courage and sacrifice in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. At the very least we owe them a fair and democratic \nprocess in determining their future.\n  The recommendations in the report released in December by the White \nHouse task force on the status of Puerto Rico do not adequately address \nthis basic issue, since the options suggested in the report do not give \nPuerto Ricans the fair choice they deserve.\n  The possibility of change in the current status has stirred intense \ndebate in recent years, and this bill is intended to allow a fair \nsolution that respects the views of all sides in the debate. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation as the most effective way to \nresolve this issue and give the people of Puerto Rico the respect they \ndeserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Obama, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Inouye, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 2305. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nrepeal the amendments made by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 \nrequiring documentation evidencing citizenship or nationally as a \ncondition for receipt of medical assistance under the Medicaid program; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to repeal a \nprovision in the Deficit Reduction Act that will require people \napplying or reapplying for Medicaid to verify their citizenship with a \nU.S. passport or birth certificate. I thank my cosponsors of this \nlegislation, Senators Obama, Bingaman, Inouye, Lautenberg, Jeffords, \nKerry, and Lieberman for their support.\n  This provision must be repealed before it goes into effect July 1, \n2006. We have arrived at this conclusion because it will create \nbarriers to health care, and from information we have gathered from \nagencies, it is unnecessary and will be an administrative burden to \nimplement. These are reasons for this legislation. The Center on Budget \nand Policy Priorities estimates that more than 51 million individuals \nin this country would be burdened by having to produce additional \ndocumentation. In 16 States--Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, \nIllinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North \nCarolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington--more \nthan a million Medicaid beneficiaries will be required to submit the \nadditional documents to receive or stay on Medicaid. In Hawaii, an \nestimated 392,000 people who are enrolled in Medicaid will be required \nto produce the additional documentation.\n  The requirements will disproportionately impact low-income, racial \nand ethnic minorities, indigenous people, and individuals born in rural \nareas without access to hospitals. Due to discriminatory hospital \nadmission policies, a significant number of African-Americans were \nprevented from being born in hospitals. One in five African Americans \nborn during 1939-1940 do not have birth certificates.\n  We need to ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries are not discriminated \nagainst and do not lose access to care, simply because they do not have \na passport or birth certificate. Data from a survey commissioned by the \nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities is helpful in trying to \ndetermine the impact of the legislation. One in 12 U.S.-born adults, \nwho earn incomes less than $25,000, report they do not have a U.S. \npassport or birth certificate in their possession. Also, more than 10 \npercent of U.S.-born parents, who have incomes below $25,000, do not \nhave a birth certificate or passport for at least one of their \nchildren. An estimated 3.2 to 4.6 million U.S. born citizens may have \ntheir Medicaid coverage threatened simply because they do not have a \npassport or birth certificate readily available.\n  Some groups are at a greater risk for losing their Medicaid coverage. \nNine percent of African-American adults reported they did not have the \nneeded documents. Seven percent of people over age 65 also report that \nthey do not have birth certificates. Many others will also have \ndifficulty in securing these documents, such as Native Americans born \nin home settings, Hurricane Katrina survivors, and homeless \nindividuals.\n  It is difficult enough to get access to health care, let alone \nacquire a birth certificate or a passport before seeking treatment. \nSome beneficiaries may not be able to afford the financial cost or time \ninvestment associated with obtaining a birth certificate or passport. \nThe Hawaii Department of Health charges $10 for duplicate birth \ncertificates. The costs vary by State and can be as much as $23 to get \na birth certificate or $87 to $97 for a passport. Taking the time and \nobtaining the necessary transportation to acquire the birth certificate \nor a passport, particularly in rural areas where public transportation \nmay not exist, creates a hardship for Medicaid beneficiaries. Failure \nto produce the documents quickly may result in a loss of Medicaid \neligibility.\n  Further compounding the hardship is the failure to provide an \nexemption for individuals suffering from mental or physical \ndisabilities from the new requirements. I am really afraid that those \nsuffering from diseases such as Alzheimer's may lose their Medicaid \ncoverage because they may not have or be able to easily obtain a \npassport or birth certificate.\n  It is likely these documentation requirements will prevent \nbeneficiaries who are otherwise eligible for Medicaid to enroll in the \nprogram. This will result in more uninsured Americans, an increased \nburden on our healthcare providers, and the delay of treatment for \nneeded health care.\n  The hardships that will be imposed are unnecessary due to existing \nrequirements that check immigration status. A 2005 study by the Health \nand Human Services Office of the Inspector General concluded there is \nno substantial evidence indicating that illegal immigrants claiming to \nbe U.S. citizens are successfully enrolling in Medicaid.\n  Twenty-eight of 47 Medicaid directors, surveyed by the Health and \nHuman Services Inspector General, indicated that requiring documentary \nevidence of citizenship would delay eligibility determination. Twenty-\nfive believe that providing additional evidence would result in \nincreased eligibility personnel costs. State Medicaid Agencies would \nlikely have to hire additional personnel to handle the increased \nworkload with significant, additional administrative and financial \ncosts. Twenty-one believe that it would be burdensome or expensive for \napplicants to obtain a birth certificate or other documentation.\n  In my home State, the Hawaii Primary Care Association estimates the \nadministrative costs for our Department of Human Services will result \nin an increased cost of $640,000. Mr. John McComas, the Chief Executive \nOfficer, of AlohaCare, stated, ``We anticipate that there will be \nsignificant administrative costs added to our already overburdened \nMedicaid programs. These\n\n[[Page S1425]]\n\nprovisions are absolutely unnecessary and place an undue burden on the \nMedicaid beneficiary, to our entire Medicaid program, and ultimately to \nour entire state.''\n  I am frequently frustrated by the inability of the Congress to enact \nmeasures to improve health care for Americans. A misconceived provision \nto mandate these additional documentation requirements will cause real \npeople real pain, and create public health and administrative \ndifficulties. The provision in the Deficit Reduction Act will force \nevery current and future Medicaid beneficiary to produce a passport or \nbirth certificate. I look forward to my colleagues working with me to \nrepeal this provision. I am hopeful that as my friends in the Senate go \nhome during recess, they talk with their constituents at health \ncenters, State Medicaid offices, and social service organizations, and \nhear how important it is to them for this legislation to be enacted to \nprotect access to Medicaid.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record, as well as letters of support and concern \nfrom AlohaCare, the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health \nOrganizations, Maternal and Child Health Access, the Hawaii Primary \nCare Association, and Siren.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2305\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Daniel Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: I am pleased to write a letter of \n     support for your bill to amend title XIX of the Social \n     Security Act to repeal the amendments made by the Deficit \n     Reduction Act of 2005 requiring documentation of citizenship \n     or nationality as a condition for receipt of medical \n     assistance under the Medicaid program.\n       Maternal and Child Health Access has provided assistance to \n     thousands of families seeking medical coverage since the \n     early 1990s. In addition to the families we serve, we educate \n     and train other social service agencies and clinics about \n     health coverage programs and thus have the opportunity to \n     hear their experiences in assisting low-income people to \n     apply for Medicaid. In California, we are ecstatic that \n     nearly 90% of the children eligible have been enrolled in \n     Medicaid or our S-CHIP program, Healthy Families. We have \n     celebrated the fact that with few exceptions, the process of \n     obtaining health care coverage for low-income families \n     presents fewer barriers than in prior years. The requirement \n     that Medicaid applicants provide birth certificates would be \n     an unfortunate reversal of that trend.\n       Even now, even with no requirement for such documentation, \n     Eligibility Workers mistakenly demand birth certificates as \n     part of the Medicaid application process. We see that the \n     need to provide such documentation causes untoward delays in \n     obtaining health care. For example, my office recently \n     assisted the family of a two-year-old child who had never had \n     Medi-Cal due to the Los Angeles County Eligibility Worker's \n     erroneous demand for a birth certificate from the client's \n     home state, which had been impossible to obtain. The child's \n     health care visits were delayed and inferior to what a two-\n     year-old should have had.\n       In California, birth certificates cost $17 and require a \n     notarized application, or sworn statement under penalty of \n     perjury. In addition to the added expense of notarizing, an \n     additional $25-$50 depending on the ability of often-\n     unscrupulous notaries to charge, making people swear under \n     penalty of perjury is intimidating and will discourage people \n     from applying. It takes four to six months to obtain birth \n     certificates for newborns and if obtained in person, require \n     travel to a different office than for duplicate copies that \n     might be needed for adults or other children who need them. I \n     see no flexibility in the amendments as passed to allow for \n     families with no disposable income to obtain the birth \n     certificates timely.\n       There is absolutely no need for a drastic measure of this \n     sort. A comprehensive study conducted last year by the Health \n     and Human Services Inspector General, ``Self-Declaration of \n     U.S. Citizenship Requirements for Medicaid,'' July 2005, \n     failed to find any substantial evidence that illegal \n     immigrants are fraudulently getting Medicaid coverage by \n     claiming they are citizens. Notably, the Inspector General \n     did not recommend requiring that documentation of citizenship \n     be required. State officials interviewed by the Inspector \n     General's office also noted that such a requirement would add \n     significant administrative costs and burdens. Half of the \n     state officials interviewed said they would have to hire more \n     eligibility personnel to handle the increased workload.\n       Requiring a birth certificate will cause delays in \n     obtaining needed medical coverage and care and unnecessary \n     costs for applicants, states and counties. If we truly care \n     about ensuring that children, pregnant women, disabled \n     people, seniors and others in need obtain the health care \n     that may enable them to continue to be productive citizens or \n     ensure their readiness for school, we should not be putting \n     unnecessary costly barriers in their way.\n       I thank you on behalf of the low income people my agency \n     serves daily.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Lynn Kersey,\n     MA, MPH, Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Hawai`i Primary Care Association,\n\n                                   Honolulu, HI, January 25, 2006.\n     Hon. Senator Daniel Akaka,\n     Re Proposed birth certificate or passport requirement for \n         Medicaid application.\n\n       Dear Senator Akaka: The Hawai`i Primary Care Association \n     would like to register our strong opposition to recently \n     proposed federal legislation that would require a birth \n     certificate or passport for each Medicaid applicant, and to \n     ask for your assistance to avert this mandate. We object to \n     this change because it is completely unnecessary to prevent \n     application fraud but would be a considerable barrier to \n     legitimate applicants and add to the cost incurred by public \n     and private agencies to complete and process applications.\n       Unnecessary barrier. In the ample experience of community \n     health centers in Hawai`i and the Primary Care Association's \n     Hawai`i Covering Kids Project, immigrants, fearful of \n     jeopardizing their immigration status, are hesitant to apply \n     for programs for which they are clearly eligible. \n     Undocumented immigrants are even less likely to call \n     attention to themselves, for obvious reasons. The Hawai`i \n     State Department of Human Services, which monitors and checks \n     into self-declared eligibility status, has found no evidence \n     of fraud in this area.\n       The following are some of the ways this proposed \n     requirement would deter legitimate applicants: Some people do \n     not have birth certificates because they were born at home or \n     in areas with no official registries (e.g., on plantations). \n     People who are mentally ill or homeless may be unable to \n     produce original or duplicate birth certificates. In the \n     event of a hurricane or other disaster, many people will be \n     unable to find documents, and public agencies may be in \n     disarray so that they can't provide duplicates. In an \n     emergency medical situation, an uninsured person may not be \n     able to find a birth certificate. The Hawai`i Department of \n     Health (DOH) charges $10 for duplicate birth certificates. \n     Procuring one for each family member that is applying or \n     renewing not only takes the applicant away from work or other \n     activities to stand in line at DOH, but also can be \n     prohibitively expensive. The application and enrollment \n     procedure will take longer and result in delays in coverage \n     that might cause serious health problems and put the health \n     care provider and individual at financial risk.\n       Processing costs. If this regulation is implemented it will \n     result in more administrative costs for DHS and for agencies \n     that assist applicants. All current Medicaid customers must \n     also be asked to submit a birth certificate or passport. This \n     requires paper, envelopes, and mailing costs. When documents \n     arrive at a Medicaid office, they must be matched to a \n     record, noted in the electronic case file, and stored in the \n     customer's case file. If the customer does not produce the \n     required document, the case will be closed. However, this \n     person is otherwise eligible for benefits, therefore when \n     she/he locates a birth certificate a new application will not \n     only be submitted, but also the Medicaid office must review \n     it and open a new case. Hawai`i's Medicaid offices receive \n     approximately 66,000 applications annually. New applications \n     without birth certificates or passports attached will be sent \n     ten-day pending notices. This requires paper, envelopes, and \n     mailing costs. If the document is not received in the time \n     allotted, the application will be denied. If mailing notices \n     and updating or closing each current Medicaid file takes at \n     least 10 minutes of public workers' time, the current Med-\n     QUEST enrollment of over 200,000 customers will take 33,333 \n     hours and cost $640,000.\n       Assumptions: 15 minutes to send notices and update or close \n     files. 2,080 is the number\n\n[[Page S1426]]\n\n     of work hours per year. Salary plus operating costs per \n     worker is $40,000 per year.\n       Cost: 16 eligibility workers will work full-time for a year \n     at a cost of $640,000.\n       In summary, we believe there is no good reason to implement \n     the proposed regulations and ample reasons to maintain the \n     current procedure that allows self-declaration. We ask for \n     your help in this matter to make sure Medicaid continues to \n     serve the most vulnerable members of our communities.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Beth Giesting,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Akaka: I have just been informed about your \n     bill to repeal the citizenship documentation requirements \n     contained in the reconciliation bill. On behalf of the \n     Services, Immigrant Rights and Education Network (SIREN), I \n     write to express our support for Senator Akaka's bill.\n       SIREN is a leading organization in Silicon Valley dedicated \n     to providing immigrant rights advocacy, community education \n     and naturalization assistance to Santa Clara County's diverse \n     immigrant communities. We believe that a requirement to check \n     citizenship status for Medicaid recipients will be costly and \n     an additional barrier to accessing this much needed program. \n     In addition, it is unnecessary and continues the stereotype \n     that immigrants are in this country to access social \n     services, which we know to be false. Immigrants come to this \n     country to create a better life for themselves and their \n     families. They contribute to the social and economic fabric \n     of our country every day.\n       Thank you for your efforts to protect immigrants and to \n     save our country from a needless expense.\n           Warmly,\n     Larisa Casillas.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Association of Asian Pacific\n\n\n                               Community Health Organizations,\n\n                                    Oakland CA, February 10, 2006.\n     Hon. Daniel Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: The Association of Asian Pacific \n     Community Health Organizations, AAPCHO, a national non-profit \n     association of community health centers, is writing to \n     support your efforts to repeal an amendment requiring \n     individuals to provide evidence of citizenship when applying \n     for Medicaid benefits.\n       We believe that these amendments, which are introduced in \n     the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, will not only raise the \n     ranks of the uninsured, but more importantly, that they will \n     leaves scores of our most vulnerable citizens without \n     critically needed health care services.\n       As you well know, there are currently over 45 million \n     people without health insurance, many of whom are Asian \n     American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander. Requiring \n     Medicaid beneficiaries to provide a birth certificate or \n     passport to prove their citizenship could lead to millions of \n     low-income Americans either losing Medicaid coverage and \n     becoming uninsured, or being delayed coverage for necessary \n     medical care. At AAPCHO's member community health centers \n     across the country, this regulation would instantly put the \n     lives and health of a significant number of low-income \n     adults, children, elderly, and disabled individuals at risk.\n       We thank you for continuing your fight to provide health \n     care for our most vulnerable populations, and we appreciate \n     your introduction of this important bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Jeffrey B. Caballero, MPH,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                    AlohaCare,\n\n                                   Honolulu, HI, February 6, 2006.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: We applaud your concerns about the \n     proposed changes in Medicaid. We wish to lend our support to \n     the Amendment that you are proposing that will remove one of \n     the most draconian aspects of the proposal in Section 6037 of \n     the Budget Reconciliation Bill that will require that \n     everyone who is applying for Medicaid, whether current or \n     new, to provide proof of their citizenship.\n       The primary forms of documentation acceptable would be \n     either a passport or a birth certificate presented in \n     conjunction with proof of identity such as a drivers' \n     license. For people who are naturalized citizens \n     naturalization papers would be accepted. This essentially \n     means that native-born citizens would have to produce birth \n     certificates or passports.\n       The new requirements, which a recent study by the Inspector \n     General of the Department of Health and Human Services shows \n     to be unnecessary, would almost certainly create significant \n     enrollment barriers to millions of low-income citizens who \n     would otherwise meet all Medicaid eligibility requirements. \n     Because of Hawaii's demographics we believe that we would be \n     heavily impacted.\n       On July 1, 2006 these new requirements will apply to all \n     applications or redeterminations of Medicaid eligibility that \n     occurred after that date, without exceptions, even for people \n     who are extremely old or have severe physical or mental \n     impairments, such as Alzheimer's disease.\n       A major concern is that many people on Medicaid do not \n     travel or have not had a need for a passport. Others no \n     longer live near where they were born or have long since lost \n     their birth certificate. Many of the elderly in Hawaii were \n     born outside of hospitals or places where birth certificates \n     were not commonly issued.\n       We anticipate that there will be significant administrative \n     costs added to our already overburdened Medicaid programs. \n     These provisions are absolutely unnecessary and will place an \n     undue burden on the Medicaid beneficiary, to our entire \n     Medicaid program, and ultimately to our entire state.\n       Please don't hesitate to contact us if we can be of any \n     assistance to you in your efforts to protect the Medicaid \n     beneficiaries in Hawaii.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                     John McComas,\n                               Chief Executive Officer, AlohaCare.\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, as our Nation faces staggering healthcare \ncosts, rising rates of chronic conditions, and a growing wage gap \nbetween the haves and the have-nots, we must acknowledge the vital \nimportance of this Nation's safety net--the Medicaid program. The \nMedicaid program is the provider of healthcare for more than 50 million \nAmericans--young and old, black and white, and the disabled.\n  As many of us would argue, and as stated by the President in this \nyear's State of the Union Address, the government has a responsibility \nto help provide healthcare for the poor and the elderly. I ask you to \nquestion whether we meet that responsibility with section 6036 of the \nDeficit Reduction Act that requires citizenship documentation for \nindividuals seeking Medicaid. In order for our country to have healthy \nchildren, a healthy workforce and healthy communities, we must not \ndeter Americans from seeking medical care, and yet this provision would \ndo just that.\n  Much of the public scrutiny on Medicaid spending has focused on the \ncosts of providing care to undocumented immigrant populations. Some \nbelieve that requirements for documentation of citizenship will curtail \nalleged abuse of the Medicaid program by illegal immigrants. Yet, a \nstudy conducted by the HHS Inspector General failed to find any \nsubstantial evidence that illegal immigrants are fraudulently getting \nMedicaid coverage by claiming they are citizens, and he did not \nrecommend any new requirements for documentation of citizenship.\n  If the requirement to document citizenship will not affect illegal \nimmigrants, who are in fact not using the Medicaid program, than we \nmust ask ourselves who will be affected by this requirement?\n  Let's think about the senior with Alzheimer's disease and the \ndifficulty she experiences in remembering the name of her daughter, let \nalone where she placed her birth certificate. Let us think about the \nfamilies who survived Hurricane Katrina, who lost their homes with all \ntheir possessions, including their passports. Let us think about the \nchildren being raised by cash-strapped grandparents and other \nrelatives, who will incur additional costs for obtaining required \ndocuments.\n  About one out of every twelve U.S.-born adults, or 1.7 million \nAmericans, who have incomes below $25,000 report that they do not have \na U.S. passport or birth certificate in their possession. In addition, \nstudies have shown that there are up to 2.9 million Medicaid-eligible \nchildren without such documentation.\n  These figures are even higher for other populations. While 5.7 \npercent of all adults at all income levels report they lack birth \ncertificates or passports, this percentage rises to 7 percent for \nsenior citizens age 65 or older, and 9 percent each for African \nAmerican adults, adults without a high school diploma and adults living \nin rural areas. Notably, these figures do not include many other groups \nwho would also experience difficulty in securing these documents, such \nas Native Americans born in home settings, nursing-home residents, \nHurricane Katrina survivors, and homeless individuals. The \ndocumentation requirements in section 6036 would apply to all current \nbeneficiaries and future applicants, allowing for no exceptions, even \nfor those with serious mental or physical disabilities such as \nAlzheimer's disease or those who lack documents due to homelessness or \na disaster such as Hurricane Katrina.\n  The costs to individuals applying for Medicaid coverage is matched by \nthe overwhelming administrative costs associated with the documentation \nrequirements. If birth certificates or passports are required for \nMedicaid enrollment, approximately 50 percent of\n\n[[Page S1427]]\n\nstate officials have reported that they would have to hire additional \npersonnel to handle the increased workload with significant, additional \nadministrative and financial costs. The National Association for Public \nHealth Statistics and Information Systems predicts a 50 percent \nincrease in the volume of birth certificate requests if requirements \nfor birth certificates or passports for Medicaid applications are \nimposed, resulting in significant delays in processing all birth \ncertificate applications. State resources are already stretched too \nthin, and we should not impose additional and unnecessary burdens.\n  At a time when this administration is touting health care tax breaks, \nwhich will benefit those who need the least help, it is critical that \nmembers of Congress remember the worst off and the most vulnerable \nmembers of our society. Medicaid is their lifeline to a healthy and \nproductive future, and we should not obstruct access to this program.\n  Senator Akaka, Senator Bingaman and I have introduced this bill to \neliminate requirements for citizenship documentation from Medicaid, and \nI urge all of my colleagues to support us in passing this critical act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 2306. A bill to amend the National Organ Transplant Act to clarify \nthat kidney paired donation and kidney list donation do not involve the \ntransfer of a human organ for valuable consideration; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be joined by Senators \nDeWine, Dorgan and Bond in introducing legislation that will save lives \nby increasing the number of kidneys available for transplantation. Our \nbill addresses relatively new procedures that did not exist when the \nNational Organ Transplant Act--NOTA--was passed more than two decades \nago. No Federal dollars will be needed to implement it. More \nimportantly, it will make it possible for thousands of people who wish \nto donate a kidney to a spouse, family member or friend, but find that \nthey are medically incompatible, still to become living kidney donors.\n  Kidney paired donations involve two living donors and two \nrecipients--the intended recipient of each donor is incompatible with \nthe intended donor but compatible with the other donor in the \narrangement. For example, person A wants to donate her kidney to her \nhusband, person B, but cannot because of a biological incompatibility. \nLikewise, person C wants to donate to his wife, person D, and cannot \nbecause of a biological incompatibility. However, testing reveals that \nA and D are biologically compatible, and C and B are biologically \ncompatible. Therefore, a paired kidney donation can be made whereby A \ndonates to D and C donates to B. Every paired donation transplant \navoids burdening the kidney waiting list and increases access to organs \nfor all kidney transplant candidates.\n  Kidney list donations involve three individuals: a living donor; the \nrecipient of the living donor's kidney, who is allocated the organ \nthrough the waiting list; and the donor's intended recipient who \nreceives an allocation priority on the kidney waiting list. In this \ncircumstance, a person intends to donate a kidney to a recipient but is \nfound to be medically incompatible, and there are no other donor-\nrecipient pairs available for a simultaneous paired donation. The \nperson donates his or her kidney, and the kidney is allocated to a \nmedically suitable patient on the national Organ Procurement and \nTransplantation Network--OPTN--waiting list according to OPTN organ \nallocation policy. The donor's originally intended recipient then \nreceives allocation priority through the national system to receive a \ndeceased donor kidney, thus fulfilling the donor's original intent to \ndonate to a particular person. It is estimated that clearing the way \nfor these procedures will not only save lives, it would save Medicare \ntens of millions of dollars each year in avoided costs for renal \ndialyses of these patients. By permitting living paired donations, this \nbill will also have the effect of increasing the number of kidneys \navailable to patients already on the kidney waiting list.\n  The legislation we are introducing removes an unintended impediment \nto kidney donations by clarifying ambiguous language in Section 301 of \nthe National Organ Transplant Act--NOTA. That section has been \ninterpreted by a number of transplant centers to prohibit such \ndonations. In Section 301 of NOTA, Congress prohibited the buying and \nselling of organs. Subsection (a), titled ``Prohibition of organ \npurchases,'' says: ``It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly \nacquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable \nconsideration. . . . '' The legislation we are introducing does not \nremove or alter any current provision of NOTA, but simply adds a line \nto Section 301 which states that paired donations do not violate it. \nWhen we originally enacted NOTA we expressly exempted several other \nactions from the valuable consideration provision, such as expressly \npermitting reimbursement of travel and subsistence costs for living \ndonors, and for reimbursement of their lost wages. We did not know to \ninclude paired kidney donation events with these exceptions because \nthey were not being performed then.\n  Congress surely never intended that the living donation arrangements \nthat permit either a kidney paired donation or a kidney list donation \nbe impeded by NOTA. Our bill simply makes that clear. A number of \ntransplant professionals involved in these and other innovative living \nkidney donation arrangements have proceeded in the reasonable belief \nthat these arrangements do not violate Section 301 of NOTA, and they \nare being performed in many states already. This legislation is \nnecessary because some have questioned whether these paired donation \nsituations might somehow involve valuable consideration in that the \nmutual promises to donate could be considered a thing of value being \ngiven in exchange for an organ. We do not believe that this is the \ncase. Certainly, Congress never intended to impede paired donation when \nit outlawed buying and selling of organs.\n  There is no known opposition to this legislation. It is supported by \nnumerous medical organizations, including the United Network for Organ \nSharing, the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, the American \nSociety of Transplantation, the National Kidney Foundation and the \nAmerican Society of Pediatric Nephrology.\n  It is important that we make the intent of Congress explicit so that \ntransplant centers which have hesitated to implement paired donation \nprograms can feel free to do so; and in order that the Organ \nProcurement and Transplant Network, which is operated by UNOS under \ncontract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, may \nimplement a national registry of pairs who need to find other \ncompatible pairs so that their loved ones can get the transplant they \nso desperately need.\n  The experts in the field of organ donation and transplantation \nestimate that our legislation will result in well over 2,000 additional \ntransplants annually and that Medicare would save millions in kidney \ndialysis costs. By its own estimate, Medicare spends more than $55,000 \nannually for each dialysis patient, which equates to more than $3.6 \nbillion per year. Savings to Medicare due to removal of an additional \n2,000 patients from the dialysis program through living kidney donation \nwould exceed $110 million. Since the median waiting time for each \npatient is four years, removal of each patient translates into a total \nMedicare savings of $220,000.\n  It is our hope that the Senate will promptly act on this necessary \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleagues, \nSenators Levin, Dorgan, and Bond, to introduce the Living Kidney Organ \nDonation Clarification Act.\n  This important legislation would clarify Section 301 of the National \nOrgan Transplant Act (NOTA). Section 301 makes it a felony ``for any \nperson to knowingly acquire, receive or otherwise transfer any human \norgan for valuable consideration for use in organ transplantation.'' \nThis provision simply makes it illegal to buy and sell human organs. \nThe bill that Senator Levin and I are introducing would clarify that \npaired donations do not violate Section 301.\n\n[[Page S1428]]\n\n  When NOTA was first enacted, the only living organ donations took \nplace between a single biologically compatible living donor and \nrecipient. In the past decade, a new type of living donation procedure \nhas developed. It's called the paired organ donation. The best way to \ndescribe a paired donation is through an example: Patient A is on the \nwaiting list for a kidney transplant. Various family and friends have \noffered to donate a kidney to Patient A, but none of the potential \ndonors are compatible. However, one of Patient A's potential donors is \ncompatible with Patient B, who is also on the waiting list for a \nkidney. Patient B has a potential donor who is compatible with Patient \nA. Patient A and B could exchange donors and both get transplants.\n  With the development of paired donations, concerns have arisen that \nthe mutual promises to donate organs could be considered ``valuable \nconsideration'' under Section 301 of NOTA. It is important to note that \nwhile paired donations were not conceived at the time NOTA was written \nover 20 years ago, they are in keeping with all of NOTA's provisions \nand protections and should be permitted. Paired donors may not receive \na monetary payment, except for reimbursement for expenses. I don't \nthink that Congress would have intended to prohibit the practice of \npaired donations with the enactment of NOTA.\n  The benefits of paired donations are tremendous. Successful kidney \ntransplants eliminate the need for dialysis for the recipient, as well \nas decrease costs to Medicare. And, the practice of paired donations \nhas the potential to increase the number of living donor transplants \ndramatically, as there are a large number of potential living donors \nwho are biologically incompatible with their intended recipients.\n  My own State of Ohio has the first state-sponsored program that \narranges paired kidney donations. There have been at least four paired \nkidney donations in Ohio during the last two years arranged through the \nPaired Donation Kidney Consortium. With over 62,000 men, women, and \nchildren waiting for a kidney donation, we cannot afford to turn our \nback on the paired donation procedure.\n  That is why it is critically important that Section 301 of NOTA be \nclarified to permit these donations. Clarification of the intent of \nCongress would encourage transplant centers throughout the country to \nimplement their own paired donation programs. It also would enable the \nOrgan Procurement and Transplant Network to create a national list of \npairs of incompatible donors so that as many recipients can be matched \nup as possible.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Levin, \nDeWine and Bond to introduce the Kidney Transplant Clarification Act of \n2006. This legislation will help save lives by increasing the number of \nkidney donations made by living donors.\n  There are currently 90,608 people in the United States who are on the \nnational organ transplant waiting list. More than two-thirds of those \non the waiting list suffer from end stage renal disease and are in need \nof a kidney transplant. Unfortunately, the number of people on the \nwaiting list continues to grow far faster than the number of organ \ndonors. In North Dakota alone, there are currently 91 patients who are \nwaiting for a kidney transplant.\n  The good news is that patients with end stage renal disease who \nrequire a kidney transplant no longer need to wait for a kidney from a \ndeceased donor or from a blood relative. Advances in medical science \nnow make it possible for friends and spouses to donate a kidney to a \npatient in need. Of the 16,004 kidney transplants in 2004, 6,647 were \nfrom living donors.\n  The bad news is outdated Federal laws inappropriately stand in the \nway of widely adopting several innovative approaches that would \nincrease the number of kidney donations from the living.\n  One of these strategies is called a paired kidney donation. Here is \nhow it works: Joe wants to donate a kidney to his wife Kathleen but \ncan't because of incompatibility. Likewise, Suzy wants to donate a \nkidney to her husband Scott but can't because of incompatibility. A \npaired donation helps match up these couples so Joe can donate a kidney \nto Scott and Suzy can donate a kidney to Kathleen.\n  The other approach is called a kidney list donation. Here is how it \nworks: Rebecca wants to donate a kidney to her husband Grant but can't \nbecause of incompatibility. In this case, she decides to donate a \nkidney to someone who is already on the national waiting list. Once the \ndonation is made, Grant is added to the waiting list but is given \nallocation priority for a kidney that becomes available in the future.\n  The Kidney Transplant Clarification Act will clarify that paired and \nlist kidney donations are allowed under the National Organ Transplant \nAct, removing a barrier that has prevented more kidney donations from \nliving donors from occurring.\n  The National Organ Transplant Act, which was enacted in 1984, \nprohibits any person to acquire, receive or donate any human organ for \nanything of value. The purpose of this law is to prohibit the buying \nand selling of human organs. I agree with this law. The last thing that \nwe want to do is sanction organ trafficking. Yet, when this law was \nenacted, paired and list kidney donations did not exist. It is \nimportant that we clarify that these innovative strategies to increase \nthe number of kidney donations from living donors are allowed under \ncurrent law.\n  The Kidney Transplant Clarification Act will not only save lives, it \nwill save the federal government and taxpayers money. Patients with end \nstage renal disease require dialysis, which is covered by Medicare. \nAccording to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Medicare \nspends about $55,000 per patient per year for dialysis. On average, \npatients with end stage renal disease wait 4 years before receiving a \nkidney transplant. This means that every kidney donation made from a \nliving donor has the potential to reduce the number of people on the \nwaiting list and save the government as much as $220,000.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 2307. A bill to enhance fair and open competition in the \nproduction and sale of agricultural commodities; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I, along with Mr. Enzi and Mr. \nThomas are introducing the ``Competitive and Fair Agricultural Markets \nAct of 2006.'' This legislation seeks to even the playing field for \nagricultural producers by strengthening and clarifying the Packers and \nStockyards Act of 1921 and the Agricultural Fair Practices Act of 1967 \nand requiring better enforcement of both laws by USDA.\n  A quick lesson in agricultural history makes clear that producers are \nno stranger to a marketplace often tilted against them. Roughly 100 \nyears ago, rapid consolidation and collusive practices by meatpacking \nand railroad and other companies prompted Congress to eventually pass \nseveral new laws designed to ensure a competitive and fair marketplace \nfor agricultural producers. Because earlier legislation was seen as \nlacking to protect livestock and poultry producers. Congress passed the \nPackers and Stockyards Act in 1921 to prohibit packers and processors \nfrom engaging in unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive \npractices.\n  Consolidation is happening in all sectors of agriculture and having a \nnegative effect on producers and consumers across the Nation. \nConsolidation in itself is not a violation of the Packers and \nStockyards Act, but when some entities become larger and more powerful \nthat makes enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act absolutely \ncritical for independent livestock and poultry producers. The \nstatistics speak for themselves. Today, only four firms control 84 \npercent of the procurement of cattle and 64 percent of the procurement \nof hogs. Economists have stated that when four firms control over 40 \npercent of the industry, marketplace competitiveness begins to decline. \nTaken together with fewer buyers of livestock, highly integrated firms \ncan exert tremendous power over the industry.\n  The dramatic changes in the marketplace are alarming, and I have \nexpressed my concerns to USDA on several occasions--but they showed \nhardly\n\n[[Page S1429]]\n\nany concern and even less action. The Grain Inspection, Packers and \nStockyards Administration (GIPSA) at USDA has the responsibility to \nenforce the Packers and Stockyards Act. For years, I have had doubts \nwhether GIPSA was effectively enforcing this important law. Concerned \nby the lack of action by GIPSA, I asked USDA's Inspector General to \ninvestigate this matter. Recently, the Inspector General issued a \nreport on GIPSA that confirmed these concerns. The report described \nwidespread inaction, agency management actively blocking employees from \nconducting investigations into anti-competitive behavior and a scheme \nto cover up the lack of enforcement by inflating the reported number of \ninvestigations conducted.\n  The Inspector General's troubling findings reveal gross mismanagement \nby GIPSA. This failure is not just at GIPSA but includes high-level \nofficials at USDA who did nothing to identify and correct problems \nwithin GIPSA. Today, the legislation I introduce will reorganize the \nstructure in how USDA enforces the Packers and Stockyards Act. This \nlegislation will create an office of special counsel for competition \nmatters at USDA. This office will oversee more effective enforcement of \nthe Packers and Stockyards Act and other laws and focus attention on \ncompetition issues at USDA by removing unnecessary layers of \nbureaucracy. The new special counsel on competition would be appointed \nby the President with advice and consent from the U.S. Senate. Some \nwould argue that this reorganization is not needed, especially given \nthat USDA has agreed to make the necessary changes recommended by the \nrecent Inspector General's report. However, what is important to \nremember here is that USDA has a long history of agreeing to making \nchanges and then never following through with them. The Inspector \nGeneral made recommendations to improve competition investigations in \n1997 and the Government Accountability Office made similar \nrecommendations again in 2000. It is 2006, yet those recommendations \nwere never implemented and GIPSA is in complete disarray. In addition, \nno one above the level of deputy administrator at GIPSA seemed to have \nany idea that any problems were going on, despite the fact I was \nsending letters to the Secretary of Agriculture pointing out that USDA \nwas failing to enforce the law. A change is needed.\n  In addition to the creation of a special counsel, this legislation \nalso makes many important clarifications to the Packers and Stockyards \nAct so that producers need not prove an impact on competition in the \nmarket in order to prevail in cases involving unfair or deceptive \npractices. Court rulings have created many hoops for producers to go \nthrough in order to succeed in cases where they were treated unfairly. \nFor example, the United States Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled \nthat a poultry grower operation failed to prove how its case involving \nan unfair termination of its contract adversely affected competition. \nThe court indicated that the grower had to prove that their unfair \ntreatment affected competition in the relevant market. That is very \ndifficult to prove and was never the intent of the Packers and \nStockyards Act.\n  This legislation also makes modifications to the Packers and \nStockyards Act so that poultry growers have the same enforcement \nprotections by USDA as livestock. Currently, it is unlawful for a \nlivestock packer or live poultry dealer to engage in any unfair, \nunjustly discriminatory or deceptive practice, but USDA does not have \nthe authority to enforce and correct such problems because the \nenforcement section of the law is absent of any reference to poultry. \nThis important statutory change is long overdue. In addition, to better \nreflect the integrated nature of the poultry industry, this legislation \nalso ensures that protections under the law extend to all poultry \ngrowers, such as breeder hen and pullet operations, not just those who \nraise broilers.\n  The Agricultural Fair Practices Act of 1967 was passed by Congress to \nensure that producers are allowed to join together as an association to \nstrengthen their position in the marketplace without being \ndiscriminated against by handlers. Unfortunately, this Act was passed \nwith a clause that essentially abolishes the actual intent of the law. \nThe Act states that ``nothing in this Act shall prevent handlers and \nproducers from selecting their customers'' and it also states that it \ndoes not ``require a handler to deal with an association of \nproducers.'' This clause in effect allows handlers to think of any \nreason possible under the sun not to do business with certain \nproducers, as long as the stated reason is not because they belong to \nan association. Currently, the Agricultural Fair Practices Act focuses \non the right of producers to join together without discrimination for \nhaving done so.\n  I propose to expand the Agricultural Fair Practices Act to provide \nnew needed protections for agricultural contracts. As I have mentioned \nearlier, consolidation in all sectors of agriculture is reducing the \nnumber of buyers of commodities and for the very few who are left, many \nrequire contracts to conduct business. Some producers have little or no \nchoice but to contract with a firm with questionable practices or face \nleaving the industry they have known for their whole lives.\n  This amendment to the Agricultural Fair Practices Act requires that \ncontracts be spelled out in clear language what is required by the \nproducer. This legislation prohibits confidentiality clauses by giving \nproducers the ability to share it with family members or a lawyer to \nhelp them make an informed decision on whether or not to sign it. It \nprevents companies from prematurely terminating contracts without \nnotice when producers have made large capital investments as a \ncondition of signing the contract. And it only allows mandatory \narbitration after a dispute arises and both parties agree to it in \nwriting. Producers should not be forced to sign contracts with \narbitration clauses thereby preventing them from seeking legal remedy \nin the courts.\n  History is repeating itself--in fact consolidation in the industry is \neven worse today. Producers deserve to have a fair and evenhanded \nmarket in which to conduct business. They should not be at the mercy of \nunfair and heavily consolidated markets that spurred Congress to enact \nlegislative reforms, such as the Packers and Stockyards Act, years ago. \nThis legislation won't be able to turn back the clock, but it will \nstrengthen laws and enforcement of them so that markets operate more \nfairly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 2308. A bill to amend the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of \n1977 to improve mine safety, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to \noverhaul the Mine Safety and Health Act to make this Nation's mines the \nsafest in the world. The recent events at the Sago mine in \nTallmansville and the Alma Mine in Mellville, WV, and the death of a \nminer of Pikeville, KY, demonstrates that improvements need to be made \nin all areas of mine safety. The West Virginia disasters remind us of \nthe one at the Pennsylvania Quecreek mine where on July 24, 2002, a \nmining machine broke through an abandoned section of the mine, \nunleashing 60 million gallons of groundwater and trapping 9 miners. \nSome 78 hours after the accident, all 9 miners were pulled safely from \nthe mine. Unfortunately, the 12 men at the Sago mine were not as lucky.\n  A recent article in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette stated: ``The rest of \nthe world will move on. In the weeks and months to come, there will be \nother disasters, other wars, other political scandals. But for the \nfamilies of the 12 men who died inside the mine in Tallmansville, WV, \nfor the one who survived, for their relatives and friends, for the \ninvestigators searching for the cause of the mine explosion, for the \npeople of these coal-rich hills 100 miles south of Pittsburgh, Sago \nwill be a daily litany. Some questions about the January 2 accident may \nnever be answered.''\n  Mining is a dangerous business. There have already been 4 coal mine \naccidents since the January 2, 2006, Sago disaster. One on January 10, \nwhen a miner was killed in Kentucky after a mine roof cave-in, another \non January 19, when 2 miners became trapped at\n\n[[Page S1430]]\n\nthe Alma mine in Melville, West Virginia, and two more accidents on \nFebruary 1, 2006, where a miner was killed at an underground mine when \na wall support popped loose, and a second fatality when a bulldozer \nstruck a gas line at a surface mine sparking a fire and killing the \noperator. Last year, the safest year on record, there were 22 \nfatalities in underground coal mines, in 20 separate accidents with 4 \nmen killed in my home State of Pennsylvania; 3 in West Virginia; 8 in \nKentucky and 7 in other States.\n  The Sago mine had 208 citations, orders and safeguards issued against \nit in 2005, with nearly half of these violations cited as ``significant \nand substantial''. Eighteen of the violations were cited as \n``withdrawal orders'', which shut down activity in specific areas of \nthe mine until problems were corrected.\n  While the budget for mine safety and health has increased by 42 \npercent over the past 10 years, these increases barely keep pace with \ninflationary costs. This has forced the agency to reduce staffing by \n183 positions over that same time period. In FY 2006, the final \nappropriation was $2.8 million below the budget request and $1.4 \nmillion below the FY 2005 appropriation due to the 1 percent across-\nthe-board reduction that was required to stay within the budget \nresolution ceiling.\n  I chaired a hearing on January 23, 2006, that included testimony from \nFederal mining officials and mine safety experts from labor, business, \nand academia, which resulted in many of the proposals in my \nlegislation.\n  Specifically, the legislation that I am introducing today amends the \nMine Safety and Health Act by requiring: 1. MSHA to release the \ninternal review and accident investigation reports to the House and \nSenate authorizing and appropriating committees, within 30 days of \ncompleting their investigation of a mine disaster. 2. MSHA to publish \nformal rules for conducting accident investigations and hearing \nprocedures. 3. That fines for a flagrant violation be increased from \n$60,000 to $500,000; defining that violation as a reckless or repeated \nfailure to make reasonable efforts to eliminate a known violation of a \nstandard that substantially and proximately caused, or reasonably could \nhave been expected to cause death or serious bodily injury; and \nprohibiting the reduction of penalties by an administrative law judge \nfor any violation termed as ``flagrant or habitual''. 4. That no fine \nless than $10,000 can be assessed for a safety violation that could \ncause serious illness or injury, and no less than $20,000 can be \nassessed to a habitual violator for a violation that could \nsignificantly and substantially contribute to a safety or health \nhazard. 5. MSHA inspectors to follow-up on all violations no later than \n24 hours. 6. MSHA to ensure that the ventilation and roof control plans \nare reviewed on a quarterly basis. 7. That mining companies be subject \nto a fine of no less than $100,000 if MSHA officials are not informed \nof a disaster within 15 minutes of an accident. The MSHA Director may \nwaive the penalty if it is found that failure to give notice was caused \nby circumstances outside the control of the mine operator. 8. That mine \nrepresentatives not be present during accident investigation interviews \nwith miners. 9. MSHA to train all mine personnel in the proper usage of \nwireless devices and do refresher training courses during each calendar \nyear. 10. That rescue teams do training exercises twice a year and \nconduct emergency rescue drills at operating mines--on a surprise, \nunannounced basis. 11. That communications between rescue teams be \nstrictly confined between the command center and the team members. 12. \nMSHA to have a central communications Emergency Call Center--which \nincludes manned telephone operation with all calls answered by a live \noperator, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This provision will apply \nto all types of mining operations. To assist in implementing and \noperating the Emergency Call Center, MSHA shall--on a quarterly basis--\nprovide the Center with a mine emergency contact list. 13. That \nwireless Emergency Tracking Devices be made available to each miner by \nthe operator which will enable rescuers to locate miners in case of an \naccident. 14. That wireless text messaging or other wireless \ncommunications devices be made by the operator and shall be worn by \nunderground personnel to enable rescuers or mine operators to \ncommunicate with underground personnel. 15. MSHA to place secondary \ntelephone lines in a separate entry in order to increase the likelihood \nthat communications could be maintained between miners and those on the \nsurface in the event of an emergency. 16. That strategically placed \noxygen stations be provided to miners with four days of oxygen--in the \nsection of the mine where miners are working. 17. That fines will be \nincreased from $5,500 to $55,000 for operators who fail to correct a \nviolation. 18. That an operator who knowingly exposes workers to \nsituations likely to cause death or serious bodily injury or willfully \nviolates a mandatory health or safety standard will have fines \nincreased from $25,000 to $250,000. 19. That if any person gives \nadvance notice of the mine inspection the fine will be increased from \nnot more than $1,000 to not more than $20,000. 20. That if any person \nmakes a false statement regarding complying with the MSHA Act the fine \nwill be increased from $10,000 to $100,000.\n\n  All metal, non-metal and coal mines as defined in section 3 of the \nAct, shall be subject to a user fee of $100.00 for each penalty \nassessed, to be collected by MSHA and deposited into its account to \naugment funding above fiscal year 2006 enacted appropriations, for the \nfollowing activities: reimburse operators for the costs of training, \nresearch and development, rescue teams, safe rooms, and other miner \nsafety supplies and equipment, and supplement MSHA funding of technical \nsupport, educational policy and development, and program evaluation and \ninformation activities.\n  These amendments that I have proposed to the Mine Safety and Health \nAct will improve the conditions in this Nation's mines. The provisions \nset forth in this legislation will provide increased protections for \nminers; put in place new equipment and technology to locate miners \nworking underground; increase their oxygen supplies and speed up rescue \noperations so that the tragedy of the last few months will be not be \nrepeated. I ask that you join me in cosponsoring this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 2309. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe definition of agri-biodiesel; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bill of modest \nscope but of great importance. The legislation would modify the \nexisting Federal biodiesel tax credit in two ways--to make clear that \nonly biodiesel produced from feedstocks listed, such as soy oil, are \neligible and also to ensure the credit is available only for fuel of \nthe highest quality.\n  Biodiesel is a home-grown renewable fuel that helps wean our country \noff of its oil addiction, creates economic growth and jobs in rural \nareas while enhancing our environment and public health.\n  In my State of Iowa, which leads the Nation in biodiesel production, \nthere are three plants in operation and several more coming on-line. \nEach plant bolsters farm income, provides good jobs to surrounding \ncommunities and additional tax revenues to municipalities.\n  The biodiesel tax credit was enacted into law just a few years ago. \nIt was extended through 2008 in the energy bill. I have been a leading \nproponent of the tax credit since day one. However, the tax credit has \nrecently subsidized biodiesel production from outside the U.S. While I \nam certainly not averse to trade, and generally believe that it is a \ngood thing for renewable energy to supplant fossil fuels wherever it \ncomes from, the practice does not enhance domestic energy security, a \ngoal which the President endorsed in his recent State of the Union \naddress.\n  It would be terribly unfortunate if the Federal Government, which has \nsought to bolster our domestic energy security and environmental \nquality through the development of renewable fuels, suddenly found \nitself unintentionally undermining that goal. Congress intended the \nbiodiesel tax credit to go to support production from a finite set of \nfeedstocks. We are now off-track given how the Internal Revenue Service \nhas been interpreting the law. The agency has improperly determined \nthat biodiesel produced from a variety\n\n[[Page S1431]]\n\nof feedstocks, even those not listed in statute, are eligible for the \ncredit.\n  So I have put together a bill, as I said, that is modest in scope. \nThe bill fixes the tax credit language by making biodiesel made from \nany source not listed in the statute ineligible for the tax credit.\n  In addition, I have added a performance standard to help ensure that \nonly high-quality biodiesel may receive tax benefits. There have been \nreports of late that some biodiesel doesn't perform as well as it \nshould in certain situations, and this provision should help address \nthat problem. The performance standard set forth in the bill specifies \nthat only fuel listed with a cloud point of 45 degrees or less is \neligible for the credit. Cloud point measures the point at which a fuel \nsuch as biodiesel will cloud or gel due to cold temperatures. My \nunderstanding is that cloud point is generally recognized as the best \nquality indicator for satisfactory performance.\n  The bill as crafted should not interfere in any way with our \ninternational trade obligations under the World Trade Organization \n(WTO) rules since it does not differentiate between oilseeds of U.S. \nand foreign origin. This view is shared by several trade experts \nconsulted by my staff.\n  I stand ready to work with my colleagues on the Senate Finance \nCommittee, which has direct jurisdiction over this issue, to move this \nlegislation forward.\n  In sum, I think this legislation is necessary to promote domestic \nenergy security, ensure appropriate performance, and do so in a way \nthat is compliant with our international trading obligations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 2310. A bill to repeal the requirement for 12 operational aircraft \ncarriers within the Navy; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important \npiece of legislation related to our Navy and National Security.\n  The Department of Defense has submitted its report to the Congress on \nthe Quadrennial Defense Review for 2005 and, as we are all well aware, \nin the 4 years since the previous Quadrennial Defense Review.\n  The global war on terror has dramatically broadened the demands on \nour naval combat forces. In response, the Navy has implemented \nfundamental changes to fleet maintenance and deployment practices that \nhave increased total force availability, and it has fielded advances in \nship systems, aircraft, and precision weapons that have provided \nappreciably greater combat power than 4 years ago.\n  These commendable efforts reflect the superb skills, resolve, and \ndedication of the men and women of our Armed Forces, as they adapt to \nthe added dimension of international terror while providing for the \nsecurity of our Nation.\n  However, we must consider that the Navy is at its smallest size in \ndecades, and the threat of emerging naval powers superimposed upon the \nNavy's broader mission of maintaining global maritime security, \nrequires that we modernize and expand our Navy.\n  The longer view dictated by naval force structure planning requires \nthat we invest today to ensure maritime dominance 15 years and further \nin the future; investment to modernize our aircraft carrier force with \n21st century capabilities, to increase our expeditionary capability, to \nmaintain our undersea superiority, and to develop the ability to \npenetrate the littorals with the same command we possess today in the \nopen seas.\n  The 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review impresses these critical \nrequirements against the backdrop of the national defense strategy and \nconcludes that the Navy must build a larger fleet. The Navy, in its \nevaluation of the future threat, has determined that a force level of \n313 ships, 32 ships greater than today's operational fleet, is required \nto maintain decisive maritime superiority.\n  These findings are in whole agreement with previous concerns raised \nby Congress as the rate of shipbuilding declined over the past 15 \nyears. Now we must finance this critical modernization, and in doing so \nwe must strike an affordable balance between existing and future force \nstructure.\n  The centerpiece of the Navy's force structure is the carrier strike \ngroup, and the evaluation of current and future aircraft carrier \ncapabilities by the Quadrennial Defense Review has concluded that 11 \ncarrier strike groups provide the decisively superior combat capability \nrequired by the national defense strategy. Carefully considering this \nconclusion, we must weigh the risk of reducing the naval force from 12 \nto 11 aircraft carriers against the risk of failing to modernize the \nnaval force.\n  Maintaining 12 aircraft carriers would require extending the service \nlife and continuing to operate the USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67). The \ncompelling reality is that today the 38-year-old USS John F. Kennedy \n(CV-67) is not deployable without a significant investment of \nresources. Recognizing the great complexity and risks inherent to naval \naviation, there are real concerns regarding the ability to maintain the \nKennedy in an operationally safe condition for our sailors at sea. In \nthe final assessment, the costs to extend the service life and to make \nthe necessary investments to deploy this aging aircraft carrier in the \nfuture prove prohibitive when measured against the critical need to \ninvest in modernizing the carrier force, the submarine force, and the \nsurface combatant force.\n  We in the Congress have an obligation to ensure that our brave men \nand women in uniform are armed with the right capability when and where \ncalled upon to perform their mission in defense of freedom around the \nworld. Previously, we have questioned the steady decline in naval force \nstructure, raising concerns with regard to long term impacts on \noperations, force readiness, and the viability of the industrial base \nthat we rely upon to build our Nation's Navy. Accordingly, I am \nencouraged by and strongly endorse the Navy's vision for a larger, \nmodernized fleet, sized and shaped to remain the world's dominant \nseapower through the 21st century.\n  However, to achieve this expansion while managing limited resources, \nit is necessary to retire the aging conventional carriers that have \nserved this country for so long. To this end, Mr. President, I offer \nthis legislation which would amend section 5062 of Title 10, United \nStates Code to eliminate the requirement for the naval combat forces of \nthe Navy to include not less than 12 operational aircraft carriers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 2311. A bill to establish a demonstration project to develop a \nnational network of economically sustainable transportation providers \nand qualified transportation providers, to provide transportation \nservices to older individuals, and individuals who are blind, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in recent years, we have become \nincreasingly aware of the great challenges facing our Nation as our \npopulation ages. While much discussion revolves around health care, \nsocial security, and pension systems, there is another daunting \nchallenge that is rarely addressed in a comprehensive way.\n  I am referring to the challenge of senior transportation.\n  We Americans love our automobiles. From the time most of us were old \nenough to drive, we have been behind the wheel. Cars mean freedom--not \nin some grand philosophical sense--but in the real and practical sense \nthat matters to us in our everyday lives. Having a car, and being able \nto drive it, means the freedom to go where we want, when we want.\n  But as we age, we will find it harder and harder to use the freedom \ngiven to us by automobiles. Because as we age, our abilities decline, \nand driving becomes less and less simple. And then the day comes when \nwe wonder whether we should keep driving at all, and if we don't, how \nwe will get about our daily lives.\n  That day has already come for millions of our senior citizens.\n  All around the Nation, older Americans are struggling to stay active \nand independent while their ability to drive themselves declines. A few \nlive in communities with well-developed public transportation services \ngeared to our senior citizens, but most do not. Many seniors drive as \nlong as they can, perhaps longer than they think they should, simply \nbecause they feel they have no alternative.\n  That is why I am today introducing the Older Americans Sustainable \nMobility Act of 2006. Despite its rather\n\n[[Page S1432]]\n\nawkward name, this legislation has a great purpose. It would create a \n5-year demonstration project, overseen by the Administration on Aging, \nto establish a national, nonprofit senior transportation network to \nhelp provide some transportation alternatives to our aging population. \nThe goal of this network is to build upon creative, successful models \nthat are already showing how the transportation needs of older \nAmericans can be met in a manner that is economically sustainable.\n  This last point is important. Senior transportation is a complex and \nexpensive logistical problem. We cannot expect to address this problem \nby creating a brand new, expansive, Federal Government program that \nrequires the commitment of vast sums year after year in order to \nsucceed. We can't afford that, and that really isn't what older \nAmericans want.\n  What older Americans want is what most of us have and take for \ngranted--the freedom and mobility that our automobiles provide.\n  My legislation would build upon models that have demonstrated how \nsenior citizens can stay active and mobile even after they stop \ndriving. One such model is ITNAmerica, which has been operating in my \nhome State of Maine since the mid-1990s and has since branched out to \ncommunities across the Nation. ITNAmerica uses private automobiles to \nprovide rides to senior citizens whenever they want, almost like a taxi \nservice. Riders open an account which is automatically charged when the \nservice is used. Riders can get credits for rides through volunteer \nservices, through donations--and this is what I think is most \nintriguing--by donating their private car to the program after they \nhave decided that they should no longer drive.\n  Kathy Freund, the founder of ITNAmerica, sees this as a way of taking \nsomething people see as a liability, and turning it into an asset. \nThrough Kathy's extraordinary vision and hard work, ITNAmerica has \ndeveloped a model that works because it allows older Americans to make \nthe transition away from driving themselves without asking them to \nsacrifice their independence, or to learn at an older age how to \nnavigate public transportation systems that may simply be inappropriate \nfor their needs, or widely unavailable in many parts of the country. \nThey can still be mobile, they can still go where they want and when \nthey want, and they can go by car.\n  Senior citizens will often keep their vehicles long after they have \nstopped driving. I am sure you have seen these vehicles in your State \nas I have in mine. You will see them sitting in driveways--unattended \nand poorly maintained, sometimes not driven for many months at a time. \nIn this form, these cars are ``wasting'' assets. But ITNAmerica has \nfound that the value of these cars can be unlocked by allowing seniors \nto exchange them for rides. That is why my bill calls for the creation \nof a once-in-a-lifetime tax benefit for seniors who exchange their cars \nfor rides, valued at the amount of the ride-credit they are provided.\n  One of my senior citizen constituents, June Snow from Falmouth, ME, \nhas been using the system that I described--the ITNAmerica system--\nsince 1995, when her eyesight began to fail. At first, she used the \nprogram only to get into the city, Portland, and only after dark, when \nshe found it more difficult to drive. But more recently she has traded \nher car for rides, and now she depends on the system to go everywhere \nshe needs to go. She finds that the program allows her to get around \ntown, to run errands, and do the things she has to do and wants to do \nwithout worrying about whether she will be able to get safely from one \nplace to another. She told me: It's not like riding a bus, where you \nhave to work with their schedules, and they won't stop and help you \nwith your groceries. They won't make you get your feet wet walking \nthrough the snow to the bus stop.\n  But what she loves most is the personal attention she gets from the \ndrivers, most of whom are volunteers. ``They help you to the door, and \nthey even carry your bundles and put them in the trunk,'' she says.\n  My bill also creates a limited-time matching grant program to help \ncommunities establish sustainable transportation alternatives for \nseniors as part of a national network. Programs that wish to compete \nfor these matching grants must be able to show that they can become \nself-sustaining after 5 years, and that they can operate after that \nperiod without reliance on public funds. So what I am proposing, is \nthat we just provide some seed money as a catalyst, to get these \nprograms going, with the full expectation--indeed the requirement--that \nthey become self-sustaining without any public funds after the initial \nperiod. My bill also provides smaller grants to help transportation \nproviders acquire the technology they need to connect to this network, \nand grants to encourage efforts to get the baby boomers more involved \nin supporting transportation alternatives in their communities. The \ntotal cost of these grant programs would be only $25 million over the \nfull 5 year period. Then the program sunsets, and these wonderful \ntransportation programs that would be created all over the country \nwould be sustainable on their own without public funding.\n  The challenge of providing transportation alternatives to our \nNation's senior citizens is literally growing by the day. The bill I am \noffering is one step toward a reasonable, practical, solution to this \nimportant challenge. I think all of us know of neighbors and family \nmembers who reach their senior years and really shouldn't be driving \nanymore but are very reluctant to give up those car keys because there \nare simply no workable alternatives for them. This bill would provide \nthose alternatives, and I urge my colleagues to support the \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 2312.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nfederally-supported education and awareness campaign for the prevention \nof methamphetamine use; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \ncurb meth use in the United States. We have often been told that an \nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, but this adage is \nparticularly true with methamphetamine addiction. But the problems \nassociated with meth do not end with a one-time high-they are only just \nbeginning. All too often, we hear horror stories about the change in \nthe brain's chemical composition that results from meth use. There's no \nguarantee that a meth user's brain will be the same after they use meth \njust once.\n  The impact of meth, both emotionally and physically, is significant. \nThe individuals that use meth are also not the only ones harmed by this \ndevastating drug--meth problems manifest themselves in family \nrelationships, place strain on treatment facilities and public health \nneeds, and the community. at large must bear the costs associated with \nmeth, such as drug-endangered children and the remediation of meth \nlabs. The most efficient use of Federal dollars should be directed \ntoward prevention--and that is why I have introduced legislation today.\n  With consideration of the PATRIOT Act and the inclusion of the Combat \nMeth Act provisions which I fully support, I strongly believe that an \nemphasis on prevention is essential, and the discussion today is a \ntopical one. We must change the attitude of the consumer. So long as \nthere is a demand for meth, there will always be willing sellers.\n  My legislation would allow communities to apply for assistance for \nany campaign which would have a demonstrated reduction of meth use. A \n100 percent match is required of all applicants to ensure that the \ncommunity organization or local government applying for funds has a \nstake in the outcome. However, my legislation also recognizes the \ndifficulty this matching requirement may have on rural areas, or Indian \nreservations, which typically have a high level of meth use, but lack \nthe necessary resources. For these applicants, the match will be cut in \nhalf.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in helping to prevent this public \nhealth crisis called meth from becoming any worse. I have seen the \nSenate's Anti-Meth Caucus start with six members when I created it last \nyear, and membership now stands at over 30 members. In the Senate, we \nrealize the serious nature and scope of the problem facing our States--\nnow it's time to act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 2316. A bill to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to \npermanently prohibit the conduct of offshore drilling on the Outer \nContinental Shelf in the Mid-Atlantic and North Atlantic planning \nareas; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from New \nJersey, Senator Lautenberg, to introduce legislation designed to \nprotect our State's coastline from the threat of encroaching oil and \ngas development. The Clean Ocean and Safe Tourism Anti-Drilling Act, or \nCOAST Anti-Drilling Act, bans oil and gas drilling off the New Jersey \nshore, and in the entire Atlantic seaboard from Maine to North \nCarolina.\n  This bill is necessary because of last week's publication of the \nMinerals Management Service's, MMS, draft 5-year plan for the Outer \nContinental Shelf, which proposes to open the waters off the coast of \nVirginia to oil and gas leasing in 2011. In some places, this means \ndrilling less than 75 miles off the coast of New Jersey. While the MMS \nmay believe you can assign a part of the ocean as belonging to a \ncertain state, oil spills will not respect those boundaries. Seventy-\nfive miles is more than close enough for a spill to affect the New \nJersey shore, potentially devastating our beaches and the state's \ncritical tourist economy.\n  According to the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission, \ntourism is a $22 billion dollar industry in the State, responsible for \nmore than 430,000 jobs, over 10 percent of the total jobs in the State. \nTo risk all of that, and the coastal economies of every State along the \nAtlantic coast, for what is estimated to be a fairly small potential \nreserve of oil and gas is simply not worth it.\n  The MMS recently released new estimates for recoverable oil and gas \nin the outer continental shelf, and the entire Atlantic seaboard adds \nup to less than 6 percent of the nation's estimated OCS gas reserves, \nand less than 3 percent of the oil reserves--barely a 6-month supply. \nAnd that's from Maine to Florida, so the area off any individual State \nwill be a small fraction of that.\n  This is not an issue of trying to lower the price of natural gas, or \nmaking the United States more energy independent. This is about \nprotecting New Jersey's environment and economy. This is about \nprotecting the coastline where New Jersey families live, work, and \nplay. I look forward to working with my colleagues from neighboring \nStates, and from States around the country, to ensure that our beaches \nare protected for generations to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Hatch, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 2327. A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to require the United \nStates Trade Representative to identify trade enforcement priorities \nand to take action with respect to priority foreign country trade \npractices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I--along with Senator Hatch and \nSenator Stabenow--introduce the Trade Competitiveness Act of 2006, a \nbill that will provide the administration with additional tools, \nresources, and accountability to enforce international trade \nagreements.\n  This bill is the first in a comprehensive package of legislation that \nI will introduce during the next few weeks to bolster American \ncompetitiveness.\n  The United States is still a world leader in almost every way \nimaginable. But we need a bold agenda to maintain America's economic \nleadership and preserve high-wage American jobs here at home.\n  I just got back from China and India, and that trip only underscored \nthe challenges we face in the global economy. To rise to this \nchallenge, my bills\n\n[[Page S1434]]\n\nwill address trade and all other keystones of America's \ncompetitiveness--education, energy, health, savings, research, and tax \npolicy.\n  But today, we start with international trade. Trade and investment in \ninternational markets is a challenge that I have asked U.S. companies \nto embrace.\n  I want American companies to get aggressive about getting their \nproducts and their people into foreign markets to bolster the U.S. \npresence around the world and bring jobs and dollars back home.\n  But when American companies embrace these new market opportunities, \nthey need to know that the American government will back them up. They \nneed to know that we will do all that we can to make sure our trading \npartners play by the rules.\n  That is why trade enforcement is critical. And this bill will step up \ntrade enforcement in five ways.\n  Number one: Under my legislation, every year, the USTR will be \nrequired to identify the biggest trade barriers hurting the U.S. \neconomically. The USTR will have to get Congress's input. And the USTR \nwill be required to act, through the WTO or in some other way, to break \nthose barriers down.\n  Number two: My bill will create a ``Chief Trade Enforcement Officer'' \nat the USTR. This person will be confirmed by the Senate. His or her \nentire job will be to investigate enforcement concerns and recommend \naction to the USTR. This person will also answer to Congress when it \nhas concerns about enforcement.\n  Number three: This new Trade Enforcement Officer is going to have \nsome backup. My bill will create a ``Trade Enforcement Working Group'' \nin the Executive Branch. It will be chaired by the USTR, and include \nrepresentatives of the Departments of Commerce, State, Agriculture, and \nTreasury. They will help the Chief Trade Enforcement Officer get the \njob done.\n  Number four: This new Trade Enforcement Officer will need resources \nto get the job done. My bill provides $5 million additional to the USTR \nfor enforcement. Right now, the President's Fiscal Year 2007 budget \neffectively cuts enforcement funds.\n  Number five: This bill will send a strong message to the \nInternational Monetary Fund. It will urge our Administration to tell \nthe IMF to get aggressive with countries that manipulate their own \ncurrency to obtain a trade advantage. It will also urge the IMF to \nundertake reforms so it becomes more transparent and more \nrepresentative of the emerging economies in Asia.\n  Senator Hatch wanted to make sure that the Federal Government does \nnot lose sight of Federal and State sovereignty when negotiating, \nimplementing, and enforcing trade agreements. That's an important issue \nto consider, and I'm glad it's in this bill.\n  The bottom line is that improving enforcement of our trade agreements \nwill allow American companies to play hard and win big in the global \nmarketplace. A level playing field is the foundation of American \ncompetitiveness on trade. This bill will help to provide it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 2318. A bill to provide driver safety grants to States with \ngraduated driver licensing laws that meet certain minimum requirements; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague from Virginia, \nSenator Warner, to introduce the Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform \nProtection, STANDUP, Act of 2006--an important piece of legislation \nthat seeks to protect and ensure the lives of the 20 million teenage \ndrivers in our country.\n  We all know that the teenage years represent an important formative \nstage in a person's life, They are a bridge between childhood and \nadulthood--the transitional and often challenging period during which a \nperson will first gain an inner awareness of his or her identity. The \nteenage years encompass a time for discovery, a time for growth, and a \ntime for gaining independence--all of which ultimately help boys and \ngirls transition successfully into young men and women.\n  As we also know, the teenage years also encompass a time for risk-\ntaking, A groundbreaking study published last year by the National \nInstitutes of Health concluded that the frontal lobe region of the \nbrain which inhibits risky behavior is not fully formed until the age \nof 25. In my view, this important report requires that we approach \nteenagers' behavior with a new sensitivity. It also requires that we \nhave as a Nation an obligation to steer teenagers towards positive \nrisk-taking that fosters further growth and development and away from \nnegative risk-taking that has an adverse effect on their well-being and \nthe well-being of others.\n  Unfortunately, we see all too often this negative risk-taking in \nteenagers when they are behind the wheel of a motor vehicle. We see all \ntoo often how this risk-taking needlessly endangers the life of a \nteenage driver, his or her passengers, and other drivers on the road. \nAnd we see all too often the tragic results of this risk-taking when \nirresponsible and reckless behavior behind the wheel of a motor vehicle \ncauses severe harm and death.\n  According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \nmotor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans \nbetween 15 and 20 years of age. Between 1995 and 2004, 63,851 young \nAmericans between the ages of 15 and 20 died in motor vehicle crashes--\nan average of 122 teenage deaths a week. Teenage drivers have a \nfatality rate that is four times higher than the average fatality rate \nfor drivers between 25 and 70 years of age. Teenage drivers who are 16 \nyears of age have a motor vehicle crash rate that is almost ten times \nthe crash rate for drivers between the ages of 30 and 60.\n  A recent analysis by the American Automobile Association's Foundation \nfor Traffic Safety concluded that teenage drivers comprise slightly \nmore than one-third of all fatalities in motor vehicle crashes in which \nthey are involved, whereas nearly two-thirds of all fatalities in those \ncrashes are other drivers, passengers, and pedestrians.\n  Finally, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety concludes that \nthe chance of a crash by a driver either 16 or 17 years of age is \ndoubled if there are two peers in the motor vehicle and quadrupled with \nthree or more peers in the vehicle.\n  Crashes involving teenage injuries or fatalities are often high-\nprofile tragedies in the area where they occur. However, when taken \ntogether, these individual tragedies speak to a national problem \nclearly illustrated by the staggering statistics I just mentioned. It \nis a problem that adversely affects teenage drivers, their passengers, \nand literally everyone else who operates or rides in a motor vehicle. \nClearly, more work must be done to design and implement innovative \nmethods that educate our young drivers on the awesome responsibilities \nthat are associated with operating a motor vehicle safely.\n  One such method involves implementing and enforcing a graduated \ndriver's license system, or a GDL system. Under a typical GDL system, a \nteenage driver passes through several sequential learning stages before \nearning the full privileges associated with an unrestricted driver's \nlicense. Each learning stage is designed to teach a teenage driver \nfundamental lessons on driver operations, responsibilities, and safety. \nEach stage also imposes certain restrictions, such as curfews on \nnighttime driving and limitations on passengers, that further ensure \nthe safety of the teenage driver, his or her passengers, and other \nmotorists.\n  First implemented over ten years ago, three-stage GDL systems now \nexist in 38 States. Furthermore, every State in the country has adopted \nat least one driving restriction for new teenage drivers. Several \nstudies have concluded that GDL systems and other license restriction \nmeasures have been linked to an overall reduction on the number of \nteenage driver crashes and fatalities. In 1997, in the first full year \nthat its GDL system was in effect, Florida experienced a 9 percent \nreduction in fatal and injurious motor vehicle crashes among teenage \ndrivers between 15 and 18 years of age. After GDL systems were \nimplemented in Michigan and North Carolina in 1997, the number of motor \nvehicle crashes involving teenage drivers 16 years of age decreased in \neach State by 25 percent and 27 percent, respectively. And in \nCalifornia, the numbers of teenage passenger deaths and injuries in \ncrashes involving teenage drivers 16 years of age decreased by 40 \npercent between\n\n[[Page S1435]]\n\n1998 and 2000, the first three years that California's GDL system was \nin effect. The number of ``at- fault'' crashes involving teenage \ndrivers decreased by 24 percent during the same period.\n  These statistics are promising and clearly show that many States are \ntaking an important first step towards addressing this enormous problem \nconcerning teenage driver safety. However, there is currently no \nuniformity between States with regards to GDL system requirements and \nother novice driver license restrictions. Some States have very strong \ninitiatives in place that promote safe teenage driving while others \nhave very weak initiatives in place. Given how many teenagers are \nkilled or injured in motor vehicle crashes each year, and given how \nmany other motorists and passengers are killed or injured in motor \nvehicle crashes involving teenage drivers each year, Senator Warner and \nI believe that the time has come for an initiative that sets a national \nminimum safety standard for teen driving laws while giving each State \nthe flexibility to set additional standards that meet the more specific \nneeds of its teenage driver population. The bill that Senator Warner \nand I are introducing today--the STANDUP Act--is such an initiative. \nThere are four principal components of this legislation which I would \nlike to briefly discuss.\n  First, The STANDUP Act mandates that all States implement a national \nminimum safety standard for teenage drivers that contains four core \nrequirements recommended by the National Transportation Safety Board. \nThese requirements include implementing a three-stage GDL system, \nimplementing at least some prohibition on nighttime driving, placing a \nrestriction on the number of passengers without adult supervision, and \nimplementing a restriction on the use of electronic communications \ndevices, such as cell phones, during non-emergency situations.\n  Second, the STANDUP Act directs the Secretary of Transportation to \nissue voluntary guidelines beyond the three core requirements that \nencourage States to adopt additional standards that improve the safety \nof teenage driving. These additional standards may include requiring \nthat the learner's permit and intermediate stages be six months each, \nrequiring at least 30 hours of behind- the-wheel driving for a novice \ndriver in the learner's permit stage in the company of a licensed \ndriver who is over 21 years of age, requiring a novice driver in the \nlearner's permit stage to be accompanied and supervised by a licensed \ndriver 21 years of age or older at all times when the novice driver is \noperating a motor vehicle, and requiring that the granting of an \nunrestricted driver's license be delayed automatically to any novice \ndriver in the learner's permit or intermediate stages who commits a \nmotor vehicle offense, such as driving while intoxicated, \nmisrepresenting his or her true age, reckless driving, speeding, or \ndriving without a fastened seatbelt.\n\n  Third, the STANDUP Act provides incentive grants to States that come \ninto compliance within three fiscal years. Calculated on a State's \nannual share of the Highway Trust Fund, these incentive grants could be \nused for activities such as training law enforcement and relevant State \nagency personnel in the GDL law or publishing relevant educational \nmaterials on the GDL law.\n  Finally, the STANDUP Act calls for sanctions to be imposed on States \nthat do not come into compliance after three fiscal years. The bill \nwithholds 1.5 percent of a State's Federal highway share after the \nfirst fiscal year of non-compliance, three percent after the second \nfiscal year, and six percent after the third fiscal year. The bill does \nallow a State to reclaim any withheld funds if that State comes into \ncompliance within two fiscal years after the first fiscal year of non-\ncompliance.\n  There are those who will say that the STANDUP Act infringes on \nStates' rights. I respectfully disagree. I believe that it is in the \nnational interest to work to protect and ensure the lives and safety of \nthe millions of teenage drivers, their passengers, and other motorists \nin our country. I also believe that the number of motor vehicle deaths \nand injuries associated with teenage drivers each year compels us to \naddress this important national issue today and not tomorrow.\n  The teenage driving provisions within the STANDUP Act are both well-\nknown and popular with the American public. A Harris Poll conducted in \n2001 found that 95 percent of Americans support a requirement of 30 to \n50 hours of practice driving within an adult, 92 percent of Americans \nsupport a six-month learner's permit stage, 74 percent of Americans \nsupport limiting the number of teen passengers in a motor vehicle with \na teen driver, and 74 percent of Americans also support supervised or \nrestricted driving during high-risk periods such as nighttime. Clearly, \nthese numbers show that teen driving safety is an issue that transcends \nparty politics and is strongly embraced by a solid majority of \nAmericans. Therefore, I ask my colleagues today to join Senator Warner \nand myself in protecting the lives of our teenagers and in supporting \nthis important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that text of this legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2318\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Safe Teen and Novice Driver \n     Uniform Protection Act of 2006'' or the ``STANDUP Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has \n     reported that--\n       (A) motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death of \n     Americans between 15 and 20 years of age;\n       (B) between 1995 and 2004, 63,851 Americans between 15 and \n     20 years of age died in motor vehicle crashes, an average of \n     122 teenage deaths per week;\n       (C) teenage drivers between 16 and 20 years of age have a \n     fatality rate that is 4 times the rate for drivers between 25 \n     and 70 years of age; and\n       (D) teenage drivers who are 16 years of age have a motor \n     vehicle crash rate that is almost ten times the crash rate \n     for drivers aged between 30 and 60 years of age.\n       (2) According to the American Automobile Association, \n     teenage drivers comprise slightly more than \\1/3\\ of all \n     fatalities in motor vehicle crashes in which they are \n     involved and nearly \\2/3\\ of all fatalities in those crashes \n     are other drivers, passengers, and pedestrians.\n       (3) According to the Insurance Institute for Highway \n     Safety, the chance of a crash by a 16- or 17-year-old driver \n     is doubled if there are 2 peers in the vehicle and quadrupled \n     with 3 or more peers in the vehicle.\n       (4) According to the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration, the cognitive distraction caused by hands-\n     free and hand-held cell phones is significant enough to \n     degrade a driver's performance, particularly teenage drivers \n     between 15 and 20 years of age.\n       (5) Although only 20 percent of driving by teenage drivers \n     occurs at night, more than 50 percent of the motor vehicle \n     crash fatalities involving teenage drivers occur at night.\n       (6) In 1997, the first full year of its graduated driver \n     licensing system, Florida experienced a 9 percent reduction \n     in fatal and injurious crashes among teenage drivers between \n     the ages of 15 and 18, compared with 1995, according to the \n     Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n       (7) The Journal of the American Medical Association reports \n     that crashes involving 16-year-old drivers decreased between \n     1995 and 1999 by 25 percent in Michigan and 27 percent in \n     North Carolina. Comprehensive graduated driver licensing \n     systems were implemented in 1997 in these States.\n       (8) In California, according to the Automobile Club of \n     Southern California, teenage passenger deaths and injuries \n     resulting from crashes involving 16-year-old drivers declined \n     by 40 percent from 1998 to 2000, the first 3 years of \n     California's graduated driver licensing program. The number \n     of at-fault collisions involving 16-year-old drivers \n     decreased by 24 percent during the same period.\n       (9) The National Transportation Safety Board reports that \n     39 States and the District of Columbia have implemented 3-\n     stage graduated driver licensing systems. Many States have \n     not yet implemented these and other basic safety features of \n     graduated driver licensing laws to protect the lives of \n     teenage and novice drivers.\n       (10) A 2001 Harris Poll indicates that--\n       (A) 95 percent of Americans support a requirement of 30 to \n     50 hours of practice driving with an adult;\n       (B) 92 percent of Americans support a 6-month learner's \n     permit period; and\n       (C) 74 percent of Americans support limiting the number of \n     teenage passengers in a car with a teenage driver and \n     supervised driving during high-risk driving periods, such as \n     night.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATE GRADUATED DRIVER LICENSING LAWS.\n\n       (a) Minimum Requirements.--A State is in compliance with \n     this section if the State has a graduated driver licensing \n     law that includes, for novice drivers under the age of 21--\n       (1) a 3-stage licensing process, including a learner's \n     permit stage and an intermediate\n\n[[Page S1436]]\n\n     stage before granting an unrestricted driver's license;\n       (2) a prohibition on nighttime driving during the \n     intermediate stage;\n       (3) a prohibition, during the learner's permit intermediate \n     stages, from operating a motor vehicle with more than 1 non-\n     familial passenger under the age of 21 if there is no \n     licensed driver 21 years of age or older present in the motor \n     vehicle;\n       (4) a prohibition during the learner's permit and \n     intermediate stages, from using a cellular telephone or any \n     communications device in non-emergency situations; and\n       (5) any other requirement that the Secretary of \n     Transportation (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') \n     may require, including--\n       (A) a learner's permit stage of at least 6 months;\n       (B) an intermediate stage of at least 6 months;\n       (C) for novice drivers in the learner's permit stage--\n       (i) a requirement of at least 30 hours of behind-the-wheel \n     training with a licensed driver who is over 21 years of age; \n     and\n       (ii) a requirement that any such driver be accompanied and \n     supervised by a licensed driver 21 years of age or older at \n     all times when such driver is operating a motor vehicle; and\n       (D) a requirement that the grant of full licensure be \n     automatically delayed, in addition to any other penalties \n     imposed by State law for any individual who, while holding a \n     provisional license, convicted of an offense, such as driving \n     while intoxicated, misrepresentation of their true age, \n     reckless driving, unbelted driving, speeding, or other \n     violations, as determined by the Secretary.\n       (b) Rulemaking.--After public notice and comment rulemaking \n     the Secretary shall issue regulations necessary to implement \n     this section.\n\n     SEC. 4. INCENTIVE GRANTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--For each of the first 3 fiscal years \n     beginning after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary shall award a grant to any State in compliance with \n     section 3(a) on or before the first day of that fiscal year \n     that submits an application under subsection (b).\n       (b) Application.--Any State desiring a grant under this \n     section shall submit an application to the Secretary at such \n     time, in such manner, and containing such information as the \n     Secretary may require, including a certification by the \n     governor of the State that the State is in compliance with \n     section 3(a).\n       (c) Grants.--For each fiscal year described in subsection \n     (a), amounts appropriated to carry out this section shall be \n     apportioned to each State in compliance with section 3(a) in \n     an amount determined by multiplying--\n       (1) the amount appropriated to carry out this section for \n     such fiscal year; by\n       (2) the ratio that the amount of funds apportioned to each \n     such State for such fiscal year under section 402 of title \n     23, United States Code, bears to the total amount of funds \n     apportioned to all such States for such fiscal year under \n     such section 402.\n       (d) Use of Funds.--Amounts received under a grant under \n     this section shall be used for--\n       (1) enforcement and providing training regarding the State \n     graduated driver licensing law to law enforcement personnel \n     and other relevant State agency personnel;\n       (2) publishing relevant educational materials that pertain \n     directly or indirectly to the State graduated driver \n     licensing law; and\n       (3) other administrative activities that the Secretary \n     considers relevant to the State graduated driver licensing \n     law.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated out of the Highway Trust Fund (other than \n     the Mass Transit Account) $25,000,000 for each of the fiscal \n     years 2007 through 2009 to carry out this section.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Res. 373\n\n       Whereas 2006 marks the 10th year that the Hotline has been \n     answering calls and saving lives;\n       Whereas, 10 years ago this month, the Hotline answered its \n     first call;\n       Whereas the Hotline is a project of the Texas Council on \n     Family Violence headquartered in Austin, Texas, and provides \n     crisis intervention, information, and referral to victims of \n     domestic violence, their friends, and their families;\n       Whereas the Hotline operates 24 hours a day and 365 days a \n     year;\n       Whereas the Hotline provides its users with anonymous \n     assistance in more than 140 different languages, and a \n     telecommunications device for the deaf, deaf-blind, and hard \n     of hearing;\n       Whereas the Hotline was created by Congress in the Violence \n     Against Women Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-322; 108 Stat. \n     1902);\n       Whereas Congress continues its commitment to families of \n     the United States by strengthening and renewing this \n     important legislation in 2000 and most recently in December, \n     2005;\n       Whereas, since taking its first call in 1996, the Hotline \n     has answered over 1,500,000 calls;\n       Whereas, since its inception, the Hotline has become a \n     vital link to safety for victims of domestic violence and \n     their families;\n       Whereas today, Hotline advocates answer as many as 600 \n     calls per day and an average of 16,500 calls per month from \n     women, men, and children from across the United States;\n       Whereas, as public awareness grows about domestic violence, \n     the Hotline has seen a significant increase in call volume, \n     with calls to the Hotline increasing by 200 percent over the \n     last 10 years;\n       Whereas, because no victim should ever get a busy signal, \n     the Hotline recently unveiled cutting edge technology that \n     will allow more victims to connect to life saving services; \n     and\n       Whereas the 10th anniversary of the Hotline marks a true \n     partnership between the Federal Government and private \n     businesses as each has come together in a collaborative \n     effort to save lives: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate should--\n       (1) continue to support the National Domestic Violence \n     Hotline; and\n       (2) commemorate the 10th anniversary of this critical \n     national resource that saves lives each day.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators \nCornyn, Hutchison, Hatch, Specter, Leahy and Kennedy to submit a \nResolution commemorating the 10th anniversary of a critical American \nresource--the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Operating 24 hours a\n\n[[Page S1437]]\n\nday, 365 days every year, in more than 140 different languages, with a \nTTY line available for the deaf, the Hotline offers confidential and \nanonymous help for victims of domestic violence, their families and \nfriends.\n  Located in Austin, TX, the National Domestic Violence Hotline was \ncreated in the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. As I began to draft \nthat Act over 15 years ago, I held many Congressional hearings and \nlistened to hours of testimony from experts about how to craft an \neffective, coordinated community response to battering. One of the \nrealities that was raised over and over in those hearings was how very \ndifficult it was, and still is, for a battered woman to admit the \nabuse. It was, and still is, very difficult for a battered woman to \nreport the abuse to the police or local prosecutor. In the Violence \nAgainst Women Act we created a safe haven--a place to talk about the \nabuse that offered lots of solutions and total anonymity, the National \nDomestic Violence Hotline.\n  On February 21, 1996, the Hotline answered its first call, and since \nthen has received over 1.5 million calls. Today, Hotline advocates \nanswer as many as 600 calls per day and an average of 16,500 calls per \nmonth from women, men and children across the nation. These are real \nlives that have been dramatically changed by their first call to the \nNational Domestic Violence Hotline. Over 60 percent of the Hotline \ncallers report that this is their very first attempt to deal with the \nabuse--they hadn't told a friend yet, or reported it to the police.\n  Each day Hotline advocates listen and respond to heart-wrenching \npleas for help and information, and each day they offer their callers \nhope and help. I am pleased that the Senate can recognize their hard \nwork with today's Senate Resolution commemorating its 10th anniversary. \nIt is but a small token of this body's gratitude for the National \nDomestic Violence Hotline.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/16/senate-section/article/S1437-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 374--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY, DOCUMENT PRODUCTION, AND \n   LEGAL REPRESENTATION IN UNITED STATES OF AMERICA V.

Res. 378\n\n       Whereas Mucopolysaccharidosis (referred to in this preamble \n     as ``MPS'') is a genetically determined lysosomal storage \n     disorder that renders the human body incapable of producing \n     certain enzymes needed to breakdown complex carbohydrates;\n       Whereas complex carbohydrates are then stored in almost \n     every cell in the body and progressively cause damage to \n     those cells;\n       Whereas the cell damage adversely affects the human body by \n     damaging the heart, respiratory system, bones, internal \n     organs, and central nervous system;\n       Whereas the cellular damage caused by MPS often results in \n     mental retardation, short stature, corneal damage, joint \n     stiffness, loss of mobility, speech and hearing impairment, \n     heart disease, hyperactivity, chronic respiratory problems, \n     and, most importantly, a drastically shortened life span;\n       Whereas the nature of the disorder is usually not apparent \n     at birth;\n       Whereas without treatment, the life expectancy of an \n     individual afflicted with MPS begins to decrease at a very \n     early stage in the life of the individual;\n       Whereas recent research developments have resulted in the \n     creation of limited treatments for some MPS disorders;\n       Whereas promising advancements in the pursuit of treatments \n     for additional MPS disorders are underway;\n       Whereas, despite the creation of newly developed remedies, \n     the blood brain barrier continues to be a significant \n     impediment to effectively treating the brain, thereby \n     preventing the treatment of many of the symptoms of MPS;\n       Whereas treatments for MPS will be greatly enhanced with \n     continued public funding;\n       Whereas the quality of life for individuals afflicted with \n     MPS, and the treatments available to them, will be enhanced \n     through the development of early detection techniques and \n     early intervention;\n       Whereas treatments and research advancements for MPS are \n     limited by a lack of awareness about MPS disorders;\n       Whereas the lack of awareness about MPS disorders extends \n     to those within the medical community;\n       Whereas the damage that is caused by MPS makes it a model \n     for many other degenerative genetic disorders;\n       Whereas the development of effective therapies and a \n     potential cure for MPS disorders can be accomplished by \n     increased awareness, research, data collection, and \n     information distribution;\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution than can raise public \n     awareness about MPS; and\n       Whereas the Senate is also an institution that can assist \n     in encouraging and facilitating increased public and private \n     sector research for early diagnosis and treatments of MPS \n     disorders: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates February 25, 2006, as ``National MPS \n     Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``National MPS \n     Awareness Day''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/16/senate-section/article/S1438-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 379--RECOGNIZING THE CREATION OF THE NASCAR-\n        HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES CONSORTIUM\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Burr, Mrs. \nDole, and Mr. Allen) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 380\n\n       Whereas the first African Americans were brought forcibly \n     to the shores of America as early as the 17th century;\n       Whereas African Americans were enslaved in the United \n     States and subsequently faced the injustices of lynch mobs, \n     segregation, and denial of basic, fundamental rights;\n\n[[Page S1439]]\n\n       Whereas in spite of these injustices, African Americans \n     have made significant contributions to the economic, \n     educational, political, artistic, literary, scientific, and \n     technological advancements of the United States;\n       Whereas in the face of these injustices, United States \n     citizens of all races distinguished themselves in their \n     commitment to the ideals on which the United States was \n     founded, and fought for the rights of African Americans;\n       Whereas the greatness of the United States is reflected in \n     the contributions of African Americans in all walks of life \n     throughout the history of the United States, including \n     through--\n       (1) the writings of Booker T. Washington, James Baldwin, \n     Ralph Ellison, and Alex Haley;\n       (2) the music of Mahalia Jackson, Billie Holiday, and Duke \n     Ellington;\n       (3) the resolve of athletes such as Jackie Robinson, Jesse \n     Owens, and Muhammed Ali;\n       (4) the vision of leaders such as Frederick Douglass, \n     Thurgood Marshall, and Martin Luther King, Jr.; and\n       (5) the bravery of those who stood on the front lines in \n     the battle against oppression, such as Sojourner Truth and \n     Rosa Parks;\n\n       Whereas the United States of America was conceived, as \n     stated in the Declaration of Independence, as a new country \n     dedicated to the proposition that ``all Men are created \n     equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain \n     inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and \n     the Pursuit of Happiness'';\n       Whereas United States citizens of all races demonstrate \n     their commitment to that proposition through actions such as \n     those of--\n       (1) Allan Pinkerton, Thomas Garrett, and the Rev. John \n     Rankin, who served as conductors in the Underground Railroad;\n       (2) Harriet Beecher Stowe, who shined a light on the \n     injustices of slavery;\n       (3) President Abraham Lincoln, who issued the Emancipation \n     Proclamation, and Senator Lyman Trumbull, who introduced the \n     13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States;\n       (4) President Lyndon B.

NORMAN SHUMWAY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 377, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 377) honoring the life of Dr. Norman \n     Shumway and expressing the condolences of the Senate on his \n     passing.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, S. Res. 377 is the resolution honoring the \nlife of Dr. Norman Shumway and expressing condolences on behalf of this \nbody.\n  I wish to pay tribute to a medical pioneer, a man who inaugurated a \nnew era of medicine, my mentor in surgery and friend. Sadly, Dr. \nShumway passed away late last week at the age of 83. He left behind a \nlegacy as an inspirational leader, a healer, a guiding spirit who made \nmy own professional field of heart transplants a reality. When all \nthose around him said it was impossible, said it was a pipe dream, said \nit couldn't be done, his vision and his determination and his \nunrelenting commitment and pioneer attitude has saved thousands and \nthousands of lives.\n  I had the distinct honor of studying under the tutelage of Dr. \nShumway at Stanford University Medical Center in the early 1980s. I \nwitnessed his rare gifts. Those gifts included a blend of long-term \nthinking, a love of medicine and healing, and a true pioneering spirit \nthat inspired and attracted like-minded individuals from across the \ncountry and, indeed, around the world.\n  He was fond of remarking that his role as a surgeon was comparable to \nthat of being the world's greatest first surgical assistant in the \noperating room. When you are treating a patient, when you are operating \non a patient, the surgeon stands on one side of the table and the first \nassistant across the way on the other side. It is that image of Dr. \nShumway, on the other side, instructing, teaching, cultivating that \nexpertise in the young surgeon, that stands out most vividly in my \nmind, the constant cajoling and instructing in very gentle, humble \nways, the certainty of that guiding hand which would reach over if \nthere was a slightly wrong move or a hesitant move that was made. I \nthink his comment about being the world's greatest first assistant \nreflects that humility but also that comfort level and that competence \nthat, coupled with his pioneering spirit, has proved to be \nrevolutionary in the field of medicine and surgery. Now his humble, yet \nvisionary, work is reflected in surgical programs all over the world \nbecause he was that first assistant, as he instructed and taught and \ninspired. Those surgeons he trained are now literally populating \nacademic and clinical programs all over this country and indeed \nthroughout the world. He loved his role as healer, and he cherished the \nopportunity not only to operate and to innovative but to inspire and to \nplant seeds, all a part of his mode of inspirational teaching.\n  I have worked with a lot of cardiac surgeons, heart surgeons, in \nprograms around the world, including Boston, MA, over in England, out \non the west coast, down in the South at Vanderbilt and, more than \nanybody I interacted with over the 20 years I have spent in medicine, \nDr. Shumway was the one, was the single one, who had the broadest, as \nwell as the deepest, influence because of his unparalleled commitment \nto teaching in an inspirational way that encouraged others to go out \nand teach and to spread the word and to spread the technique and to \nspread what he indeed pioneered: heart transplantation, lung \ntransplantation, heart-lung transplantation.\n  He was a brilliant man, a pioneering spirit. Yet he was always \naccessible. He was always there on rounds. He believed in the team \napproach, of relying on the technician running the heart-lung machine, \nrelying on the nurses who, with him, made rounds each morning and each \nevening to see his patients.\n  His teachings were filled with turns of phrases and catchy one-liners \nand, in my own mind, as I stand here and recall listening to him, he \nwould say things such as: Never be afraid to double dribble. I think \nabout it a lot because what he was saying was if that first stitch you \nare about ready to put in isn't perfect, put in another stitch; don't \nbe so bold, don't be so confident,\n\n[[Page S1446]]\n\ndon't be so cocky, where if you have a question you don't make \nabsolutely sure that something is perfect. Never be afraid to double \ndribble.\n  Dr. Shumway looked for somebody who had the passion for healing, and \nhe would encourage their active pursuits. It is almost as if he had a \nsixth sense, both for inspiration but also in recognizing in others an \nability or a desire to be innovative, to create, to think outside of \nthe box in order to benefit humanity.\n  He considered it part of his mission to nurture and cultivate his \ntrainees' ambition and their drive and their desire. It didn't matter \nwhat your age was. It didn't matter what schools you had gone to. It \ndidn't matter whether you were a first-year resident, an intern, or a \nfifth-year resident; if you had a good idea, if you had a creative \nidea, he would nurture it and he would put an environment around you to \nallow that idea to grow, to prove itself, to go down in defeat. He \nwould even set up a laboratory around an intern or a first-year \nresident who had a creative idea that he thought just may work.\n  It was a very different mentality than most people in his field of \nsurgery in medicine. The traditional medical establishment, as I \nmentioned earlier, thought heart transplantation could never be done. \nYet that sort of ``a little bit out of the box'' thinking, that \npioneering spirit, did inspire some of the great innovations in \nmedicine in the 20th century: Heart transplants, which he is known for, \nwith the first successful heart transplant in our country--it came at \nthe era I was there--the combined heart-lung transplant, where \nessentially you remove all of the organs from the top of the chest down \nto the diaphragm, taking that heart-lung out to transplant and repair \nand to have it replaced to give life to individuals with otherwise \nfatal diseases; the early work with left ventricular assist devices; \nthe invention of the cardiac biopsy, where the catheter is inserted \nthrough the neck and you can actually sample pieces of the heart with a \ntechnique that takes literally about 2 or 3 minutes but allows you to \ndetermine whether a patient is rejecting that heart or has inflammation \nof that heart; the immunosuppressive protocols which made heart \ntransplantation possible. These were all pioneering fields he jumped \ninto, that he created, that he explored, and he did so with a \ndisciplined approach, a scientific approach, an approach characterized \nby perseverance over a long period of time, in spite of a lot of people \nquestioning and putting forth doubts as he went forward.\n  In talking to a number of people who asked about this man and what \nhis contributions have been, it has come to my attention, as I reflect \nupon it, that he has also encouraged people to go out and explore new \nfields. Some of the cardiac surgeons he trained--one went into public \nservice for a period of time, but others went on to become lawyers, to \nbecome heads of the great universities of the country and, indeed of \nthe world. Given the unique type of drive that inspired a person to \nstudy with Dr. Shumway, it is probably not all that unexpected because \nhe did encourage people to figure out what their strengths were and how \nthey could better humanity--whether it is the scientist in the \nlaboratory, whether it is the clinical surgeon, whether it is the \nacademic surgeon, whether it is the lawyer who ultimately best \nunderstood the delivery of health care and went off to participate in \nlegal aspects of health care today.\n  He also encouraged people to take risks, and to take risks in a very \npositive way, because if people did not work outside of their comfort \nzone he felt progress could never be made. But encouraging people to \ntake those risks, he did so with science, with a strong foundation, \nwith a good understanding of what limitations are, with a strong \nunderstanding of cost and risk and benefits. But that element of risk \ntaking, calculated risk taking, is a legacy he has left many of us, and \nmany of the people who have trained with him--thinking and saying and \nbelieving that is the only way progress in society takes place.\n  Dr. Shumway was a legend in his field and his presence will be sorely \nmissed. As I look back, I would never have had that blessing, and it is \na blessing, to be able to transplant the human heart and I would have \nnever transplanted a human heart if I had not had the opportunity to \nstudy under Dr. Norman Shumway. I would have never in my life been able \nto transplant the human lung, to give life to people who have an \notherwise fatal disease, if I had not trained with and studied under \nDr. Norman Shumway. I would have never put in any left ventricular \nassist devices for struggling, ailing hearts when people have had \nmassive heart attacks. I would have never been able to do neonatal \ntransplants on little infants. I mention those only because without \nthat man and his vision, his philosophy of conceiving something and \nbelieving in it and doing it, it would have affected my life greatly. \nIndeed, in all likelihood I would not be on the floor of the Senate \ntoday if I had not had that exposure to Dr. Norman Shumway.\n  Having had the honor of working with him, he was an inspirational \nleader. He was the guiding light who seemed to be able to pull it all \ntogether with his vision and with his determination and his dedication. \nHe has affected the lives of thousands and indeed hundreds of thousands \nof people through his teaching and through his training around the \nworld.\n  He was my mentor, he was a great surgeon and a true friend, and \nsomeone I will miss dearly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 378\n\n       Whereas Mucopolysaccharidosis (referred to in this preamble \n     as ``MPS'') is a genetically determined lysosomal storage \n     disorder that renders the human body incapable of producing \n     certain enzymes needed to breakdown complex carbohydrates;\n       Whereas complex carbohydrates are then stored in almost \n     every cell in the body and progressively cause damage to \n     those cells;\n       Whereas the cell damage adversely affects the human body by \n     damaging the heart, respiratory system, bones, internal \n     organs, and central nervous system;\n       Whereas the cellular damage caused by MPS often results in \n     mental retardation, short stature, corneal damage, joint \n     stiffness, loss of mobility, speech and hearing impairment, \n     heart disease, hyperactivity, chronic respiratory problems, \n     and, most importantly, a drastically shortened life span;\n       Whereas the nature of the disorder is usually not apparent \n     at birth;\n       Whereas without treatment, the life expectancy of an \n     individual afflicted with MPS begins to decrease at a very \n     early stage in the life of the individual;\n       Whereas recent research developments have resulted in the \n     creation of limited treatments for some MPS disorders;\n       Whereas promising advancements in the pursuit of treatments \n     for additional MPS disorders are underway;\n       Whereas, despite the creation of newly developed remedies, \n     the blood brain barrier continues to be a significant \n     impediment to effectively treating the brain, thereby \n     preventing the treatment of many of the symptoms of MPS;\n       Whereas treatments for MPS will be greatly enhanced with \n     continued public funding;\n       Whereas the quality of life for individuals afflicted with \n     MPS, and the treatments available to them, will be enhanced \n     through the development of early detection techniques and \n     early intervention;\n       Whereas treatments and research advancements for MPS are \n     limited by a lack of awareness about MPS disorders;\n       Whereas the lack of awareness about MPS disorders extends \n     to those within the medical community;\n       Whereas the damage that is caused by MPS makes it a model \n     for many other degenerative genetic disorders;\n       Whereas the development of effective therapies and a \n     potential cure for MPS disorders can be accomplished by \n     increased awareness, research, data collection, and \n     information distribution;\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution than can raise public \n     awareness about MPS; and\n       Whereas the Senate is also an institution that can assist \n     in encouraging and facilitating increased public and private \n     sector research for early diagnosis and treatments of MPS \n     disorders: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates February 25, 2006, as ``National MPS \n     Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``National MPS \n     Awareness Day''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/16/senate-section/article/S1447-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NASCAR-HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES CONSORTIUM\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 380\n\n       Whereas the first African Americans were brought forcibly \n     to the shores of America as early as the 17th century;\n       Whereas African Americans were enslaved in the United \n     States and subsequently faced the injustices of lynch mobs, \n     segregation, and denial of basic, fundamental rights;\n       Whereas in spite of these injustices, African Americans \n     have made significant contributions to the economic, \n     educational, political, artistic, literary, scientific, and \n     technological advancements of the United States;\n       Whereas in the face of these injustices, United States \n     citizens of all races distinguished themselves in their \n     commitment to the ideals on which the United States was \n     founded, and fought for the rights of African Americans;\n\n[[Page S1448]]\n\n       Whereas the greatness of the United States is reflected in \n     the contributions of African Americans in all walks of life \n     throughout the history of the United States, including \n     through--\n       (1) the writings of Booker T. Washington, James Baldwin, \n     Ralph Ellison, and Alex Haley;\n       (2) the music of Mahalia Jackson, Billie Holiday, and Duke \n     Ellington;\n       (3) the resolve of athletes such as Jackie Robinson, Jesse \n     Owens, and Muhammed Ali;\n       (4) the vision of leaders such as Frederick Douglass, \n     Thurgood Marshall, and Martin Luther King, Jr.; and\n       (5) the bravery of those who stood on the front lines in \n     the battle against oppression, such as Sojourner Truth and \n     Rosa Parks;\n       Whereas the United States of America was conceived, as \n     stated in the Declaration of Independence, as a new country \n     dedicated to the proposition that ``all Men are created \n     equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain \n     inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and \n     the Pursuit of Happiness'';\n       Whereas United States citizens of all races demonstrate \n     their commitment to that proposition through actions such as \n     those of--\n       (1) Allan Pinkerton, Thomas Garrett, and the Rev. John \n     Rankin, who served as conductors in the Underground Railroad;\n       (2) Harriet Beecher Stowe, who shined a light on the \n     injustices of slavery;\n       (3) President Abraham Lincoln, who issued the Emancipation \n     Proclamation, and Senator Lyman Trumbull, who introduced the \n     13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States;\n       (4) President Lyndon B. Johnson, Chief Justice Earl Warren, \n     Senator Mike Mansfield, and Senator Hubert Humphrey, who \n     fought to end segregation and the denial of civil rights to \n     African Americans; and\n       (5) Americans of all races who marched side-by-side with \n     African Americans during the civil rights movement;\n       Whereas, since its founding, the United States has been an \n     imperfect work in making progress towards those noble goals;\n       Whereas the history of the United States is the story of a \n     people regularly affirming high ideals, striving to reach \n     them but often failing, and then struggling to come to terms \n     with the disappointment of that failure before recommitting \n     themselves to trying again;\n       Whereas, from the beginning of our Nation, the most \n     conspicuous and persistent failure of United States citizens \n     to reach those noble goals has been the enslavement of \n     African Americans and the resulting racism;\n       Whereas the crime of lynching succeeded slavery as the \n     ultimate expression of racism in the United States following \n     Reconstruction;\n       Whereas the Federal Government failed to put an end to \n     slavery until the ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865, \n     repeatedly failed to enact a Federal anti-lynching law, and \n     still struggles to deal with the evils of racism; and\n       Whereas the fact that 61 percent of African American 4th \n     graders read at a below basic level and only 16 percent of \n     native born African Americans have earned a Bachelor's \n     degree, 50 percent of all new HIV cases are reported in \n     African Americans, and the leading cause of death for African \n     American males ages 15 to 34 is homicide, demonstrates that \n     the United States continues to struggle to reach the high \n     ideal of equal opportunity for all citizens of the United \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges the tragedies of slavery, lynching, and \n     segregation, and condemns them as an infringement on human \n     liberty and equal opportunity so that they will stand forever \n     as a reminder of what can happen when the citizens of the \n     United States fail to live up to their noble goals;\n       (2) honors those United States citizens who--\n       (A) risked their lives during the time of slavery, \n     lynching, and segregation in the Underground Railroad and in \n     other efforts to assist fugitive slaves and other African \n     Americans who might have been targets and victims of lynch \n     mobs; and\n       (B) those who have stood beside African Americans in the \n     fight for equal opportunity that continues to this day;\n       (3) reaffirms its commitment to the founding principles of \n     the United States of America that ``all Men are created \n     equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain \n     inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and \n     the Pursuit of Happiness'';\n       (4) commits itself to addressing those situations in which \n     the African American community struggles with disparities in \n     education, health care, and other areas where the Federal \n     Government can help improve conditions for all citizens of \n     the United States; and\n       (5) calls on the citizens of the United States to observe \n     Black History Month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, \n     and activities.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
