If Senators have amendments to the \nbill, they should be contacting Senator Stevens or Senator Inouye at \nthis time. If we have a full day today and into the evening, there is \nno reason we can't complete this bill by Thursday night.\n  It is also my intention to move today to proceed to the death tax, \nminimum wage, and extenders package. There is an objection to moving \nforward on that bill, and therefore I will be filing a cloture motion \non the motion to proceed to that bill. We will still be able to \ncontinue our work on the Defense bill, as the vote on invoking cloture \non the motion to proceed will not likely occur until Friday morning; \ntherefore, there will be votes today as Chairman Stevens makes progress \non the Defense appropriations bill.\n  I hope we can finish our work this week or this weekend, and if we \nwork together over the next couple of days, we can complete a number of \nimportant legislative matters before we leave.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require plans to procure medical countermeasures for \n  treating forward deployed members of the Armed Forces against acute \n                radiation syndrome and similar threats)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. __.

Mr. President, last evening, on behalf of myself and the \nSenator from Hawaii, I submitted an amendment and the Senate agreed to \nthe amendment dealing with additional funding on an emergency basis for \nthe Department of Defense. That was offered after consultation with the \nDepartment of Defense and also the Office of Management and Budget. It \nconsiders a series of things, some of which would be covered by other \namendments which I understand other Members have.\n  I see Senator Reed is here now.\n  The amendment was intended to cover a whole series of issues.\n  I apologize to the Senator from Rhode Island. I know he wishes to \noffer an amendment.\n  I must say that these funds are duplicative, however, and we would \nhave to examine each amendment to see what we will do with it. But we \nresponded to the request of the Department of Defense and the OMB to \nprovide additional emergency money for 2008 so-called reset programs. I \nwill be happy to discuss that with anyone.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, while I certainly appreciate the efforts \nlast evening of Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye to add roughly $13 \nbillion to this appropriations bill for the readiness of the U.S. Army \nand the Marine Corps, it is emergency spending, but it should come as \nno surprise that it is necessary.\n  What I find surprising is that apparently the requests by the \nDepartment of the Army, the Department of Defense, and also the OMB \nwere turned down until it became obvious--and publicly obvious--that \nthe readiness condition of the Army and the Marine Corps is the worst \nit has been in several decades. The principle is the lack of repaired, \nrehabilitated, and in certain cases replaced equipment. We are in a \ndifficult situation with threats across the globe, with an Army that is \nheavily committed and a Marine Corps that is heavily committed to both \nIraq and Afghanistan, and we are in a situation now in which our \nreadiness is the worst it has been in three decades. This is a \nsituation which requires not only the remedy of money, but it requires \naccountability.\n  How did the Department of Defense and this administration allow our \nmilitary forces to become so degraded? In the judgment of many people, \nincluding former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry, myself, and others, \ntwo-thirds of the Army's operating force, Active and Reserve is now \nreporting in as unready. There is not a single non-deployed Army \nbrigade combat team in the United States that is ready to deploy. Our \nArmy currently has no ready strategic reserve. Not since the Vietnam \nera and its aftermath has the Army's readiness been so degraded.\n  How did that happen? It is not a surprise. Months ago, in February, I \ncame to this Chamber and proposed an amendment to the tax \nreconciliation bill which would provide a fund of $50 billion to \nprovide for the reset recapitalization of Army and Marine equipment. I \nwas offsetting that, as I think it is appropriate to do, with the upper \nincome tax breaks that were being voted on in that bill. My measure \ndidn't survive conference, but the tax cuts did. I believe that is an \nunfortunate paradigm of what is happening here too often.\n  We are sending soldiers and marines in harm's way, and we are not \nrepairing their equipment. We don't have time to wait until it is too \nlate--until the emergency is upon us. But we have plenty of time to \ndebate tax cuts and estate tax reform.\n  I can tell you that I served, as so many others did, and in fact, we \nare privileged to have the chairman and ranking member of this \ncommittee as distinguished veterans of the Army Air Corps and U.S. \nArmy. I don't know many soldiers who qualify for the estate tax, but \nevery soldier needs adequate, decent equipment to do their job. Their \nlives depend upon it.\n  Yesterday Lieutenant General Blum, chief of the National Guard \nBureau, stated:\n\n       I am further behind or in more dire situation than the \n     Active Army.\n\n  This is the Reserve National Guard forces. The National Guard is \ncharged not only with assisting in operations such as Enduring Freedom \nand Iraqi Freedom, they are the first line of protection at home. They \nare the first responders in a hurricane situation. They are in worse \nshape than our active forces.\n  At the end of June--again, several weeks ago--at a hearing before the \nHouse of Representatives, Congressman Ike Skelton asked the Chief of \nStaff of the Army:\n\n       Are you comfortable with the readiness level for the non-\n     deployed units that are in the continental United States?\n\n  General Schoomaker replied: No. The Chief of Staff of the United \nStates Army says in a public hearing he is not comfortable with the \nreadiness condition of our forces in the United States. That is a \nstunning admission.\n  Senator Dodd and I were ready to propose an amendment to this Defense \nbill, along with Senators Lautenberg, Mikulski, Lieberman, and many \nothers, to try to rectify this. We would offer $10.2 billion in \nemergency spending. I not only support but commend the leadership of \nthis committee, Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye, proposing $13.1 \nbillion. The money is necessary. I concur in their judgment and their \naction.\n  This is not a situation where suddenly yesterday someone jumped up \nand said, we need some money. This is a situation that has been \nrecognized for months. Not only was nothing done, but the budget sent \nhere by the White House was inadequate and they knew it At a time of \nwar when soldiers are committed, at a time of contest and conflict \naround the globe when we have to respond to threats, they lowballed \nmoney for the Army and the Marine Corps. We can give them all the money \nwe want, but we need a little accountability, also. We didn't reach \nthis position overnight. This was not a midnight discovery. This is \nyears in the making.\n\n  The Army told those who would listen that for every year of intense \noperations in Afghanistan and Iraq, they need $12 billion for reset. \nLast year we only provided a fraction of that, so this year the bill \nwas $17 billion. Some of those funds cannot be used in this year so it \nwill be pushed forward a bit, but basically we know what is happening. \nIt will continue to happen every year. Twelve billion baseline for \nreset. If we do not make that number, it is rolled over to next year. \nThis is not going to be a one-time affair. It is an emergency, but it \nis a chronic emergency. We have to understand the Army will need \nanother $12 billion and the Marine Corps will need another $12 billion \nnext year and the next year, as long as we are committed. It is the \nreal course of\n\n[[Page S8563]]\n\nIraq, the course that seldom is found in speeches about ``staying the \ncourse,'' or ``when they stand up, we will stand down.'' We have to pay \nthose costs.\n  Last October, GAO released a report on military readiness. It \nassessed the state of 30 pieces of equipment, predominantly tanks, \nvehicles, helicopters, and aircraft. They made several disturbing \noperation observations last October:\n\n       GAO's analysis showed reported readiness rates declined \n     between fiscal years 1999 and 2004 for most of these items. \n     The decline in readiness, which occurred more markedly in \n     fiscal years 2003 and 2004, generally resulted from, 1, the \n     continued high use of equipment to support current operations \n     and 2, maintenance issues caused by the advancing ages and \n     complexity of the systems. Key equipment items--such as Army \n     and Marine Corps trucks, combat vehicles, and rotary wing \n     aircraft--have been used well beyond normal peacetime use \n     during deployments in support of operations in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan.\n\n  Let me relate a story. I was in Fallujah about 3 weeks ago with the \n1st Marine Expeditionary Force. They are doing a superb job, as all our \nforces are. We asked questions about the state of the helicopters. They \ntold us their helicopters are flying 200 percent more than in \npeacetime. They told us this before we got on the helicopters. We got \non anyway because the helicopters are being maintained. But it costs \nmoney to maintain those helicopters. It costs money to repair those \nhelicopters. If you fly any helicopter, fixed-wing aircraft, or you \ndrive any military vehicle 200 percent more than its normal allocation, \nthey wear out very quickly. That is what is happening.\n  A report of the GAO went on to say:\n\n       Until the DOD ensures that condition issues for key \n     equipment are addressed, DOD risks a continued decline in \n     readiness trends, which could threaten its ability to \n     continue meeting mission requirements. The military services \n     have not fully identified near and long-term program \n     strategies and funding plans to ensure that all the 30 \n     selected equipment items can meet defense requirements.\n\n  Another GAO report released last October assessed the readiness of \nthe Army National Guard. It found:\n\n       To meet the demand for certain types of equipment for \n     continuing operations, the Army has required the Army \n     National Guard units to leave behind many items for use by \n     follow-on forces. The Army Guard estimates that since 2003 it \n     has left more than 64,000 items, valued at more than $1.2 \n     billion, overseas to support operations. Without a completed \n     and implemented plan to replace all Guard equipment left \n     overseas, Army Guard units will likely face growing equipment \n     shortages and challenges in regaining readiness for future \n     missions.\n\n  Again, this is the Army National Guard. These are the people we \nexpect in the next few weeks to respond to a hurricane if it strikes \nthe gulf coast, the Atlantic coast. These are the folks we expect to \nrespond to earthquakes and to other problems any place in this country. \nThey have left a great deal of their equipment overseas. They need \nhelp, also.\n  In April of this year, still 3 months before the markup of this \nDefense appropriations bill, the Lexington Institute and the Center for \nAmerican Progress jointly released the report called ``Army Equipment \nAfter Iraq.'' This report clearly stated:\n\n       High utilization rates and harsh conditions have greatly \n     accelerated the aging of equipment. A significant amount of \n     equipment is being destroyed due to both combat losses and \n     the wear associated with constant use. Equipment readiness in \n     deployed units has shown a gradual erosion as the service \n     struggles to keep up with maintenance and replacement needs. \n     Readiness in nondeployed units has plummeted as equipment is \n     transferred to deploying units or left behind when troops \n     depart Iraq.\n\n  Again, warning bells were sounded, but the administration was deaf. \nThe Army knew the situation was growing increasingly difficult--indeed, \nperilous. They always knew that there would be a reset bill. Last \nNovember, as I suggested, they said it would cost $12 billion a year \nfor each year of ongoing operations until 2 years after that. The \nMarines estimated at that time that they needed $11.7 billion over a 5-\nyear-period for reset. These figures were confirmed by our March GAO \nreport, entitled ``Preliminary Observations on Equipment Reset \nChallenges and Issues for the Army and the Marine Corps.'' Again, these \npleas for help were ignored.\n  However, when the Army and Marine Corps submitted their reset needs \nto the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Office of the \nManagement and Budget, these requirements, the requirements of the \ncommanders in the field, were slashed. The Army's request was \nreportedly cut by $4.9 billion and the commanders in the field were not \nable to submit a rebuttal argument as they have in \nothe administrations. Our military leaders were told what they would \nget by the budget experts and that was the end of the discussion until \nit became so painfully obvious and publicly obvious that we are not \nready to deploy significant forces that are here in the United States.\n\n  In February, the President's budget request was submitted to \nCongress. The shortfall for reset was obvious. Again, I recognized \nthis, as others did. That is why in February I submitted my amendment \nto the reconciliation bill to provide a fund of $50 billion over the \nnext several years so we could deal with this readiness problem, not \nthrough emergency spending but through an offset where we would use \nproposed tax cuts for the very wealthiest Americans to buy equipment \nfor our soldiers and marines in the field. This amendment was rejected \nand the tax cuts went through. The equipment remained unrepaired.\n  As early as 2005, information on the state of Army and Marine Corps \nreadiness was readily available for all who were willing to pay \nattention. Billions of dollars would be needed to solve this problem. \nNow here we are in August of 2006. We are debating the fiscal year 2007 \nDefense appropriations bill and until last night there was only $2.5 \nbillion in this bill for the Army for their reset needs.\n  Again, we all must commend and thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor taking the action they did last night. But we have to ask serious \nquestions about an administration that would allow this situation to \ndevelop, that would tell commanders that they were not going to get the \nmoney they needed to provide for the equipment and troops in the field.\n  This administration has tried to run a serious war on the cheap. They \nhave tried gimmicks. They have hidden costs. They have failed to admit \nstaggering costs that are involved already. It goes not only to the \nequipment, but having just returned from Iraq, having observed \nreconstruction that has produced very little after $30 billion, having \nlistened to Prime Minister Maliki in his speech ask for further \nreconstruction aid, if we are ever going to make a difference there, we \nwould have to complement our military effort with renewed \nreconstruction. That is a multibillion dollar proposition. Where are we \ngoing to get the money?\n  I am pleased the Army and Marine Corps will receive this $13.1 \nbillion, but that is just an installment payment. As long as we are \ncommitted, we will continue to see this type of expenditure go on and \non and on. We have to provide for it, not on an emergency basis, not \nsuddenly with the expression of surprise. We have to understand this \nwill happen again and again and again. Anyone who goes to Iraq or \nAfghanistan, anyone who has the privilege of being with soldiers, \nmarines, sailors, and airmen, knows the extraordinary sacrifices they \nmake. Anyone who has ever been around a military unit knows one of the \nquickest ways to undermine morale, undermine the spirit of these \ntroops, is to give them lousy equipment and not repair their equipment. \nThey know their life depends upon the equipment. They also know that it \nis not the speeches, not the parades, not the flag pins in the lapel \nthat say what you mean about troops; you have to give them what they \nneed to fight. Last evening, we did that.\n  This administration has to be accountable. I don't understand how we \ncan have both an administration and a Secretary of Defense who would \nsee the readiness numbers that are presented today and deny money, \nforcing Congress to put it in. There is a gross lack of accountability \nbordering on dereliction.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. I yield.\n  Mr. DODD. I commend my colleague from Rhode Island for raising this \nissue, particularly the point he raised about how long we have known \nabout this.\n  I commend to my colleagues a report dated March 28 of this year, Army \nEquipment RESET Update to HAC-D.\n  I further ask my colleague, just to make the point, this has been \nknown for some time. The fact that the\n\n[[Page S8564]]\n\nCommander in Chief did not send up a budget, including the necessary \nresources knowing exactly what my colleague from Rhode Island has \ndescribed, is troublesome. I commend him in joining our colleagues who \noffered the amendment last evening, although I would still suggest we \nare still in excess of $6 billion short of what our uniformed services \nare telling us they need.\n  It might be appropriate here to have an amendment that would include \na soft mark that would allow the military, if they are able to do it, \nhave the resource capability to fill in the gaps that are necessary. \nThe amount we are talking about here, based on what we presently know, \nwould allow them to meet what they can do with the money that has been \nappropriated, yet there is a significant shortfall still, but to make \nsure the units are going to be combat ready. Lord forbid they are \ncalled upon to respond to a crisis in the Korean Peninsula or \nelsewhere.\n  I appreciate the comments of my colleague from Rhode Island. I will \nhave some comments myself, and then discuss the possibility of an \namendment that might require the soft mark that would not require the \nspending to occur, but if the military could use those resources, we \nought not to deprive them of the cash they need if the units are \nready. I do not know if he has any additional comments to make.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. He has been \nextraordinarily active in ensuring us the resources are available for \nour military forces. I would be happy to explore with him the \npossibility of additional funding if it is necessary.\n  Again, let me thank Senator Dodd. We traveled together in October of \nlast year to Iraq and saw the great service that is being rendered by \nour soldiers and the need for the equipment, the honest need. But I \nwill, at this juncture, Mr. President, yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague from \nConnecticut in commending our leader from Rhode Island for the role he \nhas played in bringing this to our attention. The men and women of the \nArmy and the Marines are fortunate to have the Senator looking after \ntheir interests. I thank him very much.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we join the Senator from Rhode Island, \nMr. Reed, with his distinguished military career, who has raised this \nissue. Some time ago, we had reports on this matter of the reset \nfunding and the goal of about $17 billion for that purpose.\n  I personally visited with Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary \nGordan England and Admiral Giambastiani about this and asked they check \nhow much was needed for this reset operation and urged them to deal \nwith the Office of Management and Budget so we would not have any \nproblem over the total amount.\n  If you examine the bill, as we have it now, with the moneys we added \nlast night, and the money that is already in the bridge account, there \nis the $17 billion there that was requested by the military.\n  In my trips to Iraq, I visited some of the places where they are up-\narmoring large trucks and up-armoring some of the humvees and saw some \nof the activities they were pursuing in order to get better armor on \nsome of the helicopters.\n  All of this is part of the process, and it is not something new. \nAfter the Persian Gulf war we had two separate requests for funds for \nthe reset activities. And ``reset'' is a word of art in the military; \nthat is, to literally reset the force and the equipment so it is usable \nand ready in the event of another operation, should that be necessary.\n  But again, we had several sums suggested. And when we went to the OMB \nand to the Department, they came back with the figures we offered the \nSenate last night on a bipartisan basis. I think they are sufficient at \nthis time to carry us through. We will have a supplemental in the \nspring. We all know that. The bridge is to carry us forward through the \nperiod until we look at what might be the requirements for the \noperations going on in some 120 countries. As I said yesterday, in \nterms of our people in uniform, they are in 120 countries as we speak. \nSo this is an enormous problem to assure that the equipment and all of \nthe systems are brought up to absolute the best state possible.\n  But again, Senator Reed has put forth his comments about this \nnecessity from his military background. We appreciate that, and we \nagree with him. We agreed with him, and, as a matter of fact, the \nmoneys we added last night were in addition to what the Senator was \nseeking because they cover some other activities beyond what he was \ntalking about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes, if I can, and \nspeak on similar subject matter. I appreciate the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska and my great friend from Hawaii who \nbrings a wealth of knowledge and information, including his personal \nexperiences, of the importance of adequate equipment.\n  America's soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are courageously \nwaging wars on two fronts against terrorism and militant insurgents, \nwith 19,000 U.S. servicemembers still engaged in combat in Afghanistan \nand 132,000 of our troops in uniform in Iraq, as we speak this morning \non the floor of the Senate.\n  No other military service bears the brunt of these military \noperations more than the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. And no other \nAmericans are sacrificing more in these wars than the soldiers, \nmarines, and their families involved in these conflicts.\n  It is therefore critically important, as Senator Reed from Rhode \nIsland has pointed out, and my colleagues on the floor--Senator Inouye \nand Senator Stevens--that we pay particular attention to their \nuniformed leadership when these leaders speak out about equipment \nshortfalls that they warn could jeopardize our missions and our \nmilitary's overall combat readiness.\n  When the U.S. Army's Chief of Staff repeatedly sounds the alarm in \ntestimony before Congress--repeatedly--that the budgets drawn up by the \ncivilian leaders at the Pentagon and the White House have left them \nwith a $17 billion shortfall in vehicles and equipment they need, then \nwe should take heed and listen to what they are saying.\n  And when our Army and Marine Corps' top leaders are telling us such \nshortfalls are so severe that major portions of their forces are \nunprepared for combat duty, then I think we need to take action.\n  I am deeply concerned, as I think others are, that we are not meeting \nour obligations to these men and women in uniform. Amendments may serve \nas a first step toward addressing the needs of our soldiers and \nmarines. Out of the $17 billion identified by the Army Chief of Staff \nthat is needed to address equipment shortfalls, the amendment that was \nadopted last evening would add $7.8 billion on top of the $2.5 billion \nthat is also included in the underlying bill, and another $5.3 billion \nfor the Marine Corps.\n  Nonetheless, I remain concerned, as I hope my colleagues are as well, \nthat there remains almost a $7 billion shortfall of what we are being \ntold by the uniformed military leaders we need to address the Army's \noutstanding requirements, as expressed by GEN Pete Schoomaker, the \nArmy's top general.\n  As the Senator from Rhode Island has pointed out, these shortfalls \nhave been known for months. The report that I included in the Record a \nmoment ago is dated March of this year. They were not suddenly \ndiscovered last evening or in the last few days. I have a slide \npresentation that the Army provided to the House Appropriations \nCommittee on March 28 of this year that specifically identifies all of \nthese shortfalls without exception. And yet, despite that briefing in \nMarch, the administration and Congress did little or nothing about it.\n  Today, I do not think we can stand by--in the remaining days of this \nCongress--and allow this Congress to proceed further without addressing \nour Nation's major and most pressing needs, particularly as our men and \nwomen in uniform continue to defend America in combat operations each \nand every day.\n  We are not talking about arbitrary budget numbers that we pulled out \nof\n\n[[Page S8565]]\n\nthin air. These are very specific allocations requested by our top \nleaders in uniform--leaders such as General Schoomaker and his \ndeputies: LTG James Lovelace and LTG David Melcher. They have testified \nrepeatedly--repeatedly--that the Bush administration has once again \nproposed a Defense budget that falls far short of what our troops need.\n  As far as this Senator is concerned, the days of sort of nickel and \ndimming our national defense needs should be over when it comes to \nthese soldiers in uniform. We can no longer afford to continue down the \npath the Bush administration has brought us.\n  Regrettably, this is not the first time we have had to address the \nadministration's poor budget planning for this war. But I hope it might \nbe the last. I have come to the floor to try to address, in the past, \nsome lacking resources for our military's essential equipment needs \nfrom the very first year of this conflict.\n  In 2003, the Army identified $322 million in shortfalls in critical \nhealth and safety gear--ranging from body armor, camelback hydration \nsystems, and combat helmets, to equipment for deactivating high \nexplosives--all of them are listed as priorities that the Rumsfeld \nPentagon and Bush administration failed to provide in their initial \nbudgets.\n  I offered an amendment, in 2003, to the emergency appropriations bill \nto resolve those problems. Unfortunately, the administration opposed \nthis legislation, and the amendment was defeated, despite the fact that \nour top uniformed military leaders were asking otherwise.\n  In 2004, we tried a different approach, in an amendment I offered \nrequiring the Department of Defense to reimburse military personnel who \nbought equipment for their military service in Iraq and Afghanistan \nthat the Rumsfeld Pentagon had failed to provide. This time, despite \nardent objections from the Secretary of Defense, Congress approved the \nlegislation. And in October 2004, the President signed that bill--the \nlarger bill which included those amendments--into law.\n  We approved similar legislation last year because the Pentagon did \nnot act on them, despite the fact that Congress had voted \noverwhelmingly in support of those provisions and the President signed \nthem into law. And on the very day I offered a new amendment, I \nreceived a call from the Pentagon saying on that day--a year later--\nthey were beginning to implement the legislation as required under law.\n  This year, the difficulties associated with equipment shortfalls pose \na far more serious problem. The ones I identified earlier, which my \ncolleagues will recall--having servicemen stand up and admit they were \nrummaging--rummaging--through garbage dumps in Baghdad to provide \nequipment to up-armor their humvees and other equipment because they \nwere not getting it from the Pentagon. These were not some dissidents, \nsome activists outside complaining. These were our men and women in \nuniform telling us what they had to do in a theater of war to protect \nthemselves because they were not getting it from the Pentagon\n  Well, today the problems are more serious. The ones that Senator Reed \nhas identified are real. And the concerns are being expressed by our \ntop military leaders. It is disgraceful it takes an amendment being \noffered on the floor of Congress to try to provide for these needs \nrather than coming from the leaders at the Pentagon, the civilian \nleadership or out of the White House.\n  We are not talking today about a shortage of flapjackets or gun \nscopes. Today, the challenge is that our Army's entire fleet of tanks, \naircraft, and vehicles are wearing out. And we are not doing enough \nabout it.\n  Recent media accounts have indicated that the administration's \nfailure to fund the replacement and repair of this critical hardware is \ngreatly affecting America's overall military readiness. The Associated \nPress reported on July 26 that up to two-thirds of the Army's combat \nbrigades are not ready for wartime missions, largely because they are \nhampered by equipment shortfalls.\n  In other words, if America does not finally heed the warnings of the \nU.S. military's top generals, and fully fund our equipment needs, the \nArmed Force's ability to respond to future challenges to America's \nnational security--whether on the Korean Peninsula, the Middle East or \nelsewhere in the world--could be harmed, to put it mildly.\n  Maintaining a wartime military is very different from business as \nusual--something I am afraid that the Rumsfeld Pentagon does not seem \nto entirely understand, after 5 years of combat in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Having 16 to 18 combat brigades deployed in combat at one \ntime over the last year 3 years, in addition to other U.S. forces, has \nplaced tremendous stress on the military's equipment.\n  In Iraq, U.S. tanks are being driven over 4,000 miles per year--five \ntimes the expected annual usage of 800 miles. Army helicopters are \nexperiencing usage rates up to two to three times their planned usage. \nThe Army's truck fleet is experiencing some of the most pronounced \nproblems of excessive wear, with usage rates of five to six times the \nnormal rates, further exacerbated by the addition of heavy armor.\n  This increased use, obviously, shortens the life of equipment and \ndemands much earlier and larger investments in maintenance and \nprocurement. On top of that, our equipment is being further degraded by \nthe sand and extreme heat in that part of the world, which harm the \nmechanical and electronic systems, not to mention rocket-propelled \ngrenade and explosive attacks that are causing grave harm and loss of \nequipment at an alarming rate.\n  As this chart I put up shows, just a few years in combat will age \nmilitary equipment dramatically. These statistics are coming from the \nU.S. Army. They are not ones I made up. So my colleagues can appreciate \nwhat we are talking about here.\n  For example, the Abrams tank, listed up here--it may be hard to read \non the TV screen--but the first item here, the Abrams tank, usually has \na lifespan of 20 years before it needs to be overhauled. It is seeing \nits lifespan being cut short to just over 5 years because of where they \nare.\n  The flatbed truck, which we have listed here as well--this item \nhere--normally has an expected lifespan of 20 years. It is getting 3.3 \nyears today--substantially less than would normally be expected to be \nthe case.\n  The humvee has a 15-year normal, expected lifespan. And 2.5 years is \nwhat we are getting here.\n  The semitrailers and trailers--all 20 to 15 years--but the actual \nnumbers they are getting is in the range of 2.5 to 3.3 years\n  This is what we are being told and have been told repeatedly. These \nnumbers didn't pop up yesterday or the week before. We have been told \nrepeatedly by top military leaders that this problem has persisted and \nis growing.\n  Recently, Army officials testified before Congress that it will cost \n$36 billion to fully reset the force due to this situation. But this \nestimate assumed that the United States would fully draw down its \nforces by the end of 2007. Army Chief of Staff Peter Schoomaker \nconceded that if the Army continues to operate in Iraq at its current \npace, the reset cost will total over $72 billion and will eventually \nrequire steady reset expenditures for a full 2 years after the U.S. \nmilitary withdraws from Iraq. These estimates do not even take into \naccount the Marine Corps' reset requirements. In the meantime, the Army \nintends to leave over 280,000 major items in theater and will not \nredeploy this equipment to be reset until forces draw down in Iraq.\n  The situation in the Army National Guard, which my colleague from \nRhode Island who is knowledgeable on these matters has pointed out, is \nparticularly alarming. In late 2003, the Army began to direct \nredeploying Guard units to leave their equipment in theater for use by \ndeploying forces. Under current regulation, the Pentagon requires the \nArmy to replace equipment transferred to it from the Guard. But under \nSecretary Rumsfeld's leadership, the Army has not tracked much of the \nGuard equipment left in theater nor prepared to replace it.\n  The National Guard and Reserves comprise 40 percent of the forces now \nfighting in Iraq. If you consider that the National Guard began the \nIraq war with less capable equipment than the Active Force to begin \nwith, it only seems reasonable to assume that they have lost ground as \nthe occupation has continued. The Army claims that the\n\n[[Page S8566]]\n\nNational Guard has been directed to transfer more than 75,000 pieces of \nequipment, valued at $1.7 billion, to the Army. But the Army does not \nhave a complete accounting of these items. An independent analyst at \nthe Government Accountability Office put the cost of resetting the \nGuard at $20 billion. Since much of the stay-behind equipment is \nrelatively old, I presume it will never return to the United States.\n  The drawdown of the National Guard equipment in the United States to \nsupport the war effort is so extensive that it raises doubts about \npreparedness for homeland defense. As the Senator from Rhode Island \npointed out, we are now going into the hurricane season and the \nproblems that can ensue there. I don't think the National Guard is \ngoing to be ready to respond to those situations because of the \nsituation we are in today.\n  For that reason, I am joining my colleague from Vermont, Senator \nLeahy, in supporting an amendment he will be offering to provide \nnecessary funding for the National Guard that for too long has been \nneglected by this administration. On Tuesday of this week, the Chief of \nthe National Guard Bureau, LTG H. Steven Blum, admitted that more than \ntwo-thirds of the Army National Guard's 34 brigades are now not combat \nready due largely to the vast equipment shortfalls that will take as \nmuch as $21 billion to correct. General Blum addressed the situation \nthis way:\n\n       I am further behind or in an even more dire situation than \n     the active Army, but we both have the same symptoms, I just \n     have a higher fever.\n\n  In spite of all the administration's rhetoric that we have turned a \ncorner, I think many of us believe that the insurgents are not in their \nlast throes, as the Vice President said only a few months ago, or that \nthe mission is accomplished, as others have suggested. Our military \ncommitments in Afghanistan and Iraq have only grown, as we are hearing \nnow additional requests for troops to protect the Baghdad area, to the \npoint that our forces are now larger in number in these countries than \nthey were when we started the wars in 2001 and 2003. And there is some \nindication that our forces in Iraq may increase even more. Now it seems \nthat the effect on our own forces has been devastating. Our forces are \nstretched thin. Our fleets of aircraft, tanks, and trucks are wearing \nout. But the administration's only answer for Iraq and Afghanistan is \nto stay the course.\n  I can tell you, with today's situation, that is not an option. If we \nare going to maintain America's edge in the war on terrorism, retain \nthe ability to respond to other future threats, then we need to provide \nsome relief to our Armed Forces and start putting critical investments \ninto rebuilding these forces.\n  During two Presidential election campaigns, the Bush-Cheney team sold \nits candidacy to the American people as a solution to all of our \nNation's security needs. A vote for that ticket, we were told, would \nshore up our Nation's vulnerabilities at home and keep us on the \noffensive overseas. Sadly, I submit, the policies of this \nadministration have only left our Nation weaker, as the administration \nshortchanges the needs of our Armed Forces and fails America's National \nGuard personnel.\n  The 2000 campaign disparaged President Clinton' stewardship of the \nArmed Forces, and it was leaked that two of the Army divisions were \nrated C-3 and C-4, the lowest levels of preparedness and readiness, the \nlowest category, according to the Army's own scale, decrying that ``two \nArmy divisions could not report for duty.'' The then-Governor of Texas \npointed out that he promised help was on the way. Instead today, as a \nresult of the administration's strain on our forces, the situation is \ndramatically worse.\n\n  According to the Army's own accounts, our forces are being drained of \ncritical resources to meet our homeland security needs in the United \nStates and to stay prepared to address our military threats in the \nfuture.\n  While the sheer size and scope of U.S. Army readiness remains \nclassified, one thing is for certain, our military hardware is \nstretched thin. Our fleets of aircraft, tanks and trucks are wearing \nout. Those are the facts. The military leaders are telling us that in \nclear, uncomplicated voices. U.S. military experts and media reports \nhave long been sounding the alarm about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars \nand their impact on military readiness.\n  The Washington Post recently said the following:\n\n       The unexpected heavy demands of sustained ground combat are \n     depleting military manpower and gear faster than they can be \n     fully replenished. Shortfalls in recruiting and backlogs in \n     needed equipment are taking a toll, and growing numbers of \n     units have been broken apart or taxed by repeated \n     deployments, particularly in the Army National Guard and Army \n     Reserve.\n\n  That was from a year and a half ago. Things have only gotten worse \nsince then. The administration's failures are literally breaking the \nback of the U.S. Armed Forces. I am worried about it. I know my \ncolleagues are. In addition to the amendment we have adopted, and while \nthe Senator from Alaska is correct, the amount of money they can \nreceive and actually spend is constrained. But I am hopeful our \nmilitary leaders will be able to do a better job. I ask them to \nconsider the possibility of what we might call a soft mark that would \nprovide the resources now, not wait until next spring, and that if our \nmilitary leaders can find the way to expend the dollars to increase the \nreadiness of this equipment, we ought not wait another almost year to \ndo so. If they can't spend the money, then it doesn't get spent. It \ncomes back to the Treasury. But I wouldn't want them saying we could \nhave used the money, but you didn't appropriate it on an emergency \nbasis for us.\n  So while I appreciate the amendment that was adopted last night, as I \npointed out, we are still $7 billion short, according to the military \nleaders testifying before Congress in the last number of months. I \nthink it is not only appropriate but required of us here to provide \nthose resources, put them in place. And if they can be spent, they \nought to be spent to make sure this equipment we are falling so short \non is going to be replenished and repaired so that our units can be \ncombat ready, not only for the present crises but also for future ones \nwe may face.\n  Again, my compliments to the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from \nHawaii, who historically have placed the needs of our military very \nhigh on their agenda. My criticism is not focused on them. It is \nfocused on the fact that the Secretary of Defense and the Commander in \nChief should have been having these numbers in the budget coming up \nhere, not requiring us to ask them to do a better job. That is what the \ntwo Senators did last night. They should have been telling us how the \nleadership of the Pentagon and the White House put the numbers in and \nthat we were supporting them, not requiring an amendment to be adopted \nout here to fill the needs.\n  I am urging my colleagues to take a look at some additional funding \nwe may need in order to meet these requirements.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I commend my colleague from Connecticut. I concur fully \nwith my friend that when we are prepared to send men and women into \ncombat and in harm's way, the least we can do is provide them with \nappropriate equipment to carry out the mission and to return home \nsafely.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will not speak on an amendment at this \ntime, but if others do not object, I would like to call up amendment \nNo. 4775 and ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside the present \namendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S8567]]\n\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4775.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide $1,829,000,000 for the Army National Guard for the \n construction of 370 miles of triple-layered fencing, and 461 miles of \n              vehicle barriers along the southwest border)\n\n       On page 221, line 9, strike ``$204,000,000'', and insert \n     ``$2,033,000,000, which shall be designated as an emergency \n     pursuant to Section 9011 of this Act.''.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I had previously offered and called up \namendment No. 4775, and I ask that Senator Kyl of Arizona be made an \noriginal cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, on May 17, by a vote of \n83 to 16, we approved my amendment to mandate the construction of at \nleast 370 miles of fencing and 500 miles of vehicle barriers along the \nsouthwest border of the United States. That was a very strong vote. It \nrepresented the request of Secretary Chertoff of the Department of \nHomeland Security. It was the amount of barriers and construction that \nhe felt was necessary to help him create a secure border. I believe \nthis Senate meant it when we voted to do that.\n  When the vehicle came forward on Homeland Security, we failed to fund \nthis project. I think it left this body in an embarrassing position, \ntelling the American people we are for barriers at the border, we are \nfor meeting the request of the Secretary of Homeland Security, but, by \nthe way, we are not going to put up any money to fund it.\n  I know there were reasons that some felt it couldn't be afforded \nunder the amendment process, which gave the appropriators a requirement \nto find it within the $30-billion-plus Homeland Security bill, but we \nare now in a position where we feel there are funds available that we \ncan utilize to make this step.\n  We believe this is a germane amendment to the Defense bill. The \nNational Guard is going to be a part of our border security, and the \nNational Guard does have the authority to enter into construction and \nother engineering projects as part of their directive to assist in \nsecuring the border.\n  That is where we are today. I think this is an appropriate amendment. \nI see my colleague, Senator Kyl from Arizona, is here. I would say it \nhas been my honor to work with him quite a number of years--ever since \nI have been in the Senate. There is not a single Senator here who has \never spent anything like the number of hours he has spent in advocating \nfor a legitimate, sound method of border security, nor has anyone voted \nmore consistently than he to establish that. I am glad he is a \ncosponsor.\n  Senator Kyl understands this process. He is one of the leaders in the \nSenate. I am glad he feels this is an appropriate way we can go \nforward.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4788 to Amendment No. 4775\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I call for the regular order with respect to \namendment 4775 and send a second-degree amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending. The clerk will \nreport the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4788 to amendment No. 4775.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows\n\n(Purpose: To provide $1,829,000,000 for the Army National Guard for the \n construction of 370 miles of triple-layered fencing, and 500 miles of \n              vehicle barriers along the southwest border)\n\n       On line 2, strike ``2,033,000,000'' and insert \n     ``2,033,100,000''\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this amendment simply adds $100,000 to the \nsum that would otherwise be appropriate to the National Guard for the \npurpose of constructing the fence. There is some question about whether \nthe appropriations for vehicle barriers we have in the Department of \nHomeland Security appropriations bill will be added to construct the \nfull number of barriers that are required. This is a very slight \naddition to the funding called for in the underlying amendment to help \nensure we have that funding as well.\n  What Senator Sessions and I are committed to doing is ensuring that \nthe authorization for construction of fencing is fully funded so that \nwe can assure our constituents that we have done everything necessary \nto provide the fencing on the border that the experts have said is \nnecessary. When we talk about vehicle barriers, let me describe briefly \nhow that fits into fencing.\n  Fencing is primarily a way for the Border Patrol to ensure, as it \npatrols the border in urban areas primarily, that it is very difficult \nto cross. It is hard for the Border Patrol in urban areas to be able to \npatrol on a continuous basis and deal with the large volume of people \nwho could come across if there is not adequate fencing. I think we have \nall seen the pictures of the rush to the border at border points of \nentry where large numbers of people congregate on the Mexican side of \nthe border, come rushing across, and it is virtually impossible for the \nBorder Patrol to deal with that mass of people when they cross. In \norder to make it more difficult in the urban areas where this is likely \nto occur, they prefer fencing as one of the mechanisms for securing the \nborder.\n  Fencing is not effective unless you also have Border Patrol to patrol \nalong the fencing because it is possible, in most cases, to get over a \nfence or through a fence. But it slows people down to the point that \nthe Border Patrol is able to apprehend them and ensure that they do not \ncross illegally. One of the reasons for a double fence is that the \nBorder Patrol can get to the point where people are trying to cross \nillegally if you have a double fence, and that is what this funding is \nhelping to achieve.\n  Right now, we have this single fence constructed of steel. It is \nexcess or surplus landing mat steel that the military has no more use \nfor but used to be the equipment they would lay down on a field in \norder to be able to land planes on an emergency basis. This is surplus \nsteel. They put that on end, welded together, and it constructs a \nfence. It is somewhat effective in the urban areas, but much of it is \ndeteriorating in the areas where it has been constructed for a long \ntime, and it is also not as effective because the Border Patrol cannot \nsee through it and therefore it does not as easily know what is \nhappening on the other side of the fence--whether people are \ncongregating there. They would prefer to replace that deteriorating \nlanding mat fencing with other kinds of fencing.\n  What the amendment from Senator Sessions does is ensure the National \nGuard will have the funds necessary to put the landing mat fencing up \nthat they are currently constructing in those areas where that is \nappropriate but also that there will be adequate funding to convert to \nthe other kind of fencing we are familiar with in the form of a very \nheavy gauge chain link kind of fencing with barbed wire, and so forth, \nto prevent entry.\n  The vehicle barriers we speak of are a real necessity now because the \nBorder Patrol is gradually gaining control of the border, and their \ncontrol is being contested by the cartels and the coyotes who in the \npast have had significant control of that territory. They are \nresponding with violence, and they are using pretty high-caliber \nweapons.\n  What the Border Patrol says is that every time they see a vehicle \ncoming across the border, they know they have a problem because it is \nbig enough to carry weapons. It is also big enough to carry contraband, \nusually drugs, which is protected by weapons. So unlike the\n\n[[Page S8568]]\n\nsituation with illegal immigrants crossing the border, they know that \nthe coyotes and the cartels, the gangs that are in control, are going \nto use weapons to protect their turf, protect their territory, and \nenable that contraband to get across the border. So vehicles present a \nspecial threat to the Border Patrol.\n  The vehicle barriers they will construct and they are constructing \nwill prevent, in the flat areas, beyond the urban areas, these vehicles \nfrom coming across. They are constructed in such a way that animals or \npeople could get through them, but vehicles cannot. In some of the more \nmountainous areas, obviously it is not possible to put up either \nfencing or vehicle barriers. But the combination of those two items, \nplus cameras that can view large areas of the border at a time, plus \nlights that enable the Border Patrol to see at night and sensors in the \nmore remote areas, in addition to the unmanned aerial vehicles, fixed-\nwing and helicopters that patrol the border, provides a mechanism that \nsupports the vehicular patrols of the Border Patrol and the combination \nof which provides the mosaic for securing the border.\n  All this is a part of the Border Patrol's recommendations--the \nDepartment of Homeland Security recommendations--and is authorized by \nlegislation we have adopted. But the funding is not adequate to \ncomplete all of this work. That is what the amendment Senator Sessions \nhas offered would do. It would in effect put our money where our mouth \nis. It would provide the funding that is needed to achieve the goals we \nhave all agreed we need to achieve.\n  Just a final point. When the previous appropriations bill was before \nus, and Senator Sessions referred to this, we had amendments--for \nexample, one that I offered that was accepted which applied more \nfunding to achieve the authorization we had previously passed to fund \nmore detention spaces to end the catch-and-release program. Right after \nthat or very shortly after that amendment was adopted, the amendment of \nSenator Sessions was laid down. Through no fault of his, there was a \nproblem in funding--that is, it would have provided a potential across-\nthe-board funding reduction of everything else--so some of us were \ncaught in a catch-22. We very much wanted to support what Senator \nSessions was doing--he is absolutely right, we needed to secure more \nmoney for the construction of fencing--yet in my case it could have \nbeen taken out of funding I had just succeeded in adding to the bill. \nSo it was an impossible vote for us.\n  One of the reasons this amendment is before us is to correct that and \nensure that all of the things we need to fund will be funded: the \ndetention spaces that I was able to add, more border patrol that we \nhave added, as well as the fencing that has to be added. So in effect \nthis is the last block in the foundation for the effort we have of \nsecuring the border. We need to put it in place.\n  We have authorized the work. Everybody agrees it needs to go forward. \nThere has simply been a difference between the funding appropriated and \nthe funding required. This amendment will provide that funding and will \ndo so in a way that will do harm to no other account and will help us \nto achieve the goal of securing the border.\n  I am very happy to support the amendment. The second-degree amendment \nthat I laid down, as I said, is technical; it simply adds $100,000 to \nensure there is enough money to provide for the vehicular barrier \nconstruction as well.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I had a call several months ago, before I offered the \namendment, from Congressman Duncan Hunter of San Diego, who chairs the \nHouse Armed Services Committee, and he shared with me his positive view \nof what the San Diego fencing had meant for that area. Crime had gone \ndown. Economic growth had occurred on both sides of the border--it was \nso positive. I know there is fencing in Arizona, and it is not the best \nkind, not the most attractive. As was said, it is not something you can \nsee through--landing mats.\n  But based on the Senator's experience and many years of examining \nwhat has happened at the border, is he convinced and would he share his \nthoughts about how this could be helpful in the overall view of \ncreating a border in which the law is followed and we have security?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate that. We had testimony before \nthe Terrorism Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, which I chair \nand on which Senator Feinstein is the ranking member, about what the \nresults of that fencing in San Diego have meant--on both sides of the \nborder. The testimony was that it has reduced crime on both sides of \nthe border. The people in Mexico are very pleased because the gangs and \nthe coyotes that used to gather together before they would try to bring \ntheir load of illegal immigrants across the boarder--preying on them, \nstealing from them, robbing them, beating them, and committing other \ncrimes against them--that whole milieu has ended because the fencing \nhas made it impossible to cross, so the coyotes have gone to other \nplaces to try to take their loads across the border. They are no longer \ncongregating and hanging out in that area in Tijuana and south of the \nSan Diego area, and as a result, on both sides of the border, crime has \ngone down dramatically. The environment has improved dramatically \nbecause you don't have these thousands and thousands of people \ncrossing, cutting all these trails, leaving their garbage behind.\n  In fact, I am told nobody has actually gotten across the fencing in \nthat entire sector. I don't have the statistics off the top of my head \nhere, but the testimony before our subcommittee was dramatic in terms \nof the number of apprehensions before the fencing and the number of \napprehensions afterward. I am proud that I was a sponsor, along with \nSenator Feinstein, of the fencing in that area which has made such a \ndramatic difference there.\n  As I said in the Judiciary Committee, when I got the authority to add \nfencing in Arizona, a lot of those folks who were crossing in \nCalifornia are now trying to do it in Arizona. Wherever that traffic is \nnow attempting to cross the border, we need to provide the Border \nPatrol with all the tools it needs to get the job done, and that \nincludes a substantial amount of fencing.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. One more question, if I could ask the Senator from \nArizona. Would he share with us and the American people some \ninformation he might have about the size and scope and numbers of \npeople that are crossing in the Arizona area? I know he cares about \nthat. That is one reason the Senator feels so strongly about it. But I \nam not sure a lot of people understand the scope of the problem. He has \nalready shared that fencing is a component of fixing the problem, but \nwould the Senator share with us the scope of the problem?\n  Mr. KYL. Let me illustrate with a couple of examples. There are so \nmany things one could talk about. For example, the violence at the \nborder has increased 108 percent, according to the U.S. attorney in \nArizona, Paul Charlton, in testimony before our subcommittee. The \nnumber of crimes and number of criminals crossing is up dramatically. \nOver 10 percent of all of the people apprehended now at the border have \ncriminal records--and these are serious crimes. This is murder and rape \nand kidnapping and drug crimes and the like. So it is not just people \ncoming across the border to find work here. There is a substantial \nnumber of criminals, and they are not just from our neighbor to the \nsouth, Mexico; they are from countries all over the world.\n  When you see the apprehensions of people from Russia and Vietnam or \nChina or Iran or Iraq or other countries, you also wonder how many \npeople we are not apprehending who are criminals or who can be \nterrorists. So there is that element.\n  I spoke to the matter of vehicle barriers. One of the areas they are \nadding barriers right now and want to add more is in the area of the \nBarry Goldwater Gunnery Range. This is known to the people in the \nmilitary as the finest area of training for our pilots in the world. \nThere are wide-open spaces. There is nothing to prevent the kind of \nactivity that occurs, which includes dropping bombs. From all over the \ncountry, our pilots come to train there. There is one problem. With \nillegal immigration, the Marine Corps now has to go out on patrol to \nmake sure there are not any illegal immigrants in the\n\n[[Page S8569]]\n\narea where the bombing or strafing will occur. Obviously you don't want \nto hurt anyone.\n  They do that at great cost. They come back and report the area is \nclear, our planes are gassed, ready, loaded with the bombs and so on, \nmaybe take off, and then they get a report that more immigrants are \nstreaming into the area.\n  They have had to call off their missions. Over the past couple of \nyears there have been hundreds of missions that had to be canceled. \nThousands of flying hours have been lost as a result.\n  My point is this: There are costs for not having secured the border \nthat I think many in America aren't even aware of. There are huge \nenvironmental costs. Tons of garbage are left behind rotting, a danger \nthat leads to the people as well as to the livestock, the way the \nranchers' operations are disrupted when the fences are torn down, the \nwater lines are broken, and all the other things that occur.\n  The bottom line is that we have to secure the border, and adding \nfencing helps to do that.\n  That is why the amendment is so important. We have to make up the \ndifference between what we have authorized and what the Border Patrol \nsays they need, with what we have already provided in funding in the \namendment to make up the difference to ensure that we have full funding \nfor what we have to do at the border.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Kyl. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The minority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, let me say this. We are in a \nprocedural quagmire in the Senate as happens once in a while. Of \ncourse, it would have been the right of the minority to stop this \nDefense appropriations bill from going forward. For a couple of reasons \nI felt that was inappropriate.\n  First of all, the defense of this country is extremely important, and \nwe should try to get a few things done dealing with our fighting men \nand women around the world as quickly as we can. But one of the factors \nin my agreement to go forward with this legislation is the two managers \nof this bill are history itself. Two of the most senior Members of the \nSenate, two of the most experienced Members of the Senate, the two \nMembers who manage a bill as partners, as a couple of friends should, \nare experienced. I felt that with their management of this bill we \nwould have a fair opportunity to do what was appropriate. My feeling \nhas been underscored in the little while we have been on this bill. We \nwill give a fair shake in the process to the men and women who are \ndefending our country.\n  I come to the floor today with a simple amendment. I must confess \nthat the amendment I brought to the floor is certainly not new and \nunique with me. The amendment that I am offering has been taken \ndirectly word for word from a bill that was passed by the Republican-\ncontrolled House last week by a broad bipartisan margin.\n  This amendment consists of tax provisions--so-called extenders--\nexcluding the abandoned mine land fund in the House-passed bill.\n  Again, every single provision in my amendment enjoys broad bipartisan \nsupport. But I am forced to offer this amendment for a couple of \nreasons.\n  First, our friends in the majority have allowed many of these \nprovisions to expire.\n  Second, the statements made by the majority leader yesterday--which I \ndon't think are hard to understand--I have to confess that the \nstatements by my friend, the majority leader, were wrong in a number of \ndifferent ways. What he basically said yesterday was we have a vote on \nthe motion to proceed to a big bill on Friday; take it or leave it take \nthat bill which includes these extending tax provisions which are so \nimportant to the country, some of which have expired.\n  It also has in it a minimum wage provision which is so flawed. It \ntakes 3 years to kick in, but, more importantly, for seven States it \nwould be a wage cut for these people. The threats--for lack of a better \nway to describe it--are simply an attempt to coerce, blackmail Members \nof the Senate to vote for a bill that is bad just because there are \ncertain provisions that people might like, thinking, well, this allows \na chance; whatever, we are going to have to vote on the extenders and \nthe pension bill simply is not true. We have to pass these extenders. \nWe always do, and we will this year.\n  I certainly hope we pass the pensions legislation. We have worked on \nthat in conference for almost a year.\n  Last Friday, it was all agreed on, and on a bipartisan basis it was \ndone. They were ready to sign the conference report. Had that happened, \nwe would have long been done with this.\n  For the majority leader to say it is now or never, you vote for this \nFriday morning on the motion to proceed, that it is a very faulty, \nwrong-headed piece of legislation, not the least of which is to create \nan $800 billion further deficit and debt for this country with the \nestate tax--$800 billion.\n  It affects 8,100 people in our country. We are a country of 300 \nmillion people. This whole matter is being driven for 8,100 people--\n$800 billion.\n  If we are talking about priorities, what is more important? The \npensions provisions affect 45 million people, and these extenders which \naffect virtually everybody in the country--businesses and, of course, \ndirectly our citizens.\n  We do not need to go through each of these extenders, and I am not \ngoing to do that. For example, take the one that allows taxpayers to \ndeduct up to $4,000 of their college tuition expenses. Senator Frist is \ntelling us and the American people that the 8,100 Americans that we are \ncreating a debt for this country of $800 billion are more important \nthan parents sending their children to college with this deduction. It \ndoesn't sound good to me. It doesn't seem like a fair chance.\n  This amendment contains an R tax credit to encourage American \nbusinesses to make investments that will benefit American workers. What \nis more important, to get that done before we leave here at the end of \nthis week or to pass an estate tax repeal costing $800 billion? Senator \nFrist said that the 8,100 people are more important than the R tax \ncredit.\n  My amendment contains a provision that will extend the State and \nlocal sales tax deduction, led by a number of Members but certainly the \nsenior Senator from the State of Texas. That State's residents will \nbenefit so significantly because there are so many people there. But \nNevada, which doesn't have as many people, has a sales tax, and we want \nthis benefit.\n\n  Senator Frist says, no, you are not going to have a chance to do that \nunless you support my estate tax repeal--$800 billion to extend the \nState and local sales tax.\n  This amendment includes a provision to allow teachers to deduct out-\nof-pocket expenses when they incur classroom expenses. In Nevada, we \nare struggling to find ways to have affordable housing for our \nteachers. This means a lot to them--deduct out-of-pocket expenses for \nclassroom activities. Senator Frist says, No, 8,100 of the richest of \nthe rich of the rich take precedent.\n  As I have said, I am not going to go through each of these \nprovisions. But why don't we just go ahead and pass this?\n  People say the House is out of session. The House is still in \nsession.\n  I think it would give true impetus to this defense bill, and we could \nperhaps finish this bill within a day or two. There will be some \nstimulus for doing that. On the House side, just like we do over here, \nleadership can bring the House back into session. They have to come \nevery 3 days. That is the rule. They cannot adjourn unless we give them \npermission.\n  They can do this by unanimous consent. We could do the Defense \nappropriations bill, and we could do these extensions.\n  This amendment is important. It provides an opportunity for every \nMember of this body to show the American people that we are prepared to \nrespond to their needs.\n  These extenders should have been extended a long time ago.\n  I am speaking for my friend, the ranking member on the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus, who, as you know, is not here as a result of \nhis nephew being killed while serving us in Iraq. He feels very \nstrongly about this.\n  I don't believe we can be coerced into providing budget-busting tax \nbreaks for the wealthiest of the wealthy in our country. We should not \nleave here\n\n[[Page S8570]]\n\nwithout giving our colleagues every opportunity to provide working \nAmericans some tax relief, which they deserve.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment that is \nbeing offered by the Senator from Nevada.\n  Yesterday, the Republican leader, Senator Frist, told us that the \nonly chance the Senate would have to pass critical legislation to help \ncountless deserving Americans will be if we are willing to reduce and \nvirtually repeal the estate tax in America.\n  My question and the question of the Senator from Nevada and this side \nof aisle is, why? Why not just pass this tax-extender package that is \nready right now on the Senate floor?\n  Those of us who have been in Congress for a few years know that this \npackage of extenders is a spoonful of sugar. It helps the medicine go \ndown. It is saved until the end of the session. It is offered as a \nsweetener to pass a package that is otherwise not palatable for \nindigestion.\n  We all know the merits of these proposals. They are very positive, \nand they help a lot of people across America. Why wouldn't we get that \npart right?\n  Why wouldn't this Congress, which has done so little to help people \nacross America, make sure that this package of extenders passes?\n  Why wouldn't we pass this legislation and make it easier for veterans \nto own their own homes?\n  Why wouldn't we pass this to make it easier for families to pay for \ntheir kids' college education expenses?\n  Why wouldn't we pass this and help high school teachers pay for the \nexpenses that they incur out-of-pocket to help students in the \nclassroom?\n  Why wouldn't we pass it to encourage investment in low-income \ncommunities, to encourage employers to hire workers from low-income \nfamilies, or Indian tribes, and encourage employers to hire high-risk \nyouth and veterans?\n  Why wouldn't we pass this to encourage our businesses to conduct \ncritical research on new products and ideas?\n  Why wouldn't we pass it to support coal mining cleanup and bolster \ncoal miners' health care when they retire?\n  It appears that the answer, as Senator Reid has stated, is very \nsimple. The position of the Republican leader is you can't do these \ngood things for America unless you do something that is terrible for \nAmerica. Unless we repeal the estate tax creating an additional debt on \nfuture generations of at least $750 billion to $800 billion, you can't \nhelp Americans across-the-board unless you provide a special tax break \nfor those who are the most well-off in America, the most comfortable, \nthe people who have benefited the most from being part of this great \nNation.\n  Unless you give them an additional tax break, the position of the \nRepublic leader yesterday was, We will not help anyone else in America. \nWe will not help 6.6 million minimum-wage workers who desperately need \nan increase in the minimum wage after 9 years of being stuck at $5.15 \nan hour.\n  We will not pass these tax extenders which help some Americans in so \nmany different ways unless at the same time we repeal the estate tax at \ngreat expense to America and to future generations.\n  We believe these priorities in this amendment are too important to be \nany kind of subject for games in the Senate. This is serious business. \nI encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, despite all the \nother debate we might get in, to enact this amendment. Pass these tax \nextenders at the earliest opportunity.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4795\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friends have agreed to set aside the \npending amendment and I ask consent that be done, and I then call up my \namendment which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4795.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. STEVENS. I make a point of order this amendment is legislation on \nan appropriations bill and violates rule XVI, and it would bring about \na blue slip if this is reported to the House.\n  With regret, I make that point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained. The amendment \nfalls.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, what just happened is extremely \nunfortunate for American families, extremely important for people all \nacross the country who want Members to do things in the Senate that \naffect them and their lives.\n  People are feeling squeezed on all sides: Jobs, health care costs are \nrising, they are afraid they will lose their pension, maybe have lost \ntheir pension, the costs of college, men and women serving overseas \nwant to know when they come home their house is not gone because of \nforeclosure, or they worry their family has a more difficult time \nbecause they have been serving our country.\n  The extension bill, the amendment Senator Reid offered with Senator \nDurbin, and of which I am proud to be a cosponsor, speaks to those \nissues the American families are asking Congress to address. It speaks \nto the kind of tax policy that makes sure middle-class Americans are \nsupported and that we are doing something for them, not just for those \nwho are the most blessed, the multibillionaires of this country.\n  Let me give an example. Our amendment that was just objected to \nincluded a provision to extend the $4,000 deduction for higher \neducation expenses for families to send their children to college or \nfor people going back to school themselves to be retrained or get a new \ndegree to better meet the demands of the new global economy. Why in the \nworld would we not want to rush to extend that $4,000 tax deduction for \nindividuals who are just trying to make it, trying to get the American \ndream for themselves or their children?\n  Extending the research and development tax credit, again, is \nabsolutely critical. Our State has gone through and continues to go \nthrough major transformations in manufacturing. This is not your \nfather's factory anymore. This is high tech. The R tax credit is \ncritical to be extended.\n  It is about jobs. There are many provisions in this amendment just \nobjected to that directly relate to jobs, directly relate to our way of \nlife in this country, creating opportunity, as well as supporting our \ntroops. One of the provisions treats combat pay as earned income under \nthe earned income tax credit for our brave men and women in uniform. \nWho would not support doing that as quickly as possible? I regret this \namendment was not supported.\n  Let me go on to say, as our leader Senator Reid indicated, there is \nanother bill that affects middle-class Americans that is being held up, \nessentially is being used for political maneuvers right now, that \naffects upwards of 45 million people in this country. That is the \npension bill. We are talking about people who have paid into a defined \nbenefit plan all their lives. They assumed it would be there. They \nassume in the United States of America one shouldn't have to worry, \nafter paying into a pension, that the funds would not be there at \nretirement. Yet that is happening for too many people I represent and \ntoo many people around the country.\n\n  We have a bill that has been worked on very hard. People on both \nsides of the aisle in the Senate have worked together in a bipartisan \neffort, a good-faith effort--the Committee on Finance, with Senator \nGrassley and Senator Baucus, and the HELP Committee, with Senator \nKennedy and Senator Enzi, working very hard along with Senator Mikulski \non our side playing such a critical role to make sure we get it right. \nUnfortunately, the process for this bill has been a disaster despite \nthe best efforts of people on both sides of the aisle in the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, the price is being paid by families who find their \neconomic interests, their future, their retirement security, put on the \nback burner. Three failed deadlines have occurred on this bill, 7 \nmonths of lost time in conference. Now the same families are being told \nthey have to wait some more so we can take up a tax bill with \nprovisions that do not even expire until 2010. People have pensions in \njeopardy because of the possibility we will not act\n\n[[Page S8571]]\n\nin 2 days, and we are not acting. Hopefully we will get this done. We \nought to get this done now before we focus on legislation that affects \nonly .2 percent of the wealthiest in this country, people who are not \neven impacted for 4 years. There is something wrong with this picture.\n  There is no way to justify this. In my opinion, it is immoral to \nwatch working Americans lose pensions they have earned over the last 30 \nor 40 years, and not step up and do something about it as quickly as \npossible. People have waited too long. In Michigan alone we have over \n1.5 million families counting on their pension plan. They are counting \non Congress to make sure it will be there. They are counting on \nCongress to make sure what they have worked for all their life will be \nthere.\n  There is a fundamental principle: You work all your life, you pay \ninto a pension, you ought to get it, period. We shouldn't be spending \nthe time to take up another bill. This should have been done months \nago. I don't understand this.\n  The families I represent are betting on us to help them. They are \ncounting on us to make sure they have their pensions. Unfortunately, \nthe leadership on the other side of the aisle has decided to prioritize \na bill that impacts .2 percent of the wealthiest taxpayers while a bill \nthat affects upwards of 45 million people is waiting to come to the \nSenate floor. We have no guarantee it will be passed this week. We \ncannot count on the fact when all of this is done on Friday that they \nwill even proceed with this critical pension bill.\n  On the pension bill itself, I commend, as I said before, my \ncolleagues, our leaders, who have worked so hard. I commend the \nconferees for considering the unique aspects of manufacturing and the \nauto industry. These are tough times in Michigan. The bill as it passed \nthe Senate did not fully represent what we need for manufacturing. In \nthe conference committee, people of good will worked together. We fixed \nthose things. I am very pleased about that. Our automakers are trying \nto do the right thing, trying to fund their pension plans. The pension \nbill addresses those things that will allow them to continue to do the \nright thing.\n  We also have folks in the construction industry and building trades, \nthe multiemployer plans, who are asking for flexibility to fix their \npension plans. That is in this bill. We have companies such as \nNorthwest Airlines, which has gone into bankruptcy but has chosen up to \nthis point not to dump their pensions in the Pension Guaranty Fund. We \nhave to make sure we do everything possible to help. Thousands of \npeople, their livelihoods, their future, their retirement security, are \nat stake.\n  I thank all those working on the pension bill. I thank all of my \ncolleagues who have worked to address our manufacturing issues and the \nmultiemployer provisions. I am proud to be one of the sponsors of the \namendment to address the pension plans of about 10 million Americans in \nwhat is called multiemployer pension plans. I thank the conferees for \nincluding that, as well. I thank all of those businesses that are \ntrying to hang in there and do the right thing.\n  Most importantly, people are counting on us to do the right thing. \nPart of the American dream has been to work hard all your life, care \nfor your family, put money aside for retirement, be able to afford \ncollege, which this last amendment would have addressed if it had not \nbeen objected to.\n  Right now, too many people in America are feeling squeezed on all \nsides. They see decisions being made, issues being brought up, that \nhave nothing to do with their lives. They see policies being proposed \nthat have nothing to do with helping them do better, hoping they will \nable to keep the American dream, be able to protect their way of life.\n  It is time we had a new direction in this country. It is time we had \na new direction and focus on that which will directly affect people \nevery day so they will trust in their Government again that we will \nhave the right values and priorities that allow every middle-class \nAmerican, every working American, everyone who is working hard and \nplaying by the rules, to have a chance to know they will not only make \nit but we will keep our promises, as well.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues, urge the leadership in the \nSenate, to bring before the Senate a bill that can have universal \nsupport, overwhelming support in the pension bill.\n  As we complete this very important Defense bill, this funding bill \ncritical to our men and women, our troops, a bill we all want to see \npassed, I urge we then bring up the pension bill and let us pass it so \n45 million people will have the assurance by the end of this week that \ntheir pensions will remain intact, or at least we will have given it \nour very best effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have a chart that shows the reset \nrequirements of the Army and Marine Corps. Again, I say to the Senate, \nthe Defense Department identified a $23.7 billion requirement for \nresetting the force, bringing it back up to operational capability. The \namount included was $17.1 billion for the Army and $6.6 billion for the \nMarine Corps. The fiscal year 2007 Defense appropriations bill which we \nhave presented to the Senate included $10.6 billion that would directly \naddress these needs. The remaining need was $13.3 billion. That was \naddressed in the amendment Senator Inouye and I presented last evening.\n  I ask unanimous consent the chart be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    ARMY AND MARINE CORPS RESET NEEDS\n                             [$ in billions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              Remaining\n                                    Total need    FY 2007       needs\n                                    identified    bill as     (Stevens-\n                                      by DOD      proposed      Inouye\n                                                              amendment)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nArmy:\n    Equipment....................          8.6          3.6          5.0\n    Maintenance..................          8.5          5.7          2.8\n        Total, Army..............         17.1          9.3          7.8\nMarine Corps:\n    Equipment....................          5.3          1.1          4.2\n    Maintenance..................          1.3          0.2          1.1\n        Total, Marine Corps......          6.6          1.3          5.3\n            Total in the Bill....         23.7         10.6         13.1\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Amendments Nos. 4758, as Modified, 4759, 4770, and 4772, en bloc\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are prepared now to offer the first \nmanagers' package. This includes Senate amendment 4758, as modified, \nfor Senator Cochran, requiring a report on depleted uranium.

We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                    AMENDMENT NO. 4758, as modified\n\n (Purpose: To require a report assessing the Depleted Uranium Sensing \n    and Treatment for Removal program of the Department of Defense)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8109.

Mr. President, if Senator Sessions is prepared to \nconsider his amendment No. 4775, the managers are prepared to accept \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his interest \nand support. I know he indicated we needed to work on it the last time \nwe voted on it. Perhaps I would like to speak a little more on it. And \nI think I would ask for a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator Kennedy had the floor when I interrupted him. \nWhen he is finished, we will be happy to proceed with your amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am going to send an amendment to the \ndesk, and at the appropriate time I will ask for its consideration. The \nfloor managers have the amendment now and are reviewing it. But I \nwanted to make a brief comment, which I will do at this time, to \noutline the amendment. And then we will work with the floor managers to \nsee if this might be an acceptable amendment.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I send to the desk would require the \nDirector of National Intelligence to task the intelligence community to \nprepare an updated National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq. The \namendment is cosponsored by our Democratic leader, Senator Reid, \nSenator Biden, Senator Levin, and Senator Reed of Rhode Island.\n  The last time the NIE was updated was in July 2004. According to \npress reports, it outlined three possibilities for Iraq through the end \nof 2005. The worst case was civil war. The best case was an Iraq whose \nstability would remain tenuous in political, economic, and security \nterms. Much has changed over the last 2 years, and decisionmakers in \nthe executive and legislative branches urgently need an updated NIE.\n  Since 2004, reports from the Departments of Defense and State and \ncomments by administration officials on security and stability in Iraq \nhave been unconvincing, and it is essential to have an objective \nassessment of Iraq from the intelligence community.\n  Our amendment would require the Director of National Intelligence to \nprovide an intelligence assessment by October 1--2 months from now. If \nhe is unable to do so, he must provide a report outlining the reasons.\n  The intelligence estimate required in our amendment would require an \nupdate on eight key issues.\n  The first is sectarianism. We need an assessment from the \nintelligence community on whether Iraq is in a civil war now or is \ndescending into civil war, and what will prevent or reverse a \ndeterioration of conditions promoting civil war.\n  The growing sectarian violence, the ruthless death squads, the \nincreasingly powerful privately armed militias, and the \nadministration's decision to send thousands more U.S. troops to Baghdad \nare alarming and are of concern to the American people. We need an \nassessment from the intelligence community so we know how to adjust our \npolicy.\n  The second issue the new intelligence estimate should address is \nsecurity. One of the key elements of that assessment should be the \nmilitias. Militias are the engines of civil war. All one needs to do is \nlook at Bosnia or Lebanon.\n  As the violence in Lebanon demonstrates, political parties cannot \ngovern with one hand and use militias to terrorize civilians with the \nother. It did not work with Hezbollah in Lebanon, it will not work with \nHamas, and it will not work in Iraq.\n  Prime Minister Maliki has acknowledged the militia problem, but he \nhas not articulated a clear vision for how to tackle this critical \nissue. It is time for the new Government to move beyond vague \nstatements and develop a viable strategy to deal with the militias and \nprevent Iraq from descending into full-scale civil war.\n  On this critical issue, we need to know the intelligence community's \nassessment of the likelihood that the Government of Iraq will obtain a \ncommitment from the political parties to ban militias. We need to know \nthe extent to which the Government of Iraq has developed and \nimplemented a credible plan to disarm, demobilize, and reintegrate \nmilitias into Government security forces.\n  More broadly, we need an assessment from the intelligence community \nabout whether Iraq is succeeding in standing up its own effective \nsecurity forces and what actions are needed to increase the prospect of \nthat occurring.\n  The third issue is terrorism. We need an assessment from the \nintelligence community about the extent of the threat from violent, \nextremist-related terrorism, including al-Qaida, in and from Iraq, and \nthe factors the intelligence community believes will address the \nterrorist threat.\n  Iraq Prime Minister Maliki told Congress last week that in addition \nto the challenge of sectarian violence, his country is ``the front \nline'' against terrorism. Is a majority of the violence in Iraq driven \nby the insurgency rather than foreign terrorists? Is it still the case \nthat less than 1 percent of the prison population in Iraq are foreign \nfighters? We need to know the current nature and the extent of the \nterrorism threat. Just as important, we need the intelligence \ncommunity's assessment on what we and the Iraqis can do to counter the \nthreat.\n  Fourth, we need an assessment from the intelligence community about \nwhether Iraq is succeeding in creating a stabile and effective unity \ngovernment, the likelihood that changes to the constitution will be \nmade to address the concerns of the Sunni community, and the actions it \nbelieves will increase the prospect of that occurring\n  Fifth is economic reconstruction. We need an assessment from the \nintelligence community about whether Iraq is succeeding in rebuilding \nits economy and creating economic prosperity for Iraqis, the likelihood \nthat economic reconstruction in Iraq will significantly diminish Iraq's \ndependence on foreign aid to meet its domestic economic needs, and the \nactions the intelligence community believes are needed to increase the \nlikelihood of that occurring.\n  Sixth is the future of Iraq. We need an assessment from the \nintelligence community of the optimistic, the most likely, and the \npessimistic scenarios for the stability of Iraq through 2007. The \nfuture of Iraq is difficult to predict, but certainly the assessment \nprovided in 2004 needs to be updated. We need to know what the \nintelligence community foresees now.\n  Seventh is an assessment of the international presence in Iraq, \nincluding whether and in what ways the large-scale presence of \nmultinational forces is helping or hindering Iraqis' chances for \nsuccess.\n  Eighth, and finally, we need an assessment of the extent to which our \noperations in Iraq are affecting our relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia, \nTurkey, and other countries in the region.\n  A new National Intelligence Estimate is long overdue. John Adams once \nsaid: ``Facts are stubborn things.'' It is abundantly clear that the \nfacts matter. They mattered before the war and during the war and they \nmatter now as we try to deal effectively with the continuing quagmire.\n  So, Mr. President, at the appropriate time I will urge our colleagues \nto accept the amendment. And I will be glad to work with the floor \nmanagers if they have ideas about how it can be addressed and further \neffected.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4775\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to share a few remarks\n\n[[Page S8573]]\n\nabout the amendment I have offered, No. 4775. It is to actually fund \nthe border barriers and fencing that we authorized by an 83-to-16 vote \njust a few weeks ago, on May 17. This Senate said that is what we \nwanted to do. Unfortunately, when the more appropriate time came to \nfund it, we failed to have the money to do it.\n  I think there is a great deal of cynicism among the American people \nabout Congress's commitment to actually creating a lawful system of \nimmigration for America. They are not only cynical, but they are \ndetermined to see to it that Congress does. We are the vehicles for the \nAmerican people to accomplish national goals of importance.\n  As a person who had been a law enforcement officer for many years \ninvolving Federal law, it is just heartbreaking to see, with regard to \nimmigration, law made a mockery. People have every right to be upset \nwith us, upset with the President--this President--and previous \nPresidents, previous Congresses.\n  Twenty years ago, in 1986, we developed a system that was supposed to \nwork to deal with immigration. We gave a one-time amnesty to several \nmillion people. We promised we were going to make the system work in \nthe future. And we never funded anything that would work. That is \nundisputable. It just cannot be denied by any person, I do not think, \nwho would look at the situation as it has developed since 1986. There \nwas a promise to do something. That promise was not fulfilled. So we do \nnot want to head down that road again.\n  I think the House of Representatives is correct. Let's make sure we \nfollow through this time. We have a credibility gap. We have a problem. \nPeople are not confident we are going to do it. Indeed, money gets \ntight around here. We spent $30-something billion on homeland security, \nbut we could not find $1.8 billion to fund the fencing we voted to \nauthorize and that DHS wants--fencing is a one-time expenditure that \nwould reduce the number of Border Patrol agents, reduce the number of \npeople who attempt to come in, and reduce the overall cost in the long \nrun of making the border secure. But we did not do it. Why not? Well, \nthose are the kinds of questions we are dealing with.\n  Now, the President has done some things that indicate he is committed \nto border enforcement. On July 25, Border Patrol Chief David Aguilar \nand National Guard Bureau General Steven Blum held a press conference \non Operation Jump Start. That is where the National Guard is helping us \nat the border, as the President requested that they do. Chief Aguilar \nand General Blum explained: The National Guard is assisting them--the \nBorder Patrol--with their ``tactical infrastructure so they can be more \neffective; . . . better roads so they can move along the border \nlaterally . . . '' You have to be able to move along the border. You \ncannot have people elbow to elbow trying to stop people coming here \nillegally. When you see people come, you have to be able to move \nlaterally along the border. And quote: ``fences and lighting and \nsensors.''\n  So that is what the National Guard is doing.\n  Now, yesterday, on August 1, we received a letter from Ralph Basham, \nthe Border Patrol Commissioner, and Paul McHale, Assistant Secretary of \nDefense, announcing the fulfillment of President Bush's promise to \ndeploy 6,000 National Guardsmen to the border by August 1. He met that \ngoal. This is a good step. It is not the solution. They are not allowed \nto participate as a law enforcement agency. They have a lot of \nrestrictions on them. But it is an assistance, and it is also part of a \nsignal to the world that a wide-open border no longer exists, that we \nare taking steps to maintain security at our borders, like most nations \nof the world strive to do.\n  The letter describes how 6,199 soldiers and airmen are now working in \nfour border States. One of the capacities they are serving in is \n``forward deployment,'' which includes ``engineering and other \nefforts.'' This refers to the National Guard's role in building \ntactical infrastructures--roads and fencing.\n  So the National Guard is already charged with helping build the \ntactical infrastructure needed on the southern border. But they just do \nnot have enough money to build what the Senate authorized: 370 miles of \nfencing and 500 miles of vehicle barriers that are less expensive but \nat least keep people from driving across the border in their vehicles.\n  So the amendment we have before us now, and the vote we will have, \nwill finally appropriate the funds that will build fencing on the \nborder. This is a real vote. What we often do in this Chamber is \nauthorize expenditures. We authorize programs to be undertaken that \nwill serve some good purpose. But if the appropriating committees and \nthe Senate do not get around to actually funding those authorized \nactivities, they never occur.\n  This is an appropriations bill, and it is a bill that has real power \nto fund a fence, in this case. So it is a real vote.\n  The language of the amendment is simple. We take the amount of money \nalready in the bill to fund emergency National Guard activities and \nincrease that money by the amount needed to construct the 370 miles of \nfencing and 461 miles of vehicle barriers on the southern border. \nBecause 39 new miles of vehicle barriers were already funded in the \nSenate-passed Homeland Security bill we moved some weeks ago, we only \nfund 461 miles of vehicle barriers with this amendment.\n  Of course, the number of miles of barriers and fencing is what was \nrequested by the Secretary of Homeland Security, Mike Chertoff, to the \nCongress. It is what he stated he needed to be effective on the border.\n  It is also important that we send that signal to the world that there \nhas been a change in policy. We can deny we had a policy of open \nborders, but in reality we basically did. We have had an open borders \nmentality, so people around the world have received a message; and that \nis, if they are determined and if they come to our border, they can \nfigure out a way to get across. That has been happening. We do not need \nto send that signal. We need to send a signal that the open borders \ntime is over by passing this amendment. It is not a bottomless pit of \ncosts. In fact, these barriers are one-time costs, but they will help \nus have good enforcement with fewer agents for decades to come. The net \nresult will be that we will be able to save money. It will also save \nmoney in its signal capacity in that I believe we are going to have \nfewer people attempting to violate the law, as a result of a clear \ncommitment to use the National Guard, fencing, increased Border Patrol, \nand also detention beds and deportation activity.\n  We are not playing games. The American people have every right to be \ndubious and concerned about the commitment of this Congress to follow \nthrough. However, I believe we can follow through. This is a test for \nus. I believe we will be ready to pass the test.\n  The cost to construct these miles of fencing and barriers will run \nbetween $1 and $3 million per mile for fencing, based on whether the \nmilitary constructs the fencing or they use private contractors, and \nthey are authorized to use contractors that they supervise, and $1.4 \nmillion per mile of vehicle barriers. The total construction cost for \nthese miles will be less than $2 billion. That is not a small amount of \nmoney, but it is a manageable amount.\n  In a budget that spends over $900 billion a year, we ought to be able \nto find a couple of billion dollars to follow through on a commitment \nwe made and the commitment the American people expect us to fulfill.\n  Fencing is a proven approach. With the establishment of the San Diego \nborder fence, crime rates in San Diego have fallen off dramatically. \nAccording to the FBI crime index, crime in San Diego County dropped 56 \npercent between 1989 and 2000, after the fence was built. This is a \nwhole county. It was a huge lawless area. Congressman Duncan Hunter, \nchairman of the House Armed Services Committee, lives in San Diego. He \ncalled me several months ago to give me some personal insight into the \neconomic growth, the security, and safety on both sides of the border, \nafter this lawless area was brought under control by a fence. It is a \nproven success.\n  Vehicle drive-throughs, where people drive across the border and run \nright past anybody who may be watching them, have fallen between 6 to \n10 per day before the construction of the border infrastructure to only \nfour drive-throughs in the whole year of 2004.\n\n[[Page S8574]]\n\nThose occurred only where the secondary fence was incomplete. It is \nundeniable that fencing has reduced illegal entries into San Diego.\n  According to the numbers provided by the San Diego sector Border \nPatrol in February of 2004, apprehensions decreased from 531,689 in \n1993--they apprehended 531,689 people on the San Diego sector in 1993. \nAs a result of the fencing at the most busily crossed area in 2003, \nthere were 111,515. Isn't that great? That is about one-fifth as many, \nindicating that one-fifth as many people were trying to cross the \nborder overall. They apprehended in the San Diego area last year--in \n2003--111,000 people attempting to enter this country illegally, and \nthere are hundreds of thousands now crossing in Texas and Arizona, far \nmore than are crossing where the San Diego fence was built.\n  So the scope of this problem is huge. I can't understand the concern \nthat people would have that barriers would be somehow impractical when \nwe are dealing with these kind of numbers. Fencing has also reduced \ndrug trafficking in San Diego. In 1993, before the fence, authorities \napprehended over 58,000 pounds of marijuana coming across the border. \nIn 2003, after the fence helped stem the tide, only 36,000 pounds of \nmarijuana were apprehended. In addition, cocaine smuggling decreased \nfrom 1,200 pounds to approximately 150 pounds. We have made a lot of \nprogress there. We need to replicate that. We have learned from it, and \nwe need to follow our own example. It is a one-time expense that this \nbill would meet and will allow us to meet those challenges.\n  I am convinced that physical barriers at the border are an essential \npart of a cost-effective solution to our current border security \ncrisis. Virtual fences are intriguing and may be good in remote areas, \nbut they don't impress me with regard to high traffic areas where we \nare talking about half a million or a million people crossing per year. \nThere are only two alternative routes that we can take to secure the \nborder: manpower alone or manpower plus infrastructure. We can take \neither: just personnel alone or we can do personnel plus \ninfrastructure. The latter is much more cost effective. It will save us \nmoney.\n  Attempting to secure the entire 2,000-mile border with manpower alone \ncould require as much as 150,000 agents, if you put 15 per mile over \nthe 2,000 miles of the border. Then you have 7 days a week, 24 hours a \nday. How serious is this? It is a huge cost, were we not to have \nbarriers at the most troubled areas.\n  If we only build a virtual fence and not a real one, we will be \nspending millions on technology to detect illegal crossings, and then \nwe will be spending millions on manpower to chase down, apprehend, \narrest, process, and deport the illegal crossers. That is not what we \nwant to do. We don't want to play an expensive game where we catch and \nrelease and chase and catch and apprehend and pay to deport and pay to \nhouse while they are being deported. Apprehension is manpower \nintensive, slow, and legally complex. It requires additional related \nactivities and costs such as incarceration and repatriation, courts, \nappeals, transport, lawyers. We don't want to do that. We want to get \naway from that.\n  We want to send a message to the world that this border is no longer \nopen, that if you attempt to cross our border illegally, you are not \ngoing to succeed. You need to apply and wait in line to come legally. \nWe are generous about how many people we allow now and how many people \nwe will allow in the future. We are a very generous nation with regard \nto immigration. We will remain so. But we want people to make their \napplication and wait in line, not to pour across the border. Many of \nthe illegal crossers are coming from areas of the world that have \nterrorist influences. Once they are inside the border, they are that \nmuch harder to catch. Preventing people from coming here illegally is \nthe right approach. Prevention is the right approach. We need to get to \nthat place.\n\n  I talked to President Bush about this issue recently. He agreed that \nwe need to get to what you might call a tipping point. Once we are \nserious and get border enforcement up and going in a real way, we get \nmore Border Patrol agents, we end the catch-and-release policy, we put \nup fences and vehicle barriers, and we have sufficient detention beds \nso people don't have to be released on bail after they have been \napprehended, never to show up again when they are asked to come back to \ncourt, if we end all of that, all of a sudden we will see a dramatic \nreduction in the number of people attempting to come. Couple that with \na really workable biometric identifier card for people who come here \nwith a lawful entry right and a job, and they have to present that card \nor they can't get work, people will wait in line to get that card. If \nwe crack down on businesses who are hiring people without the proper \nidentification, they will quit hiring people. Most businesses will do \nwhat you tell them to do.\n  We can get to that point very easily, far easier than a lot of people \nbelieve, where we can go back to a lawful system of immigration for \nAmerica. That is what the American people want. They have every right \nto insist on it. They have been insisting on it for 40 years. We were \nsupposed to have fixed it in 1986, 20 years ago. We did not do so. I am \ntelling you, this Senator is not going to support any kind of \nimmigration legislation that will not work to serve the interests of \nthe United States and will not create a system that is lawful and not \nlawless. No Member of this Senate should.\n  I urge my colleagues to take this step and vote for this amendment \nbecause it is narrow. It simply adds money to the emergency National \nGuard account already in this bill to provide funds for the \nconstruction of physical barriers on the most vulnerable miles along \nthe southern border, the area that Secretary Chertoff and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security favor. If we don't use the emergency \nfunds provided in the budget for this purpose, they will get used for \nsomething else. The Senate has already voted overwhelmingly to approve \nconstruction of physical barriers along the border. We missed a chance \nto fund that barrier in the Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations bill. With this vote, there are no difficult choices to \nmake. We can actually say to our constituents that we followed through \nand we walked the walk as well as talked the talk. I am confident that \nwe will be successful.\n  I thank Chairman Stevens for his consideration. I understand we may \nhave a vote later this afternoon, which would be pleasing to me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 4802 to H.R. 5631 be the pending business after the conclusion of \nthe Sessions amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4788\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Kyl \nsecond-degree amendment be agreed to; further, that the Senate proceed \nto a vote in relation to the Sessions amendment, as amended, at 2 p.m. \ntoday, with no further second-degree amendments in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4788) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent that \nSenators Kyl and Burns be added as cosponsors to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I thank and commend Senator Stevens and \nSenator Inouye for their hard work on the Defense appropriations bill. \nThey have done a tremendous job of putting together a bill that funds \nprograms critical to the global war on terror.\n  I come to the floor today to talk about another aspect of our \nnational security, and that is our border security. This amendment is a \nborder security emergency supplemental appropriations amendment that I \nfiled to the Defense appropriations bill.\n  At the outset, I made clear to the chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Stevens, and anyone else who was \ninterested, this amendment does not reduce by one penny any funding for \nthe Defense Department or our troops, nor would this amendment add to \nthe budget deficit\n\n[[Page S8576]]\n\nbecause it is emergency spending necessary to control our borders and \nimprove our national security.\n  It has now been about 2 months since the Senate passed a \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill and over 7 months since the House \nof Representatives passed its bill. We are at a stalemate, I think it \nis fair to say, with no apparent way out.\n  While there has been no progress over the past few months on \ncomprehensive immigration reform and border security measures, I remain \noptimistic and certainly committed to sending the President a \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill before the end of the year.\n  The enforcement titles in the House and Senate bills are, upon \ninspection, people would agree, very similar. And there are several \ndifferent proposals for addressing the 12 million people who are \ncurrently living here out of status, including one Senator Kyl and I \nintroduced about a year ago. Others have offered productive and \nconstructive ideas and concepts, and I welcome all those who share my \ngoal of moving this process forward and addressing this subject this \nyear.\n  The main hurdle to a conference with the House and ultimately a bill \napproved by both Chambers is not a lack of common ground between the \ntwo bills. Instead, I submit it is a deep-rooted public skepticism that \nthe Federal Government will enforce the immigration laws and fund \nenforcement programs that are necessary to maintain any level of \nintegrity in our immigration system.\n  Unfortunately, Madam President, their skepticism is warranted. In \n1986, Congress promised the American people that there would be a one-\ntime amnesty and that increased enforcement would then prevent a \nbuildup of illegal immigration in the country.\n  As we know, the amnesty came, but the enforcement did not. Unless and \nuntil Americans are confident that the Federal Government will control \nthe border and enforce the law, they are unlikely to support an \nimmigration bill that includes any temporary worker program.\n  One way to build that confidence is for Congress and this \nadministration to fully fund border security and immigration \nenforcement programs starting with those that the Congress has already \nauthorized and that the President has indicated are necessary to \ncontrol our broken immigration system.\n  What are Americans to think when Congress authorizes additional \nBorder Patrol agents and detention beds and claims then to have dealt \nwith our broken borders, but when Congress turns around, it fails to \nfund the positions and the infrastructure that we just got through \nauthorizing. Unfortunately, that has been the pattern too often over \nthe last years.\n  Last week, Senators Kyl, Isakson, Chambliss, and I sent a letter to \nPresident Bush asking him to send Congress an emergency supplemental \nrequest to fully fund those programs; again, not new programs, by and \nlarge, but programs that have already been authorized by an act of \nCongress, signed into law by the President but never funded, in \naddition to a couple of additional programs the President himself has \nsaid we need in order to deal with this problem. A request by the \nPresident would send a clear message that the time for the status quo \nis over, it is no longer acceptable, and that the Federal Government \nwill fund and, yes, will enforce the immigration laws of the United \nStates.\n  But I am also prepared to proceed with an amendment to this Defense \nappropriations bill, the amendment that is before the Senate. It is my \nhope and desire that by funding enforcement programs that we will \nincrease the credibility of the Federal Government when it comes to \nactually creating a system that will work and will facilitate a \nsuccessful conference on comprehensive immigration reform between the \nHouse and the Senate.\n  This amendment in no way eliminates the need for comprehensive \nimmigration reform. It is not a substitute for it, and I believe that \ncomprehensive immigration reform should and can be done in a single \npiece of legislation. In fact, this amendment, rather than being a \nsubstitute for that comprehensive immigration reform, is just the \nopposite. This amendment will allow us to find common ground on visa \nreform and ways to address the 12 million individuals who are currently \nliving in the shadows and outside our laws.\n  Absent action on this sort of credibility-restoring measure, I am \nafraid that we will find ourselves at a continued stalemate and do \nnothing.\n  My amendment would fund an additional 500 Border Patrol agents, along \nwith the necessary support staff, training, and education to help make \nour borders safe. The President called for an additional 2,500 agents, \nand this appropriations amendment would allow him and us to meet that \ngoal.\n  This amendment would also fund 1,300 additional detention beds which \nwould allow the Department of Homeland Security to end its policy of \ncatch and release more quickly.\n  The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 authorized 8,000 additional beds, \nbut Congress and the President have only funded 6,700 additional beds.\n  This amendment would provide $60 million to fund the US-VISIT entry-\nexit system. But the GAO report released today that revealed that \nundercover agents routinely were able to enter the country with false \ndocuments demonstrates, in as current fashion as today's news, the need \nto move forward with a biometric entry-exit system, and this amendment \nwould provide the funds to do exactly that, something we have already \npassed and has been authorized but which we have not funded.\n  The President has also called for an expansion of the electronic \nverification system that would allow employers to quickly and more \nreliably determine whether new hires are authorized to work legally in \nthe United States.\n  Unfortunately, the basic pilot program, which is a voluntary program, \nbut it is only utilized by a handful of employers, has not been \nsuccessful because it is not mandatory and it is not nationwide, and \nthe Government today, even under this voluntary program, struggles to \nservice the 10,000 employers who do voluntarily participate.\n  If we were serious about expanding the verification system to all \nemployers around the country--which means approximately 6 million \ncompanies--on the timeframes proposed by the House and Senate, Congress \nneeds to fully fund that program. This amendment would do that.\n  Anyone who has visited the border region knows that the \ninfrastructure of our Coast Guard and our Border Patrol is woefully out \nof date. At one point, all of the P-3 surveillance aircraft along the \nborder were grounded due to structural failures. This amendment \ntherefore funds $973 million for Coast Guard improvements in vessels, \naircraft, and equipment, and to replace air assets and engage in air \nfleet modernization--something that is long overdue. This funding was \npreviously passed by the Senate in H.R. 4939, only to be stripped \nduring the conference report.\n  Of course, this amendment alone will not fix our broken immigration \nsystem. We need comprehensive reform. But until Congress regains the \ncredibility it so sorely needs to be able to move forward on \ncomprehensive immigration reform, we will remain stuck as we are now \nwith the Senate, which has passed a bill and the House which has passed \na bill failing to convene a conference and work out our differences and \nactually provide a solution to this problem.\n  We do need comprehensive immigration reform. We need to create a \ntemporary worker program for those who come to our country and want to \nwork legally and then return to their country of origin. We need to \naddress the 12 million individuals who are currently living in the \nshadows who are already present, living among us.\n  I remain committed to comprehensive immigration reform and I will \ncontinue to advocate for a bill that provides economic and national \nsecurity. But I believe that funding for our border security is a \nnecessary and essential step in that direction and I urge my colleagues \nto support this amendment.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At this time there is not a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I wish to compliment our colleague. I know \nthe\n\n[[Page S8577]]\n\nSenator from Georgia wishes to speak so I will simply say this: Senator \nCornyn and I proposed something rather radical here and that is that we \nactually put our money where our mouth is. That is to say, all the \nthings we authorized, all the things the President requested to make \nsure we can secure the border, we actually fund so we can get the job \ndone. That is what this amendment does. It basically takes the \ndifference between what we said we want to do and what we fund and \ncloses the gap so we fund it all. It is an important amendment to \nensure that we can secure the border first as part of a comprehensive \nimmigration reform.\n  I appreciate the work my colleague Senator Cornyn has done. I am \nproud to cosponsor it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent I be included as a cosponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, the heart and soul of comprehensive \nimmigration reform is first and foremost the foundation of a secure \nborder. When we debated in the Senate the comprehensive immigration \nbill that was finally passed, Senator Sessions, Senator Cornyn, Senator \nKyl, myself, Senator Santorum, and others were sponsors of the \namendment that called on the border security being the trigger for any \nprogram granting legal status to someone who is here illegally. That \nstill is the case and is still the foundation on which we must build \ncomprehensive immigration reform.\n  The American people know that in 1986, the last time Congress \nreformed immigration laws, we granted amnesty and promised border \nsecurity. We gave amnesty, but we did not secure the borders. That is \nwhy we had a 3-million illegal alien problem in 1986 and we have a 12-\nmillion illegal alien problem today.\n  It is absolutely essential, too, as the Senator from Arizona said, to \nput our money where our mouth is. The amount of money proposed by the \nSenator is truly an emergency. There is no greater domestic issue in \nthis country than the problems on our southern border with Mexico. \nThere is no greater challenge to American business, industry, and \nagriculture than to have a functioning and a working and a meaningful \nguest worker program. None of those can be accomplished without first \nsecuring the border so people come to the United States the right way \nand the legal way.\n  Our country has always had a pathway to citizenship and it is known \nas legal immigration. Only with the enforcement of our laws and respect \nfor those laws can we bring about a return to legal immigration into \nthe United States of America.\n  I have commented often in speeches I have made around my State that \nthis is a great nation in which we live. You don't find anybody trying \nto break out of the United States of America. They are all trying to \nbreak in because we are a nation of hope and promise. But with an \nabsence of respect for our own security on our own border, we ask for \nand will end up getting significant trouble.\n  Senator Cornyn has brought to the floor a perfect idea: an emergency \nsupplemental as a part of the Department of Defense authorization to \nensure that border security becomes meaningful and becomes real. It is \nabsolutely true, it is a national security issue. And, it is absolutely \ntrue that it is a matter of the defense of our Nation. It is \nfundamentally true that it is the foundation for whatever comprehensive \nreform this Senate and the House will ever agree to.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the Cornyn amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4768, As Modified\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I send a modification of amendment 4768 \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 4768), as modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n                                TITLE __\n\n                 BORDER SECURITY AND IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n               CHAPTER 1--DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n\n   United States Visitor and Immigration Status Indicator Technology\n\n       For an additional amount for ``United States Visitor and \n     Immigration Status Indicator Technology'' to accelerate \n     biometric database integration and conversion to 10-print \n     enrollment, $60,000,000, to remain available until expended: \n     Provided, That the amount provided under this heading may not \n     be obligated until the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives receive and approve a plan for expenditure \n     prepared by the Secretary of Homeland Security: Provided \n     further, That the amount provided under this heading is \n     designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     402 of H.

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the 2007 \nDefense appropriations bill. Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye, as \nwell as the entire committee, worked diligently to produce a bill that \nsupports our troops and provides what our military needs to fight and \nwin the global war on terrrorism. I am pleased to say that this bill \ndoes just that. The bill provides $453.48 billion in new budget \nauthority for the Department of Defense, including the $50.0 billion in \nadditional global war on terror appropriations, and $14.7 billion above \nthe fiscal year 2006 enacted level, excluding supplemental funding. \nThis bill provides our service men and women with the resources \nnecessary to continue and win the global war on terrorism, keep our \ncountry safe, and improve the quality of life for soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, marines, and their families.\n  After visiting with soldiers stationed from the 48th Brigade in \nTallil, Iraq, I am convinced that the members of the Armed Forces are \nwholeheartedly committed to accomplishing the mission. It is my belief \nthat Members of Congress have a duty to support fine soldiers such as \nthese and ensure they have the best training, equipment, and resources \nto defeat our Nation's enemies. We must never forget that it is \nessential we finish the job we set out to do because our own security \nrests in winning the global war on terrorism.\n  Over the past few months, we have seen many amendments that claim \nthat withdrawing from Iraq is the right approach. The Senate wisely \ndefeated those amendments. We have a responsibility to ensure that the \ngovernments of Iraq and Afghanistan are stable, have the ability to \ngovern themselves as sovereign nations, and have the infrastructure \nnecessary to maintain the rule of law. I am proud that the bill before \nus today allows us to continue to fight and win the global war on \nterrorism and also continues to enhance our research and development \nprojects so that we will continue to be able to defeat those who raise \narms against us.\n  One of the key provisions in this bill is the funding for new \naircraft. By appropriating $4.3 billion and approving a multiyear \ncontract for the F-22A, the United States will maintain its position as \nhaving the superior air fighter well into the next few decades. Because \nmy colleagues and I fought hard for multiyear procurement during the \nDefense authorization bill debate, we will be able to save the American \ntaxpayer an estimated $225 million over separate 1-year contracts for \nthe next 60 F-22s. While some dismissed these savings as \n``insignificant,'' funds saved through this multiyear contract can be \napplied to other, crucial priorities during this time of war.\n  I am also very proud of the aspects of the bill which guarantee the \nUnited States will maintain its strategic lift capability. With an \naging fleet, it is imperative we invest now in strategic lift aircraft \nto secure our future. The bill appropriates $867 million to procure C-\n130Js. Coupled with an additional $12 million for the C-5 AMP Program \nand $2.3 billion for C-17 procurement, including language directing the \nDepartment of Defense to budget for additional C-17s fiscal year 2008, \nwe can be assured that the United States will maintain a strategic \nforce projection capability able to respond to crises any place on \nshort notice.\n  We must remember, however, that the best investment we can make is \nnot equipment, but in the warfighters themselves. I am pleased that \nthis legislation appropriates $45 million in supplemental education \nfunding for local school districts that are heavily impacted by the \npresence of military personnel and families, including $30 million for \nimpact aid, $5 million for educational services to support special-\nneeds children, and an additional $10 million for districts \nexperiencing rapid increases in the number of students due to rebasing \nand the BRAC process. I have several bases in my State that will \nbenefit from this funding and I can assure you that this funding is \ncritical to ensuring that children of our military families receive the \nquality education they deserve. As a result of the 2005 base \nrealignment and closure process, Fort Benning and school systems in the \nsurrounding area will experience an influx of approximately 10,000 \nstudents into their school systems over\n\n[[Page S8579]]\n\nthe next several years. This funding ensures that communities like Fort \nBenning will have additional resources to help accommodate these extra \nstudents.\n  Continuing our focus on the families of service members, this bill \nprovides $2 million to support the Reach Out and Read Program on \nmilitary installations world-wide. The Reach Out and Read organization \nseeks to promote literacy and language development in infants and young \nchildren to ensure that they start school with every advantage \npossible. Cited by the National Research Council as an exemplary \nprogram, I am pleased that the bill provides funding for this worthy \ncause. This program makes an investment in the future that I am sure \nwill pay substantial dividends.\n  This bill also provides a well deserved pay raise of 2.2 percent for \nall military personnel, effective January 1, 2007, and approves \ntargeted pay raises for mid-career and senior enlisted personnel and \nwarrant officers effective April 1, 2007. I have heard directly from \ntroops in the field and personnel at Georgia military installations \nabout how important these targeted pay raises are for retaining our men \nand women in uniform in the service and taking advantage of their hard-\nto-replace expertise. I commend the committee for including these pay \nraises in the bill.\n  This is a good bill that is clearly crafted with the needs of our \ntroops and the security of our Nation foremost in mind. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in expeditiously approving this legislation so \nthat our men and women in uniform can get the equipment, the benefits, \nand the support that they need and deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4775, as Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I send to the desk a modification of Senator Sessions' \namendment that reflects the amendment offered by Senator Kyl. Since it \nhas not been ordered yet, I believe it is the Senator's right to modify \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A vote has been ordered on the amendment, so \nit does take consent.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent he be permitted to modify his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4775), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 221, line 9, strike ``$204,000,000'', and insert \n     ``$2,033,100,000, which shall be designated as an emergency \n     pursuant to section 402 of S. Con. Res. 83 (109th Congress), \n     the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2007, \n     as made applicable in the Senate by section 7035 of Public \n     Law 109-234.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations and the ranking Member for \ntheir very good work in producing this Defense appropriations bill. It \nhas been my pleasure to serve on this committee for some 25\\1/2\\ years \nwith Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye. I have supported their action \nin providing substantial funding for a robust military and will be \nsupporting this bill.\n  Our first line of defense is diplomacy. We ought to be undertaking \nsome very strenuous efforts at diplomacy on what is happening today in \nthe Middle East with Israel raging a defensive war, having been \nattacked by Hezbollah to the north and Hamas to the south, two \nterrorist organizations.\n  I spoke at some length on this subject on June 16th. My remarks are \nin the Congressional Record. I made the basic point that I thought it \nhighly advisable for the United States to engage in direct negotiations \nwith Iran and in direct negotiations with North Korea to try to solve \nthe problems posed by those nations on the very serious issue of \nnuclear proliferation, with Iran seeking to develop nuclear weapons and \nwith North Korea having nuclear weapons and posing an enormous threat.\n  In the more extensive remarks, which I made back on June 16, I \npointed out the experience I have had in discussions with Hafez al-\nAssad on many visits which I paid to Syria over the years and some of \nthose contacts which I think were helpful in acquainting Hafez al-Assad \nwith the thinking of the West, acting to some extent as an intermediary \nbetween Assad and the Israeli Prime Minister because they would not \ntalk, and perhaps being helpful in getting Assad and the Syrians to go \nto the Madrid Conference in 1991.\n  I picked up some of the efforts of former Congressman Solarz in \ntrying to get Assad to allow the Jews in Syria to leave. And after many \nyears, Assad did that. Whether my exhortations had any influence or \nnot, I cannot be sure. But my own experience has been, in talking to \nforeign leaders, that one-on-one negotiations is highly desirable.\n  I had occasion to talk to Castro, to Chavez in Venezuela, to \nofficials in China. And all of this is set out at some greater length \nin the floor statement I made back on June 16.\n  I made some comments on July 20, again, noted in the Congressional \nRecord, as to what I thought ought to be done with respect to trying to \nwork for a settlement in the Mideast, trying to eliminate Hezbollah as \na threat to Israel's north and Hamas as a threat to the south in \nIsrael.\n  I want to supplement those comments today with the underlying point \nthat a solution to the problems there require some international \npressure, if there is any pressure at all that can be brought to bear \non Iran and Syria to stop backing Hezbollah and to stop arming \nHezbollah and to stop being an accessory before the fact and really a \ncoconspirator with Hezbollah in waging the war against Israel.\n  Earlier this week, on July 31, I wrote to Secretary of State \nCondoleezza Rice, with a copy to U.N. Ambassador Bolton. My letter to \nSecretary Rice applauded the efforts she is making to find a peaceful \nsolution to the Mideast, and saying:\n\n       It is my judgment that no solution is possible, especially \n     as to Hezbollah, until Iran and Syria cease to support \n     Hezbollah's military action.\n\n  I sent a copy of that letter, as noted, to our Ambassador to the \nU.N., John Bolton, and talked to him about the situation. And after \nthose discussions--and I am not looking for any endorsement from \nanybody--I thought that I ought to pursue the matter with this floor \nstatement.\n  We have had a situation where the Iranian Foreign Minister was in \nBeirut earlier this week and parroted the party line from Syria and \nHezbollah in making demands for a five-point program: First, Israeli \nwithdrawal; second, an exchange of prisoners; third, an international \nforce; fourth, that Israel should compensate Lebanon, which is not \nsensible, to put it mildly, in light of the fact that Israel is \nfighting a war in self-defense, which Israel has every right to do \nunder article 51 of the U.N. Charter; and the fifth point pursued by \nthe Iranian Foreign Minister, in talks with the French Foreign Minister \nin Beirut earlier this week, was the formation of an international \ncommission to investigate Israeli war crimes, with the view to \ncompensation--again, an idea which has no merit whatsoever in view of \nthe underlying facts as to what is going on there.\n  We have seen a situation evolve in the fighting there where Hezbollah \nhas fired some 1,500 Katyusha rockets into Israel. They started the \nturmoil and the conflict on July 12 of this year, kidnapping two \nIsraeli soldiers and killing eight others. This is the same Hezbollah \nterrorist organization which, in April of 1983, killed 63 people in a \nbomb attack on the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon. On October 23, 1983 \nHezbollah was responsible for the killing of 241 U.S. servicemen at the \nmarine barracks in Beirut.\n  Since its establishment, Hezbollah has been tracked with the \nkidnapping of more than 30 westerners and has been charged with \ncarrying out attacks from London to Buenos Aires. Hezbollah has killed \nmore Americans than any terrorist group, with the exception of al-\nQaida.\n  The State Department's 2006 Country Reports on Terrorism noted that \nHezbollah ``receives training, weapons, and explosives, as well as \npolitical, diplomatic, and organizational aid, from Iran.'' The report \nfurther states that Hezbollah ``is closely allied with Iran and often \nacts at its behest.'' Further, the report maintains that ``the Iranian \nIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Ministry o Intelligence and \nSecurity\n\n[[Page S8580]]\n\nwere directly involved in the planning and support of terrorist acts \nand continued to exhort . . . Lebanese Hezbollah, to use terrorism in \npursuit of their goals.''\n\n  The same State Department 2006 report on terrorism also describes the \nsupport provided to Hezbollah by the Government of Syria. According to \nthe report: ``Hezbollah receives diplomatic, political, and logistical \nsupport from Syria'' and ``Syria continued to permit Iran to use \nDamascus as a transshipment point to resupply Hezbollah in Lebanon.'' \nMore recently, an intelligence officer said, as reported by the \nWashington Post on July 27 of this year, that, Iranian national \nsecurity chief Ali Larijani was on an unannounced visit to Damascus on \nThursday to discuss the Lebanon crisis with Syrian leaders and to urge \ncontinued support for Hezbollah.''\n  The New York Times, on July 19, reported that 5 days earlier an \nIsraeli naval vessel was attacked by ``a sophisticated antiship cruise \nmissile, the C-802, an Iranian-made variant of the Chinese Silkworm.'' \nExperts cited in this article noted that ``Iran was not likely to \ndeploy such a sophisticated weapon without also sending Revolutionary \nGuard crews with the expertise to fire the missile.'' And the Times \nalso noted that forensics conducted by the Israelis concluded that many \nof the Hezbollah rockets ``including a 220-millimeter rocket used in a \ndeadly attack on a railway site in Haifa . . . were built in Syria.''\n  On February 9 of 2004, the Security Council passed Resolution 1559 by \na vote of 9-0 which called for the disbanding and disarmament of \nHezbollah, the removal of foreign forces from Lebanon, and the \ndeployment of the Lebanese Army to the southern border. After the \nadoption of that resolution, the U.N. issued a statement calling ``upon \nall parties concerned to cooperate fully and urgently with the Council \nfor the full implementation of all its resolutions concerning the \nrestoration in Lebanon of territorial integrity, full sovereignty and \npolitical independence.''\n  An April 2006 report delivered to the Security Council on the \nimplementation of Resolution 1559 was explicitly critical of Iran's and \nSyria's support for Hezbollah. In the report, Secretary General Kofi \nAnnan noted:\n\n     . . . renewed incidents of arms transfers across the Syrian-\n     Lebanese border into Lebanon . . . [is] in contradiction of \n     resolution 1559.\n\n  The report further stated that Hezbollah ``maintains close ties, with \nfrequent contacts and regular communication, with the Syrian Arab \nRepublic and the Islamic Republic of Iran.''\n  All of this paints a conclusive picture of Iran and Syria being \nbehind Hezbollah, having armed Hezbollah, having the rockets in a \nposition with a knife at the throat of Israel, with Israel taking \naction in self-defense, once Israeli soldiers were killed, other \nIsraeli soldiers attacked.\n  And in searching for a resolution to this dire situation, it is \npointless to defang Hezbollah if Hezbollah is going to be resupplied by \nSyria and by Iran. And that is why I have urged Secretary of State \nCondoleezza Rice, by the letter dated July 31, to have the United \nStates seek to bring Iran and Syria before the United Nations for the \nimposition of sanctions if they do not act promptly in furtherance of \nU.N. resolutions to stop arming Hezbollah.\n  My conversations with U.N. Ambassador John Bolton confirmed my view \nthat this sort of U.N. action is urgently needed. I complimented \nAmbassador Bolton on the U.N. resolution--14 to 1--to set the stage for \nthe imposition of sanctions on Iran if Iran does not move ahead to \ncease its development of nuclear weapons.\n  So I urge our State Department to move ahead vigorously to seek the \nimposition of sanctions on Iran and Syria to try to be helpful on this \nserious situation. Without eliminating the source of supply to \nHezbollah, any cease-fire or any resolution would be temporary only.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my \nletter to Secretary Rice be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 31, 2006.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a fuller \nstatement be printed in the Record at the end of these extemporaneous \nremarks\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement of Senator Arlen Specter on the United Nations Obligation To \n              Confront the Iran-Syria-Hezbollah Connection\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President. I have been following the \n     recent developments in the Middle East with great concern. \n     While Israel has rightfully defended itself against the \n     attacks of Hezbollah, I believe the true source of this \n     conflict must be confronted if there is to be an enduring \n     peace in the region. Hezbollah is not a terrorist entity \n     acting solely of its own accord. Rather, Hezbollah is a proxy \n     of Iran and Syria.\n       Despite Israel's withdrawal from Southern Lebanon in 2000, \n     the territory has remained a terrorist safe haven and over \n     the last two weeks has become the launching point for more \n     than 1,500 Katyusha rockets into Israel. This is the same \n     territory from which Hezbollah launched an attack on an \n     Israeli border patrol on July 12, 2006 which resulted in the \n     killing of eight Israeli soldiers and the kidnapping of two \n     others. These unprovoked acts of aggression have resulted in \n     numerous civilian casualties in both Israel and Lebanon.\n       Israel, especially its citizens in the north, have had a \n     knife at their throat for decades. Hezbollah has spent the \n     last 25 years digging in and arming themselves poised to \n     attack Israel. These belligerent acts are not the first to \n     come from Hezbollah. In April 1983, Hezbollah killed 63 \n     people in a bomb attack on the U.S. embassy in Lebanon. In \n     October of that same year, the terrorist group killed 241 \n     U.S. servicemen at the Marine Corps barracks in Beirut. Since \n     its establishment, Hezbollah is believed to have kidnapped \n     more than thirty Westerners and has been charged with \n     carrying out attacks from London to Buenos Aires.\n       I compliment the Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, for \n     her efforts to highlight the connectivity which exists \n     between Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah. These links have \n     contributed to the destabilization of the region and are \n     directly responsible for the outbreak of hostilities between \n     the Israeli Defense Forces and Hezbollah. The UN must \n     proclaim that Iran and Syria's links with Hezbollah will not \n     be tolerated and must be severed. Failure to do so will allow \n     Syria and Iran to remain the obstacle in laying a foundation \n     upon which a lasting peace can be established.\n       The connection between Iran, Syria and Hezbollah is \n     undeniable. According to the State Department's 2006 Country \n     Reports on Terrorism, Hezbollah ``receives training, weapons, \n     and explosives, as well as political, diplomatic, and \n     organizational aid, from Iran.'' The report states that \n     Hezbollah ``is closely allied with Iran and often acts at its \n     behest.'' Further, the report maintains that ``the Iranian \n     Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Ministry of \n     Intelligence and Security (MOIS) were directly involved in \n     the planning and support of terrorist acts and continued to \n     exhort . . . Lebanese Hezbollah, to use terrorism in pursuit \n     of their goals.''\n       The State Department's 2006 Reports on Terrorism also \n     describes the support provided to Hezbollah by the government \n     of Syria. According to the report, ``Hezbollah receives \n     diplomatic, political, and logistical support from Syria'' \n     and ``Syria continued to permit Iran to use Damascus as a \n     transshipment point to resupply Hezbollah in Lebanon.'' More \n     recently, an intelligence officer told The Washington Post on \n     July 27, 2006, that, ``Iranian national security chief Ali \n     Larijani was on an unannounced visit to Damascus on Thursday \n     to discuss the Lebanon crisis with Syrian leaders and to urge \n     continued support for Hizbollah.''\n       The outbreak of violence has made these connections even \n     more apparent. According to officials cited in a July 19, \n     2006 article in The New York Times, on July 14, 2006 an \n     Israeli naval vessel was attacked by ``a sophisticated \n     antiship cruise missile, the C-802, an Iranian-made variant \n     of the Chinese Silkworm.'' Experts cited in this article \n     noted, ``Iran was not likely to deploy such a sophisticated \n     weapon without also sending Revolutionary Guard crews with \n     the expertise to\n\n[[Page S8581]]\n\n     fire the missile.'' The New York Times also stated that \n     forensics conducted by the Israelis concluded that many of \n     the rockets in Hezbollah's arsenal ``including a 220-\n     millimeter rocket used in a deadly attack on a railway site \n     in Haifa . . . were built in Syria.'' It is evident that not \n     only is Hezbollah supplied by Iran and Syria, but that both \n     nations have tacit knowledge of their actions and are \n     directly supporting terrorist operations in Southern Lebanon.\n       On February 9, 2004, the Security Council attempted to \n     plant the seeds for peace when it adopted Resolution 1559 by \n     a vote of 9-0 which called for the disbanding and disarmament \n     of Hezbollah, the removal of foreign forces from Lebanon, and \n     the deployment of the Lebanese army to the southern border. \n     Upon adoption of Resolution 1559, the U.N. issued a statement \n     calling ``upon all parties concerned to cooperate fully and \n     urgently with the Council for the full implementation of all \n     its resolutions concerning the restoration in Lebanon of \n     territorial integrity, full sovereignty and political \n     independence.'' Although Israel fully withdrew its forces \n     from Lebanon, Hezbollah did not disarm. Further, Iran and \n     Syria continued to be an obstacle by providing support to \n     Hezbollah, which prevented the deployment of Lebanese \n     forces to southern Lebanon--an area the State Department \n     has described as a ``terrorist sanctuary''.\n       An April 2006 report delivered to the Security Council on \n     the implementation of Resolution 1559 was critical of Iran \n     and Syria's support for Hezbollah. In the report, Secretary-\n     General Kofi Annan noted, ``renewed incidents of arms \n     transfers across the Syrian-Lebanese border into Lebanon . . \n     . in contradiction to resolution 1559''. Specifically the \n     report cited, ``an incident, in which arms destined for \n     Hezbollah had been transferred from the Syrian Arab Republic \n     into Lebanon. Twelve trucks carrying ammunitions and weapons \n     of various kinds, including Katyusha rockets, crossed the \n     border from the Syrian Arab Republic.'' The report further \n     stated that Hezbollah, ``maintains close ties, with frequent \n     contacts and regular communication, with the Syrian Arab \n     Republic and the Islamic Republic of Iran'' and that \n     implementation of the resolution would require the \n     ``cooperation of all other relevant parties, including the \n     Syrian Arab Republic and the Islamic Republic of Iran.''\n       Secretary General Annan stated, ``with the continued \n     support of the Security Council, the national dialogue, the \n     unity of the Lebanese and the farsighted leadership of the \n     Government of Lebanon, as well as the necessary cooperation \n     of all other relevant parties, including the Syrian Arab \n     Republic and the Islamic Republic of Iran, the difficulties \n     of the past can be overcome and significant headway made \n     towards the full implementation of resolution 1559.'' It is \n     clear that Iran and Syria, have acted in a manner to subvert \n     the implementation of 1559.\n       I believe Iran and Syria, through Hezbollah, are \n     responsible for attacking the State of Israel and should be \n     held accountable. Accordingly, I urge the United Nations to \n     demand the immediate halt of Hezbollah's attacks against \n     Israel, declare Iran and Syria directly responsible for the \n     actions of Hezbollah and demand that all support for the \n     terrorist organization be immediately withdrawn under the \n     threat of sanction.\n       Iran and Syria were three of the original 51 Member States \n     of the United Nations, agreeing to the Charter and accepting \n     its conditions on October 24, 1945. Chapter I, Article 2, \n     Paragraph 2 of the Charter binds ``All Members, in order to \n     ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting from \n     membership, shall fulfill in good faith the obligations \n     assumed by them in accordance with the present Charter.'' The \n     Charter further calls on member states ``to practice \n     tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good \n     neighbors'' and ``to maintain international peace and \n     security.'' Iran and Syria have not practiced tolerance and \n     their actions pose a threat to peace and security.\n       Chapter I, Article 2, Paragraph 3 states that, ``All \n     Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful \n     means in such a manner that international peace and security, \n     and justice, are not endangered.'' Iran and Syria, via \n     Hezbollah, have chosen to support aggression rather than \n     peaceful means in their dispute with Israel.\n       Furthermore, under Chapter I, Article 2, Paragraph 4, ``All \n     Members shall refrain in their international relations from \n     the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity \n     or political independence of any state, or in any other \n     manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United \n     Nations.'' Iran and Syria, who have tacit knowledge of and \n     directly support Hezbollah's actions, have orchestrated and \n     enabled the attacks against the territory of a sovereign \n     nation.\n       The Security Council is bound under Chapter VII, Article 39 \n     to, ``determine the existence of any threat to the peace, \n     breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make \n     recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in \n     accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore \n     international peace and security.'' Accordingly, the UN must \n     recognize that Hezbollah is a threat to the peace, Iran and \n     Syria have enabled Hezbollah to breach the peace and that \n     this connectivity represents a direct threat to the peace. \n     The Security Council should, under Article 40, call on Syria \n     and Iran to cease and desist. Should either nation fail to \n     comply, the UN should move to consider actions, such as \n     sanctions, available under Article 41.\n       In conclusion, Syria and Iran have acted contrary to \n     Security Council Resolution 1559, to the detriment of peace \n     and stability in the region. Iran and Syria enable, arm, \n     support and, to a significant degree, dictate the actions of \n     Hezbollah. It is the duty of the United Nations to directly \n     confront Iran and Syria and take swift and harsh action to \n     rightfully lay the blame of Hezbollah's aggression at the \n     doorstep of Damascus and Tehran.\n       I yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Under the previous order, it is now in order \nto consider amendment No. 4802, as offered by Senator Kennedy.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself, \n     Mr. Reid, Mr. Biden, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Reed, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4802.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require a new National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq)\n\n       On page 150, line 24, insert before the period the \n     following: ``: Provided, That Director of National \n     Intelligence shall, utilizing amounts appropriated by this \n     heading, prepare by not later than October 1, 2006, a new \n     National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq with an assessment by \n     the intelligence community of critical political, economic, \n     and security trends in Iraq, which shall address such matters \n     as the Director of National Intelligence considers \n     appropriate, including (1) an assessment whether Iraq is in \n     or is descending into civil war and the actions that will \n     prevent or reverse deterioration of conditions promoting \n     civil war, including sectarianism, (2) an assessment whether \n     Iraq is succeeding in standing up effective security forces, \n     and the actions that will increase the chances of that \n     occurring, including an assessment of (A) the extent to which \n     militias are providing security in Iraq, and (B) the extent \n     to which the Government of Iraq has developed and implemented \n     a credible plan to disarm and demobilize and reintegrate \n     militias into government security forces and is working to \n     obtain a political commitment from political parties to ban \n     militias, (3) an assessment of (A) the extent of the threat \n     from violent extremist-related terrorism, including al Qaeda, \n     in and from Iraq, (B) the extent to which terrorism in Iraq \n     has exacerbated terrorism in the region and globally, (C) the \n     extent to which terrorism in Iraq has increased the threat to \n     United States persons and interests around the world, and (D) \n     actions to address the terrorist threat, (4) an assessment \n     whether Iraq is succeeding in creating a stable and effective \n     unity government, the likelihood that changes to the \n     constitution will be made to address concerns of the Sunni \n     community, and the actions that will increase the chances of \n     that occurring, (5) an assessment (A) whether Iraq is \n     succeeding in rebuilding its economy and creating economic \n     prosperity for Iraqis, (B) the likelihood that economic \n     reconstruction in Iraq will significantly diminish the \n     dependence of Iraq on foreign aid to meet its domestic \n     economic needs, and (C) the actions that will increase the \n     chances of that occurring, (6) a description of the \n     optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic scenarios for the \n     stability of Iraq through 2007, (7) an assessment whether, \n     and in what ways, the large-scale presence of multinational \n     forces in Iraq helps or hinders the chances of success in \n     Iraq; and (8) an assessment of the extent to which the \n     situation in Iraq is affecting relations with Iran, Saudi \n     Arabia, Turkey, and other countries in the region: Provided \n     further, That, not later than October 1, 2006, the Director \n     of National Intelligence shall submit to Congress the \n     National Intelligence Estimate prepared under the preceding \n     proviso, together with an unclassified summary of the \n     National Intelligence Estimate: Provided further, That if the \n     Director of National Intelligence is unable to submit the \n     National Intelligence Estimate by the date specified in the \n     preceding proviso, the Director shall submit to Congress, not \n     later than that date, a report setting forth the reasons for \n     being unable to do so''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is a request for a national \nintelligence estimate on Iraq. We haven't had one now for 2 years. I \nhave talked with the managers. They will review it. It is under \nconsideration. They will let us know. We will have further comments on \nit later. The managers understand this, and I hope we will have an \nopportunity to dispose of it a little later.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Senator Kennedy's amendment remains the \npending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 4802 is the pending business.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum. I withhold that \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4781\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so I may call up amendment No. 4781 for debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Mr. \n     Obama, and Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4781.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To make available from Research, Development, Test and \n Evaluation, Army, up to $2,000,000 for the improvement of imaging for \n                       traumatic brain injuries)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8109. Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by title IV under the heading ``Research, \n     Development, Test and Evaluation, Army'', up to $2,000,000 \n     may be available for the improvement of imaging for traumatic \n     brain injuries and the adaptation of current technologies to \n     treat brain injuries suffered in combat.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me for a few \nminutes to consider this amendment. It relates to traumatic brain \ninjury. It is a very serious problem with soldiers who are serving in \nIraq and Afghanistan. This amendment addresses the very real medical \nissues and problems they are facing with these serious wounds. Senator \nObama shares my concern of this issue. That is why we are offering this \namendment together today.\n  Our goal is to improve the treatment of the devastating injuries \nwhich are suffered by many of our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Traumatic brain injuries can range from large, penetrating skull \nfractures to concussions which may not be immediately detected.\n  As of January of this year, the Department of Defense reported that \nnearly 12,000 members of the military have been directly or indirectly \nwounded in explosions in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Mr. President, I am going to display a chart at this moment which is \npainful to see. I talked it over with a man who has served in Iraq who \ncommanded troops in Iraq who saw one of his soldiers suffer a very \nserious injury similar to the one I am about to show. I asked whether \nhe thought it was appropriate for me to show this image on the floor. \nHe said, Yes, it is important that the people of this country \nunderstand the kinds of injuries that our soldiers are experiencing and \nwhy this issue of traumatic brain injury is so important for us to \ndiscuss with this amendment.\n  This is an actual x-ray of an American soldier who has been the \nvictim of a traumatic brain injury. Because of an explosion, one can \nsee that a major portion of this soldier's skull was blown off. We are \ntold that there are soldiers who have experienced injuries that are \neven more grievous, and they survived. Through the miracle of \nevacuation and medical treatment, they survive. They go through \nextensive surgeries, and some, this officer told me, end up wearing \nhelmets for long periods of time during their recuperation until they \ncan finally rebuild their skulls so they can start to go through \nrehabilitation and recuperation.\n  This is amazing when we see an image of an x-ray such as this and \nunderstand that many of our soldiers have been subjected to traumatic \nbrain injury of lesser and greater extent and are now returning to the \nUnited States.\n  These brain injuries are often caused by bullet wounds or penetrating \nhead injuries and can also be the result of blasts, obviously bombs, \ngrenades, landmines, missiles, mortar, artillery shells.\n  In the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, traumatic brain injury \naccounts for 22 percent or more of injuries, a larger proportion of \ncasualties than in any other recent war of the United States. It is a \nserious medical challenge for those who treat our soldiers, certainly \nfor the soldiers who are victims of these injuries and their families.\n  With the frequency of attack by rocket-propelled grenades, improvised \nexplosive devices in Iraq and Afghanistan, soldiers are more likely to \nencounter an explosion. Improvements in protective devices, such as \nKevlar helmets and body armor, may make the soldiers more likely to \nsurvive these terrible explosions.\n  More than 1,700 of those wounded in Iraq are known to have sustained \nserious brain injury--1,700 soldiers. Half of these injuries are severe \nenough to permanently impair thinking, memory, mood, behavior, and \ntheir ability to work.\n\n[[Page S8583]]\n\n  This information I am sharing is from official documentation of the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Mr. President, you may recall, however, that back in January, ABC \nNews co-anchor Bob Woodruff sustained a traumatic brain injury from an \nIED when he was embedded with the Army's 4th Infantry Division in Iraq.\n  In a recent survey of 115 soldiers wounded from blast injuries, 62 \npercent had brain injuries, according to the Defense and Veterans \nInjury Center at Walter Reed.\n  According to a recent study by researchers at Harvard and Columbia, \nit is estimated that the cost of medical treatment for those \nindividuals with brain injuries from the Iraqi war will be at least $14 \nbillion over the next 20 years. In Vietnam and previous 20th century \nwars, brain injuries accounted for less than 20 percent of injuries.\n  The effect of these injuries range from short-term minor impairment \nto long-term serious disability. One of the common long-term residual \neffects of traumatic brain injury is the onset of epileptic seizures. \nThese symptoms may begin months or even years after the injury occurs. \nThe more brain tissue a soldier loses as a result of a brain injury, \nthe more likely he or she is to develop seizures.\n  I can recall recently seeing another television show. There was a \nyoung woman, a beautiful young woman, who had volunteered to serve in \nthe Army and was in Iraq. She was the victim of one of these blast \ninjuries and lost a major portion of her skull. She had gone through \nnumerous surgeries and long periods of recuperation. When you saw her \non television, she looked perfect, beautiful as can be, perfectly \nnormal, as if nothing had ever happened to her. It is a tribute to the \nmen and women who treat our soldiers that they do return to this moment \nin their lives where they have a chance.\n\n  When she was asked what life was like, she said: It is still a battle \nevery day, but it is one I am willing to face--double vision, pain, \nthese are things which I am just going to work with.\n  Unfortunately, we know that these brain seizures are also a challenge \nfor these victims. Recurrent late seizures are considered post-\ntraumatic epilepsy, or PTE. Studies have estimated that over 50 percent \nof Vietnam veterans with penetrating head injuries acquired epilepsy as \na result of their injuries.\n  The same statistics apply in Iraq. It means that we will have massive \nnumbers of our soldiers in years to come who have suffered head \ninjuries of varying degrees at least subject to the possibility of \nthese seizures. Unfortunately, our veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan may \nface that future. I hope they do not, but it could happen.\n  Given the heavy incidence of closed head trauma in this war, which is \nless well understood, we may see even more cases.\n  The Army currently does not have a program focused on advanced \ntraumatic brain injury diagnosis that will treat combat wounds and \nrelated ailments, such as PTE. Clearly, such a program would help the \nmore than 1,700 soldiers with brain injuries sustained in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  The Army estimates that there is an annual investment gap of $20 \nmillion in research, development, test, and evaluation for improved \ndiagnostics and other long-term rehabilitative treatments of traumatic \nbrain injuries. These are the Army's own estimates: That they are \nfalling short $20 million for what they need to deal with this serious \nproblem.\n  Senator Obama and I are offering this amendment so that we can focus \na small part of a large bill on defense funds, using them to acquire \nand use technology that can best diagnose, identify, and help us treat \ntraumatic brain injury.\n  Currently, there is a promising technology called diffusion tensor \nimaging, DTI, that could help identify traumatic brain injury that \nmight not be apparent. DTI is similar to an MRI, but it is twice as \npowerful in scanning the brain. DTI identifies damage to the white \nmatter in the brain that frequently causes traumatic brain injury.\n  However, today DTI is currently used primarily to identify noncombat \ndiseases, such as multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia, not for \ndiagnosing combat-related injuries.\n  Before we can deploy this promising technology to help treat our \nsoldiers who suffer traumatic brain injury, we need a greater \nunderstanding of how to use it more effectively. If this research isn't \nfocused soon, we won't be able to deploy DTI technology to combat field \nhospitals or regional medical treatment facilities in places such as \nBaghdad or Landstuhl, Germany, that are very close to the scene of \nbattle.\n  In order to reach the point where DTI can be deployed closer to \ncombat, we need to fund a program that pairs the Army with premier \nbrain institutes in America to focus primarily on diagnosing brain \ninjuries sustained in combat.\n  The amendment that Senator Obama and I offer would do just that. It \nwould allocate $2 million--$2 million--a significant sum for the \naverage person, but in the context of this bill involving billions of \ndollars a very small amount. It would allocate $2 million to premier \nbrain scientists at the University of Chicago where this research is \nunderway and enable them to partner with the U.S. Army to test and \nevaluate DTI technology so that we can establish a standard of care for \ntraumatic brain injury that would bring the advantages of DTI closer to \nthe troops in the field.\n  This will allow us to immediately detect and treat the increasing \nnumber of traumatic brain injury cases caused by combat. In addition, \nthese funds will allow the university to partner with the Army Medical \nResearch and Materiel Command and associated epilepsy advocacy to treat \ntraumatic brain injury survivors with post-traumatic epilepsy.\n  As my colleagues can see, this project is directly related to the \nreal-life needs of our soldiers who have served us so valiantly in Iraq \nand Afghanistan and other theaters. It is a small amount by the \nstandards of this bill, but it could provide the promise of recovery \nfor soldiers who face these traumatic brain injuries. It will go a long \nway toward treating what may be the signature wound of the conflicts in \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  I know this is not included in the bill as it comes before us. I \nhope, despite the debate in the committee, that my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle will consider this amendment.\n  Mr. President, $2 million seems a small price to pay to give these \nsoldiers who have paid such a greater price for America, a chance for \nfull recovery; $2 million doesn't seem like an unreasonable amount to \nbring the very best, modern technology closer to the battlefield so \nthat our soldiers can be treated and treated effectively and treated \nquickly. I hope my colleagues will support our injured troops fighting \nthis war by supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I think I can say with assurance, I am \nprobably the only Member of the Senate who has had a traumatic brain \ninjury in connection with a jet crash in 1978. I have deep respect for \nthe researchers who are involved in this area. But really, this is an \namendment to give the University of Chicago's research team $2 million.\n  The NIH has a substantial number of programs. I am told that through \nthe National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, a whole \nportion of NIH has an extensive traumatic brain injury program that \nsupports basic, translational, and clinical research through grants and \ncontracts through over 100 research teams and investigators.\n  In addition, we have $45 million in this bill that can be used. It is \ncalled the Peer Review Medical Research Program. This amount can come \nout of that $45 million if the Department of Defense needs it. It is up \nto them. To stay within our allocation, we had to notify Members who \nbrought us requests for medical research that we had established this \n$45 million program, and from that the Defense Department can pick \nthese suggestions that come from Members of the Senate, the Congress, \ntoo. The House will be involved in it obviously.\n  This is not a neglected area. We spent over $1 billion in research \ngrants for studies in this area, particularly funding long-term \nresearch in traumatic head injury, head and spine injury, and epilepsy. \nThis amendment deals with epilepsy and its connection with brain \ninjuries.\n\n[[Page S8584]]\n\n  In the past 3 years, an average of $430 million a year has been \nawarded for grants, contracts, and research by the National Institutes \nof Health clinics for epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and injuries to \nthe head and spine. In the last 3 years alone we spent $1.29 billion in \nthose specific efforts in this area.\n  In this current fiscal year Congress encouraged and directed the \nNational Institutes of Health to expand basic and advanced research in \nbrain injury rehabilitation. As I said, they told us they have an \nextensive program there. This is where this money should be taken, in \nthe final analysis. We have been using over three-quarters of a billion \ndollars for research not associated with military programs in the past.\n  We have at least 20 amendments of the same kind that have also been \nsuggested to us. The Senator from Pennsylvania has one. A whole series \nof people have come and said they want to have earmarks on the money we \nhave in that fund. We have not done that because we believe the \nDepartment should take the money and spend it on research that is \nrelated to the demands of the military today.\n  Further brain injury research through the Department of Defense will \nreduce the funds available for military readiness and will ignore the \nvaluable contributions made by NIH and other nondefense research \nentities.\n  I say to the Senator from Illinois, as we discussed in the committee, \nthere is no question it is a good program. There is no question the \nUniversity of Chicago should compete with other universities for the \nmoney that is available. For this to be earmarked here now means they \nno longer have to compete. As I said, NIH said there are currently over \n100 separate contracts out there right now in addition to the $45 \nmillion we have in this bill. NIH has an enormous amount of money and \nthe expertise of NIH and their clinical trials. The program they have \nfor allocating money, I think, should not be obviated by an earmark \nhere on the floor.\n  If it happens, if the Senate wants to adopt this amendment, then I \ncan tell them in all fairness we are going to have to bring forth the \namendments of the other Senators. Several of them, as a matter of fact, \nare from Senators who are up for election. We told them no. So I say to \nthe Senate, if you want to adopt this amendment of the Senator from \nIllinois to give the University of Illinois priority on this money, \nthen that is the judgment of the Senate. I oppose it, as I did in \ncommittee. I do think we have to stop using Defense money for contracts \nwith universities and basic research at the suggestion of a single \nSenator. It is not something that should be done.\n  We have adequate money in this bill to cover this if the Department \nwants to do it. We have an overwhelming amount of money in the NIH \narea, if NIH wants to pursue having the University of Chicago do this \nepilepsy research, but this is not a military requirement.\n  All the Senator said about injuries that are coming from current \nmilitary involvement is correct. But they are being met. Not one member \nof the military society came to us and said we need more money for \nbrain research--not one. This is not something to be handled with an \namendment on the floor, to give one university priority over all others \nin connection with the research money that is available under this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been my honor to serve on the \nAppropriations Committee and on this subcommittee. It is an important \nsubcommittee, one of the most important subcommittees in terms of our \nnational defense.\n  A decision was reached, probably before I was elected to the Senate, \nthat we would dedicate funds within this appropriation for medical \nresearch. Some have questioned them over the years. I have never \nquestioned them. I believe it is important that we pursue medical \nresearch, not only at the National Institutes of Health--which, \nincidentally is facing a cutback in medical research funds in this \nPresident's budget this year--but also when it comes to our military \nmedical research. They are very competent. They have been very good. \nThey have included in their research enormous opportunities, \nopportunities which relate directly to the soldiers in combat and \nopportunities which relate to them and their families.\n  Breast cancer research is included in this. I totally support it. I \napplaud it. I voted for it. There is no question about that. What I am \ntalking about here is traumatic brain injury to soldiers. This is \nsomething that has become the signature wound of this conflict in Iraq. \nThe amount of money which I am asking for, $2 million, pales in \ncomparison to the millions and millions of dollars earmarked in this \nbill for universities, specific universities for specific medical \nresearch.\n\n  The Senator from Alaska cannot tell me that every dollar in medical \nresearch in this bill is peer reviewed. It is not. You know it and I \nknow it. Decisions were made by the committee to earmark certain \nresearch at specific universities. I will tell the Senator, I didn't \nquestion that. I deferred to his judgment and the judgment of Senator \nInouye on that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield? I will be pleased to have you \npoint that out to me.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Page 241.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have had $3 billion requested of our subcommittee for \nmedical research. It is the largest growth area in this subcommittee's \njurisdiction. More and more money for medical research was requested. \nWe put $45 million into this program. I want to see that earmark.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is page 241 that I refer the chairman to. What we are \ntalking about here is $2 million. The Senator from Alaska has said we \ncan't afford this. We cannot afford this medical research. It will be \nat the expense of our readiness, the ability of our soldiers to fight.\n  I am prepared to make the same offer I made to the Senator in \ncommittee. I am prepared to take $2 million--Senator Obama and I will--\nfrom existing projects we alone offered in this bill, $2 million we \nwill take out of those projects to go into this medical research for \ntraumatic brain injury so you cannot make the argument that the $2 \nmillion is at the expense of anything else related to readiness.\n  These are dollars that only we requested, dollars given to us in the \nbill, and we believe this is a higher priority. So the argument that \nsomehow we are taking money away from military readiness does not \napply.\n  To argue that $2 million for traumatic brain injury should be \ndisqualified because it would go to the University of Chicago? It turns \nout the University of Chicago is one of the premier institutes when it \ncomes to this new technology. I am not going to argue about money going \nto any university if it is the right place to send it, and we believe \nthe credentials of this institution stand up against the best in \nAmerica--the best in the world. Isn't that what we want for our troops?\n  As far as being an earmark, I plead guilty, it is an earmark. But it \nis being discussed right here on the floor of the Senate, the exact \ndollar amount, the exact recipient, and the exact purpose. There is \nnothing that is being done here under cover of night. It should not be.\n  Why is it so hard for us in a bill of this magnitude, with all of \nthis spending, to find $2 million for epileptic seizures from traumatic \nbrain injury when we have so many of our soldiers returning with this \nproblem? Wouldn't we want to at least err on the side of these soldiers \nto get them back, as quickly as possible, recovered, as close as \npossible to normal lives?\n  I don't understand it. I can't understand the opposition of the \nchairman. I am prepared--maybe it is best now to go ahead and do it. I \nam prepared to say we will take the $2 million out of existing projects \nin the bill.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4781, As Modified\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to modify the pending amendment and send this \namendment in its place to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does this require unanimous consent?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I don't need consent to modify my amendment under the \nSenate rules.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment (No. 4781), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n\n[[Page S8585]]\n\n       Sec. 8109. (a) Improvement of Imaging for Traumatic Brain \n     Injuries.--\n       (1) Additional amount for research, development, test and \n     evaluation, army.--The amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by title IV under the heading ``Research, \n     Development, Test and Evaluation, Army'' is hereby increased \n     by $2,000,000.\n       (2) Availability.--Of the amount appropriated or otherwise \n     made available by title IV under the heading ``Research, \n     Development, Test and Evaluation, Army'', as increased by \n     paragraph (1), up to $2,000,000 may be available for the \n     improvement of imaging for traumatic brain injuries and the \n     adaptation of current technologies to treat brain injuries \n     suffered in combat.\n       (b) Offset.--\n       (1) Other procurement, air force.--The amount appropriated \n     by title III under the heading ``Other Procurement, Air \n     Force'' is hereby reduced by $1,000,000.\n       (2) Defense health program.--The amount appropriated by \n     title V under the heading ``Defense Health Program'' is \n     hereby reduced by $1,000,000.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. That argument is gone. This $2 million is from our \nprojects that only we requested, that we are prepared to give up for \nthis medical research for the soldiers. Now what is the next argument? \nThat we don't need it, when 1,700 of our soldiers have already suffered \ntraumatic brain injuries? We are prepared to take it out of our own \nprojects for soldiers who are going through this kind of an injury.\n  Why do you still resist it?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, those 1,700 or however many you have, \nsoldiers, aren't going to the University of Chicago. This is simply a \nprovision to take $2 million of the defense money for the University of \nChicago for epilepsy research. As I said, we had a total of $3 billion \nin requests from this subcommittee for medical research from other \nSenators. We turned them all down. The Senator from Illinois wouldn't \ntake ``no.''\n  I understand his position. His position is he now wants to say other \nitems we allowed him to earmark in other portions of the bill would be \nchanged in order to have this go to the University of Chicago.\n  Every Senator who asks for that money is going to come wanting to do \nthe same thing. In other words, it will not make any difference. The \nmoney will be going to medical research instead of going to the needs \nof the military.\n  I didn't say it was for readiness. I said we could not have any more \nmoney going out of the Defense bill to take care of medical research \nwhen medical research is basically a function of NIH and the \nsubcommittee that deals with Labor, Health, and Human Services. It is \nnot our business.\n  I confess, I am the one who made the first mistake years ago. The \nSenator just reminded me. I am the one who suggested that we include \nsome money for breast cancer research. It was languishing at the time. \nIt was back in the 1980s. Since that time it has grown to $750 million \nthat was involved, I think it was, in the last bill we had, dealing \nwith medical research that had nothing to do with the Department of \nDefense.\n  With the shortage of money we have now, we are now over the budget by \nabout $78 billion in emergency money. Don't tell me I am objecting to \nbrain research. As I said, I have been the subject of brain research. \nBut there is plenty of money there for it.\n  I notice the occupant of the chair suggests maybe I need a little bit \nmore.\n  But as a practical matter, we cannot do this just for one Senator, \nand I have been a whip and I understand what it means to have access to \nthe floor and make a demand. But this is not right. I say to the \nSenate, if we are going to vote this $2 million, I am going to go back \nand tell each one of the other Senators they should come and offer \ntheir amendments, too. They are very well-meaning amendments. I have to \ntell you, we have back injury. We have problems with regard to a whole \nseries of items. Among the amendments proposed were tissue engineering; \nanother traumatic brain injury study for a long-term concept of a study \nof that; vaccine health care centers; eye refractive surgery; \nhypothermia; hemostatic agents; traumatic brain injury research at \nseveral other universities.\n  One of the reasons we turned this one down is we could not in good \nfaith take the one from the University of Chicago in Illinois and take \ndown the others. We had neuromuscular research. I could go on and on.\n  The things all added up to $3 billion. This is just the tip of the \niceberg. It is $2 million, but it leads into, Why should we take this \namendment of the Senator from Illinois and turn down all these other \namendments? We turned them down, not because they were not worthy. We \ndidn't turn them down because they were not necessary. We turned them \ndown because this is not the place to fund them.\n  It is my position that the suggestion we are going to turn around and \ntake it out of another provision in the bill that says why did we agree \nto that other provision, if it is not necessary? Why did we add it to \nthe bill?\n  As a matter of fact, I don't recall those items where we did, but we \ndid handle several amendments for the Senator from Illinois. We treated \nthem the same as we did every other Senators with regard to research \nfor medical purposes. This is the only one out of all of them where we \nsaid, no, that has been presented to the Senate.\n  I do not want to be accused of being against brain research or \nignorant of the fact that there is an enormous number of brain injuries \nto our military people. As a matter of fact, I went out to Walter Reed \nto see one of our young people from Alaska who had a brain injury. But \nno one, again, has told me we need money in this bill for brain \nresearch beyond what is there already and beyond what is being made \navailable by NIH.\n  I do say again, this amendment should not be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I don't want to belabor this. I think we \nhave covered most of the ground. But I will tell the chairman, the \nSenator from Alaska, the Army estimates annual investment gaps of $20 \nmillion in research, development, test, and evaluation for improved \ndiagnostics and other long-term rehabilitative treatment of traumatic \nbrain injury.\n  I am not making this up from whole cloth. This is the Army's own \nreport. To suggest that we have all the funds we need in this area, to \nsuggest they couldn't figure out what to do with $2 million just isn't \nbacked up by the Army's own official statements about what is needed. \nThey need $20 million. We are offering $2 million.\n  The Senator has argued that we are taking it from some other areas of \nthe bill. Senator Obama and I are offering $1 million each from \nprojects included in the bill, which will slow down their development \nbut will put more money into medical research in traumatic brain \ninjury. And, yes, the University of Chicago is a leader. I don't \napologize for that. Wouldn't you want to go to a leading institution \nwith $2 million for 1,700 soldiers facing traumatic brain injury?\n  I don't want to belabor the point other than to say to the Senator, \nwhom I tried in the committee to reason with, that we are prepared to \nmake sacrifices in other areas for what we consider to be a very \nimportant medical priority, and he wouldn't allow us to go forward. I \ntried here on the floor; I am trying now.\n  At some point, I would like to have my colleagues vote. I think \ntraumatic brain injury is a serious issue. We need to put more \nresources into it. We need to give our soldiers the very best \ntechnology.\n  Senator Obama and I will offer this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Menendez and Salazar be added \nas cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4776\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 4776.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4776.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S8586]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide that, of the amount appropriated or otherwise made \navailable by title II for the Air Force for operation and maintenance, \n  $10,000,000 shall be available for an interoperable communications \n           capability for the United States Northern Command)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by title II under the heading ``Operation and \n     Maintenance, Air Force'', $10,000,000 shall be available to \n     provide the United States Northern Command with an \n     interoperable mobile wireless communications capability to \n     effectively communicate with Federal, State, and local \n     authorities.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4776, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the \namendment with a modification which I am sending to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to modify the \namendment.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 4776), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by title II under the heading ``Operation and \n     Maintenance, Air Force'', up to $10,000,000 may be available \n     to provide the United States Northern Command with an \n     interoperable mobile wireless communications capability to \n     effectively communicate with Federal, State, and local \n     authorities.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nLevin and Warner be added as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I also understand that this amendment \nwill be accepted as part of a managers' package. I want to say thank \nyou to both the Senator from Hawaii and the Senator from Alaska, the \nfloor managers, for accepting this amendment.\n  At the outset of my brief comments on this amendment, I also want to \nsay that I very much appreciate the leadership of both Senator Inouye \nand Senator Stevens. I had the great honor of participating in some \nactivities with Senator Inouye within this past week and hearing his \nown story of his personal courage and fight against discrimination, and \nhow he has stood up for our country is something that makes me very \nproud to be an American. I think with Senator Inouye's life story one \ncan see how far it is we have come as a country. And he is a living \nexample of the kind of heroes that we need in America today in these \ndifficult times which we face as a nation.\n  I commend both Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye for bringing this \nvitally important bill to the floor. While servicemembers are fighting \noverseas, this bill is one of the most important actions that we can \ntake this year on the Senate floor.\n  This bill takes care of our troops and I look forward to its passage \nbefore the August recess.\n  Protecting its citizens from attack is our Government's most \nimportant responsibility. Liberty and prosperity are impossible without \nsecurity here in our Nation and in our homeland.\n  We must see to it that we are making the right investments to protect \nAmericans from attack.\n  In the last few years the threats facing our Nation have grown in \nsize and complexity. Rogue nations are developing nuclear weapons as we \nspeak. Terrorist organizations are recruiting and new members and have \nbeen plotting attacks against Americans. And American service men and \nwomen are in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan as we speak.\n  Our way of life and our freedoms depend on our ability to confront \nthese threats. They depend on our ability to make smart, forward-\nthinking investments in our national defense.\n  I am proud to represent a State that contributes so much toward \nachieving these objectives. An in-depth look at this bill shows just \nhow prominent a role Colorado plays in contributing to our national \ndefense and our homeland security. I am happy to support those measures \nin this bill that focus on Colorado's military installations, such as \nthose that will benefit Fort Carson, Schriever Air Force Base, Peterson \nAir Force Base, the United States Air Force Academy, and Pueblo \nChemical Depot.\n  Furthermore, this bill contains additional emergency supplemental \nmoney for the ongoing campaign in Iraq. This money is necessary to make \nsure that our fighting men and women are provided with the equipment \nthey need to be safe and to get the job done. Recently there have been \na number of military commanders saying that overall military readiness \nis on the decline. Military equipment is wearing out in the harsh \nenvironment of the desert. I am very troubled by these reports, and am \ntherefore very proud to support the measure introduced by Chairman \nStevens and Ranking Member Inouye last night to counteract this decline \nin readiness by adding $13.1 billion to the bridge fund for Army and \nMarine Corps equipment reset requirements. This money is necessary for \nthe continuing combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. I thank my \nfriends--the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii, as well \nas Senator Reed of Rhode Island and Senator Dodd of Connecticut--for \ntheir leadership on this important issue.\n  The amendment I offer directly impacts our homeland security, by \nproviding the United States Northern Command, known as NORTHCOM, with \nan emergency, mobile, fly-away interoperable communications capability.\n  Northern Command is headquartered in Peterson Air Force Base in \nColorado, and is a crown jewel of our Nation's homeland defense.\n  The U.S. Northern Command was established on October 1, 2002 to \nprovide command and control for DOD homeland defense efforts and to \ncoordinate military assistance to civil authorities. NORTHCOM serves to \ndefend America on our native soil.\n  Specifically, NORTHCOM's mission is to conduct operations to deter, \nprevent, and defeat threats and aggression aimed at the United States, \nits territories and interests within the assigned area of \nresponsibility; and as directed by the President or Secretary of \nDefense, provide military assistance to civil authorities including \nconsequence management operations.\n  The area of responsibility that falls under Northern Command is vast. \nTheir responsibility encompasses the continental United States, Alaska, \nCanada, Mexico, and the surrounding water out to approximately 500 \nnautical miles. It also includes the Gulf of Mexico, Puerto Rico and \nthe U.S. Virgin Islands.\n  NORTHCOM plans, organizes, and executes homeland defense and civil \nsupport missions. NORTHCOM's civil support mission includes domestic \ndisaster relief operations that occur during fires, hurricanes, floods, \nand earthquakes. Support also includes counterdrug operations and \nmanaging the consequences of a terrorist event employing a weapon of \nmass destruction.\n  It is quite clear to all of us, that in the few short years that \nNORTHCOM has been in existence, it has quickly become integrated into \nthe very fabric of our homeland defense. NORTHCOM exists to provide the \nunity of command that is absolutely necessary when responding to \nemergencies that immediately threaten Americans on their home soil. I \nknow that the men and women at NORTHCOM work hard every single day to \nmake sure that we are safe, and I thank them for their dedication and \ntheir unswerving devotion to duty.\n  But thanking them is not enough. We, the Congress, have to provide \nthem with the tools necessary to do their job. And one thing they lack \nright now but desperately need is an interoperable communications \ncapability.\n  The amendment I am proposing will benefit the entire country, because \nit will provide NORTHCOM with the interoperable communications \nequipment they need in order to respond effectively during an \nemergency.\n  Northen Command's top unfunded requirement is the purchase of these \nsystems. Without interoperable communications, NORTHCOM, the Department \nof Homeland Security, and local and State authorities cannot \neffectively respond to natural and manmade disasters. A $10 million \nincrease in fiscal year 2007 funds for NORTHCOM would allow the command \nto procure an interoperable mobile communications capability.\n  This amendment cosponsored by Senator Warner and Senator Levin will\n\n[[Page S8587]]\n\naccomplish that. It is legislation that we have approved before in the \nSenate.\n  When we spoke about this with respect to the budget resolution and \nthe Department of Defense authorization bill, it was approved by the \nSenate.\n  Language included in the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 2007 specifically referred to the $10 million for \ninteroperable communications.\n  On page 293 of that report, we in the Senate said the following:\n\n       U.S. Northern Command requires the capability to \n     effectively communicate with Federal, State, and local \n     governments in order to facilitate support to civil \n     authorities, share information, and provide situational \n     awareness in response to natural or manmade disasters.\n\n  The committee recommends an increase of $10 million to OMAF to \naddress this funding shortfall and to provide the interoperable \ncommunications capability for USNORTHCOM.\n  My amendment follows that recommendation.\n  The Nation cannot afford to wait for the next disaster to strike \nbefore we purchase this equipment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank the Senator \nfrom Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii for their consideration and for \ntheir support of this amendment. I am proud to offer this amendment and \nagain thank both Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens for their \nleadership on Department of Defense appropriations legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4806\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself and Mr. \n     Wyden, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. \n     Cantwell, and Mr. Salazar, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4806.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit the suspension of royalties under certain \ncircumstances, to clarify the authority to impose price thresholds for \n  certain leases, to limit the eligibility of certain lessees for new \n        leases, and to restrict the transfer of certain leases)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. ROYALTY RELIEF FOR PRODUCTION OF OIL AND GAS.\n\n       (a) Price Thresholds.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of law, the Secretary of the Interior shall place limitations \n     based on market price on the royalty relief granted under any \n     lease for the production of oil or natural gas on Federal \n     land (including submerged land) entered into by the Secretary \n     of the Interior on or after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (b) Clarification of Authority to Impose Price Thresholds \n     for Certain Lease Sales.--Congress reaffirms the authority of \n     the Secretary of the Interior under section 8(a)(1)(H) of the \n     Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(1)(H)) \n     to vary, based on the price of production from a lease, the \n     suspension of royalties under any lease subject to section \n     304 of the Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief \n     Act (Public Law 104-58; 43 U.S.C. 1337 note).\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, let me briefly describe what this amendment \ndoes. We will have a unanimous consent request later today to deal with \nthis amendment in the most expeditious way. I appreciate the \ncooperation of Senator Stevens and his staff and Senator Domenici in \nhelping to work out how we deal with this particular amendment.\n  This amendment deals with some unfinished business before the Senate. \nAs we will recall, yesterday the Senate overwhelming passed S. 3711, \nwhich is the Gulf of Mexico Security Act of 2006. This bill would open \nnew areas off the gulf to oil and gas exploration and development. S. \n3711, which I voted for, is an important first step in providing our \nenergy independence and reducing energy prices for American consumers. \nOnce again, it raises a matter of concern: a history of lapses and \nmistakes in royalty collection and payments for oil and gas production \nunder deepwater leases. It also underscores the prospect that future \npayments will go uncollected due to royalty provisions that are still \non the books.\n  We must step up and deal with this unfinished business of royalty \nreform. That is why Senator Wyden and I are offering this amendment \ntoday. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Wyden who has been working \nwith me on a bipartisan basis on this issue, along with Senator DeWine, \nwho is an original cosponsor of this royalty reform legislation, S. \n3760, and Senators Lieberman, Feinstein, Cantwell, and Salazar.\n  There are three important aspects of the royalty program that need \nfixing.\n  First, we need to deal with the mistakes that were committed by the \nClinton administration in 1998 and 1999. In those years, the Department \nof the Interior, through the Mineral Management Service, issued leases \nthat did not include price thresholds. That is a big deal. Energy \nprices have skyrocketed, and without price thresholds to trigger \npayment for royalties, the U.S. Government and the American people will \nnot see a dime from these leases. The GAO estimated that this mistake \ncould cost the taxpayers at least $7 billion in lost revenues to the \nU.S. Treasury.\n  Second, we need to deal with leases that were issued in 1996, 1997, \nand 2000 that included price thresholds in the lease terms but which \nare being challenged. A few of the oil and gas companies who signed \nleases in those years\n\n[[Page S8588]]\n\nhave refused to pay royalties on production even though the thresholds \nhave been exceeded. One of the companies has sued the Department of the \nInterior, arguing that Interior does not have the authority to \nestablish price thresholds or any leases issued between 1996 and 2000. \nIf the lawsuit is successful, this could have significant implications \nfor royalties already collected. The Federal Government would likely be \nrequired to refund approximately $525 million in royalties paid by the \nindustry and be precluded from collecting between $18 billion and $28 \nbillion over the next 5 years.\n  Third, we need to deal with new leases that have royalty relief in \nthe lease terms. In the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress \nreinstitutes royalty relief on production in the deep waters but did \nnot require the Department of Interior to put price thresholds in new \nleases that include royalty relief. The 1998 and 1999 leases \ndemonstrate that the Interior Department can't be trusted to do this on \nits own, and we cannot afford another $7 billion mistake.\n  Let me explain how the amendment fixes these three problems. Let's \ntake the 1998 and 1999 leases first, since they are the most \ncontroversial. In the context of the fiscal year 2007 Interior \nappropriations bill, there have been efforts to address this problem by \nSenator Gregg, Senator Domenici, and Senator Feinstein. This amendment \ntoday builds on those efforts.\n  In our approach, we try to get companies to do the right thing by \ngiving them a choice: Keep your existing leases royalty free but be \nbarred from bidding on new leases or renegotiate in good faith with the \nFederal Government and retain your eligibility to bid on new leases in \nthe future. The major difference in our amendment is that we provide \ntime to renegotiate.\n  Every company that wants to come to the table has a full year from \nthe date of enactment of this Act to reach agreement. One year is more \nthan enough time to address any concerns that need to be explored and \nworked out. I am told many of the companies holding leases from 1998 \nand 1999 are already renegotiating those leases. I applaud the efforts \nof those companies. However, Congress cannot stand by and watch \nconsumers pay record prices at the pump knowing that American taxpayers \nare not getting fairly compensated for the oil and gas extracted from \npublic land. We need to deal with this problem.\n  Incidentally, I note that Senator Domenici has inserted in a separate \nappropriations bill an amendment that deals with this problem, \nhopefully, over the course of the next year. What Senator Wyden and I \nare saying is let the process that Senator Domenici has begun have an \nopportunity to work. We hope it does work. But in the event that it \ndoes not work after a year, our amendment kicks in to, in effect, force \na solution.\n  The other two fixes are less controversial and probably in the future \nactually even more important. Let's turn to the leases first issued \nbetween 1996 and 2000 and the Secretary's authority to impose price \nthresholds limiting royalty relief when oil and gas prices are high. \nThe amendment we are offering simply reaffirms that Congress intended \nthe Secretary to have the authority to vary the suspension of royalties \nbased on the price of production in all leases subject to the deepwater \nroyalty relief action. The language is exactly the same as Senator \nDomenici offered on another bill. After all, the whole point of royalty \nrelief was to provide companies that undertook high-risk investments in \ndeep water specific volumes of royalty-free production to help cover a \nportion of their capital costs before starting to pay royalties. It was \nnot to pad the pocketbooks of the oil and gas companies at the expense \nof the American taxpayer. Price thresholds are the mechanism that \nensures the companies do not benefit from both high market prices and \nroyalty-free volumes.\n  Finally, Congress needs to require that new oil and gas deepwater \nleases that the Federal Government issues include price thresholds. \nThis seems like a no-brainer, but right now there is no requirement \nthat price thresholds be included in leases that have royalty relief. \nThe language says ``may,'' not ``shall.'' Our amendment will say \n``shall.'' It is a one-word change that directs the Secretary of \nInterior to include price thresholds in all new leases. This is an \nimportant action to ensure that the Interior Department collects \nroyalties on the American people's energy resources at times when oil \nand gas prices warrant it.\n  I am hoping that as we debate this important Defense bill we can do \nthe right thing and fix this problem. We are talking about a program \nthat accounts for 30 percent of the oil and 23 percent of the natural \ngas produced domestically and is a major source of revenue for the \nFederal Government.\n  According to the Mineral Management Service, Federal revenues from \noffshore leases are estimated at $6.3 billion in fiscal year 2005. Of \nthe $6.3 billion in revenue for fiscal year $2005, $5.5 billion was \nfrom royalties. Securing royalty receipts is important.\n  I recognize this amendment may be deemed legislating on an \nappropriations bill, but my colleagues and I have tried to go the \ntraditional route up to this point to no avail. This problem is too \nimportant to ignore. We are running out of time. We are willing to \nsubmit this amendment to a 60-vote threshold. I look forward to working \nwith Senator Domenici to work an agreement to that effect soon.\n  As President Bush and the oil and gas companies have said, we don't \nneed these additional incentives to explore and develop oil and gas at \ncurrent prices. Let's give the American taxpayer fair compensation for \nthe oil and gas that is extracted from public lands.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree to our amendment. I note, in passing, \nthat the score of this, according to CBO, is a $9 billion revenue gain \nto the Treasury. This is one of those few times when we are actually \ngoing to be able to help the Treasury rather than take some money from \nit.\n  I conclude by thanking my colleague from Oregon. The Senator from \nOregon and I have worked in a bipartisan way now for several weeks. We \nhave come to a good resolution of the issue that our colleagues should \nbe able to support.\n  Senator Wyden is seeking recognition, and I will let him comment at \nthis point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona for working with me on this issue for many months \nnow. Colleagues know that I stood in this spot for almost 5 hours a few \nmonths ago to try to put together a bipartisan effort to save taxpayers \nbillions of dollars. I believe we have done that.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the official \nscore that Senator Kyl and I have now received from the Congressional \nBudget Office, which the Congressional Budget Office has now officially \ninformed us that over the next 10 years, the taxpayers will save $9 \nbillion\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Estimated budgetary impact of Kyl-Wyden amendment to \n     prohibit the suspension of royalties under certain \n     circumstances, to clarify authority to impose price \n     thresholds for certain leases, to limit the eligibility of \n     certain lessees for new leases, and to restrict the transfer \n     of certain leases--Amendment No. 4806.\n\n                                                                            [In millions of dollars, by fiscal year]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               2007       2008       2009       2010       2011       2012        2013         2014         2015         2016       2007- 2011      2007- 2016\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBA........................................          0       -100       -500       -600       -900       -900       -1,100       -1,600       -1,700       -1,600          -2,100          -9,000\nOL........................................          0       -100       -500       -600       -900       -900       -1,100       -1,600       -1,700       -1,600          -2,100          -9,000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: CBO.\n\n\n[[Page S8589]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the reason Senator Kyl and I feel so \nstrongly about this, this is a program that is out of control. The fact \nis that even the sponsor of this program, our distinguished former \ncolleague, Senator Johnston of Louisiana, said this program is not \noperating as Senator Johnston intended.\n  A brief bit of history is relevant. This program began in the 1990s, \nwhen the price of oil was under $20 a barrel. The point of the program, \nas devised by Senator Johnston, nobody could really argue with. We \nneeded to produce energy, and with the economic situation in that part \nof the country, folks were hurting. They devised this program.\n  But no one can make a case for a program that began when oil was $19 \na barrel, when the price of it is now over $70 a barrel. We have a \nsituation where the companies are charging record prices. They are \nmaking record profits. We certainly do not need record subsidies, \nparticularly at a time when we have a program that even the sponsor of \nthe original effort says is not working.\n  This is the biggest subsidy in the energy area. This is one of the \nbiggest boondoggles we have seen operated by the Federal Government. \nThe fact of the matter is, there have been mistakes made under both \nDemocratic and Republican administrations.\n  As I outlined for the Senate several months ago, the initial mistakes \nwere made by those in the Clinton administration which did not lock in \nthe appropriate price thresholds. When former Secretary Norton came \ninto office, she sweetened up the subsidies administratively, and \nCongress went still further with respect to this program in the Energy \nbill.\n  The Government Accountability Office has estimated that at a minimum \nthe Federal Government and the taxpayers are going to be out $20 \nbillion. There is litigation underway that could mean the taxpayers \nwould be out in the vicinity of $80 billion. It is time to draw a line \nin the sand and ensure that this effort to roll back these subsidies \nbecomes law.\n  If the oil industry can keep the Senate from voting on royalties, the \nlegislation the House adopted after Senator Kyl and I came to the \nSenate and discussed it, almost certainly is going to disappear. The \nnegotiations now underway with oil companies, in my view, are going to \nbe dragged out until the last legislative vehicle has left town. Then \nthe companies can walk away from the table and return to feeding at the \nexpense of the taxpayers.\n  Senator Kyl and I have worked very closely with Chairman Domenici. As \nalways, he has been very fair and very straightforward with us.\n  With this approach, we have a chance to get a permanent solution to \nthis giveaway of taxpayer money. We will not interrupt the approach \nthat Chairman Domenici has advocated. We hope it will work. It \nessentially involves negotiations on a voluntary basis. As I have \nindicated in the Senate before, while I hope that works, put me down as \nskeptical because it is fairly implausible that the oil companies will \nsimply walk away from billions and billions of dollars at the \nnegotiating table. If it does work, all the better. If it doesn't work, \nhowever, Senator Kyl and I believe it is finally time for the Senate, \non a bipartisan basis, to lock in a permanent solution.\n  Colleagues, the President, to his credit, has said, ``You don't need \nsubsidies for the oil industry when the price of oil is over $55 a \nbarrel.'' The President made that statement, and I appreciate him \nmaking it. Second, this is an opportunity for the Senate to go back \nthrough these various programs, save taxpayers some money, and to do it \nin a bipartisan way.\n  Even though the President said we do not need incentives with the \nprice of oil over $55 barrel, we did see the Secretary of the Interior \nand the Congress continue to sweeten this royalty relief program, even \nas the price of oil climbed far above the point mentioned by the \nPresident at which the oil industry no longer needs subsidies.\n  We are now faced with the prospect that if we are going to get a \npermanent solution, now is the time for the Congress to step up.\n  I, also, point out, given the fact that the Senate has voted in the \nlast few days to start a new program, a program that will involve \nadditional dollars going out to the oil industry, at a minimum, let us \nsay we are going to fix the old program that is out of control before a \nnew program is started. That is common sense.\n  For the Senate to talk about creating a new program, allowing even \nmore taxpayer money to be given away--and in that case, for 50 years or \nmore--common sense says the Senate should step up before the end of \nthis session and move to permanently fix the old program that is out of \ncontrol.\n  The Senate ought to have an opportunity to debate and vote on a \npermanent solution to ending these oil royalty giveaways. The House has \nvoted to do it. They voted, in a bipartisan way, for the very thing \nthat I spoke at length about in the Senate and that Senator Kyl and I \nhave been trying to change for many months.\n  I also point out, if we can get the savings by fixing the old \nprogram, you can talk about a responsible way for funding new efforts, \nsuch as the effort approved by the Senate this week.\n  I am sure our citizens who now face the highest gas prices ever will \nbe interested to know when the Senate is going to have a chance to vote \non the question of, at this time of record prices and record profits, \nwhether we should continue to give away record amounts of taxpayer \nsubsidies that the President of the United States has indicated are not \nnecessary.\n  If the Senate ducks this issue, I think it will be very difficult to \nexplain to the American people how Congress can be proposing to allow \nadditional billions of dollars of royalty money to go out before it \nfixes the current out-of- control program.\n  I have said for some time the Senate should not be forced into a \nfalse choice of either aiding the Gulf States or standing up for the \npublic interest in the face of outrageous taxpayer rip-offs.\n  We can and should do both. Given what the Senate did earlier this \nweek on the new program, it is, in my view, essential to protect \ntaxpayers to accept the bipartisan amendment that Senator Kyl and I \noffer this afternoon to reform the Oil Royalty Program.\n  Mr. President, I urge colleagues to support the bipartisan Kyl-Wyden \namendment. I would also note--I see Senator Stevens on the Senate \nfloor--that we have a number of sponsors of this bipartisan proposal, \nincluding Senator DeWine, Senator Lieberman, Senator Cantwell, Senator \nFeinstein, and Senator Salazar.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the Kyl \namendment dealing with royalty relief. The amendment would put an end \nto the Federal Government giving the oil and gas industry incentives to \ndrill when oil and natural gas prices are high.\n  The amendment includes a provision that Senator Gregg and I \nsuccessfully included in the Senate Interior Appropriations bill that \nwould fix an administrative error that was made in 1998 and 1999. This \nprovision also passed the House by a vote of 252 to 165.\n  In 1998 and 1999, the Department of Interior inadvertently omitted \nprice thresholds from contracts entered into with oil and gas \ncompanies.\n  This omission has allowed oil companies to produce in Federal waters \nin the Gulf of Mexico for free while consumers are paying $3 a gallon \nat the pump. And it will cost American taxpayers $10 billion over the \nnext 25 years.\n  Essentially, the amendment provides energy companies with a choice: \nThey can keep their existing leases royalty-free if they so choose, but \nbe barred from bidding on a new lease, or agree to renegotiate the \nterms of the existing lease and be free to bid on new leases.\n  In my view, the oil companies do not need incentives at a time when \nthey are making record profits. Just last week, the companies reported \ntheir second quarter profits, and again, they hit new records. \nExxonMobil made $10.36 billion in the second quarter of 2006; that is \nalmost $3 billion more than they made in the second quarter of 2005. \nShell reported a second quarter profit of $7.32 billion--more than $2 \nbillion greater than their second quarter profit in 2005. And BP's \nprofits were $7.27 billion, or just less than $2 billion greater than \ntheir second quarter 2005 profits.\n  The oil companies themselves have said that they do not need royalty \nrelief. At the Joint Energy and Natural\n\n[[Page S8590]]\n\nResources and Committee hearing on November 9, 2005, the oil executives \nwere asked by Senator Wyden:\n\n       Gentlemen, the President says and I quote ``With $55 oil, \n     we don't need incentives to oil and gas companies to explore. \n     There are plenty of incentives.'' Now today the price of oil \n     is above $55 per barrel. Is the President wrong when he says \n     we don't need incentives for oil and gas exploration?\n\n  All responded that they did not need incentives.\n  In addition, a lawyer for Shell Oil, Michael Coney, recently told the \nNew York Times:\n\n       Under the current environment, we don't need royalty \n     relief.\n\n  The amendment passed by the House and by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee has spurred oil companies to admit publicly that they would \nbe willing to renegotiate their leases to include a price threshold. \nBut without congressional pressure, there is no reason for them to \nactually do it. We need to hold their feet to the fire in order to make \nsure the leases are really renegotiated.\n  I just want to take a minute to focus on the issues that the oil \ncompanies have raised in opposition to this amendment: First, they \nraised the issue that foreign companies were going to take over \nproduction in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Nothing could be farther from the truth. Regulations implementing the \nOuter Continental Shelf Lands Act state that ``Mineral leases issued \npursuant to the Act . . . may be only held by Citizens and Nationals of \nthe United States . . . or private, public or municipal corporations \norganized under the laws of the United States or of any State or of the \nDistrict of Columbia or territory thereof . . .''\n  Secondly, the oil companies have argued that the amendment will hurt \noil and gas production.\n  In fact, the amendment will not impact the daily production of more \nthan 1.5 million barrels of oil and 10 billion cubic feet of natural \ngas from the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Oil companies are also free to explore and drill in the more than \n4,000 untapped leases in the Gulf of Mexico that have already been \nleased to them. The amendment simply prohibits oil companies that fail \nto renegotiate existing royalty-free leases from obtaining new ones.\n  Finally, and most importantly, the oil companies say that the \namendment attacks the sanctity of contracts.\n  And the oil companies couldn't be more wrong on this point.\n  CRS has issued two papers now stating that the amendment is \nconstitutional. Specifically, CRS says ``the amendment's incentive to \nrenegotiate . . . gives the government side a classic argument that \nthere is no taking here: the decision of a . . . leaseholder to \nrenegotiate is voluntary, and voluntary actions cannot be the basis of \na taking claim.''\n  In addition, CRS shows that case law supports the fact that amendment \ndoes not violate contracts.\n  The courts have determined that if there is no legal compulsion, the \nvoluntary compromise of a property right in exchange for an economic \nbenefit is not a taking.\n  And I would like to reiterate--the amendment offers energy companies \na choice: compromise a property right--exemption from payment of \nroyalties--in exchange for a possible economic benefit--ability to bid \non new OCS leases.\n  This amendment is not a taking, because the government is not taking \nany property right from the oil companies; it is merely offering an \nincentive to renegotiate their leases--an incentive that the oil \ncompanies are free to decline.\n  We should not be giving away this oil and gas for free while \nconsumers are paying record high prices to fuel their cars and heat \ntheir homes, and oil companies are making record profits.\n  Unless we act to force the companies to renegotiate the leases, \ntaxpayers are going to be left holding the bill for $10 billion.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 4776, as modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that Senator Salazar's amendment No. 4776 be \nplaced before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the managers of the bill are prepared to \naccept this amendment and ask that it be accepted on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 4776), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n     amendments nos. 4778; 4773; 4760, as modified; 4796, and 4771\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have managers' package No. 2 back \nagain. I wish to restate that request now. It applies to amendment No. \n4778, for Senator Smith, regarding airships; amendment No. 4773, for \nSenator Dayton, regarding postdeployment support; amendment No. 4760, \nas modified, for Senator Lott, regarding airdrop systems; amendment No. \n4796, for Senator Conrad, regarding weapons bays; and amendment No. \n4771, for Senator Frist, regarding contracts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and \nthat the Senate proceed to the consideration of this managers' package \nen bloc, and that they be adopted en bloc, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  Mr. INOUYE. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Now, what is the pending amendment, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Kyl amendment No. \n4806.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4805\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know that the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee and particularly this \nsubcommittee are anxious to move this piece of legislation. I thank \nthem for their work. This is perhaps one of the more difficult pieces \nof legislation to put together from the appropriations side. It spends \nan enormous amount of money at a time when we are engaged in wartime \nactivities. There are many accounts that are in urgent necessity of \nbeing replenished and restored.\n  Let me say to the chairman and to the ranking member, I think they \nhave done an excellent job with a very difficult piece of legislation. \nI appreciate their work, and I am privileged to serve on that \nsubcommittee with them and understand the importance this bill will \nhave for the U.S. military at a time when men and women are risking \ntheir lives because their country has asked them to do that.\n  I do want to make a point, however, today, as we pass an \nappropriations bill, and I will make the point understanding that the \nchairman and ranking member will recognize that this is not about how \nmuch money we appropriate but, rather, about how the money is used. I \naccept that in most cases that is a function of authorizing \ncommittees--oversight requirements of authorizing committees--rather \nthan the Appropriations Committee.\n  But I do want to make the point now because we have spent a great \ndeal of money, and will again spend a lot of money--most of it \nemergency funding outside of this particular bill--dealing with issues \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, when all around us we are seeing that a fair \nportion of that money is attached to allegations of misuse and waste \nand, in some cases, fraud.\n  I think all of us, especially those of us on the Appropriations \nCommittee, wish very much to make certain that what we appropriate is \nused to support our troops, to improve the security of this country, is \nused wisely and prudently in support of the things that Congress has \nauthorized.\n  I want to go through some things because I think it is important for \nall of us in Congress to understand the allegations of waste that have \nattended some of this spending. And it is important for all of us on \nthe appropriations and authorizing committees to try to figure out: How \non Earth do we deal with this? What do we do to put a stop to--not \nallegations--the waste of taxpayers' funding?\n  There are so many examples it is hard to know where to start. But \nbecause there have been so few oversight hearings on the bulk of these \nissues, I think it is important to describe what we are hearing. \nTaxpayers in this country have been asked to provide taxpayer funding \nthrough appropriations, and here are some of the examples: contracts \nthat are signed, sole-source, no-bid contracts that extend for some \nlong while.\n  And because they are sole-source, no-bid contracts, and they are \ncost-plus, the taxpayer has been fleeced.\n  These are stories not from someone who alleges to have seen \nsomething, these stories are from people who worked for the \ncontractors, whistleblowers: $85,000 trucks, brandnew $85,000 trucks \nabandoned beside the road to be torched because they had a flat tire; \n$85,000 trucks abandoned to be torched because they had a plugged fuel \npump; a case of Coca-Cola, $45--that is the charge to the American \ntaxpayer--two plates of breakfast, $28 a plate; feed 42,000 soldiers a \nday--and it turns out they were feeding only 14,000 soldiers a day; \nthey missed it by 28,000 in the charges they made to the U.S. \nGovernment--leasing SUVs, $7,500 a month.\n  Hand towels, providing hand towels for our troops, the buyer who was \nasked to buy the additional hand towels for our troops in the war \ntheater said: Here are the hand towels I was going to purchase. And \nhere are the hand towels I was asked to purchase. And the hand towels I \nwas asked to purchase by my supervisor included the embroidered name of \nmy company, which doubled the price of the hand towels. So when I \ncomplained about that, the answer was: It doesn't matter.\n  This is cost-plus. We are the only contractor. The taxpayer will pay \nthe bill. Cost doesn't matter.\n  The list is endless and goes on and on and on. Food service to the \ntroops: A man named Rory, who actually worked in the food service \nkitchens, in Iraq, of the contractor--an employee of the contractor--\nsaid: We routinely got food that was stamped ``expired,'' date-stamped \n``expired.''\n  He said: Our supervisors said it doesn't matter. Feed it to the \ntroops. It doesn't matter. Just feed it to the troops.\n  He said: We were repeatedly told by our supervisors, don't you dare \nspeak to a Government investigator or a Government auditor. If they \nshow up and you talk to them, you are going to be fired. If they show \nup and you talk to them, and you are not fired, you are going to be \nsent to the most hostile area we can find to send you.\n  The fellow named Rory, who showed up and spoke about this, who was an \nemployee and described all of this, in fact, did speak to Government \ninvestigators about what he saw happening to the American taxpayer, and \nhe was sent to Fallujah during the hostilities. That is what happened \nto him.\n  More recently, we have a whistleblower, or several of them, who have \ncome forward to say: We are spending money for a contractor to provide \nwater to our troops at all of the bases in Iraq. That is the money we \nare spending to provide water to our troops.\n  I want to show you some memoranda and some discussions back and forth \nabout what has happened to that spending. This is an internal report \nwritten by Will Granger, who works for the company that has the \ncontract to provide water to all the U.S. bases in Iraq. Will Granger \nis the top employee for Halliburton on the ground in Iraq. Here is what \nWill Granger said in his report:\n\n       No disinfection to non-potable water was occurring at Camp \n     Ar-Ramadi for water designated for showering purposes.\n\n  Incidentally, this is water that the troops use to brush their teeth \nand wash their face and shower.\n\n       This caused an unknown population to be exposed to \n     potentially harmful water for an undetermined amount of time.\n\n  The whistleblowers came forward who were also involved in the \ndelivery of this water. And they said: By the way, the nonpotable \nwater--that is water you do not drink, but water you brush your teeth \nwith and take showers with, and so on--the nonpotable water was more \ndegraded, more contaminated than if they would have taken raw water \nfrom the Euphrates. This is from the whistleblowers.\n  Now, when this became known, the internal report that we had from Mr. \nWill Granger--again, from the same company--said:\n\n       The deficiencies of the camp where the event occurred is \n     not exclusive to that camp; meaning that country wide, all \n     camps suffered to some extent from all or some of the \n     deficiencies noted.\n\n  Now, while all this going on, the company, Halliburton, said: None of \nthis happened. You are wrong. None of this happened.\n  My point is, the discussion of this came from employees of the \ncompany itself and from an internal memorandum that was leaked, an \ninternal memorandum written by the top official on the ground in Iraq \nin charge of water.\n  Will Granger, the man I am speaking of, the man in charge, while his \ncompany in Houston was saying publicly, and said it repeatedly, that \nnone of this happened, none of this happened, Mr. Ganger's report said \nthis:\n\n       This event should be considered a ``near miss'' as the \n     consequences of these actions could have been VERY SEVERE \n     resulting in mass sickness or death.\n\n  We are spending money on these contracts. Then we have whistleblowers \ncome forward to say there is a waste of money--tragic waste of money. \nThen we have whistleblowers come forward to say that the companies that \nare getting these contracts--in this case for water--are not treating \nthe nonpotable water properly, which is a danger to the troops. And the \ncompany says: Not true. Just not true.\n\n[[Page S8592]]\n\n  Then we discover the internal memorandum that the company received \nfrom that company's person on the ground in Iraq, and the guy says:\n\n       The consequence . . . could have been VERY SEVERE resulting \n     in mass sickness or death.\n\n  Shortly after this, by the way, a young woman who is serving in Iraq, \nan Army physician, wrote me an e-mail, and she said: I have read about \nthis sort of thing. I want you to know it has happened in my camp. And \nI had my assistant go track the water line to see what kind of water \nthey were bringing into the base that is called nonpotable water, and \nit, too, was contaminated, and it, too, is of degraded quality and more \ncontaminated than raw water, the raw water you would get from the \nEuphrates River.\n  So the question is: What are we getting? What are we getting for the \nmoney we are spending? Where is the accountability?\n  Now, some of these have been Halliburton. And I know the minute you \ntalk about Halliburton, somebody says: Ah, that is a political attack \non the Vice President. The Vice President is not at Halliburton. This \nis not about the Vice President at all. He used to work for that \ncompany, but this is not about him. It is about a company that received \nlarge no-bid contracts, sole-source contracts, and the allegations are \nalmost unbelievable about what has happened.\n  Now, there are others. Some of them are with a RIO contract, Restore \nIraq Oil contract, others with a LOGCAP contract. But let me give you \nsome other examples: Custer-Battles--two guys show up in Iraq, one \nnamed Custer, one named Battles, and they decide: We want to get in on \nsome of this. We want to get in on some of this activity.\n  Before that ended, Custer and Battles had received over $100 million \nin contracts from our Government. Among the contracts was one to \nprovide security at the Baghdad Airport. There were no flights going in \nand out of the Baghdad Airport, so presumably they did a pretty good \njob of that, except they took the forklift trucks that existed at that \nairport, put them in a shed someplace and repainted them blue, and then \nsold them back to the Coalition Provisional Authority, which was us. \nThat is an interesting way to do business.\n  And, by the way, here is a picture of $2 million wrapped in Saran \nWrap. I know this fellow. This fellow showed up here in Washington, DC. \nThis picture was taken in Iraq in a building.\n  He was the guy holding a portion of this money. He said: Our message \nin Iraq was, Bring a bag; we pay in cash. If you are a contractor, \nbring a sack; we pay in cash.\n  This is $2 million, 100-dollar bills wrapped in Saran Wrap. They used \nthem to play football in the office, throwing bricks of 100-dollar \nbills around. It was like the Wild West, he said. This particular $2 \nmillion went to Custer Battles, a company that showed up with no \nexperience, took forklift trucks from the airport, repainted them, sold \nthem back to the American taxpayer, called the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority. The CPA is us, the Coalition Provisional Authority. That was \ncreated by Donald Rumsfeld. He signed the creation of the CPA. It was \nus. So Custer Battles gets a contract for airport security.\n  Here is the Baghdad airport director of security talking about Custer \nBattles. He wrote it to the CPA.\n\n       Custer Battles have shown themselves to be unresponsive, \n     uncooperative, incompetent, deceitful, manipulative, and war \n     profiteers. Other than that they are swell fellows.\n\n  Something else that happened with this contract. They were supposed \nto provide trucks. The problem is, they supplied trucks and the trucks \ndidn't work. Couldn't get them started. They didn't run. The Custer \nBattles company said: We just said we would supply trucks. We didn't \nguarantee they were going to run. They didn't have to be operational.\n  My point is this, this goes on day after day, month after month. It \nis not the fault of the appropriators. It has nothing to do with the \nappropriators. It is about accountability. And in most cases, that \nwould come from authorizing committees and from a Congress that would \nsay: Wait a second. When we hear about nonpotable water that is more \ncontaminated than raw water from the Euphrates River, a Congress would \nsay, wait a second; you can't do that to American troops, and begin an \nimmediate investigation. Yet you see very little activity to look into \nthese issues.\n  On behalf of the taxpayers and on behalf of those of us who are \nappropriators, including the chairman and ranking member and the entire \ncommittee, I think all of us, the Congress, the Department of Defense, \nall of us need to expect more accountability and soon. We are spending \nan enormous amount of money.\n  I have mentioned previously that in the early 1940s, Harry Truman \nbelieved there was substantial waste. He put together the Truman \ncommittee, formed by Congress, a bipartisan committee. I am sure there \nwas a great deal of teeth gnashing down at the White House because the \nPresident was of his own party. But the Congress, with that bipartisan \ncommittee, rooted out a great deal of waste, fraud, and abuse through \nthe Truman committee. I have tried previously on three occasions to \npass such legislation here in the Senate. I have not been successful.\n  I think it is time--and I only take the time to speak as we \nappropriate money--for all of us to expect more from those committees \nwith the responsibility to hold accountable those who spend this money. \nI have seen precious little energy and far too little activity to \nrespond to these issues.\n  I have talked about food and water to troops. There are many other \nissues. I will not go through them all today. The issues are sufficient \nthat we need to take a hard look at what is happening.\n  Last Friday I met with a doctor from Iraq. He wanted to go look at \nthe 142 health clinics that were to be restored and rehabilitated and \ncreated in Iraq, 142 health clinics with the money we appropriated in \nthe U.S. Congress. This Iraq physician went to the health minister of \nIraq and said: I would like to track the money and see what is \nhappening with these 142 clinics.\n  The health minister said: No, you don't understand. Many of these \nclinics are imaginary.\n  I said: Are you sure? You are sure that is what he said.\n  Oh yes, I am sure. Many of these are imaginary clinics. They don't \nexist.\n  It turns out 20 clinics were rehabilitated or created of the 142 that \nwere supposed to have been rehabilitated or created. Only 20 were done \nand all the money is gone. Why? How? Who cares? Does somebody care? \nThat is the question for this Congress.\n  I don't mean in any way to suggest that my colleagues, the chairman \nand ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, bear responsibility \nfor this. That is not the case. It is the case, however, that we need \nto be much more aggressive on other committees with oversight \nresponsibility. Oversight is a significant legislative responsibility. \nIt has gone unfulfilled in this Congress and a couple of Congresses \npreceding it.\n  I have an amendment that I noticed. I understand that the amendment \nitself is not germane on an appropriations bill. A point of order would \nlie against it. I would expect my colleagues would insist on a point of \norder. But the amendment would punish war profiteers, crack down on \ncontract cheaters, and force real contract competition so that we \nfinally can do what we should for the American taxpayer and bring down \nthese costs.\n  I had filed it as No. 4805. I ask unanimous consent that we set aside \nthe pending amendment in order to have 4805 considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4805.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am appalled at some of the information \nthat the Senator from North Dakota\n\n[[Page S8593]]\n\nhas brought to us. I will join him, perhaps, in some specific amendment \nthat might have some germaneness to this bill such as an authorization \nto shoot such people. I can't imagine that anyone would provide to \ntroops in the field contaminated water. I can't believe that we are \nbeing charged for a sizable number of clinics and our taxpayers are \npaying for it and they are imaginary.\n  On the other hand, this is a provision that deals with Government \ncontracting governmentwide. If we include it, we would have to have \nseveral subcommittees and the other body confer with us to try to write \nthe amendment in a way that might be pertinent to the matter before us, \nand that is financing the Department of Defense.\n  I do think we should be indebted to the Senator for his research and \nwhat he is doing to try to bring honesty into Government contracting. \nBut I am compelled to say that it is an amendment that should be taken \nto the Government Affairs Committee, and it should not be on this bill. \nIt is legislation on an appropriations bill. I do make a point of order \nthat it violates rule XVI.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is taken.\n  The amendment falls.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I use this opportunity when we appropriate \nmoney to make the point. It is not the responsibility or the burden of \na couple people who have put together a good appropriations bill to \nbear the responsibility for a lack of oversight that exists and the \nlack of oversight that exists in the entire Congress. I only raise this \nbecause I think it is critically important that all of us understand.\n  There is far too much waste and fraud and abuse in some of these \ncontracts. I recognize that wartime is different. There are times \nduring wartime when you do things you might not otherwise do. You might \nnot be quite as efficient or effective. Some money may be wasted. But \nthis seems like hogs in a trough when you see what is going on.\n  We are spending so many billions. We added $18.2 billion for \nreconstruction in Iraq, and the grunting and shoving and moaning of \nhogs at the trough trying to find some of that money. I mentioned \nCuster Battles. Two guys would show up with hardly a taxi fare, get \n$100 million in contracts, and now we discover the American taxpayer \nhas been fleeced for much of that. The water isn't going to clear up \nuntil you get the hogs out of the creek. We need to find a way to \naddress these issues, most especially those raised with food and water \nto troops.\n  Let me say to Senators Stevens and Inouye, I want to work with them. \nI know they want the same result I want with respect to these issues. \nThat is the only reason I raise this today. This burden also falls on \nsome authorization committees and others that really need to do a much \nbetter job with respect to oversight.\n  My hope remains that at some point we will be able to pass my \namendment--I expect to offer it again, and I think that will be the \nfourth time--to create a Truman-type committee that sinks its teeth \ninto these issues and says: We will not put up with this. We won't put \nup with waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  I will be back again. I thank my colleagues for their forbearance as \nI discuss these things and know that they share with me an interest in \ntrying to deal with them in an effective way on behalf of our troops \nand on behalf of America's taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves, I am sure \nSenator Inouye is telling him the same thing. We will instruct our \nstaff to start the process of establishing a series of hearings to \ninvestigate this fraud that he has brought to our attention. The \nSenator is a member of our committee, and we will be pleased to work \nwith him on it. If it gets to the point where we need a commission per \nse to be outside of the Congress to do this investigating, we can look \ninto that, too. I think we should start the process of investigating \ninto these repeated reports we have had about fraud and corruption in \nconnection with Government contracting, particularly that related to \nour war effort.\n  I thank the Senator for his work.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me then work with my colleagues, \nSenators Stevens and Inouye, and see if I can find a way to write this \napproach in a way that does not have a point of order lying against it \nand in a way that begins some kind of inquiry. I very much appreciate \nthe cooperation and interest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I don't think we need an act. We have authority under \nour existing rules today to do that investigation. As has been pointed \nout, President Truman used a subcommittee of the Congress at the time \nhe did his investigations in World War II.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wanted to speak briefly about the status \nof the budget relative to defense spending, really more for the purpose \nof information for my colleagues, because we are getting into a process \nwhere there is tremendous confusion over how much we are spending and \nwhere it is coming from and how it is being spent as a function of what \nhas been the administration's view that they can fund this war out of \nemergency supplementals ad infinitum.\n  Traditionally when you fund a war such as this--I guess there isn't \nmuch tradition, and hopefully it won't be a tradition for war. But if \nyou look back over the wars we have fought as a nation that have gone \non for a while, they have usually started out with significant \ncommitments of emergency funds. There is no question about that. It is \nessential to get the troops in the field and get them what they need.\n  Over time, in both the Korean war and the Vietnam war, which are \nprobably the best examples to look to, the operation and funding of the \nwar has been folded into the regular order where the authorizations \nhave gone through the Defense Department, have gone through the Defense \nauthorization committee and on to the Appropriations Committee, and \nthere has been some significant congressional oversight.\n  In the Korean war, 77 percent of the cost of that war was funded \nthrough the regular budget. In the Vietnam war, about 72 percent was \nfunded through the regular budget.\n  This war we are confronted with now is as big and as significant a \nthreat as we have ever faced because of the fact that, regrettably, the \npeople who wish to do us harm have shown their willingness to kill \nAmericans. They have stated their purpose is to destroy our culture. \nThey have said that if they can get their hands on a weapon that will \nkill thousands of people, they will use it against civilian \npopulations, and they have shown their willingness to kill civilians, \nAmericans on American soil.\n  So this is a war that must be fought aggressively. I congratulate the \nPresident for the aggressiveness with which he has gone after \nterrorists around the globe and the fact that he has taken the fight to \nthem. I have supported that effort. But I also remain concerned that \nwe, as a Congress, have a role here, which we have to some degree \nabrogated, and that is the role of oversight as this effort goes \nforward--maybe not so much in the day-to-day operation of the war, \nwhich should be left to the generals and the people on the ground, the \nofficers and men and women fighting this war, but to the issue of how \nthe Defense Department structures its core purposes in the context of \nbeing in a war.\n  In fact, for the first couple of years of this effort, when \nsupplementals were coming up--and they came up at the rate of $50 \nbillion, $60 billion--there appeared to be an almost physical \ndisconnect between the dollars being used on the war-fighting effort \nand the dollars being used for the core purposes of national defense. \nOne could ask the question: Was the core purpose of the Defense \nDepartment, which was costing in the vicinity of $300 billion to $400 \nbillion at the time, 2 or 3 years ago--\n\n[[Page S8594]]\n\nwas a large percentage of that being used to fight the war or was a \nlarge percentage being used to maintain traditional operations within \nthe Defense Department? It appeared that the two were decoupled in many \nways.\n  What evolved is a process where, essentially, we have a core defense \nbudget, on which we have overlaid an entirely separate appropriations \nprocess and budget, called emergency appropriations. We have now had 4 \nyears of experience, and we are averaging about $90 billion a year of \nemergency appropriations that are outside of the basic budget process \nand which are being spent on the war-fighting effort. For the first 2 \nyears of this effort, the Defense Department refused to send up any \nnumber at all relative to what this would cost. That didn't make a lot \nof sense because we knew we were going to have to pay something with \nsoldiers in the field. At the urging of the Congress 2 years ago, we \nput into place a $50 billion--for lack of a better term--``holding'' \nnumber to try to cover and identify what that cost was going to be in \nthe context of the entire budget.\n  The Defense Department still at that time took the position that it \nhad no number for that, so $50 billion didn't need to be put in. It \nturned out that they exceeded the $50 billion by about $40 billion. \nLast year, because we put in $50 billion before, the administration \nsent up the base defense budget of about $400 billion and put $50 \nbillion in because, as it was represented by the Assistant Secretary of \nDefense before the Budget Committee, because he said the Congress had \ndone it the year before, he could not estimate whether that would be \nthe cost of the war. They put that in because Congress had already done \nthat, so they were trying to track what Congress did. This didn't make \na lot of budgetary sense again, so we put in the budget what had been \nthe average for this supplemental effort to fight the war, which was \n$90 billion.\n  The new Budget Director--and I give him great credit, and I \nappreciate the fact that he has convinced people at the Pentagon to go \nalong with this--stated very openly that now the supplemental that they \nexpect in the next budget cycle will be somewhere in the vicinity of \n$110 billion to $120 billion, which is at least a number we can work \non, a number that has been put forward and appears to be realistic.\n  I guess the point is this: Where do we stand with all these numbers \nfloating around? Do we have any control over this? Is this a lot of \noperational activity that is being basically sloughed off on the \nemergency accounts so that we end up with the core budget of the \nDefense Department not being correctly reflected and authorized, and, \nof course, that account clearly isn't authorized relative to war \nfighting and is difficult to reflect.\n  I tried to put this together. This chart reflects the situation as I \nsee it and the Budget Committee sees it. I put these numbers out so \npeople can get a sense of where we are going and what we are spending \nbecause this is becoming a fairly significant item of the Federal \nactivity and is obviously critical to our capacity to fight this war \nand be successful.\n  Since 2001, we have had this core budget of the Defense Department \nwhich, as you can see, rose from $297 billion in 2001, where the \nDefense Department had been radically cut back by the Clinton \nadministration and was suffering underfunding. Ironically, I would call \nin the last year and a half of the Clinton Presidency--he acknowledged \npublicly that he disproportionately cut the Defense Department and was \nstarting to retool it and refund it. The core budget has gone from $297 \nbillion--which was a low number, below what they needed--up to $430 \nbillion. That includes the appropriations for the Defense bill and for \nmilitary construction.\n  The supplementals in the postwar period, as we dealt with the Iraq \nsituation and Afghanistan situation, are the red numbers. They have \ngone from $79 billion to $88 billion, to $79 billion, and last year--or \nthe year we are presently in, it is estimated to be $125 billion. Now \nwe are looking at 2007.\n\n  This is a number that I think needs to be at least publicly stated so \nwe know what is happening around here. We have the core budget of $430 \nbillion. On top of that, we have a supplemental within this bill--\nbefore the 2007 is even passed and the year has even begun, this is a \nsupplemental within the bill of $42 billion to basically fight the war. \nThen $8 billion came out of money, which last year there was an across-\nthe-board cut in spending generating about a $9 billion savings--more \nthan that, but of that across-the-board cut, about $9 billion was not \nspent. That came down to about $8 billion being available. And it is \nnow transferred over to this Defense bill. It could have gone to the \nDefense bill or the HHS bill, whatever bill came to the floor, or it \ncould have been applied to deficit reduction.\n  On top of that, last night there was a $13 billion add-on to this \nbill in emergency spending to basically refund the Army and the \nMarines, who are in desperate shape in the area of equipment due to the \nharsh climate of Iraq, and this money was critical. And then the \nPresident's representative, Mr. Portman--and I congratulate him--has \nsaid the full cost of this year's emergency supplementals will be about \n$110 billion. So we can presume that we are going to get at least \nanother $60 billion in emergency supplemental as we head into 2007 and, \nregrettably, I suspect that will be conservative. It means we are going \nto essentially have a $553 billion budget in the defense area, even \nthough you could argue that the stated budget is $430 billion in the \ndefense area.\n  These are just numbers and they are facts. I think it is important we \nunderstand what is happening. I guess the bottom line of all this is we \nhave set up a two-track process of budgeting and spending around here. \nOne is subject to the proper review process, which is the authorizing \nprocess followed by the appropriating process. That is the $430 \nbillion. And the other part in here essentially has no controls and \ncomes at us from the White House and the administration, where they \nunilaterally make the decision as to the dollars. I don't think that is \nhealthy.\n  There is no question that the Defense Department probably needs this \nmoney. But the purpose of the Congress should be in oversight of the \nuse of the money. So I am hopeful, because it appears that this process \nof these large supplementals has become the modus operandi for both the \nadministration and the Congress. We should take a hard look at this. We \nneed to consider the fact that maybe there is a better way to do this, \nwhere Congress can intersect a little earlier on how we are going to \nspend this money, so that we put the same review into this money that \nwe are putting into the base budget, so we can be sure that the money \ngoing to the emergencies of fighting the war--and it is critical that \nour soldiers have what they need in the field--is not being used \nactually for the purpose of replacing core defense opportunities or \ndefense needs and, thus, being a way around congressional scrutiny of \ncore defense obligations.\n  There are a lot of weapons systems being purchased which have outyear \nprocurement issues. I heard the second ranking member of the Defense \nCommittee say that of the nine major systems--I think he said seven \nsystems were in issue as to how much they were costing and whether they \nwould be delivered on time. If you are going to properly oversight \nthat, you want to make sure that those dollars are not suddenly flowing \nthrough the emergency process and thus not being subject to review.\n  So we have a problem as a Congress, as to how we deal with the \nreality of having troops on the ground who have to get support from \nus--and no one here would not support them--but at the same time have a \ndefense budget and an actual budget process that is fundamentally \nbroken relative to our capacity to oversight these dollars as they are \ncoming up and being requested.\n  I don't have the answer, to be very honest with you. But I am trying \nto outline the issue so that people are aware of it. I honestly don't \nthink there are probably five people in the Senate who understand this \nnumber. What we are dealing with is not a defense number of $430 \nbillion, not a defense number of that plus the $42 billion supplemental \nin it or plus the $8 billion or plus the $13 billion. It is a defense \nnumber of somewhere around $553 billion and going up. It may be, and \nprobably is, money we are going to have to spend. I suspect I will vote \nfor all of it. But I would like to have more\n\n[[Page S8595]]\n\nconfidence than I have right now that we have not set up a two-track \nbudget process, where we essentially focus on one set of numbers and \nallow another set of numbers to pass through here as if they are going \nthrough in the night on some shadowy boat.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Budget Committee chairman raises literally the \nthings we have been thinking about and mumbling about for months now. \nWe have in this bill a provision that says next year all of this should \nbe within the budget. That, of course, we realize is next to impossible \nbecause of the inability to predict in advance--really 18 months in \nadvance--what the costs are going to be to fight a war.\n  I believe the Senator should look at the changes that have been made \nsince the war I was in, World War II. We had draftees. All of the \nequipment that was used, the transportation equipment was operated by \npeople in uniform. All of the bases were operated by people in uniform. \nWe didn't have security people; we did the guard duty. We didn't have \npeople running the kitchens; we did it ourselves. I distinctly remember \npeeling potatoes for hour after hour.\n  All I am saying to the Senator is, the concept of handling war \nmaterials and emergency issues has gotten out of control. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota--I don't know if the Senator from New Hampshire saw \nhis comments about some of the fraud and abuse that is involved in \nGovernment contracting.\n  It is fairly clear, because of the nature of the emergency, controls \nhave been thought of after the fact. We are trying to bring it into \nsome kind of perspective for the future.\n  As budget chairman, the Senator from New Hampshire is absolutely \ncorrect, I don't know how we could fold into the budget for next year \nand make everything involved in the fiscal year 2008 the concepts we \nare dealing with in terms of emergency funding right now.\n  However, I am also convinced that because of the way this conflict \nhas changed and the nature of the conflict, as opposed to wars of the \npast, even the Persian Gulf war that we fought, we have no way of \ntelling how much it is going to cost.\n  I want the Senator to know that those of us who handle the \nappropriations bills, particularly those regarding defense, would like \nto work with the Senator. There must be some way to put some controls \nover the way this money is spent.\n  I am appalled when I hear of some of the things the money is spent \nfor in a redundant fashion which ends up not achieving the goals, but \nstill have to spend the money after the goals are not achieved. It is \ndifficult for us right now to get our hands on the way this war has \nbeen costed out and the way the money has been spent.\n  I don't think it is a political question. I don't think it is a \nmatter of politics. I think it is a matter of practical application, \nsome good money-handling propositions. We have run into that in terms \nof some of the money we have provided to the Iraq Government, also. I \nhope the Senator from New Hampshire is familiar with those.\n  I wonder whether the Senator has any suggestions on how we might help \nhim in this endeavor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first off, my admiration for the Senator \nfrom Alaska is immense and is extremely deep on the issue of defense \npolicy and how we should fund our Defense Department. If the Senator \nfrom Alaska says we need something, the odds are I am going to say we \nneed to fund it. People, such as the Senator from Alaska who have the \nexpertise around here and have had it for a long time--the Senator from \nVirginia, for example, who chairs the Armed Services Committee and \nmembers of that committee--are not getting much of a window of \nopportunity to be players in how these budgets are evolved. We are just \ngetting them presented to us and claimed they are an emergency and \nbasically they have gone outside the budget process.\n  We have to set up some process that allows the Senator from Alaska, \nas chairman of the subcommittee that appropriates, and which allows \nSenator Warner as chairman of the full Armed Services Committee to \nintersect this activity a little earlier in the process so they can \nhave their input in it, much as they would the core budget.\n  The Senator from Alaska spent a lot of time putting together this \nbase budget of $434 billion. I know he did. That emergency money comes \nin here with a bang--here it is today and the Senator has to \nappropriate it tomorrow--a situation from the administration. Granted, \nit is a war and there is going to be some need for that type of \nactivity, but there is also a way to anticipate some fairly significant \npercentage of that, I would think. I think a little more openness and \ncooperation from downtown on that might be helpful.\n  I don't have the answer. I am just raising the red flag of concern. I \nwould rely greatly on the Senator's expertise and the expertise of \nothers around here who have the history and knowledge of the Defense \nDepartment to figure out how we as a Congress can engage more \neffectively and not have this second budget moving along which is \nreally sort of shadowing.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on this subject, I thank the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee and Chairman Stevens for their observations. Early \non, I urged the administration to budget for the war, and they said: It \nis hard to predict what will be needed. I said: That is true, but the \none thing we know for certain, the right answer is not zero. And that \nis what the administration was sending up in their budgets: Zero, no \nmoney. Obviously, that wasn't right.\n  Budgets are about making an estimate of what the costs are going to \nbe. Unfortunately, early on, the chief spokesman for this \nadministration dramatically understated what this war would cost. I \nremember very well Larry Lindsey, who was the chief economic adviser to \nthe President, said this may cost over $100 billion. The Vice President \nof the United States chastised him publicly--at least that is my \nrecollection--and suggested that this war would not cost more than $50 \nbillion.\n  Here we are and the war has cost over $300 billion so far, and the \nadministration is still not budgeting appropriately for it. They are \ndramatically understating in their budgets what this war is really \ngoing to cost. What that does is denies the Congress the ability to \noversee these expenditures, and the result is we are going to see more \nscandals, we are going to see more wasteful spending, we are going to \nsee more circumstances in which our troops do not receive the equipment \nthey ought to receive because this money is being handled in a way that \nis outside the normal process in which a budget is sent up here that \ndoes not really represent the spending plan at all. And then it is \nfollowed by what is called an emergency supplemental bill that has very \nlittle chance for review, very little chance for scrutiny, very little \nchance for oversight.\n  What the chairman is saying is there is a reason for a budget \nprocess, and the reason is to give Congress the chance to try to make \ncertain that money is not wasted.\n  Is it a perfect process? No, we all know that. We know it is a very \nimperfect process. But we know it is the best we have, and if we don't \nfollow it, we are then vulnerable to waste and abuse, and that is a \nserious concern for every one of the Members.\n\n\n                   The Spreading Disaster of Drought\n\n  Mr. President, I now wish to speak on a different matter. It is a \nmatter of an emergency in my State and increasingly a matter of \nemergency in other States as well, and that is the spreading disaster \nof drought that is enveloping the central part of our country.\n  Ironically, last year, my State had massive flooding. These were the \nheadlines from a year ago: ``Rain Halts Harvest''; ``Heavy Rain Leads \nto Crop Diseases''; ``Beet Crop Could be Smallest in 10 Years''; \n``Crops, Hay Lost to Flooding''; ``Area Farmers Battle Flooding, \nDisease.''\n  These were the headlines from last year.\n  In North Dakota last year, every one of our counties was declared a \ndisaster because of abnormal wet weather conditions, something we are \nnot very used to in North Dakota, but that is what we were experiencing \nlast year. Pictures such as this were very typical\n\n[[Page S8596]]\n\nlast year: Massive flooding in which farmsteads were surrounded by \nwater. And in fact, in North Dakota last year, we had over 1 million \nacres that couldn't even be planted; 1 million acres that could not \neven be planted in my State last year, and then hundreds of thousands \nof additional acres that were planted but then flooded out. So farmers \ngot no production.\n  Fast forward to this year and what is happening now. This is the \ndrought monitor that comes out on a weekly basis. What this shows is \nthe center part of the country is now in very serious drought. The \ncolor code for those watching on TV is: Yellow is abnormally dry, the \nlight tan is moderate drought, the darker tan is severe drought, the \nred is extreme drought, and the dark brown is exceptional drought.\n  One can see all of my State is now in drought. All of South Dakota is \nnow in drought. All of Nebraska, all of Kansas, and all of the \nPresiding Officer's State are in drought, and virtually all of Texas--\nnot quite all, but virtually all.\n  What is dramatic is how this has spread. Last year, it was just the \nsouth central part of our State. Now the entire State is in drought, \nand much of it is in extreme drought. That is the red part of this \nchart. And one part is in exceptional drought, that is beyond extreme--\nexceptional drought.\n  There was an article in one of our major dailies saying that the \nDakotas are now the epicenter of a drought-stricken Nation. It \nindicated that more than 60 percent of the United States is in drought, \nand it says the experts say that the dry spell is the third worst on \nrecord. Looking at the drought from 1999 to 2006, the drought ranks \nonly behind the 1930s and the 1950s.\n  This is an extraordinarily serious situation in my State. We put \ntogether a chart that just shows the month of July. These are the days \nthat were over 90 degrees in Bismarck, ND, the capital city, my \nhometown: 23 days over 90 degrees. Rainfall is less than 20 percent of \nnormal. We are a pretty dry area to begin with, but 20 percent of \nnormal? In my lifetime, I have never seen anything like this. I didn't \nlive in the thirties. I did live in the fifties, but I was so young I \nprobably didn't really know what was going on in terms of weather \nconditions.\n  I thought I had seen it all, but last Sunday in my hometown, it was \n112 degrees--112 degrees in Bismarck, ND. I have never seen anything \napproaching that. I am not talking about the heat index here. I am not \ntalking about when they add a bunch of things together. I am talking \nabout the temperature in my hometown last Sunday was 112 degrees with \nrainfall 20 percent of normal.\n  This is a situation that is becoming dire, and if we look at the 10 \ndays leading up to that, on the 10th of July, it was 96 degrees; the \nnext day it was 101; the next day 105; the next day 94; the next day \n102; the next day 105; the next day 106.\n  In North Dakota, typically you might have a couple of days that are \n100 in the summer, but you don't have day after day, and you certainly \ndon't have a day that gets to be 112.\n  In July, Senator Dorgan, Congressman Pomeroy, the Governor, and I \nwent together on a drought tour. This was in early July. This is what \nwe saw in pastures in North Dakota. There is nothing there. There is \nnothing for the cattle to eat.\n  Now we have seen as the days have gone by that the ground is actually \ncracking. It is so dry the ground is cracking. This is an extremely \nserious situation.\n  Here is a map of North Dakota and our counties. The red counties are \nones that have already been approved for emergency CRP haying and \ngrazing. One can see it is widespread across our State and growing.\n  But what is striking is when you go out and look at the crops. This \nis southern Burleigh County. This is where Bismarck, my hometown, is \nlocated, the capital city of North Dakota. This is a cornfield. You \nknow what they used to say--knee high by the 4th of July? This isn't \nboot high by the 4th of July. There are hardly any plants that have \neven emerged. They will produce nothing, absolutely nothing.\n  During our drought tour, a man came up from South Dakota who runs the \nHerreid livestock auction ring in north central South Dakota. He said: \nSenators, I want to alert you to something that is happening. It is a \nreal warning signal. He said: In July we would normally be selling a \ncouple of hundred head a day. The last 3 or 4 days we have been selling \nthousands, thousands of head, because there is no feed.\n  The Senate has taken action before. We took it on the supplemental \nappropriations bill and we said we needed to provide disaster \nassistance. There is a need to take it here. Seventy-two Members of the \nSenate said: Don't take it out, we ought to provide disaster \nassistance. The President said no. If there is any disaster assistance, \nhe would veto it.\n  I hope the President is watching carefully what is happening, what is \ndeveloping. I just had the independent bankers of my State in my \noffice. They told me if there is not assistance, 10 percent of the \npeople they lend to will go out of business by the end of this year--10 \npercent of the farmers and ranchers of my State. This is a catastrophe \nof stunning proportion. It is getting worse each and every day.\n  We are experiencing temperatures that are unprecedented and a lack of \nrainfall that has only happened twice before in our history--in the \n1930s, the Dust Bowl days, and the 1950s.\n  I take the time of my colleagues to raise this issue on the Defense \nappropriations bill. I recognize full well this has nothing to do with \nthe Defense appropriations bill. This does have to do with a crisis \namong the people I represent, so I have taken a few moments of the time \nof the Senate to alert them to what is happening and to tell them that \na group of us, on a bipartisan basis, from the States affected, are \nwriting the leadership, Republican and Democratic, of this body to \nalert them that when we return in September it will be our effort on \nevery vehicle that moves to put on disaster assistance.\n  This is a group of Republican Senators and Democratic Senators who \nare from the affected regions. We will do everything we can to minimize \nthe financial request that is made, but we have to say to our \ncolleagues this is a crisis. When it gets to be 112 in July in \nBismarck, ND, and rainfall is 20 percent of normal, that is headed \ntoward a catastrophe--a catastrophe for literally tens of thousands of \npeople in my State.\n  It extends way beyond the border of North Dakota. I have talked to \ncolleagues here from Montana who report to me their State is in \ndrought, as are Minnesota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, \nTexas, Colorado--so many of these States being affected--and, of \ncourse, Wyoming as well. I have talked to colleagues from many of these \nStates who report to me that they are seeing in their States what I am \nseeing in mine. This drought is intensifying and the prospects for a \ncalamitous growing season are growing.\n  I thank my colleagues for their patience.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4819\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4819.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To make available an additional $6,700,000,000 to fund \n     equipment reset requirements resulting from continuing combat \n    operations, including repair, depot, and procurement activities)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S8597]]\n\n       Sec. __. From funds available in this Act, an additional \n     $6,700,000,000 may be available to fund equipment reset \n     requirements resulting from continuing combat operations, \n     including repair, depot, and procurement activities.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator Reed of \nRhode Island, Senator Inouye, Senator Leahy, Senator Bingaman, and \nSenator Kennedy.\n  I thank Senator Inouye and his staff for helping us craft this \namendment. As I understand it, this amendment has been cleared on both \nsides for consideration. I will be asking for a vote on this amendment \nat the appropriate time, but I am not going to take a long time here \nbecause the substance of this amendment was discussed last evening when \nit was offered--part of this was offered by Senator Stevens, along with \nSenator Inouye--and then earlier today Senator Reed of Rhode Island and \nI had a discussion here on the floor about this issue, of what is \noccurring in terms of the equipment our military needs to operate \neffectively, the gap that exists, that we worry about here, in terms of \nthe failure to provide the necessary support for our men and women in \nuniform, in the Marine Corps, the Army particularly, but also in the \nNational Guard.\n  The Senator from Alaska offered an amendment last evening, as I \nmentioned a moment ago, to address critical capital equipment \nshortfalls long identified by the Army and Marine Corps.\n  As my colleagues know, Army Chief of Staff General Schoomaker has \nsaid that $17 billion would be needed to begin repairing and replacing \nour fleets of trucks, tanks, and aircraft. Last night's amendment \ncontained an additional $7.8 billion for the Army to add to the $2.5 \nbillion in the underlying bill. It also contained $5.3 billion for the \nMarine Corps. But the amendment still leaves a $6.7 billion shortfall \nwithin the $17 billion figure identified by the military's top \nuniformed officers.\n  I am offering this amendment, along with Senator Reed and others, to \nmake this remaining $6.7 billion available to our military if it needs \nit. This is what we call a ``soft mark.'' If the money is not needed, \nthe resource would come back to the Treasury. But rather than waiting \nuntil next spring sometime when a supplemental might be asked for, we \ndon't want to deprive our military leadership of the resources \nnecessary if they can use them to replace and repair the deteriorated \nequipment being used in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere.\n  This amendment is a soft amendment, if you will, in that regard. It \nwill not detract from other defense priorities, and it will not \ncontribute further to the deficit. It is part of our budget-neutral, if \nyou will, proposal. All my amendment does is say that the Army is \nallowed at its discretion to use this appropriation for any available \nunobligated funds.\n  Up until now, the cost of war in Iraq has been mainly measured in the \nnumber of lives lost, which is tragic, and the U.S. Treasury spent--and \nrightly so.\n  In Iraq, 2,578 of our fellow citizens have been killed, and Congress \nhas approved more than $437 billion, with another $50 billion now soon \nto be considered by this body. But there is another cost of this war \nthat needs to be addressed, one we cannot afford to ignore. That is \nmilitary readiness.\n  For months now, the Army's uniformed leadership has been sounding the \nalarm about the growing readiness gap, as it is called.\n  In March, Army Deputy Chief of Staff LTG James Lovelace testified to \nCongress that since the Iraq war's beginning, the number of Army units \nfully equipped for combat has steadily declined. According to General \nLovelace and his Marine counterpart, LTG Jan Huly, military units have \nincreasingly become less prepared for combat as they have seen their \nstock of functioning vehicles, aircraft, and equipment decline.\n  Last month, Army Chief of Staff GEN Peter Schoomaker put the problem \nin budgetary terms--the President's proposed 2006 supplemental request \nwas $4.9 billion short to address the equipment shortfalls caused by \ncombat losses and wear and tear in Iraq. In the administration's 2007 \nbudget request, there was an even larger $12 billion shortfall, \naccording to the leadership of our uniformed services.\n  Today we are announcing our commitment to meeting those generals' \ncalls to address one of the most pressing challenges of the U.S. \nmilitary--the growing readiness gap.\n  We must find resources necessary to repair and replace our military's \ncritical equipment. This is a matter of the most urgent priority. By \nsome accounts, these equipment shortfalls are leaving up to two-thirds \nof the U.S. Army's combat brigades unfit to perform basic combat \nduties. I do not know what could be more alarming, particularly as the \nUnited States confronts growing threats to peace and security \nthroughout the globe, from the Korean Peninsula to the Middle East, and \nelsewhere.\n\n  While the sheer size and scope of the U.S. Army readiness remains \nclassified, one thing is certain: Our military hardware is stretched \nthin and our fleets of aircraft, tanks, and trucks are wearing out. \nThose are facts--not ones I concluded on my own, but our uniformed \nservices have warned us about this since very earlier this year.\n  Early this year in Iraq, U.S. tanks were being driven over 4,000 \nmiles per year--5 times the expected annual usage of 800 miles. Army \nhelicopters are experiencing usage rates up to roughly two to three \ntimes their otherwise planned usage. The Army's truck fleet is \nexperiencing some of the most pronounced problems of excessive wear, \nwith usage rates of five to six times their peacetime rates, further \nexacerbated by the addition of heavy armor. This increased use shortens \nthe life of equipment and demands larger investments in maintenance and \nprocurement.\n  On top of that, our equipment is being further degraded by sand, \nextreme heat, rocket-propelled grenades, and explosive attacks.\n  Certainly, our military personnel's bravery and valor can never be \nexhausted. We know that. But the same could not be said of the fleets \nof humvees, trucks, and aircraft they depend upon. We owe it to them \nand to the American people to make certain that the U.S. Armed Forces \nare outfitted with the equipment they need to get the job done.\n  On three or four other occasions over the last several years, I have \nstood on this floor to offer amendments to deal with equipment used by \nour men and women in uniform. At one point, we were offering the \nnecessary dollars to make certain that our service men and women were \ngetting hydration systems, basic needs of a soldier going into combat. \nWe lost those amendments, and we came back and offered a different \nidea--to reimburse the men and women in uniform, some of whom, by their \nown accounts, were scraping around in dumps in Iraq to find the \nhardware to armor up their humvees and equipment.\n  Whatever our politics may be on the issue of the war in Iraq, all of \nus believe we should never send a soldier into harm's way without \ngiving them the equipment they deserve and need when they are in those \nkinds of situations. Those situations are important. This situation I \nhave described here today outstrips the importance of those issues. \nThis has to do with the very ability of our people to defend themselves \nand to prosecute their efforts successfully, and we are coming up \nwoefully short.\n  I appreciate the leadership of this committee, Senator Stevens and \nSenator Inouye, for supporting these additional funds we talked about \nhere which Senator Reed and I are offering. We think it is critically \nimportant that the uniformed services have the tools necessary to make \nsure the men and women in uniform are going to have the kind of \nequipment they deserve and need to have under these circumstances. I am \nvery grateful to the leadership for supporting this amendment.\n  I will ask at the appropriate time for the yeas and nays on this \namendment. In fact, I will ask for the yeas and nays at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I do not know when we want to schedule these \nvotes. Are we ready to go to a vote? I withhold moving that at that \nmoment until the chairman of the committee\n\n[[Page S8598]]\n\nhas a chance to determine how they will proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Dodd amendment raises an interesting \nissue of availability of additional money if needed. It in effect is \nreprogramming authority granted in advance to move money to meet \nnecessity, if it occurs. On that basis, I think I would be willing to \nsupport it, but I think the Senate as a whole ought to vote.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that we agree on a time to commence this \nrollcall vote. Can we say it occur at 10 minutes after 5? Is that \nagreeable with Senator Inouye?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this vote be \nscheduled for 10 minutes after 5.\n  Mr. DODD. And no second degrees in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is there any further amendment to be discussed at this \ntime?\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask to rescind the previous order \nregarding the vote that is scheduled, and I now ask consent that at \n5:15 today, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the DOD \namendment No. 4819, with no amendments in order to the amendment prior \nto the vote; further, that the Senate then vote in relation to the \nDurbin amendment No. 4781, with no amendments in order to the amendment \nprior to the vote, and there be 4 minutes for debate equally divided \nbetween the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to the Dodd \namendment No. 4819. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nBunning) would have voted ``yea.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus) and \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like the Senate to know where we \nare. As of 4:35 this afternoon, we had 68 more amendments. I have asked \nthe Parliamentarian to advise Senator Inouye and me tomorrow morning \nhow many of them are subject to rule XVI. A great many of them are \nlegislation.\n  I point out to the Senate that this bill must be conferenced and we \nmust get this bill to the President in time for the money to be \navailable at the end of the fiscal year. We cannot go over this year.\n  Amendments subject to rule XVI, when we go to conference, require us \nto confer with another committee on the House side in order to see \nwhether the House will accept these nongermane amendments.\n  It is our intention to raise rule XVI against any amendment that the \nParliamentarian tells us is subject to the rule. If some can be \nrewritten in a way not to do that, we can reconsider them.\n  I apologize to the Senator from Illinois. There is another vote \nscheduled.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4781, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 4 minutes \nequally divided prior to a vote on the Durbin amendment No. 4781, as \nmodified.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Senator Obama and I have offered an \namendment relating to medical research on traumatic brain injury. This \nis the x-ray of an American soldier who has returned from Iraq having \nsuffered an explosive blast injury. Mr. President, 1,700 of our \nsoldiers have returned with traumatic brain injuries. This is a very \nsevere case, but this soldier, thank God, survived. But 1,700 soldiers \nhave faced this injury, and 62 percent of the soldiers exposed to blast \ninjuries have traumatic brain injury.\n  Senator Obama and I have taken money out of our own projects in this \nbill--a million dollars each--to put it into medical research at the \nUniversity of Chicago so we can use the latest technology to diagnose \nand treat traumatic brain injury.\n  The U.S. Army has reported in their official documents that they have \na gap of $20 million necessary for research for diagnosis and treatment \nof soldiers who have suffered these traumatic brain injuries. This does \nnot take money out of the bill.\n  Today, we have added $1.8 billion in emergency spending. We just \nshifted $6.7 billion. We are asking for $2 million from our own \nprojects for research for traumatic brain injury for these soldiers. \nPlease, if you believe we should do everything we can to help these \nsoldiers, I hope you will support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is an important amendment. It is one \nto provide the University of Chicago with $2 million to conduct imaging \nresearch on the connection between epilepsy and brain injury.\n  This is not to directly help the soldiers who have been injured. As a \nmatter of fact, this is not a neglected area. We put up a billion \ndollars in the last 2 years, and there has been substantial research on \nbrain injuries.\n  There is a necessity for money for the treatment and care of those \nwho have this problem, but we do not need more money for research. As a \nmatter of fact, in the past 3 years, we averaged $430 million a year in \ngrants, contracts, and research conducted by NIH. For 2006, we asked \nNIH to expand research on brain injury rehabilitation.\n  This money is not going to treat soldiers; it is going to the \nUniversity of Chicago for an imaging research\n\n[[Page S8599]]\n\nproject. We have 20 other amendments here that deal with the question: \nShould we use more money from defense for medical research? We have \nsaid no, we don't want any more money used for brain research.\n  There is $45 million in this bill that the Department of Defense can \nuse for any research project in the health area it wants to. But to \ntake more money now--this is a symbolic $2 million. If this amendment \npasses, we have to deal with the other 20. We have said no to \neverybody, not just to one amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues not to support this amendment. As a matter of \nfact, I move to table this amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I announce to the Senate that we have \ncompleted all the packages we can work on tonight. We urge Senators and \ntheir staff to get together with us early in the morning. We will be \nback in session at 9:30, and we hope we can continue to find ways to \nagree to the amendments that can be worked out.\n  There is a series of amendments regarding the National Guard that we \nwish to get to as quickly as possible tomorrow. I alert Senators and \nstaff that we are interested in working on the National Guard \namendments during the early part of the morning tomorrow, if it is at \nall possible.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, amendment No. 4838 would strike language \nfrom the bill that states that certain projects in the committee report \n``shall be considered to be authorized by law.''\n  Committee reports that accompany Senate bills and joint explanatory \nstatements that accompany conference reports are not law but, rather, \nadvisory documents. While some like to think otherwise, the Federal \nagencies are under no legal requirement to follow verbatim the many \ndirectives that are included in each and every committee report. And I \nnote that also applies to the hundreds of earmarks that are included in \ncommittee reports and joint explanatory statements each year. Unless \nprovisions are included in enacted legislation, they do not have the \nforce of law. And this is not just my view.\n  Let me read from the April 1998 opinion of Supreme Court Justice \nScalia in United States, petitioner v. Estate of Francis J. Romani et \nal.:\n\n       The Constitution sets forth the only manner in which the \n     Members of Congress have the power to impose their will upon \n     the country: by a bill that passes both Houses and is either \n     signed by the President or repassed by a supermajority after \n     his veto. Art. I, Sec. 7. Everything else the Members of \n     Congress do is either prelude or internal organization.\n\n  And just this past June, in Zedner v. United States, Scalia wrote:\n\n       I believe that the only language that constitutes ``a Law'' \n     within the meaning of the Bicameralism and Presentment Clause \n     of Article I Sec. 7, and hence the only language adopted in a \n     fashion that entitles it to our attention, is the text of the \n     enacted statute.\n       It may seem that there is no harm in using committee \n     reports and other such sources when they are merely in accord \n     with the plain meaning of the Act. But this sort of \n     intellectual piling-on has addictive consequences. To begin \n     with, it accustoms us to believing that what is said by a \n     single person in a floor debate or by a committee report \n     represents the view of Congress as a whole--so that we \n     sometimes even will say (when referring to a floor statement \n     and committee report) that ``Congress has expressed'' thus-\n     and-so. . . . There is no basis either in law or in reality \n     for this naive belief Moreover, if legislative history is \n     relevant when it confirms the plain meaning of the statutory \n     text, it should also be relevant when it contradicts the \n     plain meaning, thus rendering what is plain ambiguous.\n\n  I fully understand a committee's interest in having an agency \nconsider the guidance it provides in its report language. But on \noccasion, that interest can get carried away. I remember the \ncontroversy that occurred a few years ago when a report included \nlanguage expressing extreme displeasure over the fact that an agency \nhad not followed to the letter certain prior year's\n\n[[Page S8601]]\n\nreport language. The subsequent report, which accompanied the fiscal \nyear 2004 CJS appropriations bill, stated the following:\n\n       As in past years, the Committee expects NOAA and the \n     Department to adhere to the direction given in this section \n     of the Committee report, particularly language regarding \n     consultation with Congress, and to observe the reprogramming \n     procedures detailed in section 605 in the general provisions \n     of the accompanying bill. Unlike past years, however, the \n     Committee intends to enforce congressional direction \n     ruthlessly.\n\n  The reason I am referencing that report is to demonstrate the extent \nto which committees can go in imposing report directives. I am not \ntrying to suggest the DOD appropriations report accompanying the \npending bill includes comparable threats, but I am concerned about a \nline in the bill language that I believe should be eliminated because \nit would have the effect of authorizing projects that are merely listed \nin the report, thus giving provisions in the report the force of law.\n  Section 8042 of the bill states:\n\n       The Secretary of Defense, notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, acting through the Office of Economic \n     Adjustment of the Department of Defense, may use funds made \n     available in this Act under the heading ``Operation and \n     Maintenance, Defense-Wide'' to make grants and supplement \n     other Federal funds in accordance with the guidance provided \n     in the report of the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     Senate accompanying this Act, and the projects specified in \n     such guidance shall be considered to be authorized by law.\n\n  Let me repeat the last phrase: ``and the projects specified in such \nguidance shall be considered to be authorized by law.''\n  Mr. President, the projects referred to are not included in the \nlegislative language, and we should not be suggesting that it is \nacceptable to authorize provisions by reference. In this particular \ncase, it would result in the authorization of about 30 projects. But \nimagine what is next. I can envision the conference report of this or \nanother bill to include a line stating that all the projects in its \nreport ``shall be considered to be authorized by law.''\n  The language that allows certain projects to be ``considered \nauthorized by law'' is a dangerous precedent, and I believe it should \nbe eliminated.\n  I appreciate that the bill managers have agreed to accept this \namendment, and I trust that they will work to ensure that the final \nconference agreement is free of language that would allow provisions in \nthe joint explanatory statement to have the force of law.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, recently the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee approved the fiscal year 2007 Defense appropriations bill. As \na member of the committee, I supported this measure, and it is now \nbeing considered by the full Senate.\n  The bill provides $453.5 billion in new discretionary spending \nauthority for the Department of Defense. Included in this amount is $50 \nbillion for contingency operations related to the global war on terror.\n  I have repeatedly called upon the Bush administration to be frank \nwith American taxpayers about funding levels for ongoing operations in \nIraq and Afghanistan. For far too long, the Bush administration has \nrelied upon emergency supplemental spending measures, as opposed to the \nannual budget process, to fund our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. I \nbelieve that is wrong.\n  In his budget proposal, President Bush finally submitted a $50 \nbillion request for a bridge fund to support military efforts in \nAfghanistan and Iraq for the coming fiscal year. The Senate \nAppropriations Committee funded this request, but I remain concerned \nthat this level of funding will be insufficient, and once again \nCongress will need to consider another emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  Furthermore, President Bush's continued insistence on maintaining tax \nbreaks for the extremely wealthy has made it incredibly difficult to \nfund important domestic spending programs. In fact, the President's \nbudget reduced funding for critical programs including No Child Left \nBehind, the Perkins Career and Technical Education Program, and \nfirefighter assistance grants.\n  Consequently, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Thad Cochran \nwas forced to reduce defense spending by $9.1 billion to meet urgent \ndomestic spending needs. As a result, our servicemembers received a 2.2 \npercent across- the-board pay raise, a reduction of nearly 1 percent \nfrom last year's level of 3.1 percent. In addition, the Bush budget \nrecommended funding for only 333,000 Army National Guard personnel, \nwell below the National Guard authorized end-strength of 350,000. This \nproposal was opposed by the National Guard and Reserve, and I am \npleased that the Senate was able to provide sufficient funding to \nsupport an Army National Guard end strength of 350,000 soldiers.\n  While some shortfalls remain in the bill, it is important to note \nthat it provides an additional $340 million for National Guard and \nReserve equipment above the President's request. The bill also provides \n$735 million for body armor and personal protection equipment, as well \nas $1.5 billion for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat \nOrganization.\n  Furthermore, I am pleased that the bill reported out by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee provides funding for a number of important \nSouth Dakota projects. Due to my seat on the Appropriations Committee, \nthe South Dakota School of Mines and Technology received funding to \ndevelop a number of important defense related projects. Researchers at \nthe school will receive over $3.3 million to establish and staff a \nnationally competitive polymer and composites processing laboratory in \nSouth Dakota; they will work to develop new transparent armor for the \nArmy's Future Combat Systems; and the school will develop a control \nsystem for laser powder deposition.\n  The South Dakota School of Mines and Technology is not the only \norganization conducting critical defense-related research in South \nDakota. The Rosebud Sioux Tribe will receive $5 million to continue \ntheir efforts to establish the Advanced Electronics Rosebud Integration \nCenter. The center will research, develop, test, and demonstrate \nadvanced electronics integration and fabrication technology on the \nRosebud Sioux Tribe reservation in South Dakota. In addition, funding \nwas provided to RPM & Associates to facilitate their efforts to use \nLENS technology for aerospace applications. Likewise, the Batcheller \nConsulting Group will move forward in developing innovative on-board \nsensor systems to assess the wear-and-tear to military vehicles and \nweapon systems.\n  Finally, the South Dakota National Guard will benefit from defense-\nwide funding increases I championed. For example, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee included nearly $35 million above the \nPresident's request to meet the urgent needs of our National Guard and \nReserve. This funding will help procure additional M22 Automatic \nChemical Agent Alarms, Improved Chemical Agent Monitors, targeting pods \nfor F-16 aircraft, and helmet mounted cueing systems.\n  Mr. President, while I continue to have deep concerns about the \nspending priorities of the Bush administration, I do believe that the \nfunding included in this bill will go a long way toward providing our \ntroops with the resources they need to defend our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/02/senate-section/article/S8601-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8601-S8603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in behalf of the leader I ask unanimous \nconsent that there be a period for morning business with Senators \npermitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, this is that time of year when Congressmen \nand Senators go back to their States and report to the people about \nwhat we have done and what we plan to do. I am looking forward to going \nback to the State of South Carolina. I know the people are going to be \ninterested in things that are much simpler. They want to know if we are \ngoing to help make the future better than the past, if we are going to \nmake them safer, if\n\n[[Page S8602]]\n\nwe are going to make them more prosperous, if we will do the things in \nCongress that will protect the values they believe make this country \ngreat.\n  As we think about how we have made this country safer, we can all be \nthankful there has not been an attack by terrorists in this country \nsince September 11. A lot of that can be attributed to the President, \nhis firm stand against radical Islamic terrorists around the world, and \nhis effort, along with Republicans, pushing the PATRIOT Act to give our \nGovernment the tools it needs to track down terrorists.\n  Unfortunately, as many Americans know, our Democrat colleagues have \nmade it very difficult for the President and for Republicans to do \nthose things that are necessary to protect our people. The minority \nleader was bragging, boasting, that they had killed the PATRIOT Act. \nFortunately, we were able to overrule and get that bill passed so our \ncountry will be safer.\n  Our colleagues on the other side have also criticized the President \nfor using technology to track communications of terrorists and to trace \ntheir finances--on every turn, criticizing.\n  Perhaps the biggest problem we have is our Democrat colleagues do not \neven appear to know the enemy we are fighting. They seem to believe \nthat if we withdraw from Iraq that somehow this global war against \nradical Islamic terrorists will just go away.\n  Most of us who are thinking clearly know that Afghanistan and Iraq \nare just two fronts in this battle on terror. It is a global war. We \nsee it now in Lebanon. We see it in many places around the world. We \nhave even been able to stop some attacks in the United States. The \nright is right: We are facing an enemy that is spread around the world. \nIf we allow them to win in Iraq, we will never defeat them anywhere. We \nare making this country safer. We are doing it despite the obstruction \nof the other side of the aisle.\n  South Carolinians and Americans will ask how we are protecting \nvalues. Unfortunately, again, I have heard too many of my Democrat \ncolleagues say we need to be dealing with important things and not \nmessing with these value issues. They have tried to block a number of \nthings, but we were able to pass the Child Predator Act, we were able \nto pass the Child Custody Act, and we were able to get some good judges \napproved so we can stop the activist courts from overturning our values \nand our beliefs in this country. We have made progress.\n  I want to talk specifically tonight about helping Americans make ends \nmeet. I know I have heard this around South Carolina, and my colleagues \nare telling me they are hearing it all over the country, that despite a \ngood economy, many Americans are still having trouble making ends meet. \nAs we say sometimes back home, there is too much ``month'' at the end \nof our money. People have gotten raises, but they have also seen more \ntaken out of their paycheck for health care. They have seen the cost of \ngasoline continue to rise.\n  We know our Democrat colleagues, for decades, have blocked new energy \nsupplies in this country. They have blocked the generation of \nelectricity with nuclear power. They blocked the development of new oil \nreserves in Alaska more than 10 years ago. If they had not stopped it \nthen, we would now have an additional 5 percent supply of oil at a time \nwe desperately need it. The point is, my Democrat colleagues have \nraised the cost of living for many Americans. We have to stop that.\n  This week we started off well. We passed a new energy bill that will \nopen new exploration in the gulf. We know there are huge reserves of \noil and natural gas that will lower the cost of gasoline and make it \neasier for our businesses to compete in this country. That is something \nwe passed despite Democrat obstruction.\n  On Friday this week we will take up one of the most important bills \nof the year. This gets at the recent calls for prosperity that the \nAmerican people are asking for. We call it the Family Prosperity Act. I \ncall it, raise your standard of living and lower the cost of death.\n  This bill includes a number of things. It increases the minimum wage \nbut, more importantly, it provides a number of research and development \ntax credits, tax credits for welfare to work, a lot of tax incentives \nto expand our economy, increase jobs and help everyone increase their \nincome in this country, not through a Federal mandate but by just \nletting businesses and individuals keep more of their own money and \nreinvesting in our economy. That is the way to help increase income. \nThis bill includes all of that.\n\n  It also reduces this death tax and gives some permanency out there. \nIt makes absolutely no sense in this country when people pay taxes \ntheir whole lives, and when they die we are going to take more of it. \nWe have not been able to overcome the Democrat obstruction to \ncompletely eliminate the death tax, but we have come up with a good \ncompromise.\n  All week we have heard the Democrats in the Senate talking about this \ndeath tax, with lots of misinformation about what it really means. The \ndeath tax does provide revenue to the Federal Government--last year, \nabout $24.8 billion, which is a lot of money, there is no question \nabout it. But if you look at what keeping that money in our economy \nwould do if we were able to eliminate the death tax completely, a \nnumber of economists say this would add $847 billion in capital \ninvestment and create over 100,000 new jobs a year.\n  Simply leaving that money in the economy, rather than bringing it \nhere to Washington, where every American knows we don't necessarily \nspend it in the most efficient way, it would add over $10 billion in \ngrowth per year to our gross domestic product. This economic activity \nand the tax revenues associated with it would more than offset the loss \nof revenues from eliminating this death tax.\n  Let's look at it another way. This really gets back to the American \nfamily and what this means to us as a Nation. This death tax provides \nless then 1 percent to the Federal budget as far as tax revenues. What \nit does to an individual family, a small business, a farm--I have heard \nall week this is just the richest people in America. That is absolutely \nnot true. The people who work for these small businesses and farms are \nnot rich. Many times when a person dies, their estate has to sell the \nfarm or sell the business in order to pay, sometimes, over half of what \nthat business is worth. A family may have to work their whole lives to \nbuild up this business. There is no reason when they die that we will \ntake half of that value and put it in the Federal Government.\n  Only the Democrats are going to try to make America believe that \nsomehow we are better off as a Nation, somehow the lower income people \nin this country are better off if we take money from a family farm or \nsmall business or car dealership, if we take that money and put it into \nGovernment. Somehow America is better off and this will help the little \nguy.\n  What this does, it takes his job, it diminishes our economy because \nthis money will not work as hard in our Government to create jobs and \nto raise personal income as it will if we leave it where people are \ninvesting and hiring people, creating jobs, building our economy, all \nacross the country.\n  Unfortunately, again, our Democrats are obstructing one of the most \nimportant things we can do for the American people at this time. We can \nkeep talking about a good economy, but lower and middle-income \nAmericans are not increasing their incomes as fast as the cost of \ngasoline and health care is increasing. We have tried to put a small \nbusiness health plan on the floor of the Senate this year that we think \nwould lower the cost of health care to small businesses to around 20 \npercent, but it was blocked. We hope to bring it back.\n  Too many Americans do not have health insurance. Those that do are \npaying more and more every year. If they get a $25 a week raise and \ntheir employer has to take $50 more a week out of their paycheck for \ntheir health insurance, they are worse off than they were before. When \nthey stop by the gas station, if it costs $25 more to fill up their car \nthan it did a year ago, they are worse off than they were.\n  This bill we will be voting on--the motion to proceed--on Friday, we \nwill bring it to the Senate floor to debate and work on it in \nSeptember. We can send a signal to the people of South Carolina and the \npeople of this country that we care about the problems they are having \nmaking ends meet and we are not going to stand for the Democrat \nobstruction that continues to keep\n\n[[Page S8603]]\n\nthe cost of living higher by blocking new energy production, keeping \ntaxes high and fighting the things that will actually lower the cost of \nliving such as lowering the cost of gasoline and lowering the cost of \nhealth care.\n  The Family Prospect Act includes the first increase in the minimum \nwage in almost 10 years. It includes a reduction in the death tax so \nsmall family farms and businesses will not have to be sold. It includes \ntax credits for college tuition, welfare to work, and many other things \nwe know will create jobs. It is truly the Family Prosperity Act.\n  I call on my colleagues to stop obstructing what we are trying to do. \nWe believe we can raise the income of every American and that we can \nlower the cost of living if we just work together.\n  I hope all of our colleagues, Republican and Democrat, will see the \nindividual family in America is much more important as far as their \nincome than the Government. By passing this bill, at least moving on to \ndebate at the end of this week, we will have done a lot to reassure \nAmericans that we do care about lowering the cost of living so they can \nlive more prosperous lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/02/senate-section/article/S8603-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GULF OF MEXICO ENERGY BILL\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to comment on S. \n3711, the Gulf of Mexico energy bill. I believe this legislation \nstrikes an appropriate balance between our need for new sources of oil \nand natural gas, with the concerns of the coastal States.\n  I do support passage of S. 3711, but I do not support the bill passed \nby the House of Representatives earlier this year. The careful \ncompromise that is the Senate bill cannot be found in the version \npassed by the House. I will not support any legislation that opens \nSouth Carolina's coast to drilling for oil.\n  I am supporting the Senate bill, but I wish that it went further to \naddress our energy dependency issues. According to the International \nAtomic Energy Agency, IAEA, the world's demand for energy is expected \nto double in the coming years. This should be a call to intensify our \nefforts to become energy independent as soon as possible. We must \ncontinue to fund research into alternative sources of energy such as \nhydrogen. Where suitable we need to use solar power and potentially \nwind. We must expand production of ethanol beyond corn so that all \nregions of the country can produce ethanol efficiently.\n  As a cochair of the Senate Manufacturing Caucus, I voted for this \nlegislation to increase our supply of natural gas for manufacturers. \nAccording to a study by the Congressional Research Service, 24 percent \nof our natural gas is consumed to generate electricity. While it is \nvery easy to generate electricity from gas, it is a very inefficient \nuse of the resource. Instead of electricity generation, natural gas \nshould be utilized for industrial and home heating use.\n  For electricity generation, we need to continue encourage a \nrenaissance in nuclear power. This involves reducing the regulatory \nredtape involved in constructing new plants, opening Yucca Mountain, \nand proceeding with spent nuclear fuel recycling. Nuclear power is an \nefficient zero-emission source of energy that can address both our \nenergy and climate concerns.\n  I applaud the ongoing work of Senator Domenici and others to help \nincrease the supply of critical energy resources. This bill is a small \nstep in the right direction, and I look forward to working to further \nthis effort beyond what we are accomplishing today. I also encourage my \ncolleagues in the House that if they are truly serious about passing a \nbill to increase the supply of natural gas and oil this year, S. 3711 \nneeds to be passed by the House as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/02/senate-section/article/S8603-2", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          STRENGTHENING CFIUS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, yesterday my colleague from Nevada, \nSenator Reid, and I introduced the White Pine County Conservation, \nRecreation, and Development Act of 2006. This bill is the product of \nbipartisan cooperation and it represents a fair compromise on a number \nof issues relating to the protection of White Pine County's natural \nresources. While not perfect, this measure strikes an appropriate \nbalance between economic development, privatizing Federal lands, and \ndesignating wilderness areas. On whole, the White Pine County \nConservation, Recreation, and Development Act of 2006 is a good piece \nof legislation and it should be passed.\n  White Pine County, NV, with fewer than 10,000 residents, is in rural \neastern Nevada. The county has seen more prosperous times. The closure \nof mines has been hard on the local economy. Additionally, the Federal \nGovernment manages a high percentage of land which makes it difficult \nto foster growth. The bill seeks modest changes to the land ownership \npattern to allow White Pine County to grow and increase its tax base, \nand gives residents some modest tools they need to prosper. We have \nalso provided the same tools to the Ely Shoshone Tribe. We accomplish \nthese goals through land disposal, natural resource and wildlife \nconservation, tourism development, additional protection for the \nwondrous Great Basin National Park, recreation opportunities, Nevada \nState Parks expansions, wilderness designation, and a study to \ndetermine if off highway vehicles should have a designated route \nthrough the county.\n  The White Pine County Conservation, Recreation, and Development Act \nof 2006 is modeled on an innovative law that I coauthored as a member \nof the House of Representatives with former Senator Richard Bryan. That \nmeasure, the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1998, \nSNPLMA, is widely regarded as a huge success. Two successor laws I \nwrote with Senator Reid and Congressman Gibbons, the Clark County \nProtection of Lands and Natural Resources Act of 2002 and the Lincoln \nCounty Conservation, Recreation, and Development Act of 2004 followed \nSNPLMA.\n  These county bills for Nevada can and should be replicated in every \ncounty in Nevada. Many other Western States with large public land \nholdings may benefit from our Nevada model. The premise is simple: not \nall land is suitable for public ownership, and other public lands are \nsuitable for increased protection. We settle longstanding wilderness \nissues by designating permanent wilderness areas and release wilderness \nstudy areas to multiple use. Years of disagreements between developers, \nmultiple use advocates, governments, environmentalists, \nconservationists, and other stakeholders are settled by these land \nbills. Bringing together people from diverse interests has actually \nproved to be a very healthy exercise in Nevada; it has fostered a \nspirit of cooperation that will benefit generations of Nevadans to \ncome.\n  The White Pine County Conservation, Recreation, and Development Act \nof 2006 also proposes significant amendments to the Southern Nevada \nPublic Land Management Act of 1998. In some instances, we revise \nprovisions in current law that need improvement. We add new expenditure \ncategories for\n\n[[Page S8604]]\n\nprojects that will be beneficial to the citizens of Nevada and our \nenvironment.\n  For example, an improvement we make to current law relates to local \ngovernments in Clark and Lincoln Counties that use parks and trails \nfunds in the SNPLMA special account. The localities are having \ndifficulty building approved parks and trails projects. Local \ngovernments have to front their own funds and seek reimbursement from \nthe Bureau of Land Management to build these projects. In some cases, \nthis means millions of dollars that have to be borrowed or taken from \nother programs. To help local governments speed the development of \nparks and trails, we propose to pay local governments up front, \neliminating a cumbersome reimbursement process. We can still maintain \nthe financial integrity of all expenditures.\n  Additionally, we have significantly streamlined the affordable \nhousing provisions in current law. Our revisions will make Federal land \navailable at a discount for workforce housing and improve the lives of \nhard working families across the state of Nevada.\n  For new expenditure categories, we have taken great care to propose \nusing the SNPLMA special account for critical needs, and in particular, \nfor projects and initiatives that have broad support from the \nenvironmental and conservation community. We propose a clean water \nproject for Lake Mead in southern Nevada and hazardous fuels reduction \nprograms for two of the most heavily visited and fire prone areas in \nNevada: Lake Tahoe and the Spring Mountains. We seek to conserve \nColorado River water through the buyback of turf from public entities. \nEighty five percent of the special account is now used for \nenvironmental and recreational purposes. We do not seek to break from \nthe purposes for which SNPLMA was established in 1998; doing so would \nbe controversial and harm the prospects of the passage of this bill.\n  The White Pine County Conservation, Recreation, and Development Act \nis the culmination of 2 years of hard work and spirited debate. Our \nstaffs have worked together closely and have made visits to and held \nmeetings in White Pine County on numerous occasions. We have received \nthousands of comments and useful suggestions from people across Nevada. \nThis bill touches every corner of our beautiful State, and I am proud \nto have been part of this endeavor. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues and interested parties to improve this bill as necessary.\n  In summary, under title I, the bill authorizes the disposal of up to \n45,000 acres of BLM land in White Pine County. Distributes proceeds \nthrough a White Pine special account.\n  Under title II, the bill designates roughly 545,000 acres of \nwilderness in 13 new wilderness areas and adds wilderness to two areas \nestablished in 1989. The White Pine County Commission \nsupported approximately 500,000 acres. Standard language is included \nstating primacy of Nevada water laws in wilderness areas. Wildlife \nwater developments are protected in wilderness areas.\n\n  Under title III, the bill transfers approximately 645 acres to the \nFish and Wildlife Service to be managed as part of the Ruby Lake \nNational Wildlife Refuge. In lieu of expanding the size of Great Basin \nNational Park and in an effort to simplify land management and protect \nlands near Great Basin National Park, the bill transfers 117,000 acres \nfrom the Forest Service to the BLM. Of this amount, 54,400 acres are \nwithdrawn from mineral entry and other form of entry. Motorized access \nis confined to existing routes. This withdrawal language does not \nintend for the withdrawal area to be managed as an NCA, but it will \nlikely require an update of the Resource Management Plan after the \ntransfer of administrative jurisdiction is completed. It is also \nintended through bill language that the BLM honor existing permits and \ncooperative agreements approved by the Forest Service.\n  Under title IV, the bill conveys Federal lands to expand two existing \nNevada State parks: Cave Lake State Park and the Ward Charcoal Ovens \nState Park. The bill also conveys land to expand the Steptoe Valley \nWildlife Management Area. Finally, the bill conveys Federal lands for \nthe expansion of the Ely Airport and industrial park, with certain \nrestrictions.\n  Under title V, the bill authorizes a 3-year study for a possible \nextension of the Silver State Highway Off-Highway Vehicle Trail from \nLincoln County through White Pine County. The route may only be \ndesignated if the Secretary determines that there would not be \nsignificant impacts to natural, or cultural resources, and wildlife. \nWhile the bill provides the Secretary with discretion, it is my view \nthat providing a designated route for motorized use can actually \npreserve resources and wildlife in areas that are not appropriate for \nmotorized use.\n  Under title VI, the bill expands the Ely Shoshone Tribal Reservation \nby 3,500 acres. Extensive negotiations concerning the ownership of land \njust south of Ely strived to equitably balance the future expansion \nneeds of the city of Ely with the economic development needs of the \ntribe.\n  Under title VII, the bill authorizes funding from the Southern Nevada \nPublic Land Management Act to be used for the Eastern Nevada Landscape \nProject. The project will improve landscape restoration projects that \nreduce the risk of fire, prevent the endangerment of species, and \nimprove watersheds.\n  Under title VIII, this title significantly amends the Southern Nevada \nPublic Land Management Act of 1998, SNPLMA, to improve the \neffectiveness of the act, while proposing new conservation-oriented \nexpenditure categories from the special account.\n  Specifically, for SNPLMA special account expenditure categories, the \nbill provides new authority for (1) the expansion of the Southern \nNevada Water Authority's water saving ``Cash for Grass'' program to \npublic entities for permanent turf removal; (2) the implementation of \nthe Clark County Multi-Species Habitat Conservation Program, as was \nintended by the authors of SNPLMA; (3) the Clean Water Coalition's Lake \nMead and Las Vegas Wash water quality pipeline project; (4) two \ncomprehensive, 10-year hazardous fuels and fire prevention plans for \nthe Spring Mountains and the Lake Tahoe Basin--including adjacent areas \nin Nevada along the Carson Range; (5) Nevada State Parks in Clark \nCounty to access parks and trails funding from the special account; (6) \nthe Bureau of Land Management to clear and protect lands designated for \nsale in the Las Vegas Valley, alleviating the dumping problem; and (7) \na one-time park/trails/natural area nomination in Washoe County--\nremainder of Ballardini Ranch lands offered by a willing seller.\n  For SNPLMA improvements, the bill streamlines the current law's \naffordable housing provisions that make Federal land available in \nNevada at a discount. SNPLMA's current ceiling of serving persons not \nmore than 80 percent of median income has been lifted to 120 percent, \nand future BLM land auctions of more than 200 acres in the Las Vegas \nValley will require housing builders to set aside at least 5 percent of \nthe units for affordable housing as defined by SNPLMA. The bill also \nspeeds the progress of local governments' parks and trails projects by \nreplacing a cumbersome reimbursement system, which constrains the \nfinancial ability of local governments to finance projects, with a \nrequirement that local governments be paid up front.\n  Under title IX, this title establishes the Great Basin National \nHeritage Route. The House and Senate have each approved legislation \ndesignating this National Heritage Route; however, the bill has not \nreached the President for final approval. Designation of the Route will \nensure the protection of key educational and recreational opportunities \nin White Pine County and neighboring Millard County, UT.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/02/senate-section/article/S8604-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COSPONSORSHIP OF S. 3709\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, yesterday, the Senator from North Dakota gave \na speech on the Senate floor on what he calls the wall of debt. My \ncolleague said, ``We have cut revenue, cut revenue, cut revenue.'' \nClearly, he misunderstands both the rationale and the economic effect \nof the tax cuts. I would like to take a few moments today to clear up \nseveral misconceptions.\n  My colleagues know full well that the Senator's wall of debt is built \nof increased spending and runaway entitlement costs. Twenty years ago, \nentitlements accounted for 45 percent of the budget; soon, they will \nexceed 60 percent. Medicare alone is growing by almost 10 percent a \nyear. In 30 years, the three big entitlement programs--Medicare, \nMedicaid, and Social Security--if left unchanged, will consume the \nentire Federal budget, leaving no money for border security or \neducation or any other necessary program.\n  Our problem is not that Americans are undertaxed; our problem is that \nentitlement spending has run amok.\n  In characterizing the tax relief provided in recent years, we do \nbetter to call it a ``Foundation for Economic Growth.''\n  When Congress cuts tax rates, it leaves money in the private economy, \nwhere it can be used more efficiently. Being taxed at lower rates, \nAmericans have more incentive to work, save, and invest, which fosters \neconomic growth. Tax rate cuts implemented by Republicans have kept \nAmerica competitive by leaving $1.1 trillion in the American economy, \nwhere it has given us more than 4 years of uninterrupted economic \ngrowth.\n  To illustrate the effects that low tax rates can have on the economy, \nI recommend to my colleagues a study conducted by Dr. Edward Prescott, \na Nobel laureate in economics and a professor at Arizona State \nUniversity. Dr. Prescott's study reveals an interesting fact. Based on \nlabor marker statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand Development, Americans aged 15 to 64 worked 50 percent more than \ntheir European counterparts in France, Germany, and Italy. Fifty \npercent more. But this difference in output has not always been so. Two \ndecades ago, France's labor supply, as measured by hours worked per \nemployee, exceeded the American labor supply, as did several other \nEuropean nations.\n  Why is this? According to Dr. Prescott, this discrepancy in the labor \nmarket is attributable to taxes. When you lower the rates on \nindividuals, people work harder and greater productivity results. As \nthe United States lowered its marginal tax rates, Americans had a \ngreater incentive to work hard, work longer, and be more productive, \nrelative to the European nations, which kept higher tax rates.\n  The results of Dr. Prescott's study are telling. Ultimately, a \ncountry must establish an efficient tax system with low tax rates to \nachieve maximum economic productivity. This is exactly what this \nRepublican Congress has tried to accomplish: a tax system that keeps as \nmuch money as possible in the private economy, with individuals and \nbusinesses. In contrast, Democrats seem to want to keep as much \ntaxpayer money in Washington as possible.\n  If my colleague from North Dakota doesn't believe that our tax and \neconomic policies are working, let me quote some figures from the \nOffice of Management and Budget's Mid-Session Review, released on July \n11. These figures demonstrate that our tax and economic policies are \nfostering economic growth in the private economy and that all of this \nnew economic growth is helping to bring down the budget deficit.\n  From 2005 to 2006, Federal receipts are projected to grow by 11 \npercent, $246 billion, more than twice as fast as the economy itself. \nSince the tax relief was fully implemented in 2003, tax receipts have \nincreased by 34.6 percent. The economy has grown for 18 consecutive \nquarters. The economy has created over 5.4 million jobs since August \n2003. This is more than Japan and the 25 nations of Europe combined. \nThat is combined. The unemployment rate of 4.6 percent is lower than \nthe average of the last four decades. There have been 34 months of \nconsecutive job growth. Progrowth policies and tax receipts will allow \nthe deficit to be cut in half by 2008, a year ahead of the President's \nschedule. The projected budget deficit for 2006 has fallen from 3.2 \npercent of gross domestic product to 2.3 percent of GDP--and measuring \nour deficit in relation to the size of the American economy gives the \nmost accurate assessment of how big or small the deficit is relative to \nother times in our history. The projected deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP \nregisters at the 40-year average and is lower than the deficits in 17 \nof the last 25 years.\n  Although our economy has made many steps in the right direction, we \nought not be content to stop here. My colleagues and I will continue to \nwork to reduce Government spending and to make the tax cuts permanent.\n  The issue that prompted this debate over the deficit, to be clear \nabout it, is not how to reform entitlements. It is legislation the \nSenate will consider later this week to reform the estate tax. On this, \nas well, my colleagues labor under some misconceptions.\n  I want to take a moment to explain to them how many people will \nactually benefit from this legislation and to debunk some of the myths \nwe are hearing about the cost.\n  If Congress fails to reform the estate tax, the exemption amount will \nrevert to $1 million and the rate will be 55 percent in 2011. According \nto an analysis done by the Joint Committee on Taxation at the request \nof Senator Baucus, in that year, 127,000 estates would be subject to \nthe death tax--meaning that 127,000 estates would have a value of $1 \nmillion or more in 2011.\n  But if Congress approves estate tax reform, at least 115,000 estates \neach and every year that would otherwise be subject to the tax--estates \nthat are valued over $1 million, but less than $5 million--will be \nspared from this tax on productivity, once the reform proposal is fully \neffective in the year 2015. Under the proposal the Senate will consider \nlater this week, we will be left with about 11,500 estates each and \nevery year that will still be subject to the death tax.\n  The official Joint Committee on Taxation estimate for the cost of \ndeath tax reform is $267.6 billion over 10 years. Some of my colleagues \nhave used incorrect information generated by liberal interest groups to \nargue that this underestimates the cost of the proposal, since it does \nnot begin until 2010 and is not fully phased in until 2015. Thus, they \nclaim that the cost of the death tax reform would be $808 billion over \nthe 2012 to 2021 timeframe. They claim that it would cost $1 trillion \nover the same period ``when the associated increases in interest \npayments on the debt are included.''\n  There are several reasons this logic is faulty. First, Joint Tax has \nestimated that the proposal will cost $39.186 billion in 2012--the \nfirst year of the bogus 10-year $808 billion estimate. So if you assume \nthat it will cost that amount, plus an increase for economic growth, \neach year thereafter, it could not possibly add up to $808 billion for \nthat 10-year period.\n  Using actual Joint Tax estimates--the estimates we are required to \nuse around here--you can see that once the proposal is phased in, the \nannual cost will increase by roughly $5 billion as a result of economic \ngrowth. Thus, using actual JCT estimates through 2016 and then assuming \nthat the cost will increase by $5 billion each year, the total cost \nbetween 2012 and 2021 would be around $627 billion, not $808 billion.\n  Second, JCT does not produce estimates further ahead than 10 years \nbecause anything beyond that range is thought to be too speculative to \nbe even close to accurate. We simply cannot predict how much revenue \nthe proposed changes will bring into the Government's coffers that far \ndown the road. The Congressional Budget Office and Joint Tax have had \nenough trouble accurately estimating revenue collections one year out, \nlet alone 10. For example, reducing the long-term capital gains tax in \n2003, as estimated by the budgeteers at the Congressional Budget Office \nand the Joint Committee on Taxation, would cost $27 billion in 2004. It \nactually brought in $26 billion that year. If official estimators have \ndifficulty producing accurate revenue estimates in the short-term, we \nshould heed their warnings about not betting the farm on estimates that \ngo beyond 10 years.\n\n[[Page S8606]]\n\n  Finally, as I said, Joint Tax is the official revenue-estimating body \nof Congress. Whether we like their estimates or not, at the end of the \nday we all know that is the estimate we all must rely on.\n  I hope these facts will bring a little perspective to the debate we \nare having over the deficit, the effect tax cuts have on the economy \nand, more to the point this week, the debate over what is really a \nmoderate and responsible proposal to reform the death tax--a proposal \nthat deserves broad, bipartisan support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/02/senate-section/article/S8606-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ROBERTS DAIRY\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I wish to pay \ntribute to a business that has provided irreplaceable value to the city \nof Omaha, NE, for 100 years.\n  Roberts Dairy was founded in 1906 on a farm near the outskirts of \nLincoln, NE. This is where J.R. Roberts, the company's founder, began \nhis first retail route using a herd of 60 cows. During the first years \nof the company's existence, Roberts was the only dairy that sold \npasteurized milk to the community.\n  In 1992, the company expanded to Omaha and has been expanding ever \nsince. Roberts Dairy is a full-service dairy that processes and fills \nmore than 900 million gallons yearly. It operates around the clock, 365 \ndays a year, to provide the freshest dairy products to customers. \nRoberts serves a region that includes Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas \nand parts of Colorado, Illinois, and South Dakota.\n  Roberts Dairy is one of the area's largest companies, employing more \nthan 700 people and generating annual sales of more than $250 million.\n  Roberts is a Quality Chekd' dairy, which means all of its \nproducts are produced and tested by an independent association to \nhigher standards that exceed State and Federal requirements for purity, \nfreshness, and flavor.\n  In 2004, all four of Roberts' production plants received Merit of \nExcellence Awards from Quality Chekd, signifying production that far \nsurpasses the high standards necessary to be Quality Chekd dairy.\n  In 2004, the Iowa City plant received the Wayne Gingrich Award for \nProduction from Quality Chekd Dairies Inc., an international \norganization. The plant won the award after rigorous competition among \n40 dairies, each with several plants.\n  Roberts Dairy actively supports local and regional causes, events, \nand organizations that seek to help make our communities better places \nto live. The company also annually raises funds for the Juvenile \nDiabetes Research Foundation.\n  This year Roberts Dairy will be celebrating its 100th anniversary. As \npart of its centennial celebration, Roberts Dairy plans to host its \ncelebration in Omaha on Sunday, September 3, 2006 prior to the annual \nSeptemberFest.\n  In closing, I would like to once again thank Roberts Dairy for their \ncontribution to the State of Nebraska and the Midwest as a whole. The \nservices that Roberts provide to all of its customers will continue to \nhave a lasting impact for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/02/senate-section/article/S8606-2", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8606-S8607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO ALABAMA STATE AUDITOR BETH CHAPMAN\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I recently had the opportunity to \nspeak in favor of the constitutional amendment prohibiting the physical \ndesecration of the flag. I was proud to be a cosponsor of that \namendment, and even though it failed by a vote of 66 to 34, I do not \nbelieve it is an issue that will ``go gentle into that good night,'' to \nuse the words of poet Dylan Thomas. The flag is the unifying symbol of \nour country and all it embodies. Hundreds of thousands have died \nfighting to protect what it represents. It seems only logical that we, \nas a body, would continue to fight to protect it.\n  A few days after the Senate vote, I received a copy of a speech \nwritten by Alabama's state auditor, Beth Chapman. It was a speech she \ndelivered to a meeting of the Alabama Chapter of the Daughters of the \nAmerican Revolution--a group dedicated to promoting patriotism and \npreserving American history. I found it to be not only timely, but a \nbeautifully written and passionate reminder of what the flag represents \nand why it should be protected. I ask that the full speech be printed \nin the Record.\n  The material follows.\n\n                            Flag Day Speech\n\n\n Alabama State Auditor Beth Chapman's address to The state meeting of \n    the Alabama Chapter of the Daughter's of the American Revolution\n\n       The red, white and blue, the Stars and Stripes, Old Glory, \n     our Standard, the Star Spangle Banner--the American flag--it \n     has heard the battle cry for freedom and has been the banner \n     for democracy--it is our sacred symbol of the heart and soul \n     of our country--our freedom.\n       It represents the fifty states and the blood of the men and \n     women who died carrying it--if not on their bodies, in their \n     hearts and souls as they fought for freedom of a nation--our \n     nation.\n       Though tattered and worn, it continued to wave as 6,000 \n     patriots died in the Revolutionary War breaking off the \n     chains of tyranny from Great Britain.\n       It survived the Civil War and draped the caskets of many of \n     the 500,000 total (some brother against brother) who fought \n     and died defending freedom, though they disagreed on what \n     that freedom meant--the flag continued to wave in its \n     defense.\n       It soared at Gettysburg, unfurled at the Battle of the \n     Bulge, was blood stained at Kasson, stood watch in the final \n     hours at Pearl Harbor as hulls of ships and shells of men \n     floated on the burning waters. It was hoisted by brave \n     American soldiers at Iwo Jima.\n       Throughout history it was tested and tried on the beaches \n     of Normandy and was triumphant on the shores of Tripoli.\n       It stood for justice's sake though 116,000 Americans fell \n     in WWI and 405,000 in World War II.\n       It survived the numbness of frost bite in the Chosin \n     Reservoir of the Korean Conflict and heard the brassy bugle's \n     cry of Taps being played for more than 54,000 who lost their \n     lives.\n       It proudly but sadly waves today over a wall that bears \n     only etched names in stone of more than 58,000 faces, hearts, \n     souls and bodies of the fallen soldiers who died in the \n     jungles of Vietnam.\n       It flew for righteousness' sake mounted in the dirt of \n     Desert Storm as 293 Americans' bodies were killed but their \n     love for country was not captured, conquered or defeated.\n       Most recently it saw 1,672 Americans in Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom die and is has covered the bodies of 190 killed in \n     Enduring Freedom--yet the flag still endures. It still \n     waves--restoring the foundations on which America was built \n     and reminding us of the freedom with which we've been \n     blessed.\n       And today it continues to wave, somberly but surely over \n     the 260,000 brave and courageous veterans whose silent, \n     sleeping spirits remain in Arlington Cemetery. They defended \n     our freedom and determined our destiny and the destiny of our \n     nation. Now they rest in peace while we enjoy the symbolism \n     of the flag with as much passion as they once felt when they \n     were defending it.\n       Many have spit on the flag, buried it and burned it, not \n     realizing the freedom it represents is what allows them that \n     right, though no matter how obnoxious and disrespectful it \n     may be, it supposedly was right.\n       But what a pity they know not how much innocent blood was \n     shed so they could have that freedom to express the \n     bitterness, hatred and disrespect they appear to have for \n     their own freedom and anything it represents.\n       Over one million men and women of the United States \n     Military have died defending what our flag symbolizes, but \n     others have died simply by living the American Dream which it \n     represents--2,595 civilians at the World Trade Center on 9-\n     11, 92 on Flight 11 and 65 on Flight 175, 125 in the \n     Pentagon, 64 on Flight 77, and 45 on Flight 93--total of \n     2,986 died on that same tragic day--doing nothing but living \n     out in their daily lives what our flag stands for--freedom. \n     They were the innocent victims of evil people and a jealousy \n     and hatred that comes against such a beloved freedom as ours.\n       And on that day when our country was at its lowest level, \n     our spirits had plummeted; we had been wounded worse than at \n     any time in our great nation--in the very middle of that \n     ordeal, three exhausted New York Fireman had the foresight, \n     the vision and the inspiration which could only be fueled \n     physically by adrenaline, but spiritually and emotionally by \n     raw patriotism--love of God and country--to hoist an American \n     flag for all the world, friend and foe alike to see, so they \n     would know we had not been defeated.\n       Even in the ruin and rubble, Old Glory was raised and \n     proudly waved as she had so many times before in peace and \n     war. She rose up out of the dust, dirt and even fire to \n     restore the American spirit, which can not be snuffed out as \n     a burning candle by tragedy or hatred, but is only further \n     motivated to wave higher and further unfold to spread the \n     news of freedom and of victory.\n       It symbolized freedom, hope, and determination of the \n     American people and the strength of our spirit.\n       Some have purchased with blood the freedom our flag \n     represents, other have defended it--and by the grace of God \n     those of us in this room have been blessed to simply live \n     under it in the greatest country on the face of the earth.\n\n[[Page S8607]]\n\n       And it costs most of us nothing and that's why it should \n     have our utmost honor and respect. For the same exact flag \n     many not have been through all the battles, but what it \n     represents has been, and that is more than anyone person can \n     say.\n       The flag has seen it all and survived it all, therefore, \n     the spirit and freedom which it represents has survived it \n     all. It is the epitome of the sacred symbol we know it to be.\n       It stands atop the United States Supreme Court building as \n     justice attempts to be served; it stands over the United \n     States Capitol in hopes of good laws being passed and bad \n     ones being killed.\n       It stands in schoolyards as children play, over Court \n     Houses and City Halls as good grassroots government is \n     hopefully being administered. It drapes the shoulders of our \n     country's finest athletes as they represent us at the \n     Olympics.\n       But let us not forget that it has also left this earth to \n     represent us, to fly into the Heavens and land on the moon. \n     It has flown into the wild blue yonder far into the majestic \n     skies reaching toward the very face of God, only to explode, \n     and quickly plummet into the sea with the Challenger and the \n     brave Americans in it.\n       There is little of our heritage that it has not seen; there \n     are fewer of our victories, triumphs, and tragedies that it \n     has not experienced first hand. It has waved at half mast and \n     at full mast, but it has never ceased to wave.\n       It is not to be burned or buried, but flown with great \n     pride and admiration. Some say it is not the flag, but what \n     it represents that we should honor--I say we cannot honor one \n     without a pledge of allegiance to the other.\n       The Pledge of Allegiance nationally debuted in October 1892 \n     on Columbus Day when 12 million children across America \n     recited it for the first time.\n       The Pledge of Allegiance has had three major changes:\n       Originally it read: ``I pledge allegiance to my flag and to \n     the Republic for which it stands: one nation indivisible, \n     with liberty and justice for all.''\n       June 14, 1923, it was revised to ``the flag'' instead of \n     ``my flag'' and the words ``United States'' were added.\n       One year later it was revised to read ``the flag, of the \n     United States of America.''\n       But the most significant change came on Flag Day, June 14, \n     1954, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower added these two \n     simple, but profound words: ``Under God.''\n       And this is what he said about adding those two words: ``In \n     this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious \n     faith in America's heritage and future; in this way we shall \n     constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever \n     will be our country's most powerful resource in peace and \n     war.''\n       The Pledge of Allegiance as we know it today is only 31 \n     words packed with pride, honor, loyalty and devotion.\n       Red Skelton, a brilliant comedic mind of another generation \n     shared this story on television many years ago. Little did he \n     know this story would be so poignant and prophetic today. He \n     shared the story of his teacher Mr. Laswell who came to think \n     his class was just saying the pledge of allegiance out of \n     routine so he made a drastic change in their schedule one \n     day. This is what he said to them:\n       ``I've been listening to you boys and girls recite the \n     Pledge of Allegiance all semester and it seems as thought it \n     is becoming monotonous to you. If I may, may I recite it and \n     try to explain to you the meaning of each word.''\n       I--me, an individual, a committee of one.\n       Pledge--dedicate all of my worldly goods to give without \n     self pity,\n       Allegiance--my love and devotion\n       To the flag--our standard, old glory, a symbol of freedom. \n     Wherever she waves, there's been respect because your loyalty \n     has given her a dignity that shouts freedom is everybody's \n     job.\n       United--that means we all have come together.\n       States--individual communities that have united into 48 \n     great states. Forty-eight individual communities with pride \n     and dignity and purpose; all divided with imaginary \n     boundaries, yet united to a common purpose and that's love \n     for country.\n       And to the Republic--a state in which sovereign power is \n     invested in representatives chose by the people to govern. \n     And government is the people and it's from the people to the \n     leaders, not from the leaders to the people.\n       For which it stands, one nation--one nation meaning ``so \n     blessed by God.''\n       Indivisible--incapable of being divided.\n       With liberty--which is freedom--the right of power to live \n     one's life without threats, fear or some sort of retaliation\n       And justice--the principle or quality of dealing fairly \n     with others.\n       For all--which means boys, and girls, it's as much your \n     country as mine.\n       Skelton later said since he was a young boy that two states \n     had been added to our country and that two words had been \n     added to our pledge--``Under God.''\n       Then he smiled and said, ``Wouldn't it be a pity if someone \n     said that (those two words ``Under God'') is a prayer and \n     they would eliminate it from schools too?\n       Little did he know that now, many years later, that very \n     effort has been discussed before the United States Supreme \n     Court.\n       Though the words to the Pledge of Allegiance have changed \n     its purpose, meaning and intent has not.\n       But the flag still waves and our nation is still one nation \n     under God and we still live under the banner of democracy and \n     the flag waves in our churches, school yards, state and \n     national government buildings and always in our hearts and \n     homes--because that's where freedom originated and that is \n     where it must remain.\n       When we pledge allegiance to our flag, we are making a \n     commitment, and what we are committed to is what we become as \n     individual people, and as a nation. The destinies of many \n     nations have been determined by what their people were \n     allegiant to--Rome is a good example of that. Let America \n     never become a Rome.\n       Our flag is more than three colors of cloth and millions of \n     pieces of thread sown by hand. It is more than Betsy Ross and \n     Francis Scott Key. It represents a message of hope and \n     freedom that is carried in the hearts and souls of the people \n     of a nation for generations.\n       I pray today that God will continue to bless this country \n     and that we may never divorce ourselves from the preservation \n     of that freedom for which our men and women have died and our \n     flag still boldly stands.\n       Now let us stand and with great pride, honor, humility and \n     resolve--with great enthusiasm, fervor, patriotism, passion \n     and respect to say our pledge of allegiance together as we \n     have never said it before.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/02/senate-section/article/S8607-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GALELYN McELROY\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

This \nprogram is designed to promote recognition and respect for teachers of \ncivic education across the United States.\n  The American Civic Education Teacher Awards are a part of the \nAlliance for Representative Democracy which is designed to educate \nAmericans about the relationship between the government and the \nAmerican people it serves. This program helps individuals better \nunderstand the way the government works and how it relates to them \npersonally in their individual lives.\n  Ms. McElroy teaches senior legal and government services, U.S. \nhistory, and world civilization at Central High in Prospect, KY, and \nhas been providing educational leadership in the classroom there for 13 \nyears. She has gone above and beyond the curriculum expectations by \nestablishing out of school mentoring experiences for her students at \nlocal law firms and legal study programs through the University of \nLouisville. She motivates them to think about the future by providing \nthem with real-world experiences that partner with their civic \neducation studies.\n  I now ask my fellow colleagues to join me in thanking Ms. McElroy for \nher commitment to making Kentucky a better place through educational \nexcellence and for providing her students the motivation to succeed in \nlife. I know I can speak for all Kentuckians when I say congratulations \nand thank you for everything that you do.

Mr. President, I am pleased to acknowledge the \n100th anniversary of the Planters Company which has had a fruitful \nworking relationship with Suffolk County over the past century and has \none of its major production facilities located there. To celebrate, \nPlanters has embarked on a 4- month, cross-country tour visiting \nlandmarks in Planters' history.

The Planters Suffolk \nfacility produces a variety of nut products. Planters has employed \nthousands of Virginians over the years, and many more have enjoyed and \nbenefited from both its products and its reputation in the Suffolk \ncommunity. Planters has been a model for the type of relationship that \nshould exist between communities and businesses over the past century, \nand we look forward to working with them for the next 100 \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/02/senate-section/article/S8608-3", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO RALPH CONTE\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge the \nretirement and to honor the service of a fellow Virginian, a true \npatriot, and a career civil servant of the Department of Defense who \nhas given 39 years of dedicated military and civilian service to our \ncountry. Mr. Ralph Conte was born in Ponza, Italy, in 1940. He \nimmigrated to the United States in January 1956 whereupon he studied \nengineering at New York University. He was commissioned as an Air Force \nofficer through OTS in June 1967, and his first assignment was at \nAviano Air Base, Italy. His military career included serving in Vietnam \nas a member of the premier combat engineering unit in the Air Force, \nknown as RED HORSE. He further served at Kunsan Air Base in Korea and \nat Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH. In 1975 he separated from \nactive duty and continued service to his country as a civilian manager \nat Air Force Logistics Command and a NATO program manager at Ramstein \nAir Base, Germany. He finally settled in Virginia in June 1986, working \nfor the Air National Guard eventually as the chief of programs.\n  I believe everyone in the Air National Guard will attest that very \nfew individuals have had a greater positive impact on providing the \nfinest facilities and installations for the Air National Guard to \naccomplish their missions. During his tenure at the Air National Guard, \nMr. Conte was directly responsible for planning and programming \nfacility and real property requirements worth over $7 billion to \nsupport 177 Guard locations throughout the 50 States, 3 territories, \nand the District of Columbia. His leadership, outstanding technical \nexpertise, and unlimited energy have created a blueprint for success \nfor which generations of Air National Guardsmen will reap the benefits. \nI offer sincere appreciation and thanks for his service, and wish him \nand his family the best in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/02/senate-section/article/S8608-4", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/02/senate-section/article/S8608-5", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/02/senate-section/article/S8608-6", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:40 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to increase the number of Federal judgeships, in \naccordance with recommendations by the Judicial Conference, in \ndistricts that have an extraordinarily high immigration caseload; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Kyl and \nCornyn to introduce legislation that creates the new Federal judgeships \nrecommended by the 2005 Judicial Conference for our U.S. district \ncourts that have a serious overload of immigration cases.\n  I believe it is imperative to equip all of our Federal agencies with \nthe assets they need to secure our borders and enforce our immigration \nlaws. That includes equipping our U.S. district courts with enough \njudges to handle the criminal immigration cases that appear on their \ndockets. The immigration reform bill passed by the Senate in May \nrecognizes that with increased border security and immigration \nenforcement there will be increased prosecutions, and the bill calls \nfor more immigration judges to handle those prosecutions. But the bill \nfails to recognize that repeat immigration law violators can be charged \nwith a felony and tried in U.S. district court. We need to increase the \nnumber of judges in our district courts that handle such cases, \nparticularly in those districts that are already overwhelmed with \nimmigration cases.\n  The legislation I am proposing creates eleven new Federal judgeships, \nas recommended by the Judicial Conference, in the U.S. district courts \nin which at least 50 percent of their criminal cases are immigration \ncases. The bill affects four districts, all of which border Mexico. In \nfiscal year 2004, the Western District of Texas had 5599 criminal case \nfilings, 3,688 of those cases, over 65 percent, dealt with immigration. \nThe District Court of Arizona had 4,007 criminal filings, of which \n2,404 cases, or 59 percent, were immigration filings. The Southern \nDistrict of California has 2,206 immigration filings, 64 percent of \ntheir 3,400 total criminal filings. Lastly, the District of New Mexico \nhad 2,497 criminal filings, 60 percent of them, 1,502 cases, were \nimmigration cases.\n  Based on these caseloads, I think we should already be giving these \ndistricts new judgeships. But to increase our border security and \nimmigration enforcement efforts without equipping these courts to \nhandle the even larger immigration caseloads that they are expected to \nface would be tantamount to willful negligence.\n  The New Mexico District Chief Judge, Martha Vazquez, wrote me a \nletter in May about the situation the New Mexico District faces. Judge \nVazquez wrote:\n\n       As it is, the burden on Article III Judges in this District \n     is considerable. This District ranks first among all \n     districts in criminal filings per judgeship: 405 criminal \n     filings compared to the national average of 87. As in all \n     federal districts along the southwest border, the majority of \n     cases filed in this District relate to immigration offenses \n     under United States Code, Title 8 and drug offenses arising \n     under Title 21. Immigration and drug cases account for \n     eighty-five percent of the caseload in the District of New \n     Mexico. . . In fiscal year 1997, there were 240 immigration \n     felony filings in the District of New Mexico. By fiscal year \n     2005, the number of immigration felony filings increased to \n     1,826, which is an increase of 661 percent . . . Increasing \n     the number of Immigration Judges will do nothing to reduce \n     the increasing caseload in the border states' federal courts.\n\n  The Albuquerque Tribune has also documented the burden immigration \ncases put on district courts. An April 17 article entitled ``Judges See \nRipple Effect of Policy on Immigration,'' stated:\n\n       U.S. District Chief Judge Martha Vazquez of Santa Fe \n     oversees a court that faces a rising caseload from illegal \n     border crossings and related crime. And help from Washington \n     is by no means certain . . . From Sept. 30, 1999 to Sept. 30, \n     2004 (the end of the fiscal year), the caseload in the New \n     Mexico federal district court increased 57.5 percent, from \n     2,804 to 4,416. In the 2004 fiscal year alone, 2,126 felony \n     cases were heard, almost half of all cases in the entire 10th \n     Circuit, which includes Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Utah and \n     Wyoming. Most typical immigration cases go before an \n     immigration judge, and the subjects are deported. But people \n     deported once and caught crossing illegally again can be \n     charged with a felony. And that brings the defendant into \n     federal district court. Those are the cases driving up New \n     Mexico's caseload . . . Some days as many as 90 defendants \n     crowd the courtroom in Las Cruces . . . The same problems are \n     afflicting federal border courts in Arizona, California, and \n     Texas.\n\n  Similar problems were documented in a May 23 Reuters article entitled \n``Bush Border Patrol Plan to Pressure Courts'' which said:\n\n       President George W. Bush's plan to send thousands of \n     National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border could spark a \n     surge in immigration cases and U.S. courts are ill prepared \n     to handle them . . . Even without the stepped-up security at \n     the border, federal courts in southern California, Arizona, \n     New Mexico and Texas have been overburdened. Carelli [a \n     spokesman for U.S. federal courts] said those five judicial \n     districts, out of 94 nationwide, account for 34 percent of \n     all criminal cases moving through U.S. courts . . . Most \n     immigrants caught crossing illegally are ordered out of the \n     country without prosecution. But that still leaves a growing \n     pile of cases involving illegals who are being prosecuted \n     after being caught multiple times or those accused of other \n     crimes . . . Nationwide, each U.S. judge handles an average \n     of 87 cases a year. But along the southern border, even \n     before Bush's plan moves forward, the average is around 300 \n     per judge, Carelli said.\n\n  Mr. President, the U.S. Congress needs to address the overwhelming \nimmigration caseload in our southwestern border U.S. district courts. \nThe bill I am filing today with Senators Kyl and Cornyn does just that \nby authorizing the nine permanent and two temporary judgeships \nrecommended by the 2005 Judicial Conference for the four U.S. districts \nin which the immigration caseload totals more than fifty percent of \nthose districts' total criminal caseload.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3773\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADDITIONAL DISTRICT COURT JUDGESHIPS.\n\n       The President shall appoint, by and with the advice and \n     consent of the Senate, such additional district court judges \n     as are necessary to carry out the 2005 recommendations of the \n     Judicial Conference of the United States for district courts \n     in which the criminal immigration filings totaled more than \n     50 percent of all criminal filings for the 12-month period \n     ending September 30, 2004.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Stevens, \n        Mr. Cochran, Mr. Burns, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Cornyn, \n        Mr. Domenici, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Alexander):\n  S. 3774. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \nthe unauthorized disclosure of classified information; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a related area of \nsecurity. The Defense appropriations bill is extremely important, but I \nbelieve that there is another matter we should be considering. I \nappreciate the courtesy of the managers of the bill for allowing me to \npresent this.\n  This is legislation that was passed by the Intelligence Committees in \n2000. It\n\n[[Page S8613]]\n\nhad been adopted by unanimous vote, but it was vetoed at the time. This \nbill very simply provides, for the first time, a simple, clear \nstatement of penalties for Government employees and contractors with \naccess to classified information, who have signed agreements to keep it \nclassified, who knowingly and willfully leak America's most important \nsecrets. Over the past few years, we have seen unauthorized disclosures \nof classified information at an alarming rate. Each one of the leaks \ngravely increases the threat to our national security and makes it \neasier for our enemies to achieve their murderous and destructive \nplans. Each leak is a window of opportunity for terrorists to discover \nour sources and methods. Each violation of trust guarantees chaos and \nviolence in the world.\n  Time and time again, we have witnessed leaks that told our enemies \nnot only that we were watching them and listening to them but how and \nwhom we are cooperating with and how we are getting the information. \nThese leaks have threatened to erode the trust and confidence of the \nAmerican people and the members of the intelligence community, as well \nas our allies, built upon years of work. What if during World War II, \nAmericans had seen a leak of the Enigma Program that allowed us to \ndecipher enemy communications and if major media outlets had joined in \nblowing our most sensitive secret?\n  Over the past year, there has arisen an apparent absence of fear of \npunishment in regard to arbitrary divulging of classified information. \nThese are individuals who took solemn vows to protect our Nation. In \ntaking a vow to protect classified information, one should acknowledge \nthat being privy to it establishes a solemn trust. I and all of my \ncolleagues are under obligations as Senators. And as a member of the \nIntelligence Committee, I have a higher standard to protect classified \ninformation. Having that access is a privilege and a trust. There are a \nnumber of stinging examples of how these leaks have compromised \nsecurity. I will not call attention to them because the people who are \nbenefiting from knowing the leaks don't need to know more about it. But \na litany of intelligence officials over the past year have told me how \nmuch it hurts their efforts.\n  The former Director of the CIA, Porter Goss, stated in open session \nthat there has been ``very severe'' damage to our national security. He \nrepeated ``very severe.'' I asked the same question to current CIA \nDirector Michael Hayden in his open confirmation hearing about the \nleaks and he said: We have applied the Darwinian theory to terrorists. \nUnfortunately, we are only catching the dumb ones because the smart \nones who watch the media understand what we are doing and will escape. \nAnd many others have repeated that refrain. That was before the leakage \nof our ability to track terrorist financing efforts occurred in papers.\n  As I have traveled throughout the world and talked with cooperating \noverseas officials, they have asked me why they should continue to work \nwith us when we can't keep secrets. Our intelligence chiefs abroad tell \nme that sources now think twice before speaking with U.S. officers. \nThey fear their information leaking. They said: How can I give you this \ninformation if it might be leaked?\n  What they are really worried about is that leaking their information \nwill identify them and put themselves and their families at risk. This \nis something which we cannot tolerate if we are to get the intelligence \nwe need.\n  This is language which has been passed before. It is very simple. It \njust applies to former or retired officers or employees of the United \nStates or any person who has authorized access and who has agreed to \nkeep it confidential.\n  First, let me be clear about a couple of things this legislation does \nnot do. It only affects Government employees and contractors who have \nsigned a nondisclosure agreement. It doesn't affect the media, \nbusinesses, or private citizens.\n  Second, it only regards information properly and appropriately \nclassified, not frivolously or inappropriately classified. If there is \nan overclassification, then I think the courts would easily throw out \nthe prosecution. It doesn't cover the new categories of information \ndeveloped since 9/11, like sensitive but unclassified or unclassified \nfor official use only. It limits the subject of prosecution to those \nknowingly and willfully disclosing to someone they know is not \nauthorized to receive it. It is not a ``gotcha'' tool; it is for \ndeliberate leakers.\n  Well, a Federal judge has pointed out that there is no one piece of \nlegislation that brings together all of our outdated and disparate \nprovisions on the law. The judge has stated that ``the merits of the \nlaw are committed to Congress. If it is not sensible, it ought to be \nchanged.'' This is why we are doing this.\n  Some of my colleagues said it is an insult that you have to pass a \nbill to protect classified information. One said:\n\n       If they have taken an oath, they don't need the threat of \n     law hanging over them to maintain that oath.\n\n  My answer to that one is, where have you been over the past year? I \nam sorry to inform you that some people need laws to hold them in \ncheck. More important, they need prosecution under those laws. There is \nnothing like an orange jumpsuit on a deliberate leaker to discourage \nothers from going down that path.\n  I have heard that some say Attorney General Ashcroft recommended that \nthe executive branch not pursue leaks legislation. That is true, but \nnot because it wasn't needed. He said that the onus is on the executive \nbranch to take care to instill a sense of loyalty in its employees to \ntrack down leakers and to prevent leakers. He was right. He also said \nthat leaks legislation had value.\n  I am more than happy to work with my colleagues. I believe it is \nappropriate to have this debate at a time when Osama bin Laden and al-\nZawahiri are warning the United States of future terrorist attacks. It \nis important to provide protection so that our men and women in the \nfield in places of active hostility, such as Iraq and Afghanistan, can \nbe protected by intelligence that is not compromised.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter dated \n31 July from the Association for Intelligence Officers, a group of \n4,500 current and former intelligence military and homeland security \nofficers supporting passage of this legislation.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Association for Intelligence\n\n\n                                                     Officers,\n\n                                        McLean, VA, July 31, 2006.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Bond: On behalf of the Association for \n     Intelligence Officers, a 31-year organization of over 4,500 \n     current and former intelligence, military and homeland \n     security officers, I write in support of your intention to \n     introduce a bill concerning prohibition of the disclosure of \n     classified information by individuals who sign secrecy \n     agreements. We concur that such unauthorized actions have \n     damaged national security.\n       We note that as early as the 2001 fiscal year, the Congress \n     included such provisions in the Intelligence Authorization \n     Act, but the legislation did not prevail over presidential \n     veto. Since that time, no substantive remedy has appeared.\n       We understand that the proposed legislation will apply only \n     to government employees and civilian contractors who promised \n     to uphold the secrecy contracts they signed. It will not \n     cover others, such as journalists, nor others not working for \n     the federal government or contractors. It would prohibit only \n     knowing and willful disclosure, so that innocent, \n     inadvertent, or accidental disclosures would not be covered.\n       We believe there has been an increasing cascade of damaging \n     disclosures of classified information such that a crisis now \n     exists. With no serious punishments nor enforcement of \n     penalties, we lack any meaningful impediment to this growing \n     willful harm to the national interest. As a result, the leaks \n     grow--essentially sabotaging our own intelligence and \n     military operations and causing the deaths of our troops and \n     intelligence operatives. Our allies, understandably, are \n     losing trust that we can engage in mutual operations and \n     hesitate to share crucial intelligence and battlefield \n     information with us.\n       What leakers think is a harmless bit of back channel \n     policymaking has repercussions down the line that constitute \n     treason and should be treated as such.\n       We enthusiastically support your efforts. We are ready to \n     provide assistance in whatever manner would prove helpful.\n           Very respectfully,\n                                                 S. Eugene Poteat,\n                                                  President, AFIO.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, first, I thank Senator Bond for dealing \nwith this important issue. We have indeed\n\n[[Page S8614]]\n\nreached a point in this country where I think there is confusion about \nthe absolute responsibility and legal requirement to maintain \nclassified information in our Government. We need to be more serious \nabout that. He can speak with authority. His son has served in Iraq and \nis a fine officer. We appreciate that. He understands these issues \ndeeply. Again, I thank Senator Bond for that.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Coleman, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \n        Feingold, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 3775. A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to assist \ncountries in sub-Saharan Africa in the effort to achieve \ninternationally recognized goals in the treatment and prevention of \nHIV/AIDS and other major diseases and the reduction of maternal and \nchild mortality by improving human health care capacity and improving \nretention of medical health professionals in sub-Saharan Africa, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n\n                                S. 3775\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``African Health Capacity \n     Investment Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``HIV/AIDS'' has the meaning given \n     such term in section 104A(g) of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b-2(g)).\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The World Health Report, 2003, Shaping the Future, \n     states, ``The most critical issue facing health care systems \n     is the shortage of people who make them work.''.\n       (2) The World Health Report, 2006, Working Together for \n     Health, states, ``The unmistakable imperative is to \n     strengthen the workforce so that health systems can tackle \n     crippling diseases and achieve national and global health \n     goals. A strong human infrastructure is fundamental to \n     closing today's gap between health promise and health reality \n     and anticipating the health challenges of the 21st \n     century.''.\n       (3) The shortage of health personnel, including doctors, \n     nurses, pharmacists, counselors, paraprofessionals, and \n     trained lay workers is one of the leading obstacles to \n     fighting HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (4) The HIV/AIDS pandemic aggravates the shortage of health \n     workers through loss of life and illness among medical staff, \n     unsafe working conditions for medical personnel, and \n     increased workloads for diminished staff, while the shortage \n     of health personnel undermines efforts to prevent and provide \n     care and treatment for those with HIV/AIDS.\n       (5) Workforce constraints and inefficient management are \n     limiting factors in the treatment of tuberculosis, which \n     infects over \\1/3\\ of the global population.\n       (6) Over 1,200,000 people die of malaria each year. More \n     than 75 percent of these deaths occur among African children \n     under the age of 5 years old and the vast majority of these \n     deaths are preventable. The Malaria Initiative of President \n     George W. Bush seeks to reduce dramatically the disease \n     burden of malaria through both prevention and treatment. \n     Paraprofessionals can be instrumental in reducing mortality \n     and economic losses associated with malaria and other health \n     problems.\n       (7) For a woman in sub-Saharan Africa, the lifetime risk of \n     maternal death is 1 out of 16. In highly developed countries, \n     that risk is 1 out of 2,800. Increasing access to skilled \n     birth attendants is essential to reducing maternal and \n     newborn mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (8) The Second Annual Report to Congress on the progress of \n     the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief identifies the \n     strengthening of essential health care systems through health \n     care networks and infrastructure development as critical to \n     the sustainability of funded assistance by the United States \n     Government and states that ``outside resources for HIV/AIDS \n     and other development efforts must be focused on \n     transformational initiatives that are owned by host \n     nations''. This report further states, ``Alongside efforts to \n     support community capacity-building, enhancing the capacity \n     of health care and other systems is also crucial for \n     sustainability. Among the obstacles to these efforts in many \n     nations are inadequate human resources and capacity, limited \n     institutional capacity, and systemic weaknesses in areas such \n     as: quality assurance; financial management and accounting; \n     health networks and infrastructure; and commodity \n     distribution and control.''.\n       (9) Vertical disease control programs represent vital \n     components of United States foreign assistance policy, but \n     human resources for health planning and management often \n     demands a more systematic approach.\n       (10) Implementation of capacity-building initiatives to \n     promote more effective human resources management and \n     development may require an extended horizon to produce \n     measurable results, but such efforts are critical to \n     fulfillment of many internationally recognized objectives in \n     global health.\n       (11) The November 2005 report of the Working Group on \n     Global Health Partnerships for the High Level Forum on the \n     Health Millennium Development Goals entitled ``Best Practice \n     Principles for Global Health Partnership Activities at \n     Country Level'', raises the concern that the collective \n     impact of various global health programs now risks \n     ``undermining the sustainability of national development \n     plans, distorting national priorities, diverting scarce human \n     resources and/or establishing uncoordinated service delivery \n     structures'' in developing countries. This risk underscores \n     the need to coordinate international donor efforts for these \n     vital programs with one another and with recipient countries.\n       (12) The emigration of significant numbers of trained \n     health care professionals from sub-Saharan African countries \n     to the United States and other wealthier countries \n     exacerbates often severe shortages of health care workers, \n     undermines economic development efforts, and undercuts \n     national and international efforts to improve access to \n     essential health services in the region.\n       (13) Addressing this problem, commonly referred to as \n     ``brain drain'', will require increased investments in the \n     health sector by sub-Saharan African governments and by \n     international partners seeking to promote economic \n     development and improve health care and mortality outcomes in \n     the region.\n       (14) Virtually every country in the world, including the \n     United States, is experiencing a shortage of health workers. \n     The Joint Learning Initiative on Human Resources for Health \n     and Development estimates that the global shortage exceeds \n     4,000,000 workers. Shortages in sub-Saharan Africa, however, \n     are far more acute than in any other region of the world. The \n     World Health Report, 2006, states that ``[t]he exodus of \n     skilled professionals in the midst of so much unmet health \n     need places Africa at the epicentre of the global health \n     workforce crisis.''.\n       (15) Ambassador Randall Tobias, now the Director of United \n     States Foreign Assistance and Administrator of the United \n     States Agency for International Development, has stated that \n     there are more Ethiopian trained doctors practicing in \n     Chicago than in Ethiopia.\n       (16) According to the United Nations Development Programme, \n     Human Development Report 2003, approximately 3 out of 4 \n     countries in sub-Saharan Africa have fewer than 20 physicians \n     per 100,000 people, the minimum ratio recommended by the \n     World Health Organization, and 13 countries have 5 or fewer \n     physicians per 100,000 people.\n       (17) Nurses play particularly important roles in sub-\n     Saharan African health care systems, but approximately \\1/4\\ \n     of sub-Saharan African countries have fewer than 50 nurses \n     per 100,000 people or less than \\1/2\\ the staffing levels \n     recommended by the World Health Organization.\n       (18) Paraprofessionals can be trained more quickly than \n     nurses or doctors and are critically needed in sub-Saharan \n     Africa to meet immediate health care needs.\n       (19) Imbalances in the distribution of countries' health \n     workforces represents a global problem, but the impact is \n     particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (20) In Malawi, for example, more than 95 percent of \n     clinical officers are in urban health facilities, and about \n     25 percent of nurses and 50 percent of physicians are in the \n     4 central hospitals of Malawi. Yet the population of Malawi \n     is estimated to be 87 percent rural.\n       (21) In parts of sub-Saharan Africa, such as Kenya, \n     thousands of qualified health professionals are employed \n     outside the health care field or are unemployed despite job \n     openings in the health sector in rural areas because poor \n     working and living conditions, including poor educational \n     opportunities for children, transportation, and salaries, \n     make such openings unattractive to candidates.\n       (22) The 2002 National Security Strategy of the United \n     States stated, ``The scale of the public health crisis in \n     poor countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by \n     epidemics and pandemics like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and \n     tuberculosis, growth and development will be threatened until \n     these scourges can be contained. Resources from the developed \n     world are necessary but will be effective only with honest \n     governance, which supports prevention programs and provides \n     effective local infrastructure.''.\n       (23) Public health deficiencies in sub-Saharan Africa and \n     other parts of the developing world reduce global capacities \n     to detect and respond to potential crises, such as an avian \n     flu pandemic.\n       (24) On September 28, 2005, Secretary of State Condoleezza \n     Rice declared that ``HIV/AIDS is not only a human tragedy of \n     enormous magnitude; it is also a threat to the stability of \n     entire countries and to the entire regions of the world.''.\n       (25) Foreign assistance by the United States that expands \n     local capacities, provides commodities or training, or builds \n     on and enhances community-based and national programs and \n     leadership can increase the impact, efficiency, and \n     sustainability of funded efforts by the United States.\n       (26) African health care professionals immigrate to the \n     United States for the same\n\n[[Page S8615]]\n\n     set of reasons that have led millions of people to come to \n     this country, including the desire for freedom, for economic \n     opportunity, and for a better life for themselves and their \n     children, and the rights and motivations of these individuals \n     must be respected.\n       (27) Helping countries in sub-Saharan Africa increase \n     salaries and benefits of health care professionals, improve \n     working conditions, including the adoption of universal \n     precautions against workplace infection, improve management \n     of health care systems and institutions, increase the \n     capacity of health training institutions, and expand \n     education opportunities will alleviate some of the pressures \n     driving the migration of health care personnel from sub-\n     Saharan Africa.\n       (28) While the scope of the problem of dire shortfalls of \n     personnel and inadequacies of infrastructure in the sub-\n     Saharan African health systems is immense, effective and \n     targeted interventions to improve working conditions, \n     management, and productivity would yield significant \n     dividends in improved health care.\n       (29) Failure to address the shortage of health care \n     professionals and paraprofessionals, and the factors pushing \n     individuals to leave sub-Saharan Africa will undermine the \n     objectives of United States development policy and will \n     subvert opportunities to achieve internationally recognized \n     goals for the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS and other \n     diseases, in the reduction of child and maternal mortality, \n     and for economic growth and development in sub-Saharan \n     Africa.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should help sub-Saharan African \n     countries that have not already done so to develop national \n     human resource plans within the context of comprehensive \n     country health plans involving a wide range of stakeholders;\n       (2) comprehensive, rather than piecemeal approaches to \n     advance multiple sustainable interventions will better enable \n     countries to plan for the number of health care workers they \n     need, determine whether they need to reorganize their health \n     workforce, integrate workforce planning into an overall \n     strategy to improve health system performance and impact, \n     better budget for health care spending, and improve the \n     delivery of health services in rural and other underserved \n     areas;\n       (3) in order to promote systemic, sustainable change, the \n     United States should seek, where possible, to strengthen \n     existing national systems in sub-Saharan African countries to \n     improve national capacities in areas including fiscal \n     management, training, recruiting and retention of health \n     workers, distribution of resources, attention to rural areas, \n     and education;\n       (4) because foreign-funded efforts to fight HIV/AIDS and \n     other diseases may also draw health personnel away from the \n     public sector in sub-Saharan African countries, the policies \n     and programs of the United States should, where practicable, \n     seek to work with national and community-based health \n     structures and seek to promote the general welfare and \n     enhance infrastructures beyond the scope of a single disease \n     or condition;\n       (5) paraprofessionals and community-level health workers \n     can play a key role in prevention, care, and treatment \n     services, and in the more equitable and effective \n     distribution of health resources, and should be integrated \n     into national health systems;\n       (6) given the current personnel shortages in sub-Saharan \n     Africa, paraprofessionals represent a critical potential \n     workforce in efforts to reduce the burdens of malaria, \n     tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and other deadly and debilitating \n     diseases;\n       (7) it is critically important that the governments of sub-\n     Saharan African countries increase their own investments in \n     education and health care;\n       (8) international financial institutions have an important \n     role to play in the achievement of internationally agreed \n     upon health goals, and in helping countries strike the \n     appropriate balance in encouraging effective public \n     investments in the health and education sectors, particularly \n     as foreign assistance in these areas scales up, and promoting \n     macroeconomic stability;\n       (9) public-private partnerships are needed to promote \n     creative contracts, investments in sub-Saharan African \n     educational systems, codes of conduct related to recruiting, \n     and other mechanisms to alleviate the adverse impacts on sub-\n     Saharan African countries caused by the migration of health \n     professionals;\n       (10) colleges and universities of the United States, as \n     well as other members of the private sector, can play a \n     significant role in promoting training in medicine and public \n     health in sub-Saharan Africa by establishing or supporting \n     in-country programs in sub-Saharan Africa through twinning \n     programs with educational institutions in sub-Saharan Africa \n     or through other in-country mechanisms;\n       (11) given the substantial numbers of African immigrants to \n     the United States working in the health sector, the United \n     States should enact and implement measures to permit \n     qualified aliens and their family members that are legally \n     present in the United States to work temporarily as health \n     care professionals in developing countries or in other \n     emergency situations, as in S. 2611, of the 109th Congress, \n     as passed by the Senate on May 25, 2006;\n       (12) the President, acting through the United States \n     Permanent Representative to the United Nations, should \n     exercise the voice and vote of the United States--\n       (A) to ameliorate the adverse impact on less developed \n     countries of the migration of health personnel;\n       (B) to promote voluntary codes of conduct for recruiters of \n     health personnel; and\n       (C) to promote respect for voluntary agreements in which \n     individuals, in exchange for individual educational \n     assistance, have agreed either to work in the health field in \n     their home countries for a given period of time or to repay \n     such assistance;\n       (13) the United States, like countries in other parts of \n     the world, is experiencing a shortage of medical personnel in \n     many occupational specialties, and the shortage is \n     particularly acute in rural and other underserved areas of \n     the country; and\n       (14) the United States should expand training opportunities \n     for health personnel, expand incentive programs such as \n     student loan forgiveness for Americans willing to work in \n     underserved areas, and take other steps to increase the \n     number of health personnel in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 5. ASSISTANCE TO INCREASE HUMAN CAPACITY IN THE HEALTH \n                   SECTOR IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.\n\n       Chapter 1 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 135.

A bill to ensure the provision of high-quality health care \ncoverage for uninsured individuals through State health care \ninitiatives that expand coverage and access and improve quality and \nefficiency in the health care system; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a crisis \nfacing our country, a crisis that directly affects the lives of 46 \nmillion people in the United States, and that indirectly affects many \nmore. The crisis is the lack of universal health insurance in America, \nand its effects are rippling through our families, our communities, and \nour economy. It is the No. 1 issue that I hear about in Wisconsin, and \nit is the No. 1 issue for tens of millions of Americans. Nevertheless, \nthe issue has been largely ignored in the Halls of Congress. We sit \nidle, locked in a stalemate, refusing to give this life-threatening \nproblem its due attention. We need a way to break that deadlock, and \ntoday I am introducing a bill that will do just that--the State-Based \nHealth Care Reform Act.\n  I believe that health care is a fundamental right, and every American \nshould have guaranteed health care coverage. My bill seeks to move us \ntoward that goal in a way that I hope will be acceptable to many of my \ncolleagues.\n  Every day, all over our Nation, Americans suffer from medical \nconditions that cause them pain and even change they way they lead \ntheir lives. Every one of us has either experienced this personally or \nthrough a family member suffering from cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, \ngenetic disorders, mental illness or some other condition. The disease \ntakes its toll on both individuals and families, as trips to the \nhospital for treatments such as chemotherapy test the strength of the \nperson and the family affected. This is an incredibly difficult \nsituation for anyone. But for the uninsured and underinsured, the \nsuffering goes beyond physical discomfort. These 46 million Americans \nbear the additional burden of wondering where the next dollar for their \nhealth care bills will come from; worries of going into debt; worries \nof going bankrupt because of health care needs. When illness strikes \nfamilies, the last thing they should have to think about is money, but \nI know that for many in our country, this is a persistent burden that \ncauses stress and hopelessness.\n  It is difficult to do justice to the magnitude of the uninsurance \nproblem, but I want to share a few astounding statistics. Forty-seven \npercent of the uninsured avoided seeking care in 2003 due to the cost. \nThirty-five percent needed care but did not get it. Thirty-seven \npercent did not fill a prescription because of cost. The uninsured are \nseven times more likely to seek care in an emergency room. They are \nless likely to receive preventative care because they cannot afford to \nsee the doctor, and they are more likely to die as a result. Each year, \nat least 18,000 people die prematurely in this country because of \nuninsurance. If the uninsured\n\n[[Page S8617]]\n\nhad access to continuous health coverage, a reduction in mortality of 5 \npercent to 15 percent could be achieved.\n  Even for those Americans who currently have health insurance through \ntheir employer, the risk of becoming uninsured is very real. Large \nbusinesses are finding themselves less competitive in the global market \nbecause of skyrocketing health care costs. Small businesses are finding \nit difficult to offer insurance to employees while staying competitive \nin their own communities. Our health care system has failed to keep \ncosts in check, and there is simply no way we can expect businesses to \nkeep up. More and more, employers offer sub-par benefits, or no \nbenefits at all. Employers cannot be the sole provider of health care \nwhen these costs are rising faster than inflation.\n  I travel to each of Wisconsin's 72 counties every year to hold \ntownhall meetings. Almost every year, the No. 1 issue raised at these \nlistening sessions is the same--health care. The failure of our health \ncare system brings people to these meetings in droves. These people \nused to think government involvement was a terrible idea, but not \nanymore. Now they come armed with their frustration, their anger, and \ntheir desperation, and they tell me that their businesses and their \nlives are being destroyed by health care costs, and they want the \ngovernment to step in.\n  Our country can do better, and it will.\n  Last year, I was pleased to be joined by the Senator from South \nCarolina, Mr. Graham, in introducing legislation that requires Congress \nto act on health care reform. It requires Congress to take up and \ndebate universal health care bills within the first 90 days of the \nsession following enactment of the bill. This bill does not prejudge \nwhat particular health care reform measure should be debated--it simply \nrequires Congress to act.\n  Today, I am here to build on the proposal from last year. I am \nintroducing the State-Based Health Care Reform Act. In short, this bill \nestablishes a pilot project to provide States with the resources needed \nto implement universal health care reform. The bill does not dictate \nwhat kind of reform the States should implement; it just provides an \nincentive for action, provided the States meet certain minimum coverage \nand low-income requirements.\n  Over the years I have heard many different proposals for how we \nshould change the health care system in this country. Some propose \nusing tax incentives as a way to expand access to health care. Others \nthink the best approach is to expand public programs. Some feel a \nnational single payer health care system is the only way to go. I have \nmy own preferences, but I don't think we can ignore any of these \nproposals. We need to consider all of these as we address our broken \nhealth care system.\n  As a former State legislator, I come to this debate appreciating the \nrole that States are playing in coming up with some very innovative \nsolutions to the health care problem. We are already seeing States move \nahead of the Federal Government on covering the uninsured. \nMassachusetts recently passed into law a plan to require health \ninsurance for all residents, and State legislators in my home State of \nWisconsin, as well as Vermont, Maine, and California, are working to \nexpand health insurance coverage in their States. The Federal \nGovernment should be encouraging these innovative initiatives, and my \nbill provides the mechanism for this goal to be realized.\n  This legislation harnesses the talent and ingenuity of Americans to \ncome up with new solutions. This approach takes advantage of America's \ngreatest resources--the mind power and creativity of the American \npeople--to move our country toward the goal of a working health care \nsystem with universal coverage. With help from the Federal Government, \nStates will be able to try new ways of covering all their residents, \nand our political logjam around health care will begin to loosen.\n  Under my proposal, States can be creative in the State resources they \nuse to expand health care coverage. For example, a State can use \npersonal or employer mandates for coverage, use State tax incentives, \ncreate a single-payer system or even join with neighboring States to \noffer a regional health care plan. The proposals are subject only to \nthe approval of the newly created Health Care Reform Task Force, which \nwill be composed of health care experts, consumers, and representatives \nfrom groups affected by health care reform. This task force will be \nresponsible for choosing viable State projects and ensuring that the \nprojects are effective. The Task Force will also help the States \ndevelop projects, and will continue a dialog with the States in order \nto facilitate a good relationship between the State and Federal \nGovernments.\n  The task force is also charged with making sure that the State plans \nmeet certain minimal requirements. First, the State plans must include \nspecific target dates for decreasing the number of uninsured, and must \nalso identify a set of minimum benefits for every covered individual. \nThese benefits must be comparable to health insurance offered to \nFederal employees. Second, the State plans must include a mechanism to \nguarantee that the insurance is affordable. Americans should not go \nbroke trying to keep healthy, and health care reform should ensure that \nindividual costs are manageable. The State-Based Health Care Reform Act \nbases affordability on income.\n  Another provision in this legislation requires that the States \ncontribute to paying for their new health care programs. The Federal \nGovernment will provide matching funds based on enhanced FMAP--the same \nstandard used for SCHIP--and will then provide an additional 5 percent. \nStates that can afford to provide more are encouraged to, but in order \nto ensure the financial viability of the bill and to ensure State buy-\nin, this matching requirement provides a starting point. Other than \nthese requirements, the States largely have flexibility to design a \nplan that works best for their respective residents. The possibilities \nfor reform are wide open.\n  One of the main criticisms of Federal Government spending on health \ncare is that it is expensive and increases the deficit. My legislation \nis fully offset, ensuring that it will not increase the deficit. The \nbill doesn't avoid making the tough budget choices that need to be made \nif we are going to pay for health care reform.\n  One of the offsets in the bill was proposed by the Congressional \nBudget Office: an increase in the flat rebate paid by drug \nmanufacturers for Medicaid prescription drugs. Currently, Medicaid \nrecoups a portion of its drug spending through a rebate paid by the \nmanufacturer. The savings mechanism would set a flat rebate, and \nprovide funding for the States' health care reform projects.\n  Additional funding for the bill comes from the President's fiscal \nyear 2007 budget proposal to extend the authority of the Federal \nCommunications Commission to auction the radio spectrum and the \nauthority of Customs and Border Protection to collect multiple \ndifferent conveyance and passenger user fees through fiscal year 2016. \nMy bill proposes similar extensions of these established authorities. \nAlso, my bill proposes to both simplify and reduce the federal subsidy \nof airline passenger screening costs by replacing the current variable \nfee, which is capped at five dollars per one-way trip, with a flat five \ndollar fee. This proposal is similar to one in the President's fiscal \nyear 2007 budget and would decrease federal subsidies to about thirty \npercent of passenger security costs, without reducing aviation security \nspending.\n  I also pay for this bill with an offset modeled on legislation \nintroduced in the House by my good friend and fellow Wisconsinite Tom \nPetri and in the Senate by the senior Senator from Massachusetts that \nseeks to save money by encouraging higher education institutions to \nshift from private lenders to the direct loan program, which is most \ncost-effective for taxpayers. Currently, the Federal Government \nsubsidizes private lenders for the loans they issue to students and \nthis offset would end the current taxpayer-funded subsidies while \nincreasing financial aid to students.\n  We can say that it is time to move toward universal coverage, but it \nis empty rhetoric without a feasible plan. I believe that this is the \nway to make universal coverage work in this country. Universal coverage \ndoesn't mean that we have to copy a system already in place in another \ncountry. We can harness our Nation's creativity and entrepreneurial \nspirit to design a system\n\n[[Page S8618]]\n\nthat is uniquely American. Universal coverage doesn't have to be \ndefined by what's been attempted in the past. What universal coverage \ndoes mean is providing a solution for a broken system where millions \nare uninsured, and where businesses and Americans are struggling under \nthe burden of health care costs.\n  It has been over 10 years since the last serious debate over health \ncare reform was killed by special interests and the soft money \ncontributions they used to corrupt the legislative process. The \nlegislative landscape is now much different. Soft money can no longer \nbe used to set the agenda, and businesses and workers are crying out as \nnever before for Congress to do something about the country's health \ncare crisis.\n  We are fortunate to live in a country that has been abundantly \nblessed with democracy and wealth, and yet, there are those in our \nsociety whose daily health struggles overshadow these blessings. That \nis an injustice, and it is one we can and must address. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. said, ``Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health \ncare is the most shocking and inhumane.'' It is long past time for \nCongress to heed these words and end this terrible inequality. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the State-Based Health Care Reform Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3776\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``State-Based Health Care \n     Reform Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Health care remains one of the most important domestic \n     issues for Americans.\n       (2) According to the Census Bureau, 45,800,000 Americans \n     were uninsured in 2004. Over 8,000,000 of these individuals \n     were children. The number of uninsured has increased by \n     6,000,000 since 2000.\n       (3) According to the Commonwealth Fund, many of the \n     uninsured are employed, and an increasing number are from \n     middle-income families:\n       (A) Two in five working-age Americans with annual incomes \n     between $20,000 and $40,000 were uninsured for at least part \n     of 2005. In 2001, just over one-quarter of those with \n     moderate incomes were uninsured.\n       (B) Of the estimated 48,000,000 American adults who spent \n     any time uninsured in 2005, two-thirds were in families where \n     at least one person was working full time.\n       (4) The uninsured face serious financial problems, and \n     often have to choose between medical care and other basic \n     necessities. According to the Commonwealth Fund, more than \n     half of uninsured adults reported medical debt or problems \n     paying bills. Of those, nearly half used up all their savings \n     to pay their bills. Two of five were unable to pay for basic \n     necessities like food, heat, or rent because of medical \n     bills.\n       (5) Health outcomes for the uninsured are worse than health \n     outcomes for those who are covered. According to the \n     Institute of Medicine, the number of excess deaths among \n     uninsured adults ages 25 to 64 is estimated at around 18,000 \n     a year. Fifty-nine percent of uninsured adults who had a \n     chronic illness, such as diabetes or asthma, did not fill a \n     prescription or skipped their medications because they could \n     not afford them.\n       (6) The cost of providing care to the uninsured weighs \n     heavily on the United States economy. The United States \n     spends twice as much as any other industrialized nation on \n     health care, and more than the United Kingdom's entire gross \n     domestic product. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, \n     $124,600,000,000 was spent on care provided to individuals \n     who were uninsured for all or part of 2004. Despite this \n     spending, the United States ranks second to last among \n     industrialized countries in infant mortality rates.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to establish a program to \n     award grants to States for the establishment of State-based \n     projects to--\n       (1) increase health care coverage for uninsured individuals \n     in selected States within the 5-year period beginning on the \n     date of enactment of this Act;\n       (2) ensure high-quality health care coverage that provides \n     adequate access to providers, services, and benefits;\n       (3) improve the efficiency of health care spending and \n     lower the cost of health care for the participating State; \n     and\n       (4) encourage universal health care coverage within States.\n\n                     TITLE I--HEALTH CARE COVERAGE\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure \na fairer and simpler method of taxing controlled foreign corporations \nof United States shareholders, to treat certain foreign corporations \nmanaged and controlled in the United States as domestic corporations, \nto codify the economic substance doctrine, and to eliminate the top \ncorporate income tax rate, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Export Products \nNot Jobs Act of 2006. Tomorrow, the Senate Finance Committee will hold \na hearing to tackle the issue of tax reform and will hear from the \nchairman and vice chairman of the President's Advisory Panel on Federal \nTax Reform. The panel's report took a broad look at our current tax law \nand made numerous recommendations. I agree with some of the \nrecommendations and have concerns about others, but believe that the \nreport provides a good starting place for a thorough discussion of tax \nreform.\n  In 1994, the IRS estimated that a family that itemized their \ndeductions and had some interest and capital gains would spend 11\\1/2\\ \nhours preparing their Federal income tax return. This estimate has \nincreased to 19 hours and 45 minutes in 2004. It is time for Congress \nto pass bipartisan tax legislation in the style of Tax Reform Act of \n1986, which greatly simplified Tax Code. And our tax reform should be \nbased upon the following three principles: fairness, simplicity, and \nopportunity for economic growth.\n  Our Tax Code is extremely complicated. Citizens and businesses \nstruggle to comply with ru1es governing: taxation of business income, \ncapital gains, income phase-outs, extenders, the myriad savings \nvehicles, recordkeeping for itemized deductions, the alternative \nminimum tax, AMT, the earned-income tax credit, EITC, and taxation of \nforeign business income. I believe that our international tax system \nneeds to be simplified and reformed to encourage businesses to remain \nin the United States. And today, I am introducing legislation that I \nhope will be fully considered as we begin our discussions on tax \nreform.\n  Presently, the complexities of our international tax system actually \nencourage U.S. corporations to invest overseas. Current tax laws allow \ncompanies to defer paying U.S. taxes on income earned by their foreign \nsubsidiaries, which provides a substantial tax break for companies that \nmove investment and jobs overseas. Today, under U.S. tax law, a company \nthat is trying to decide where to locate production or services--either \nin the United States or in a foreign low-tax haven--is actually given a \nsubstantial tax incentive not only to move jobs overseas but to \nreinvest profits permanently, as opposed to bringing the profits back \nto re-invest in the United States.\n  Recent press articles have revealed examples of companies taking \nadvantage of this perverse incentive in our Tax Code. For instance, \nsome companies have taken advantage of this initiative by opening \nsubsidiaries to serve markets throughout Europe. Much of the profit \nearned by these subsidiaries will stay in Ireland and the companies \nwill therefore avoid paying U.S. taxes. Other companies have announced \nthe expansion of jobs in India. This reflects a continued pattern among \nsome U.S. multinational companies of shifting software development and \ncall centers to India, and this trend is starting to expand to include \nthe shifting of critical functions like design and research\n\n[[Page S8622]]\n\nand development to India as well. Some companies are even outsourcing \nthe preparation of U.S. tax returns.\n  The Export Products Not Jobs Act of 2006 would put an to end to these \npractices by eliminating tax breaks that encourage companies to move \njobs overseas and by using the savings to create jobs in the United \nStates by repealing the top corporate tax rate. This legislation ends \ntax breaks that encourage companies to move jobs by: (1) eliminating \nthe ability of companies to defer paying U.S. taxes on foreign income; \n(2) closing abusive corporate tax loopholes; and (3) repealing the top \ncorporate rate. It removes the incentive to shift jobs overseas by \neliminating deferral so that companies pay taxes on their international \nincome as they earn it, rather than being allowed to defer taxes.\n  Last month, the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Revenue held a hearing \non international tax laws. Stephen Shay, a former Reagan Treasury \nofficial, testified that our tax rules ``provide incentives to locate \nbusiness activity outside the United States.'' Furthermore, he \nsuggested that taxation of U.S. shareholders under an expansion of \nSubpart F would be a ``substantial improvement'' over our current \nsystem. The Export Products Not Jobs Act of 2006 does just that.\n  Our current tax system punishes U.S. companies that choose to create \nand maintain jobs in the United States. These companies pay higher \ntaxes and suffer a competitive disadvantage with a company that chooses \nto move jobs to a foreign tax haven. There is no reason why our Tax \nCode should provide an incentive that encourages investment and job \ncreation overseas. Under my legislation, companies would be taxed the \nsame whether they invest abroad or at home; they will be taxed on their \nforeign subsidiary profits just like they are taxed on their domestic \nprofits.\n  This legislation reflects the most sweeping simplification of \ninternational taxes in over 40 years. Our economy has changed in the \nlast 40 years and our tax laws need to be updated to keep pace. Our \ncurrent global economy was not even envisioned when existing law was \nwritten.\n  The Export Products Not Jobs Act of 2006 that I am introducing today \nwill not hinder our global competitiveness. Companies will be able to \ncontinue to defer income they earn when they locate production in a \nforeign country that serves that foreign country's markets. For \nexample, if a U.S. company wants to open a hotel in Bermuda or a car \nfactory in India to sell cars, foreign income can still be deferred. \nBut if a company wants to open a call center in India to answer calls \nfrom outside India or relocate abroad to sell cars back to the United \nStates or Canada, the company must pay taxes just like call centers and \nauto manufacturers located in the United States.\n  Currently, American companies allocate their revenue not in search of \nthe highest return, but in search of lower taxes. Eliminating deferral \nwill improve the efficiency of the economy by making taxes neutral so \nthat they do not encourage companies to overinvest abroad solely for \ntax reasons.\n  The Congressional Research Service stated in a 2003 report that, \n``[a]ccording to traditional economic theory, deferral thus reduces \neconomic welfare by encouraging firms to undertake overseas investments \nthat are less productive--before taxes are considered--than alternative \ninvestments in the United States.'' Additionally, a 2000 Department of \nTreasury study on deferral stated, ``[a]mong all of the options \nconsidered, ending deferral would also be likely to have the most \npositive long-term effect on economic efficiency and welfare because it \nwould do the most to eliminate tax considerations from decisions \nregarding the location of investment.''\n  The revenue raised from the repeal of deferral and closing corporate \nloopholes would be used to repeal the top corporate tax rate of 35 \npercent. The tax differential between U. S. corporate rates and foreign \ncorporate rates has grown over the last two decades and the repeal of \nthe top corporate rate is a start in narrowing this gap.\n  The Export Products Not Jobs Act of 2006 would promote equity among \nU.S. taxpayers by ensuring that corporations could not eliminate or \nsubstantially reduce taxation of foreign income by separately \nincorporating their foreign operations. This legislation will eliminate \nthe tax incentives to encourage U.S. companies to invest abroad and \nreward those companies that have chosen to invest in the United States. \nI urge my colleagues to join me in this effort, and ask for unanimous \nconsent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3777\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

An original bill to reauthorize and improve the Small \nBusiness Act and the Small Business Act of 1958, and for other \npurposes; from the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship; \nplaced on the calendar.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as chair of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I rise today to introduce a bill, The \nSmall Business Reauthorization and Improvements Act of 2006, that was \nreported by the committee on a vote of 18 to 0.\n  I strongly believe we must do everything possible to sustain \nprosperity and job creation throughout Maine and the United States. To \nachieve that goal, I have long fought to expand the reach of Small \nBusiness Administration programs that have helped millions of aspiring \nentrepreneurs and existing small businesses.\n  Today is a pivotal time for the SBA. A new Administrator, Steven C. \nPreston, has been sworn in, and I have held hearings on the \nreauthorization of the agency's programs that are set to expire \nSeptember 30, 2006. The reauthorization and funding of SBA programs is \nvital to the continued growth of the economy and the small business \ncommunity. My goal is for the process to conclude with a renewed SBA \nthat is completely dedicated to fostering small business ownership and \njob creation in America.\n  The SBA's fundamental purpose is to ``aid, counsel, assist, and \nprotect the interests of small-business concerns.'' The methods for \ncarrying out this congressional mandate include a wide array of \nfinancial, procurement, management, and technical assistance programs \ntailored to encourage small business growth and expansion. As the \neconomy continues to grow, it is essential that Congress affirms long-\nterm stability in the programs the SBA provides to the small business \ncommunity. The American economy needs a strong and vibrant SBA because \nsmall businesses represent 99 percent of all employers, create nearly \n75 percent of all net new jobs, and employ 51 percent of the private-\nsector workforce.\n  There is no doubt that SBA's technical assistance programs have \ndemonstrated impressive growth. During fiscal year 2005, the SBA \nprovided 56,739 small businesses with technical assistance. That was an \nastounding 46.4 percent increase from the 38,754 small businesses \nassisted in fiscal year 2004.\n  If there is truth in numbers, the SBA has numerous ``truths'' it can \nand should tout. Its record of achievement for fiscal year 2005 alone \nincludes:\n  Counseling 1.5 million entrepreneurs through the agency's Small \nBusiness Development Centers, Business Information Centers, SCORE and \nWomen's Business Centers;\n  approving over 89,000 business loans through the 7(a) and 504 lending \nprograms;\n  funding 74,307 7(a) program loans to small businesses for a total of \nmore than $l4 billion; and\n  a doubling of small business lending since 2001, with nearly a third \nof SBA-backed loans being made to minority-owned small businesses.\n  Despite a drastically declining share of the Federal budget, the data \nclearly indicate that the SBA's programs have created or retained a \nsignificant number of jobs over the last several years. Between fiscal \nyear 1999 and fiscal year 2004, the SBA's Offices of Advocacy and \nLegislative Affairs report that the SBA's lending and technical \nassistance programs enabled participating small businesses to create or \nretain 4.4 million new jobs. In addition, the SBA's programs have \nhelped to create or retain more jobs during each passing year. In \nfiscal year 2004, the SBA's programs created or retained 51.2 percent \nmore jobs than they did in fiscal 1999.\n  Our goal is to build on these tremendous successes. The building \nblocks for a successful reauthorization are a bipartisan bill: The \nSmall Business Reauthorization and Improvements Act. It is cosponsored \nby Ranking Member Kerry, Senator Vitter, Senator Landrieu, Senator \nCantwell, Senator Lieberman and Senator Isakson. This legislation will:\n  Reform the SBA's largest small business financing program, the \nsection 7(a) loan program, which provided almost $15 billion in loans \nto small businesses last year, by increasing the maximum size of a loan \nfrom $2 million to $3 million.\n  Require the SBA to implement a more efficient test for loan \neligibility that measures businesses' revenues, rather than merely \ntheir number of employees.\n  Establish a national preferred lender program to increase small \nbusinesses' access to capital by reducing duplicative administrative \nburdens on small business loans.\n  Restructure the Small Business Investment Company Program, an \ninnovative public-private venture capital partnership that has provided \nmore than $25 billion in financing to small businesses.\n  Expand the SBA's capability to assist disaster victims by allowing \nprivate lenders to make loans at lower interest rates.\n  Increase Federal authority to prosecute, suspend, and debar large \ncorporations which obtain government contracts by misrepresenting \nthemselves as small businesses.\n  Create a stronger system of SBA size standards to ensure that Federal \nagencies respect SBA decisions on whether a company that receives a \ngovernment contract is truly a small business.\n  Address the small business health insurance crisis by creating a \ncompetitive pilot grant program for Small Business Development Centers, \nSBDCs, to provide counseling and resources to small businesses about \nhealth insurance options in their geographic areas.\n  The legislation also rejects new loan fees. I strongly oppose SBA's \nproposal to increase fees for these programs. The fees would be charged \nagainst every loan that is greater than $1 million. In the 7(a) \nprogram, this is 3 percent of loans; in the 504 program, it is 15 \npercent of loans; and in the SBIC program it's 100 percent of the \nloans. A fee increase is not the way to balance the budget and it \nremains wholly unacceptable, to put it mildly.\n  Increasing fees charged to small businesses end up hurting--not \nhelping our Nation's small businesses. When we consider that the SBA's \nbudget represents less than 3/100ths of a percent of the total Federal \nbudget, is this really the place for the administration to find \nadditional savings? Congress must always strive to ensure that all \nsmall businesses are able to access SBA's financing programs without \nadditional penalties.\n\n  In 2005, SBA programs disbursed recordbreaking totals of loans to \nsmall businesses, both in the number of loans and total dollar value \nprovided to small businesses. During the last fiscal year, the SBA \nguaranteed over $24 billion in loans and venture capital for small \nbusinesses, the highest level of capital ever provided. This included \nover $1 million in 90 loans to Mainers through the Microloan program, \nwhich is an inexpensive program the Bush administration has targeted \nfor elimination.\n  The SBA's programs demonstrate how Congress can play a positive role \nin enhancing private-sector financing\n\n[[Page S8627]]\n\nfor start-up companies. Since 1953, nearly 20 million small business \nowners have received direct or indirect help from one of the SBA's \nlending or technical assistance programs, making the agency one of the \ngovernment's most cost-effective instruments for economic development.\n  SBA loan and investment programs have produced success story after \nsuccess story, which include assisting the founders of Intel, Staples, \nand Federal Express, as well as thousands of other successful \nbusinesses. This bill will build upon these past successes and make the \nSBA even more effective.\n  The American economy needs a strong and vibrant Small Business \nAdministration. This committee is here to help improve the SBA in any \nway possible to ensure the success of tomorrow's entrepreneurs. Of \ncourse, the agency has been subjected to criticism, including my own. \nWe can move beyond criticism and find solutions to the problems that \nhave plagued the SBA and transform it into an agency that is led with \nthe same dedication to excellence found in the entrepreneurs it serves. \nThe Small Business Reauthorization And Improvements Act will help us \nachieve that goal.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today as ranking Democrat on the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, in support of a \nbipartisan bill being reported out of our committee, the Small Business \nReauthorization and Improvements Act of 2006. This bill, which \noriginated in our committee and which is the product of many Senators' \nwork, was voted out unanimously, 18 to 0. While there are no official \ncosponsors of the legislation because it is an original bill being \nreported out of committee, I would have been pleased to be added as an \noriginal cosponsor, and Senators Landrieu, Cantwell, Lieberman and \nVitter also asked to be added as cosponsors. I would like to thank my \ncolleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, for making this a bipartisan \nprocess. This is the fourth Small Business reauthorization bill I have \nworked on, having been a member of the committee for 21 years. Our \ncommittee has the reputation for working across party lines to put what \nis important for small businesses first, and I appreciate that the \nChair and her staff have worked with us on reauthorization with that \ngoal in mind. The result is a comprehensive approach to reauthorizing \nthe SBA for the next 3 years that includes not Republican or Democratic \npriorities but instead the priorities of America's small businesses.\n  This reauthorization could not have came at a more opportune time to \ntackle some of the issues that are eating away at our small business \nprograms and at the core mission of the SBA--which is to foster small \nbusiness growth and bridge the gaps left by the private sector.\n  One of the most important things we are here to do today is to \naddress the shortcomings and failures of the SBA's disaster loan \nprogram. Nearly a year has passed since Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and \nWilma battered the gulf coast, and in that year I have visited New \nOrleans on three occasions. I can tell you that many of the streets are \nstill covered in debris, and that many of the region's small businesses \nare barely keeping their doors open. The SBA needs to be prepared to \nhandle an emergency of this magnitude. Thanks in large part to the hard \nwork of Senator Landrieu and her dedicated staff, this bill provides \nthe tools to respond swiftly and effectively following future large \nscale disasters.\n  Through federally guaranteed bridge loans, States can offer small \nbusinesses short-term access to capital so that they can remain open \nwhile they wait for other sources of assistance to come through. We \nprovide the President with the authority to declare a new category of \ndisaster--a catastrophic national disaster--which triggers nationwide \neconomic injury disaster loans for businesses located outside the \nimmediate geographic disaster area. And we improve the way SBA and FEMA \ncoordinate disaster assistance. A greater importance needs to be placed \non serving the victims, by making the process of applying for and \nreceiving Federal assistance as painless and user friendly as possible. \nThat is why we give the SBA the authority to work with private lenders \nto get disaster loans out quickly--an idea that members of our \ncommittee tried to get SBA to embrace last year. This will only work if \nwe can ensure that these loans do not come at a high cost to disaster \nvictims. We are hopeful that our approach will keep interest rates \ndown.\n  This bill also addresses the effects that the energy crisis is having \non America's small businesses. Gas prices are once again approaching \nrecord highs, and for the small businesses that depend on fuel to put \nfood on the table, rising prices mean more than having to decide \nwhether or not to drive to work. Included in the bill is the bipartisan \nSmall Business Energy Emergency Relief Act, a bill which has passed the \nSenate before, which provides low-interest loans to small businesses \ndependent on fuel. The loans are triggered when oil prices increase \nsignificantly over the average price from the previous two years. This \nproposal is complemented by Chair Snowe's 7(a) express loans for small \nbusinesses that are willing to invest in renewable energy solutions.\n  In looking at our core programs, this bill makes a strong statement \nabout the need for the SBA to fill the lending gap in our minority \ncommunities. It is unacceptable that since 2001, while numbers of 7(a) \nloans have gone up for African Americans, the actual dollars loaned \nhave remained stagnant. In the Microloan program, African Americans \nreceived 28 percent of the total number of microloans made in 2001 as \ncompared to only 21 percent of the total number of loans made in 2005. \nNative Americans went from 2 percent of the total number of microloans \nmade in 2001 to less than 1 percent--a mere .93 percent--in 2005. If \nthis trend continues--Native Americans alone will be completely cut out \nof the Microloan program. The stagnant lending in these communities \nrepresents a failure of this administration to expand access to capital \nto our underserved communities, communities where conventional lending \nis not meeting the need.\n  The bill provides an incredible framework for the SBA to reverse this \ntrend. It creates an Office of Minority Small Business Development at \nthe SBA, similar to offices devoted to business development of veterans \nand women and rural areas, and, it creates a grant program to develop a \ncross campus curriculum at Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities, Tribal Colleges, and Hispanic-Serving Institutions to \nencourage minority students in a wide range of fields to consider \nentrepreneurship. There is much to be done to bridge the wealth gap in \nminority communities and this is one approach worth pursuing. Finally, \nthe bill incorporates legislation from my colleague, Senator Johnson, \nto provide financial assistance to tribal governments, tribal colleges, \nNative Hawaiian organizations, and Alaska Native corporations to create \nNative American business centers.\n  One of the keys to ensuring access to capital is making sure that \nSBA-backed financing remains affordable to the small business \ncommunity. As we all know, the administration insisted on eliminating \nall funding for 7(a) loans and shifting the cost to borrowers and \nlenders by imposing higher fees. The President's budget reveals that \nborrowers and lenders already pay too much in fees, generating more \nthan $800 million in overpayments since 1992 because the government \nroutinely overestimates the amount of fees needed to cover the cost of \nthe program. This bill seeks to address overpayments by requiring the \nSBA to lower fees if borrowers and lenders pay more than is necessary \nto cover the program costs or if the Congress appropriates money for \nthe program.\n  The bill also reauthorizes the PRIME program through 2009 and \nincludes a provision that Senator Bingaman and I worked closely to \ndevelop that will expand PRIME with a separate $2 million authorization \nto provide technical assistance and counseling to disadvantaged Native \nAmerican small business owners. The bill also includes technical yet \nimportant changes in the Microloan program such as making loans to \npersons with disabilities as one of the statutorily enumerated \n``purposes'' of the Microloan program and changing the average smaller \nloan size in the Microloan program from $7,500 to $10,000.\n\n  In reauthorizing one of our other core programs, SBA's 504 loan \nprogram, I am pleased that we were able to come\n\n[[Page S8628]]\n\nup with a bipartisan approach to preserving the local economic \ndevelopment focus of the program. The ability of our certified \ndevelopment companies, CDCs, to expand operations into multiple States, \nin conjunction with the growing demand for 504 loans, required that we \nput in place accountability measures. The 504 program was not created \nfor CDCs to expand operations and simply create revenue from one state \nto another. CDCs are more than lenders and should not act like for-\nprofit banks. This bill allows CDC board members to serve on another \nCDC board, but institutes safeguards to prevent control of multiple \nboards.\n  The bill also incorporates legislation I have introduced to create a \nChild Care Lending Pilot Program to expand the availability of \naffordable, quality childcare in this country by using the 504 loan \nprogram to spur the establishment and expansion of childcare providers. \nRight now only for-profit childcare businesses are eligible for 504 \nloans, yet in some States a majority of affordable childcare is \ndelivered through nonprofit providers and in the neediest communities \nnonprofits are often the only provider.\n  I am pleased that our bill reauthorizes the Women's Business Centers \nand makes permanent the Women's Business Center Sustainability Pilot \nProgram through the creation of 3-year ``renewal'' grants for centers \nwith sustainability grants, and 4-year ``initial'' grants for new \ncenters across the country. We should not be abandoning our existing \ncenters--many of which leverage Federal dollars to do excellent work in \nour communities--to run and create new ones. Senator Snowe and I have \nbeen fighting for this for a long time, since I first introduced \nlegislation in 1999: It is time we get this adopted. Our bill also \nreauthorizes Small Business Development Centers and builds on this \nexcellent resource by creating a pilot program to provide regulatory \nassistance to small businesses, in addition to the role SBDCs play in \nthe minority entrepreneurship initiative.\n  One area of our bill which does not deal with reauthorizing SBA \nprograms is just as critical to small businesses--Federal contracting. \nEarlier this month, we heard the new SBA inspector general Eric Thorson \ntestify about the largest impediments to small businesses receiving \ntheir fair share of prime and subcontracting opportunities. He \nexplained how many of the problems in applying and enforcing small \nbusiness contracting statutes are simply due to contracting officer \nerror. Contracting officers do not know or do not care about small \nbusiness requirements, and small businesses suffer the consequences. \nThis bill seeks to do something about the disregard that is shown to \nsmall businesses with respect to federal procurement policy.\n  Procurement center representatives, or PCRs, are responsible for \nadvocating on behalf of small businesses in cases affecting Federal \ncontracting, such as the bundling or consolidation of contracts. \nUnfortunately, there are not enough of them to effectively get the job \ndone. By requiring the SBA to assign no fewer than one PCR per major \nprocurement center, this bill takes steps to limit the incidence of \ncontractor error referred to by Mr. Thorson. We can no longer tolerate \nthe level of neglect that is currently the norm. It is time for the SBA \nto staff up and fulfill its responsibility as a watchdog for small \nbusinesses.\n  In addition to mandating adequate staffing levels, this bill takes \nmany significant steps to enforce subcontracting and bundling laws \nalready on the books. Firms bidding for small business contracts are \nrequired to certify annually as small businesses so we do not have \nlarge businesses taking small business contracts, and large prime \ncontractors are required to certify that subcontracting goals will be \nmet. If subcontractors are not paid on a timely basis, Federal agencies \nare permitted to withhold payments and to pay subcontractors directly. \nWe must stop fraudulent misrepresentation by large firms, and require \nthe administration to start looking out for the interests of small \nfirms that want to do business with the Federal Government.\n  The time has also come to implement the women's procurement program. \nThe administration has postponed implementing a women's procurement \nprogram that became law 6 years ago. This bill tells SBA to get it done \nwithin 90 days. It also makes clear that America's service disabled \nveteran small businesses deserve the same advantages as other subgroups \nwith respect to sole source contracting. Our veterans are returning \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan, and we owe it to them to give them every \nopportunity at fulfilling the dream of entrepreneurship.\n  Another program sorely needing our attention: The 8(a) program was \ncreated to assist socially and economically disadvantaged small \nbusinesses, but the financial threshold for inclusion in the program is \nout dated and too restrictive. This bill allows for an inflationary \nadjustment to be made so that businesses that belong in this program \naren't being shut out.\n  Finally, let me say a few words about SBIR, the Small Business \nInnovation Research Program. The Small Business Committee had a hearing \non SBIR earlier this month, and at that time, I made clear my concern \nthat we were being premature in going ahead with reauthorizing SBIR \nwhen the program's authorization doesn't expire until 2008. There is a \n$5 million National Academy of Sciences study due to come out at the \nend of this year that I am certain will give us much to consider. Yet, \nthis bill does reauthorize SBIR, making it permanent, and it includes \nsome strong provisions to protect SBIR companies' intellectual property \nand to reign in excessively large awards--which are a particular \nproblem at NIH. While SBIR Phase IIs are supposed to be $750,000, NIH \nPhase II are often larger. One Phase II award reportedly equalled $6 \nmillion. While the firms getting these large awards may be doing \nimportant work, we need to keep in mind that if one firm receives $6 \nmillion, there are many firms that are not getting Phase IIs at all. \nThat is why I am glad that we have adopted Senator Bayh's proposal to \nincrease the overall share of SBIR funds from 2.5 percent to 5 percent \nof Federal research budgets, so that more small businesses will have a \nchance to compete in this program. I also support several provisions in \nthe bill to encourage commercialization, one of the biggest challenges \nfacing the program.\n  There is one provision in this bill that was added during our \ncommittee markup which concerns me, a provision which gives Federal \nagencies the option to direct 25 percent of SBIR funds to firms which \nare majority backed by venture capital investment. The firms which will \nbenefit from this provision are primarily biotechnology firms and no \none disagrees that they are doing critical work and should receive \nFederal support. I am committed to finding a way to help biotechnology \nfirms but I am concerned that this set-aside may crowd out small firms \nthat are not blessed with venture capital. SBIR is the only Federal \nresearch and development program devoted to small business and it has \nbeen universally praised for fostering innovative technologies and \nlifesaving therapies and medical devices that may never attract the \nsupport of venture capital firms. SBIR serves as seed funding for the \ncompanies that are willing to take on these research and development \nprojects. It is important to retain the integrity of this program, and \nI look forward to working with my colleagues to find a way to strike a \nbalance so that we can continue to support cutting edge research that \nis at so early a stage it has yet to attract the private sector.\n  Mr. President, before I close, I want to note that while this bill is \ntruly bipartisan, so was our last reauthorization bill back in 2003, S. \n1375. However, the reauthorization bill that was finally adopted back \nin 2004, was a notably partisan product, attached to an omnibus \nappropriations bill, with almost all Democratic provisions dropped. I \nurge the Senate to maintain today's spirit of bipartisanship as we move \nforward, so that the final reauthorization bill truly reflects all of \nour efforts.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/02/senate-section/article/S8629-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8629]]\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 546--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF A NATIONAL \nPOLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE AWARENESS WEEK TO RAISE PUBLIC AWARENESS AND \nUNDERSTANDING OF POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE AND TO FOSTER UNDERSTANDING \n  OF THE IMPACT POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE HAS ON PATIENTS AND FUTURE \n                     GENERATIONS OF THEIR FAMILIES\n\n  Mr. DeWINE submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 546\n\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease (known as ``PKD'') is the \n     most prevalent life-threatening genetic disease in the United \n     States, is a severe, dominantly inherited disease that has a \n     devastating impact, in both human and economic terms, on \n     people of all ages, and affects equally people of all races, \n     sexes, nationalities, geographic locations, and income \n     levels;\n       Whereas, based on prevalence estimates by the National \n     Institutes of Health, it is estimated that about 600,000 \n     patients in the United States have a genetic inheritance from \n     1 or both parents called polycystic kidney disease, and that \n     countless additional friends, loved ones, spouses, and \n     caregivers must shoulder the physical, emotional, and \n     financial burdens that polycystic kidney disease causes;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease, for which there is no \n     cure, is 1 of the 4 leading causes of kidney failure in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the vast majority of polycystic kidney disease \n     patients reach kidney failure at an average age of 53, \n     causing a severe strain on dialysis and kidney \n     transplantation resources and on the delivery of health care \n     in the United States, as the largest segment of the \n     population of the United States, the ``baby boomers'', \n     continues to age;\n       Whereas end stage renal disease is one of the fastest \n     growing components of the Medicare budget, and polycystic \n     kidney disease contributes to that cost by an estimated \n     $2,000,000,000 annually for dialysis, kidney transplantation, \n     and related therapies;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a systemic disease \n     that causes damage to the kidney and the cardiovascular, \n     endocrine, hepatic, and gastrointestinal organ systems and \n     instills in patients a fear of an unknown future with a life-\n     threatening genetic disease and apprehension over possible \n     genetic discrimination;\n       Whereas the severity of the symptoms of polycystic kidney \n     disease and the limited public awareness of the disease \n     causes many patients to live in denial and forego regular \n     visits to their physicians or to avoid following good health \n     management which would help avoid more severe complications \n     when kidney failure occurs;\n       Whereas people who have chronic, life-threatening diseases \n     like polycystic kidney disease have a predisposition to \n     depression (7 times the national average) and its resultant \n     consequences due to their anxiety over pain, suffering, and \n     premature death;\n       Whereas the Senate and taxpayers of the United States \n     desire to see treatments and cures for disease and would like \n     to see results from investments in research conducted by the \n     National Institutes of Health and from such initiatives as \n     the NIH Roadmap to the Future;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a verifiable example \n     of how collaboration, technological innovation, scientific \n     momentum, and public-private partnerships can generate \n     therapeutic interventions that directly benefit polycystic \n     kidney disease sufferers, save billions of Federal dollars \n     under Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs for dialysis, \n     kidney transplants, immunosuppressant drugs, and related \n     therapies, and make available several thousand openings on \n     the kidney transplant waiting list;\n       Whereas improvements in diagnostic technology and the \n     expansion of scientific knowledge about polycystic kidney \n     disease have led to the discovery of the 3 primary genes that \n     cause polycystic kidney disease and the 3 primary protein \n     products of the genes and to the understanding of cell \n     structures and signaling pathways that cause cyst growth that \n     has produced multiple polycystic kidney disease clinical drug \n     trials;\n       Whereas the national PKD Foundation and its 60 volunteer \n     chapters around the country are dedicated to expanding \n     essential research, fostering public awareness and \n     understanding of polycystic kidney disease, educating \n     polycystic kidney disease patients and their families about \n     the disease to improve their treatment and care, providing \n     appropriate moral support, and encouraging people to become \n     organ donors; and\n       Whereas the PKD Foundation's Walk for PKD has grown from a \n     small, grassroots activity to an annual national awareness \n     event held during the third week of September, and such week \n     would be an appropriate time to recognize National Polycystic \n     Kidney Disease Week: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of a National Polycystic \n     Kidney Disease Awareness Week to raise public awareness and \n     understanding of polycystic kidney disease (known as \n     ``PKD'');\n       (2) recognizes the need for additional research into a cure \n     for polycystic kidney disease; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to support National Polycystic Kidney \n     Awareness Week through appropriate ceremonies and activities \n     to promote public awareness of polycystic kidney disease and \n     to foster understanding of the impact of the disease on \n     patients and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/02/senate-section/article/S8629-2", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 547--RECOGNIZING AND SUPPORTING THE SUCCESSES OF THE \n    ADOPTION AND SAFE FAMILIES ACT OF 1997 IN INCREASING ADOPTION, \n  OBSERVING THE EFFORTS THAT THE ACT HAS SPURRED, INCLUDING NATIONAL \n ADOPTION DAY AND NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH, AND ENCOURAGING CITIZENS OF \n       THE UNITED STATES TO CONSIDER ADOPTION THROUGHOUT THE YEAR\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Craig) submitted the following \nresolution;

(a) Congress makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S8661]]\n\n       (1) The United States is engaged in a global war on terror \n     that has no clear geographic boundaries, is of unknown \n     duration, and is against an enemy with no state sponsor that \n     continues to commit senseless acts of violence and human \n     destruction.\n       (2) Detention of enemy combatants in this war is necessary \n     for the security of members of the Armed Forces and the \n     achievement of United States national security and foreign \n     policy objectives, but must be conducted in a way that \n     upholds United States values and international law.\n       (3) Since January 11, 2002, Naval Station Guantanamo Bay \n     has been used for the detention and interrogation of about \n     750 enemy combatants, of which approximately 460 remain \n     incarcerated and only 10 of whom have been formally charged \n     with crimes and been subject to legal adjudication through \n     military commissions.\n       (4) The Supreme Court, in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 126 S.Ct. \n     2749, held that the nature and rules governing the United \n     States Government's military commissions were in violation of \n     the Uniform Code of Military Justice and did not comply with \n     the Geneva Conventions.\n       (5) Official investigations and reports by the United \n     States Government confirm multiple incidents of psychological \n     and physical abuse inflicted upon detainees at Guantanamo, \n     some of which included--\n       (A) the threatened use of extreme force by guards against \n     detainees;\n       (B) sleep deprivation;\n       (C) forced stress positions;\n       (D) the use of dogs in interrogations; and\n       (E) the harsh manipulation of light, sound, and \n     temperature.\n       (6) President George W. Bush stated on June 21, 2006, ``I'd \n     like to end Guantanamo. I'd like it to be over with,'' yet \n     the President has not offered a specific plan for \n     transitioning the current detainees to another status.\n       (7) The individuals currently detained at the detention \n     facility at Guantanamo Bay, many of whom appear to have \n     little or no remaining intelligence value in the global war \n     on terror, could be--\n       (A) transferred to other countries for further legal \n     review;\n       (B) enrolled in United States domestic civil, criminal, or \n     military court proceedings;\n       (C) transferred to a separate military detention facility \n     that fully complies with United States domestic law, \n     international law, and the law of war; or\n       (D) released if found not to pose a continuing security \n     threat to the United States.\n       (8) The international perception of the detention facility \n     at Guantanamo Bay is negative and has created substantial \n     hostility toward the United States, raising reservations \n     among friends and allies of the United States and other \n     countries about the commitment of the United States to human \n     rights.\n       (9) Members of the Armed Forces and other Americans who may \n     be captured overseas and detained by other countries, or by \n     non-state groups, are more likely to be treated in a manner \n     fully consistent with the Geneva Conventions if individuals \n     detained by the United States are treated in the same manner.\n       (10) The security of the United States will not be \n     diminished, United States diplomacy will be furthered, and \n     the standing of the United States in the world will be \n     enhanced if the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay is \n     closed and all detainees are transitioned to another legal \n     status.\n       (b) Not later than one year after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act--\n       (1) the Secretary of Defense shall close the Department of \n     Defense detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and\n       (2) all detainees detained at such facility shall be--\n       (A) charged with a violation of United States or \n     international law and tried in an Article III court or \n     military legal proceeding before a regularly-constituted \n     court;\n       (B) transferred to a separate military detention facility \n     that fully complies with all United States and international \n     law and the law of war;\n       (C) transferred to their country of citizenship or a \n     different country for further legal review; or\n       (D) released if found not to pose a continuing security \n     threat to the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4814.
