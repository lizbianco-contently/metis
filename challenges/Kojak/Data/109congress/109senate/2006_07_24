Madam President, this afternoon we have a 1-hour period of \nmorning business before we proceed to executive session. At \napproximately 3 o'clock today we will be turning to consideration of \nJerome Holmes to be a United States Circuit Court judge for the Tenth \nCircuit. We have an order in place that allows for 2 hours of debate \ntoday and 2 hours of debate tomorrow morning. Therefore the vote on \nconfirmation of Jerome Holmes will occur tomorrow morning before the \npolicy meetings.\n  I also remind everyone that we have a consent agreement for the \nconsideration of S. 403, the Child Custody Protection bill. We will be \nreturning to that bill tomorrow afternoon to dispose of the amendments \nand final passage of the Child Custody Protection measure tomorrow.\n  I want to put all of my colleagues on notice that we do need to \nfinish that bill on Tuesday, and if we have to work well into the \nevening, we will do so in order to finish that important bill.\n  Another issue to consider this week is the Energy Security Act of \n2006. That bipartisan bill is on the calendar and we want to proceed to \nits consideration as quickly as possible. If there are objections to \nconsidering that bill, it will be necessary to file cloture and we will \nbe prepared to file that motion. That vote would come as early as \nWednesday, Wednesday morning. I do also remind my colleagues that we \nhave a joint meeting on Wednesday morning. At 11 o'clock on Wednesday \nthere will be a joint meeting with the House to hear the address by \nPrime Minister Maliki of Iraq.\n  Given this address, a cloture vote would occur possibly around 10 \no'clock on Wednesday, in which case we could proceed directly to the \nHouse immediately following that vote, sometime after 10:30. If that is \nthe case, and I expect it will be, Senators should stay in the Chamber \nfollowing that vote and then we will proceed together to the Hall of \nthe House of Representatives for that joint meeting.\n  I was discussing with the Democratic leader, we should also put our \ncolleagues on notice that next week will be the last week of \nlegislative business prior to the August adjournment. As we plan the \nschedule for the remainder of this week and next, there is a lot to \naccomplish. Senators should fully expect a vote on Monday, July 31. We \nwere able to reach several agreements last week, which allowed us to \nsay no rollcall votes for today's session, but I expect very important \nvotes will occur each day next week, including Monday's session, so \neveryone should plan\n\n[[Page S8114]]\n\ntheir schedules to accommodate this final week.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Finally, I remind everyone that today marks the eighth anniversary of \nthe fatal shootings of Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson as they \nprotected the U.S. Capitol. At this time, I ask unanimous consent that \nat 3:40 this afternoon the Senate observe a moment of silence in \nrecognition of these two fallen officers.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Is \nthere a way the leader would try to work that into the schedule before \nwe go? Because this would be the second year without an intelligence \nauthorization bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Let's consider that. I think over the next day or so we \nneed to get together and go through all we do need to accomplish before \nwe leave for that month for the August recess.

Madam President, 8 years--that is how long it has been \nsince two Capitol police officers gave their lives in the line of duty. \nOn July 24, 1998, a lone gunman entered this building, the Nation's \nCapitol. He was wearing a green fedora with extra bullets in his pocket \nwhen he opened fire. He shot two officers and a tourist before falling \nhimself.\n  It is a day I will never forget. It is a day when I was swiftly \ndriven back to my days in emergency medicine, emergency surgery, in the \nreality that even your best efforts cannot always save a life--because, \ndespite our best efforts, we couldn't save Special Agent John Gibson or \nOfficer Jacob J. Chestnut. It is a humbling experience, realizing the \ndebt of gratitude we owe these two fallen heroes for their sacrifice \nand recognizing it can never be fully repaid. But we can honor their \nsacrifice by remembering, by offering solemn tribute to their courage, \nand by protecting the memory of these heroes.\n  We must ensure that Special Agent Gibson and Officer Chestnut did not \ndie in vain, and that the America they died protecting is the America \nwe preserve today and in the future. I hope, I pray we are never faced \nwith such tragedy again.\n  Thus, at 3:40 this afternoon, I hope this body will join me in a \nmoment of silence, a moment to reflect on the courageous sacrifice of \nSpecial Agent Gibson and Officer Chestnut for, although 8 years have \npassed, their memory and their sacrifice is alive in these halls today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/24/senate-section/article/S8114-4", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8114-S8116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE WAR IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, 1 month ago on June 22, the Senate held a \ndebate about the raging and intractable war in Iraq. That debate, \nDemocrats--led by Senators Levin and Jack Reed--gave voice to the \nconcerns of the American people and advocated that the Bush \nadministration change course in Iraq.\n  We argued that the administration follow the law of the land. The law \nof the land is that the year 2006 will be a year of significant \ntransition. That is the law. We argued that this year should be a year \nof transition, that we should follow the law with Iraqis taking charge \nof their own security and their own government so that American forces \ncould be redeployed by the end of this year.\n  Our plan would have given the Iraqi people their best chance for \nsuccess, while also giving America the best chance to confront the \ngrowing threats of North Korea, Iraq, and terrorism around the world.\n  Our plan would have engaged regional powers to help bring stability \nto Iraq and would have reminded the countries of the world of their \ncommitment to invest in Iraq's long-term economic prosperity which \nseems to have been lost.\n  Our plan would have refocused America's military, diplomatic, and \neconomic might on terrorist threats that face us in Iraq and globally, \nincluding Osama bin Laden, who remains free after 5 years.\n  Our plan would have tracked closely with the plan of our commanders \non the ground in Iraq today, led namely by General Casey, who on their \nown have developed a similar strategy for success.\n  Despite that fact, the majority of the Republicans chose not to join \nthe Democrats in serious debate about Iraq. I think they put their \npolitical needs ahead of America's security.\n  As they have in nearly every Iraq war debate, Republicans have \nblindly rubberstamped the President's mismanagement of this war and \nfell in line with his failed policy.\n  One month later, after the debate on Levin-Reid, the consequence of \n``staying the course'' in Iraq is evident in every place.\n  In the last month in Iraq, more than 3,000 Iraqis have been killed--\nan average of 100 a day. And more than 100 were killed just yesterday.\n  Pick up any newspaper. Here is today's. ``Bombings Kill at Least 66 \nin Iraq.''\n  If you read the article, it is a lot more than 66. The intense \nviolence made last week one of the deadliest in Iraq.\n  Read the article: 348 people killed, 6 of them police officers. Read \nthe article: 34 dead. Read the article: 60 killed. Read the article: 24 \ncivilians killed.\n  It doesn't talk about the hundreds and hundreds who have been wounded \nand injured, many of them for life.\n  This is a civil war. As I said last week, I tepidly talked about \ncivil war. But I decided that there was no reason to be tepid about \nit--that there is a civil war going on in Iraq.\n  Take the New York Times from yesterday. There are lots of other \nplaces you could go to find the same thing. ``It's Official: There Is \nNow a Civil War in Iraq.''\n  This wasn't written by somebody who is just passing by deciding to \nwrite an op-ed piece and they stick the headline on. He is Nicholas \nSambanis, a professor of political science at Yale, author of ``Making \nWar and Building Peace.'' He says, among other things:\n\n       The question of whether a country has fallen into civil war \n     is often deliberately muddled for political reasons.\n\n  We have had some muddling here.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       But if the term ``civil war'' seeks to convey the condition \n     of a divided society engaged in destructive armed conflict, \n     then Iraq sadly fits the bill.\n\n  The consequences of staying the course in Iraq is a full-blown civil \nwar.\n  In the last month, nearly 3,000 additional Iraqis have been killed, \n50 American soldiers have been killed, 250 have been wounded, $13 \nbillion of taxpayer money has been spent since that debate. The price \nof gasoline is now, as reported in this morning's news, the highest \never, averaging more than $3 a gallon.\n  Staying the course, North Korea, on July 4, tested new long-range \nmissiles.\n  In the last month, Hezbollah has terrorized Israel.\n  In the last month, al-Qaida found a new sanctuary, it appears, in \nlarge swaths of Somalia.\n  These are the costs of ``staying the course'' in Iraq and of a Senate \nwhich rubberstamps what the President does.\n  My question today is, how long will America be forced to pay these \ncosts? The longer it takes for this Republican Congress to hold \nPresident Bush accountable for his mistakes, the less safe America \nbecomes.\n\n  Democrats have asked for another Iraq debate before the August \nrecess. I hope we have that opportunity because\n\n[[Page S8115]]\n\nthe Republican leader said today that we are going to take up the \nDefense appropriations bill. I hope we would have an opportunity to do \nit there.\n  We want to give rubberstamping Republicans another chance to demand \nthat President Bush change course in Iraq--not because of any political \npoint scoring but because national security clearly demands it.\n  We live in a dangerous world, but nearly everywhere you look, from \nthe Middle East to Asia, America's enemies have been emboldened by this \nadministration's mismanagement of this conflict in Iraq. They are \ntaking advantage of our damaged reputation in the world and the fact \nthat Iraq has tied our hands to redouble their efforts and threaten us \nand our allies.\n  The Middle East has faced problems, as we know, for decades. Every \nAmerican President since World War II has struggled to bring freedom, \nstability, and prosperity to this region. The President washed his \nhands of what was going on with the Palestinians and the Israelis until \nthe Intifada became so complex, with so much conflict, that he had to \nstep in. But that took years into his first term of office.\n  The war in Iraq has destabilized the Middle East and taken our \nattention and our resources away from other threats. That is without \nquestion. So far, the result of the Iraq war has been instability and \nno security. One of the biggest winners so far has been Iran. They \ncontinue to thumb their nose at our country. The war in Iraq has given \nit exactly what it wants: greater influence in Iraq and throughout the \nMiddle East. The longer we go without a strategy for success in Iraq \nthe stronger Iran gets and the more confident it is in supporting \nterrorist organizations like Hezbollah, which is now terrorizing \nLebanon and Israel.\n  I believe Israel has every right to defend itself from these \nterrorist acts. While it defends itself, the United States should be \nstanding by its side.\n  Unfortunately, because Iraq has tied our hands and exhausted our \nresources and our reputation, the Bush administration has had to sit on \nthe sidelines. The President was ineffective in finding any solution \nduring the G8 Summit, and he went nearly 2 weeks without dispatching \nhis Secretary of State to the region. Finally, yesterday, Secretary of \nState Rice left for the Middle East. Hopefully her surprise visit to \nLebanon is not a continuation of the Bush photo-op foreign policy. \n``Mission Accomplished,'' ``Bring `em On.'' I hope it is not a photo-op \nagain but a serious effort to follow the call for American leadership.\n  The Bush administration's--as reported on the face of a major weekly \nmagazine last week--cowboy diplomacy cannot be replaced by couch potato \ndiplomacy where we sit and do nothing.\n  Democrats have called for a special envoy to emphasize the need for \nfull-time leadership. We need to do the hard work to put Iran back in \nthe box and bring stability back to the Middle East. That job can be \nstarted but can't be finished by the Secretary of State during a brief \nvisit there this week. What we need is a full-time special envoy--\nsomeone who can work around the clock with Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, \nthe Europeans, and, yes, Russia and Israel.\n  Together, we can bring some good out of this terrible situation by \nfinding ways to support the Lebanese Government, continue our support \nfor Israel, and disarm Hezbollah and ultimately contain the Iranian \npower. The challenge will be for this administration and its Republican \nrubberstamp allies in Congress to step up and do the job. We need a new \ndirection.\n  This week, the Iraqi Prime Minister will meet with President Bush and \naddress a Joint Session of Congress here in Washington. When he is \nhere, we need President Bush to communicate that our commitment in Iraq \nis not unlimited. He needs to announce a change of course in his \nfailing policy.\n  If we hope to live in a world that is safe and secure, we must end \nthe open-ended commitment in Iraq that is costing this Nation $3 \nbillion each week and requires the deployment as we speak of at least \n125,000 of America's finest troops.\n  We must transition the mission in Iraq so that we can marshal our \nresources to the other threats America faces such as Bin Laden, who, as \nI said, remains free after 5 years, Iran, North Korea, and many other \ntroubled spots in the world.\n  We must insure that the Senate is more than a rubberstamp for the \nexecutive branch. There are only 2 weeks before the August recess--\nreally just 6 voting days left. There are a number of important \nsubjects that deserve our attention but none more important than the \nintractable war in Iraq.\n  The Senate can no longer turn a blind eye to what is happening in \nIraq. It is costing too many American lives, too many Iraqi lives, too \nmany dollars, and too much of our national security.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, will the Democratic leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Last year, we had bipartisan agreement on the Senate \nfloor, and the agreement was that this year, the year 2006, would be a \nyear of significant transition in Iraq. We spelled out what we had in \nmind, that the Iraqis would take on more responsibility for their own \nfate and their own future, that the United States troops would be able \nto start withdrawing and coming home in this year of 2006. I ask the \nDemocratic leader, as he joins with me each morning reading about how \nIraq is descending into a civil war, the number of innocent civilians \nwho are being killed in Iraq, and the number of American troops who \ncontinue to lose their lives in Iraq, when we voted for significant \ntransition in Iraq, is this what we had in mind?\n\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, this was on a bipartisan vote. On a \nbill cosponsored by the two people who take care of our armed services, \nSenators Levin and Warner, 79 Senators voted for that, and the law of \nthe country as we speak is that the year 2006 is to be a year of \nsignificant transition in Iraq, and the President, I believe, should \nfollow that law and he is not doing that. I agree with my friend.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Nevada if he would yield for this \nquestion. Then this year when the Defense authorization bill came \nforward, is it not true that the Democratic side offered another \namendment in an attempt to strike a bipartisan position on foreign \npolicy in Iraq, an amendment which was sponsored by Senator Levin of \nMichigan, Senator Reed of Rhode Island, who is a graduate of West \nPoint, served in the United States Army, and that this amendment which \nwe offered to our friends on the Republican side to join us this year \nsaid we would start a transition this year before the end of the \ncalendar year by redeploying American troops outside of Iraq? This \namendment we offered had 39 of 45 Democratic Senators supporting it and \nno Republican support.\n  I would ask the Senator from Nevada, at the end of that Defense \nauthorization bill, just a few weeks ago, was any position taken by the \nRepublican side of the aisle that suggested any change in policy in \nIraq?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, that is what is so concerning to me, \nthat they are following--they, the Republican Senators, are following \nPresident Bush, stay the course, stay the course in Iraq. It breaks my \nheart, frankly. Every day I get up. This is just one page of the paper. \nI went through the deaths--hundreds of them. I didn't read here, but in \nthe past week 1,000 people in Iraq have moved out; they are afraid. \nThey move out of their neighborhoods. We have probably now estimated \n200,000 people in Iraq since the first of the year have had to move \ntheir homes. They have no place to go. They want to try to stay alive. \nThe turmoil, the civil strife in that country, is unbelievable, and to \nthink that this country's policy is to stay the course is not sensible.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Again, if the Senator from Nevada will yield, as you \nwatch the disintegration of the foreign policy under this \nadministration, we find ourselves relying on the Chinese to try to \nnegotiate some peaceful resolution in North Korea, we are relying on \nthe Russians to try to find some way to approach the Iranians on their \nnuclear power, but we have no one to turn to when it comes to Iraq. \nThis was our own creation, with British help and some other countries, \nbut primarily American soldiers and American resources. I would ask the \nSenator from Nevada, is his point on the floor today\n\n[[Page S8116]]\n\nthat the bipartisan Senate should not go home for the August recess \nwithout taking up this issue? We have spent weeks, the Republican \nleadership has spent weeks in the Senate on meaningless constitutional \namendments and issues that bear little relevance to the daily lives of \nAmericans, but the Senator from Nevada has to feel, as do I, we have an \nobligation to these soldiers and their families before we leave in \nAugust to have a meaningful debate on this floor about how to make \ncertain that we end up in Iraq with our mission truly accomplished. I \nask the Senator from Nevada, is that the purpose of his coming to the \nfloor?\n  Mr. REID. First, my coming here is just as the Senator indicated. How \ncan we, the Senate of our country, leave here with the raging civil war \ngoing on and our troops are right in the middle of it? How can we leave \nhere without changing the course in Iraq? That is why I am here. It is \na cry for help. We need our Republican colleagues to speak out. This \nblind allegiance to the President is not good for our country.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I have come to the Senate floor today to discuss what I \nbelieve are some necessities, steps to bring an end to the current \ncrisis in Israel and Lebanon and to set us back on a course toward \nstability in the Middle East.\n  I condemn the killing and the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers by Hamas \nand Hezbollah. I believe that was a deliberate act of provocation. It \nwas intended to further rupture efforts at creating stability in the \nregion, and it was carried out by groups who seek no less than the \ndestruction of the nation of Israel. And I, I am sure along with my \ncolleagues, support Israel's right to defend itself. However, I also \nbelieve the Israeli response has been excessive and the current crisis \nof escalating violence on both sides must be brought to an end so we \ncan resume efforts at creating a lasting peace.\n  My first point is I believe United States interests and Israeli \ninterests will be furthered if we support the efforts of the Secretary \nGeneral of the United Nations to bring about a cease-fire at the \nearliest possible date. Secretary General Kofi Annan has called for an \nimmediate end to fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. He has pointed \nout the obvious, which is that as long as fighting continues, the \nnumber of civilian deaths both in Israel and Lebanon will increase. I \nalso believe this may be the best way to ensure the safe return of \nkidnapped soldiers. Of course, the further destruction of civilian \ninfrastructure in Lebanon is putting the future economic and political \nviability of that nation at serious risk. I think it is obvious to all \nthat what is occurring in Israel and Lebanon is a disaster for many \ninnocent civilians.\n  Our own administration has chosen not to support Secretary General \nAnnan's call for an end to hostilities. As I understand Ambassador \nBolton's position, it is that allowing a continuation of hostilities \nwill provide Israel the opportunity to eliminate Hezbollah's ability to \nattack Israel and that this degrading of Hezbollah's military \ncapability will provide a better possibility for long-term peace. I \nsupport the goal of long-term peace, but I disagree with his view that \ncontinued combat is the best way to achieve it.\n  Whatever additional military advantage might be achieved by delaying \na cease-fire comes at a very high cost. First, there is the cost in the \nloss of additional civilian lives.\n  Second, there is the additional support for Hezbollah in the Arab \nworld which the continued attacks on Lebanon will almost certainly \ngenerate.\n  Third, there is the increase in anti-Israeli and anti-American \nsentiment throughout the Middle East and more broadly which will result \nif the military conflict continues.\n  While I understand the goal of these continued attacks is to bring an \nend to terror in the Middle East, and I strongly support that goal, I \nbelieve the result will be the opposite.\n  The administration's unwillingness to join other nations in calling \nfor a cessation of hostilities reinforces the belief in Arab countries \nthat our Middle East policy is based on a double standard. The \nperception is we have one level of concern when innocent Israeli \ncivilians are being killed and injured and much less concern when the \ninjured or killed civilians live in Arab countries. Support by the U.S. \nfor an immediate cease-fire would save lives on both sides and would \nhelp to counter that perception.\n  There was an article in the Washington Post last week by Michael \nAbramowitz entitled ``In Mideast Strife, Bush Sees a Step to Peace.'' \nIn the article, he states:\n\n       In the administration's view, the new conflict is not just \n     a crisis to be managed. It is also an opportunity to \n     seriously degrade a big threat in the region, just as Bush \n     believes he is doing in Iraq.\n\n  If this administration thinks it can succeed here in Lebanon with the \nsame strategy that has brought us success in Iraq, then our foreign \npolicy in Washington is even more out of touch with reality than I had \nthought.\n  My second point is as part of our effort to bring about this cease-\nfire, we need to talk directly with Syrians and others with whom we \nhave disagreed.\n  Robert Malley, who was President Clinton's special assistant for \nArab-Israeli affairs, has written an article in the July 24 issue of \nTime magazine making that case persuasively. His article is entitled \n``Time to Start Talking.'' The thrust of his argument is this \nadministration's policy of not talking to those with whom we disagree \nhas not served us well. The same argument is made by John McLaughlin, \nthe former Deputy Director of the CIA, in yesterday's Washington Post.\n  In my view, both of these former officials are giving good advice and \nI urge the President and the Secretary of State to heed that advice.\n  My final point is this current crisis should be a wake-up call to \nthis administration that the United States needs to reengage \ndiplomatically in the region.\n  For the past several decades, United States administrations have seen \nour role in the Middle East as supporting the security of Israel but \nalso as helping to resolve conflicts between Israel and its neighbors \nand supporting moderate governments in the region. There are many \nchapters in that history. Among the most remembered are Secretary of \nState Kissinger's efforts at shuttle diplomacy, President Carter's \nefforts at Camp David, President Clinton's efforts both in bringing \nRabin and Arafat to the White House for a handshake, and his later \nefforts trying to broker a peace agreement at Camp David.\n  This current administration has chosen a different course. It has \nchosen to disengage from that conflict resolution role. As evidence of \nthis, Secretary Powell did not appoint a special Middle East envoy as \nhis predecessor had. Secretary Rice also has not appointed a special \nenvoy. Her statement was:\n\n       Not every effort has to be an American effort. It is \n     extremely important that the parties themselves are taking \n     responsibility.\n\n  My strong view is this policy of disengagement has not served the \ninterests of the United States, the interests of Israel, or the \ninterests of other countries in the region. We are by far the biggest \nprovider of aid to the countries in the Middle East and if any outside \nnation is to play an effective and a constructive role, it needs to be \nthe United States.\n  I am glad the Secretary of State is in Beirut today, but progress on \nthe diplomatic front cannot be postponed awaiting fly-ins by the \nSecretary of State. Secretary Rice should appoint a special envoy to \nwork full time at resolving disputes and tensions in the region.\n  Again, John McLaughlin states the point well:\n\n       The chances of detecting and heading off imminent disaster \n     are enhanced when there is intense, unrelenting and daily \n     attention by a senior and respected U.S. figure who wakes up \n     every morning worrying about nothing else--the role Dennis \n     Ross played so effectively in the 1990s.\n\n  Continuing with his quotation.\n\n       Without constant tending to the concerns of all the \n     regional parties, rapid flagging of\n\n[[Page S8117]]\n\n     issues for decision in Washington and continuity of focus by \n     one individual with access we will lurch from crisis to \n     crisis.\n\n  It is ironic that the President and Secretary of State acknowledge \nthe need for an Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy. This was \nthe job Karen Hughes was given, to burnish the U.S. image abroad, \nparticularly in the Muslim world. Yet at the same time they refuse to \nappoint a special envoy to the Middle East which, in my view, would do \nfar more with regard to perceptions in that part of the world.\n  I urge the administration to reassert the historic role of the United \nStates as a force for resolution of conflict in the Middle East. I \nbelieve that must begin by engaging in direct talks with the parties in \nthe region. And I urge the President and our Secretary of State to help \nbring about an immediate cessation of hostilities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the two articles I have referred to, one \nby Robert Malley and the other by John McLaughlin, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From Time, July 24, 2006]\n\n                         Time to Start Talking\n\n                           (By Robert Malley)\n\n       The most alarming aspect of the unfolding crisis in the \n     Middle East isn't how many actors are jumping in. It's who is \n     opting to stay out. Hamas, Hizballah and Israel are directly \n     involved; Iran and Syria by proxy; Lebanon against its will. \n     The U.N. is dispatching its mediators; the European Union is \n     contemplating doing the same. But the U.S., despite colossal \n     strategic stakes, threats to its own security, potential \n     repercussions in Iraq, not to mention staggering loss of \n     life, remains on the sidelines. The world's sole superpower \n     is also its only no-show.\n       This is by design. From early on, the diplomacy of the Bush \n     Administration has been guided by a straightforward logic: \n     engagement is a reward, misbehavior ought not be rewarded; \n     ergo, misbehaving parties are not to be engaged. The thinking \n     is that isolation, ostracism and, if need be, sanctions are \n     more likely to get troublesome actors to change their ways. \n     And so the list of diplomatic outcasts only grows. Today the \n     U.S. does not talk to Iran, Syria, Hamas, the elected \n     Palestinian government or Hizballah. And as the violence in \n     the region clearly shows, that has hardly been cause for \n     moderation. President Bush once famously observed that the \n     U.S. had sanctioned itself out of all leverage on Iran. In \n     truth, it has worked itself out of much influence on the \n     region.\n       And that's only half the problem. Since 2000, with the \n     collapse of any Arab-Israeli peace process, the start of the \n     war on terrorism and the. U.S. invasion of Iraq, regional \n     actors have lacked a clear compass, rules of the road or a \n     referee. Syria is being told to clean up its act in Lebanon \n     and Iraq; Iran to drop its nuclear program and to stop \n     meddling in its neighbor's affairs; Hamas to undergo an \n     ideological revolution; Hizballah to disarm. All are \n     perfectly justifiable demands, but none are being accompanied \n     by a clear and appealing incentive for the parties' taking \n     such actions--other, that is, than avoiding retribution if \n     they do not.\n       As a result of this diplomatic vacuum, the only factor \n     constraining the behavior of the various parties has been \n     their mutual fear. Israel has been worried that Hizballah \n     might launch Katyusha rockets on Haifa, Syria that Israel \n     might wipe out its army or regime, Hamas and Hizballah that \n     their entire leadership could become fair game. But such \n     apprehension always was at most a feeble restraint, because \n     in an unregulated environment, the only thing more costly \n     than disregarding one's fears is displaying them. In the past \n     weeks, that last and flimsy inhibition finally gave way. The \n     conflict no longer is about achieving a specific objective--\n     it's about imposing new rules of conduct, re-establishing \n     one's deterrence, redesigning the region's strategic map. \n     Stopping such fighting is a tall order, precisely because the \n     protagonists' main goal is to demonstrate they are not afraid \n     to prolong it.\n       It certainly won't be halted without robust, credible and \n     influential third-party involvement. None of the actors will \n     want to appear overly eager for a cease-fire, but more than a \n     few might--at the appropriate time--leap at an outsider's \n     proposed deal. That happened before, in the 1980s and 1990s, \n     when Lebanon was the arena for similar proxy wars and when \n     the U.S., then the energetic mediator, was the instrument of \n     diplomatic negotiations. Without U.S. support, it's doubtful \n     that the U.N.'s mediators will be able to muster similar \n     muscle.\n       So is there any way out of the crisis? If the U.S. hopes to \n     find one, it will have to help put a comprehensive package on \n     the table, and some of its broad outlines can be divined. On \n     the Israeli-Palestinian side, it would include a reciprocal \n     and verifiable cease-fire, a prisoner swap and Israel's \n     allowing the Hamas government to govern. The Lebanese \n     equation is more complex. Here too a prisoner exchange and \n     cease-fire agreement will be necessary, but a broader deal, \n     involving steps toward Hizballah's disarmament and Israel's \n     withdrawal from the contested Shabaa farms, will probably be \n     required. On the latter issues at least, it is hard to \n     imagine much happening without addressing Syrian concerns; \n     for more sustainable stability, Iran will have to be included \n     as well.\n       But then, such an approach would entail negotiating with \n     all the wrong people about all the wrong things. That, of \n     course, is precisely what the U.S. is adamant it will not do. \n     One does not talk to outlaw actors, let alone bargain with \n     them. The result has been a policy with all the appeal of a \n     moral principle and all the effectiveness of a tired \n     harangue.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From Washingtonpost.com, July 23, 2006]\n\n                      We Have To Talk to Bad Guys\n\n                          (By John McLaughlin)\n\n       Although the fighting in the Middle East is still raging, \n     it is not too soon to start drawing lessons from these tragic \n     events. Even if this situation begins to cool, there are so \n     many other flashpoints in the Middle East and so many other \n     potential hot spots in the world that any respite from crisis \n     is bound to be short.\n       Lesson No. 1 is that change occurs incrementally and almost \n     imperceptibly in the Middle East, but when it reaches \n     critical mass, the potential for surprise and disaster is \n     enormous. The current situation did not emerge overnight. The \n     death of Yasser Arafat presented a huge opportunity for the \n     international community to bolster Mahmoud Abbas and reform \n     the Palestinian Authority. But that effort largely stalled \n     despite strenuous efforts by the special envoy representing \n     the Quartet--the United States, the European Union, the \n     United Nations and Russia. This helped set the stage for the \n     Hamas victory in the Palestinian elections. Hamas's control \n     of the West Bank and Gaza and its estrangement from the \n     international community gave Hezbollah, in Lebanon, \n     unprecedented opportunities and reach into those areas. The \n     continuing weakness of the Lebanese government allowed \n     Hezbollah a free hand in its home base.\n       Lesson No. 2 is that the chances of detecting and heading \n     off imminent disaster are enhanced when there is intense, \n     unrelenting and daily attention by a senior and respected \n     U.S. figure who wakes up every morning worrying about nothing \n     else--the role that Ambassador Dennis Ross played so \n     effectively in the 1990s. It is true that plenty of able \n     people in the U.S. government still focus on the Middle East. \n     But without constant tending to the concerns of all the \n     regional parties, rapid flagging of issues for decision in \n     Washington and continuity of focus by one individual with \n     access, we will lurch from crisis to crisis.\n       Lesson No. 3, related to all of this, is that process \n     matters, especially in the Middle East, where the issues are \n     so contentious and the parties so divided. Without ongoing, \n     regular and near-continuous negotiation, there are few \n     reference points that all the parties can accept when \n     conflict breaks out. It may not even matter whether \n     perceptible progress is occurring continuously. The important \n     thing is that the table is always set, everyone has a chair \n     and someone is in charge. That has not been the case for some \n     time in the Middle East.\n       Lesson No. 4 is that even superpowers have to talk to bad \n     guys. The absence of a diplomatic relationship with Iran and \n     the deterioration of the one with Syria--two countries that \n     bear enormous responsibility for the current crisis--leave \n     the United States with fewer options and levers than might \n     otherwise have been the case. Distasteful as it might have \n     been to have or to maintain open and normal relations with \n     such states, the absence of such relations ensures that we \n     will have more blind spots than we can afford and that we \n     will have to deal through surrogates on issues of vital \n     importance to the United States. We will have to get over the \n     notion that talking to bad guys somehow rewards them or is a \n     sign of weakness. As a superpower, we ought to be able to \n     communicate in a way that signals our strength and self-\n     confidence.\n       Lesson No. 5 is that there are no unilateral solutions to \n     today's international problems, not even for superpowers. \n     They have been rendered impossible by a host of factors \n     unique to this era--globalization, the Internet, the \n     technological revolution and the increasing role of non-state \n     actors with influence that spills across existing borders. \n     The disproportionate influence of Hezbollah at the moment \n     illustrates the point. This doesn't mean turning everything \n     over to international forums. But it is tempting to think \n     that successful passage through the current thicket might \n     have been eased by steps such as a series of regional \n     conferences, linked to our allies and to the United Nations, \n     at which all parties could have been forced--grudgingly and \n     slowly--to put their cards on the table regarding issues such \n     as Iraq, regionally based terrorism and the Israeli-\n     Palestinian conflict. Would this have gotten us anywhere?\n       In a region as complex as the Middle East, nothing \n     guarantees progress. But what is clear is that these problems \n     are intertwined, that all the states in the region have vital \n     interests at stake, and that approaching these issues \n     serially will only prolong the familiar cycle of one step \n     forward and two steps back.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

HOLMES TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR \n                           THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 3 p.m. \nhaving arrived, the Senate will proceed to executive session to \nconsider Calendar No. 764, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Jerome A. \nHolmes, of Oklahoma, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Tenth \nCircuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nhours for debate equally divided between the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nMr. Specter, and the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Judiciary Committee, which I chair, \nis pleased to report the nomination of Mr. Jerome A. Holmes to be a \njudge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Mr. Holmes \ncomes to this position with an excellent academic and professional \nbackground. He was nominated to be a judge on the court on May 4 of \nthis year, received a hearing on June 15 of this year, and was reported \nout of the Judiciary Committee on July 13 on a voice vote.\n  The unique situation with Mr. Holmes is that he would be the first \nAfrican American to serve on the Court of Appeals for the Tenth \nCircuit. I am about to yield to the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Coburn, who obviously has great familiarity with that \ncircuit, being from the State of Oklahoma. Before moving to \nPennsylvania to go to the University of Pennsylvania some years ago, I \nbegan my own academic career at the University of Oklahoma, having been \na lifelong resident up to that point of the State of Kansas. The Tenth \nCircuit is near and dear to my heart. I can testify firsthand about the \ndesirability and, in fact, the need for diversity on the Court of \nAppeals for the Tenth Circuit. There ought to be diversity to the \nextent practical and possible on all of our courts. It gives the \nconstituency, the litigants, and the people who practice before the \ncourt, the sense that there are judges from every walk of life. The \nbroader the background a court possesses, the more understanding it has \nof the problems we all face in a very diverse society, which is the \nmelting pot of the world, the better.\n  That does not mean in any way, shape, or form that qualifications \nought to be subordinated, that we should pursue diversity for \ndiversity's sake, regardless of other considerations. But when someone \nhas the qualifications that Mr. Holmes presents to the Senate and in \naddition would bring diversity to the court to which he has been \nnominated, that is something to be considered. Certainly the \ndesirability of having diversity on the Supreme Court of the United \nStates is evident and highly visible. Thurgood Marshall was the first \nJustice on the Supreme Court to be African American. Now we have \nJustice Clarence Thomas, again, the only African-American judge. It \ntook a long time for women to find a place on the Supreme Court, with \nthe nomination and confirmation of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in 1981. \nThat was the first year of my service in the Senate, after being \nelected in 1980. It was a great day when Justice Sandra Day O'Connor \ntook her place on the Supreme Court of the United States. We now have, \nin addition, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. It is important to have that \ndiversity.\n  While there is not a Hispanic on the Supreme Court, we have Alberto \nGonzales who is the Attorney General of the United States. There is no \ndoubt these individuals are role models. They demonstrate that an \nHispanic can come to the highest levels of the Government, as can an \nAfrican American, as can a woman. It took a long time for women's \nsuffrage, for women to have the right to vote, and to move into the \nupper echelons of all facets of American life. There is, realistically \nviewed, still a glass ceiling which imposes some limitation.\n  Now on to Mr. Holmes and his very excellent qualifications. He \ngraduated from Wake Forest University cum laude in 1983 and the \nGeorgetown University Law Center in 1988. At Georgetown, he served as \neditor in chief of the Georgetown Immigration Law Journal. In the year \n2000, he earned a master's in public administration from Harvard's \nKennedy School of Government. Between college and law school, he worked \nas a social services assistant in the D.C. Department of Corrections. \nFollowing law school he clerked for Judge Wayne Alley of the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Western District of Oklahoma and then Tenth \nCircuit Judge William J. Holloway. Following the clerkship, he spent 3 \nyears in private practice as an associate with the well-regarded law \nfirm of Steptoe & Johnson.\n  In 1994, Mr. Holmes began a distinguished career as a Federal \nprosecutor serving as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Western \nDistrict of Oklahoma. Among other duties, he prosecuted public \ncorruption, Federal criminal civil rights violations, and was the \noffice's antiterrorism coordinator. He also worked on the prosecuting \nteam that built a case against the perpetrators of the Oklahoma City \nbombing. Since 2005, he has been a director of the private Oklahoma law \nfirm Crowe & Dunlevy, where he has focused on white collar criminal \ndefense and complex litigation. He also chairs the firm's diversity \ncommittee.\n  Mr. Holmes has given back to the people of Oklahoma by taking \nleadership roles in a wide variety of civic organizations, including \nservice as a director of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, \ntrustee of the Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation, director of \nthe Oklahoma Academy for State Goals, chairman of the City Rescue \nMission, and vice president of the Oklahoma Bar Association. The \nAmerican Bar Association has unanimously found Mr. Holmes to be \nqualified to serve on the Tenth Circuit.\n  Before yielding the floor and turning over the management of the \nnomination to my distinguished colleague on the Judiciary Committee, I \nwish to make a few comments about a release of the American Bar \nAssociation today on so-called signing statements. I have discussed \nwith Senator Coburn that I will take a few more minutes at this time. \nMay the record show he is nodding in the affirmative. I shall not take \ntoo long.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business''.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at this point, I yield to my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Coburn, who did an excellent job as \nMr. Holmes's principal advocate before the Judiciary Committee, as my \ndesignee to handle the proceedings in the Senate this afternoon and \ntomorrow on the confirmation of Mr. Holmes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it is a privilege to be on the committee \nwith the Senator from Pennsylvania, and it is a privilege to represent \nJerome Holmes during his debate and consideration for the Tenth Circuit \nCourt position.\n  A lot of discussions have occurred in this body in the last couple of \nyears on judges. One of the things which was prominent in my election \nto the Senate was the issue of judges. It really comes back down to \nwhat the American people would like to see in those people who sit on \nthe highest courts of our land and what are the qualities and \ncharacteristics we would like them to have and do they go through a \nprocess where those are fairly vetted and taken out of the political \narena to see what those qualities are.\n  Thinking about Jerome Holmes, Senator Specter very well outlined his \nhistory. So there is no question that he has impeccable credentials and \nthat he is considered well qualified by the American Bar Association. \nBut what he does have is two things. One is a\n\n[[Page S8119]]\n\nconstitutionally correct and appropriate opinion as to the position of \njudges in our society. Their job is to take the Constitution, take our \nstatutes and our treaties, and, in the light of Supreme Court \nprecedent, rule only on those things--not to create new law, not to \ninvent a cause they want to make. They are to be very limited in their \nrole. Jerome Holmes understands that.\n  The second characteristic he has is that of integrity. We hear that \nword bantered around a lot, and we hear modifiers placed on it. You \ncannot modify integrity. You either have it or you don't. Your life \neither represents it or it does not. What people see you do and how you \ndo it is either of integrity or not.\n  This is an African-American male who was raised in this city, who \nstruggled to accomplish the highest levels of his profession. He \nexcelled every step of the way. Not only did he apply his efforts in \nterms of his profession, but he spent a great deal of his time applying \nhis skills, knowledge, and intellect to help other people outside of \nthe field of law.\n  He is a man committed to our country, who has full recognition of \nwhat his responsibilities will be as an appellate court judge in the \nTenth Circuit in this country. He also fully well knows that his role \nis to follow the precedent set by the highest Court in this land and to \ndo that in a way which gives everyone before him a truly blind cause of \njustice for their benefit. We cannot ask more than that of our judges--\nthat in fact they have not only integrity and intellect, but the last \nthing we can ask is, Do they have heart? Do they have compassion? Have \nthey experienced the real problems of life personally, so that they can \nsee into the lives of others and how they deal with those things in the \npredicaments and situations which we face and whether they follow a \nresponse that is one of integrity. I have no question in my mind that \nJerome Holmes has the qualities and characteristics which will make him \nan excellent appellate judge.\n  We are going to hear some opposition to him. The opposition is \nbasically because he believes in a colorblind society. He has written \ncommentaries based on what he believes personally. He has been \ncritical--and rightly so, as many in this body have been, and others--\nof decisions the Supreme Court has made. But to be critical doesn't \nmean one will not follow what is called stare decisis, the precedent \nset down by the Supreme Court.\n  It takes great courage for an African-American male to look at \naffirmative action in a light that says that in the long run, it hurts \nrace relations rather than helps them. Those are my words, not his. \nBut, in fact, what he has done is said this goes against what he \nbelieves to be fair and honorable, as we approach the problems within \nour society. What he really believes is that everybody should be judged \non the content of their character, not on the color of their skin.\n  So we will hear a lot over the next 4 hours--2 hours today and 2 \nhours tomorrow--from those people who would question his position. It \nis OK to question it, but it is not OK to oppose him on the basis of \nwhat his personal beliefs are. If we do that, there is not a judge who \ncan qualify. Not one judge could qualify for any court in this land if \nwe take all their personal opinions and put them out in the open and \nsay: This goes against something I believe.\n  So I am honored that I have the privilege to stand on the Senate \nfloor and defend the criticisms that will come before him. I also know \nhe has heart, he has intellect, and he has integrity. That is what we \nwant. It doesn't matter whether he is Black or White or whether he is \nRepublican or Democrat, we want those qualities in our judges. That is \nhow we assure our freedom--we take the political arena away and out of \nthe courts, and we let the Constitution and our statutes and our \ntreaties reign supreme. That is the best equality for all that we can \ngive to the next generation.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nobserve a moment of silence in recognition of the anniversary of the \nfatal shootings of Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it was 8 years ago today that these two \nbrave men gave their lives in defense of the United States Capitol. A \nplaque in this building commemorates their bravery. Their names have \nbeen etched indelibly upon the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial a mile from here, and the headquarters of the United States \nCapitol Police now bears their names, all of which are fitting and \nproper memorials but none of which can do these men the full justice \nthey deserve.\n  We must also remember them in our words, in our actions, and in, as \nwe just did, a moment of prayer. All Members of Congress today, all \ncongressional staff, and, indeed, all Americans owe a great debt of \ngratitude to Officer Jacob Joseph Chestnut and Detective John Michael \nGibson.\n  These two brave men stood up for us all. They defended our democracy \nitself, and although none of us will be called upon to display the same \nsort of moral heroism, we can all learn from their example and all \nreflect upon their bravery.\n  Today we mourn for them, we pray for them, we thank them and their \nfamilies, and we remember them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there may be other Members of the Senate who \nhave served as police officers during their careers, sitting Members of \nthe Senate. But I served as a Capitol police officer when I was going \nto school back here. I worked the swing shift. I have a great affection \nand feel very affiliated with the Capitol police.\n  Officer Gibson was killed along with Officer Chestnut on the House \nside. Not long before this terrible act occurred, the Democratic Senate \nhad a retreat in Virginia. My wife got sick during the night. We had to \ncall the Capitol police who were standing by. I can remember Officer \nGibson running. He had to run from where the headquarters was, in a \ndifferent part of the hotel, to our room--it was spread out a long \nway--carrying all this emergency equipment. When he came, he was \nperspiring so hard. He was so gentle and nice with my wife. Every time \nI hear this recounted, how he and Officer Chestnut were killed, I \nremember this man so clearly. I can see his face very plainly.\n  I have expressed to his family my personal appreciation, as I tried \nto do for Officer Chestnut, whom I did not know except in passing--but \nI felt some affinity toward Officer Gibson. These two men were at one \nof the entrances to this Capitol. The crazed man came in and killed \nboth of them. While we have this terrible event in the history of the \nCapitol 8 years ago today--1998--if there could be a positive side, and \nthat is hard to find, the one place you would have to go is the \nVisitors Center. That is because as a result of this tragic event the \ndecision was finally made, after years and years of treading water, to \ngo ahead and take care of a new visitors center for this Capitol \ncomplex. That will be completed in less than 1 year.\n  It is going to be a wonderful addition to the Capitol for people who \nare visiting the Capitol. Millions of people\n\n[[Page S8120]]\n\ncome to visit the Capitol every year. Right now they come through these \ndoors, just like the ones Officers Chestnut and Gibson were guarding. \nThere have been improvements made, but it is hard to do that because of \nthe doorways as you come into the Capitol itself. With the new Visitors \nCenter, there will be an entry over by the Supreme Court. People coming \nin will be able to be screened for weapons and other dangerous \nmaterials.\n  There will be two beautiful auditoriums where they can watch a 12-\nminute film to acquaint them with what is in the Capitol. There will be \nrestrooms which are still lacking with the present situation. There \nwill be places for them to eat, get snacks, and buy food. It will be a \nwonderful experience for them to come to the Capitol. It is a good \nexperience now, but the new situation will make the experience much \nbetter.\n  After 8 years, we still remember these two fine men. We do so not \nonly because of their personal sacrifice, but the fact that every day \nin this Capitol--as I look around, there are plain-clothes officers. A \nlot of people do not know who they are, but they are here. And they \nwould give their lives protecting the Presiding Officer, the \ndistinguished majority leader, and the assistant leader, those in the \nback rooms, or any other Senator. That is their job. They know it. \nWhile we sometimes take them for granted--and I hope we don't--these \nare some of the finest trained police officers in the world.\n  When we stand for Chestnut and Gibson in a moment of silence, our \nthoughts are also with these valiant men and women who protect this \nbeautiful facility and the people who are in it--Senators, staff, and \nvisitors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining under his \ncontrol.\n  I recognize the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am baffled that there would be any \nopposition to Jerome Holmes to be appointed a U.S. circuit court judge \nto the Tenth Circuit. I congratulate my colleague from Oklahoma for his \nleadership in promoting such a fabulous nominee. I believe that he \nwould be just the kind of person we need on the bench. It's really, \nreally baffling to hear any objection to him.\n  I want to talk about his background and record, and we'll begin to \nhave a better understanding of the demand for ideological purity on the \npart of Democratic and liberal Members of the Senate when it comes to \njudges. It is unbelievable that there would be objection a man who \narticulates a view consistent with the Supreme Court majority in the \nAdarand case, an African American himself, who believes in Martin \nLuther King, Jr.'s dream that people would be judged by the content of \ntheir character and not the color of their skin.\n  He is a fabulous nominee. I would just like to mention a few things \nabout him. He was voted out of committee a few weeks ago, July 13, on a \nvoice vote. If confirmed, he will be the first African American to \nserve on the Tenth Circuit. He has stellar academic credentials and \nlegal credentials. He graduated from Wake Forest University--one of \nAmerica's great universities--cum laude with honors in 1983. Then he \nattended Georgetown University Law Center, one of the Nation's great \nlaw schools. At Georgetown, he was editor-in-chief of the Georgetown \nImmigration Law Journal. That's a great honor, to be part of a law \njournal at any law school, much less a great law school such as \nGeorgetown. It's very competitive and difficult to get in Georgetown.\n  Recently, in 2000, he earned a master's of public administration from \nHarvard University's Kennedy School of Government. Between college and \nlaw school, he worked briefly as a social services assistant with the \nD.C. Department of Corrections, dealing with criminals and the problems \nthey have.\n  Following law school, he clerked for the Honorable Wayne Alley on the \nU.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma and the \nHonorable William J. Holloway on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nTenth Circuit. In other words, he clerked for a trial court judge in \nthe Tenth Circuit. By the way, it is a competitive process to be \nselected to be a clerk for a trial court judge. It takes a good law \nstudent to be selected for that. Everyone who applies is not selected. \nIt is a very great honor. People compete for those few positions.\n  He worked at the trial bench, where he participated at the right hand \nof a U.S. Federal judge trying cases and participating in the trial of \ncases. Following that, he went to the Tenth Circuit, the very court he \nis now nominated to. If it is difficult to be a law clerk for a Federal \ndistrict trial judge, it is far more difficult to be selected as a law \nclerk for a court of appeals judge. They have a stack of applications. \nThey look at all competitors from around the country, and they select \nthe best. He was an honors graduate from Wake Forest and a top graduate \nat Georgetown and editor of the Law Review, and he clerked for a \nFederal judge. He clerked and help Judge Holloway write opinions on the \nTenth Circuit--the very thing he will be doing if he is confirmed to \nthis position, which I trust he will be.\n  Following these clerkships, he spent 3 years in private practice as \nan associate with the well-regarded law firm of Steptoe & Johnson, one \nof the best law firms in America. They do not hire just anybody.\n  In 1994, Mr. Holmes began a distinguished career as a Federal \nprosecutor, serving as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Western \nDistrict of Oklahoma, the circuit area where he will be a circuit judge \nwhen confirmed.\n  I have served as an assistant U.S. attorney and as a U.S. attorney \nsupervising assistant U.S. attorneys for almost 15 years. That is a \ngreat, great position because the assistant U.S. attorneys prosecute \ncases full time in Federal court before Federal judges. They learn \neverything there is to know about criminal law, which will be an \nimportant part of his duties as a Federal circuit judge. It is very \ngood experience. Assistant U.S. attorneys get experience practicing \nbefore Federal judges, being involved in writing appeals to Federal \njudges, and understanding how the Federal system works. He did that for \nquite a number of years.\n  During that time, he prosecuted public corruption cases. Now that's a \nchallenge. I have been there and done that. That is not easy. \nPoliticians do not take lightly to being indicted. They do not \nappreciate it, and it is tough litigation. He prosecuted Federal \ncriminal civil rights violations. Somehow, I guess they are saying this \nAfrican American who has achieved so much is insensitive to civil \nrights because he does not agree with everything the left thinks about \naffirmative action or quotas. He was the U.S. attorney's office's \nantiterrorism coordinator, and he worked on the prosecution team that \nbuilt the case against the perpetrators of the Oklahoma City bombing. \nThat is a good background that shows a breadth of experience.\n  Since 2005, he has been the director of the prominent Oklahoma law \nfirm of Crowe & Dunlevy, where he focused on white-collar criminal \ndefense and complex litigation--another good background for the Federal \nbench.\n\n  Not only has he been a prosecutor, but he has defended criminal \ncases, giving him a perspective on both sides. I am a big fan of \nprosecutors, but I understand my colleagues on the other side of that \ndebate, who defend cases, as I have on occasion, appreciate the fact \nthat prosecutors have some defense work. He has had both.\n  Also, he chaired the firm's diversity committee, the committee \ncommitted to making sure that his law firm, Crowe & Dunlevy, did the \nthings necessary to be a diverse law firm. He has\n\n[[Page S8121]]\n\ngiven back to the people of Oklahoma through taking leadership roles in \na wide variety of important organizations. These include service as the \ndirector of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. That is an \nimportant committee outside the normal realm of what a lot of people do \nwith their lives, volunteering and giving time to a group like that. He \nalso has served as trustee of the Oklahoma City National Memorial \nFoundation, director of the Oklahoma Academy for State Goals, chairman \nof the City Rescue Mission, helping people in trouble, down and out, \npeople who need a hand to lift them up. I guess on occasion they \nminister to those people who are hurting, they minister to their souls. \nI think it is something to be proud of. He also served as vice \npresident of the Oklahoma Bar Association.\n  He enjoys strong bipartisan support in Oklahoma. Gov. Brad Henry, a \nDemocrat in Oklahoma, recently wrote that the nominee ``is a highly \nqualified candidate, a superb lawyer, with a reputation for fairness, \nethics, and integrity.''\n  He summed up his letter by writing:\n\n       In short, I do not think you could have a candidate more \n     highly qualified and regarded than Jerome Holmes.\n\n  That is the Democratic Governor of Oklahoma.\n  Daniel Webber, a Democrat whom President Clinton made the U.S. \nattorney in Oklahoma, wrote:\n\n       I have known Jerome Holmes for over ten years. . . . I \n     believe his intellect, experience, and character make him an \n     excellent choice for a position on the appellate court.\n\n  The American Bar Association has unanimously found him qualified for \nthe position.\n  Why would we have an objection to someone who spent this many years \nof his life practicing in Federal court as an assistant U.S. attorney, \nwho spent 3 years as a law clerk to Federal judges, practicing in one \nof the country's biggest law firms, and being not a partner--they use a \ndifferent phrase there, something like a partner--with the Dunlevy law \nfirm in Oklahoma, a firm with a great reputation in the State? What is \nit that causes the Senate to have a debate on this fine nominee?\n  Again, I congratulate Senator Coburn for offering this kind of \nnominee. He has been willing to express his personal views on matters \nthat some on the left do not like. I guess that is it. Let's just be \nfrank about it. I suggest that what he said is consistent with the \nopinions of the U.S. Supreme Court. But even if he had a slightly \ndifferent view than the Supreme Court, what is wrong with having him \nexpress that view? Why would anyone object to that?\n  This is what he said about the University of Michigan affirmative \naction case that many felt--and at least four Supreme Court Justices \nfelt--was essentially a quota system. What is affirmative action? \nEveryone has a different view. What I think we in America tend to agree \nis that affirmative action, affirmative outreach, affirmative efforts \nto bring minorities into institutions and give them a chance to succeed \nis all right, but setting up quotas by which people, by the color of \ntheir skin, are given preference over someone else, therefore enhancing \ntheir ability and their rights over the rights of someone else simply \nbecause of the color of their skin, violates the equal protection and \ndue process clauses of the U.S. Constitution. So that is all that \ntension in there.\n\n  I guess we come down to it in what I say, this is not a perfect \nanalysis, but we say affirmative outreach is good; quotas are bad. I \nguess when you have a case such as University of Michigan, you ask, was \nthis a quota or was it affirmative outreach? They had a big case on it. \nHe had expressed some concern about that case. Remember, it was 5 to 4. \nIt was not as if the Supreme Court had taken a case that they all felt \none way about. So he wrote an op-ed, an article in the Daily Oklahoman. \nThe title is ``A Step Closer to King's Dream.'' He started off this \nway:\n\n       Perhaps the dream of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. will be \n     realized: Children seeking educational opportunities no \n     longer will be judged by the color of their skin.\n\n  Is that something that is radical? I don't think so. We have Members \nof this Senate who believe that anybody who deviates the slightest \nmillimeter, or centimeter beyond the ideological views of the left is \nsomehow unqualified to be a Federal judge. From what I have seen, they \ntend to be more critical if that person happens to be an African \nAmerican that criticizes leftist orthodoxy.\n  So he wrote an article. It was, I thought, a very thoughtful article. \nThere was nothing extreme about this. He said:\n\n       There are other ways to get minority students on college \n     campuses besides handing out benefits based solely on skin \n     color--an accident of birth.\n\n  I think that is a thoughtful statement--a matter of real importance. \nHe then goes on to talk about what you can do to help minority students \nsucceed and have a better chance to enter universities, noting:\n\n        . . . a poverty-reduction approach that primarily focuses \n     on implementing race-neutral macroeconomic and labor-market \n     policies, even though its central goal is bettering the life \n     chances of the truly disadvantaged black and brown urban \n     poor.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Diversity proponents need to come up with race-neutral \n     policies that have the desired effect of boosting the number \n     of minority students. Politicians and educators in Florida, \n     Texas and California have attempted to do just that by \n     mandating that the top percentage of students (for example, \n     the top 10 percent) at every public school in the state be \n     guaranteed a place in a state university.\n\n  So what he is saying is that is a race-neutral way to have a more \ndiverse student body. But what is dangerous and violates the \nConstitution is to say that every law school or every university must \naccept so many people, each based on race, regardless of their \nqualifications for the position.\n  He goes on to say that this high school proposal that Florida, Texas, \nand California have done is ``race neutral, yet their acknowledged goal \nis to increase the number of minority students on college campuses. Top \nstudents from predominantly minority schools will invariably be \nrepresented there.''\n  So, Mr. President, I would just say that I don't see anything extreme \nabout those views. I don't believe my colleague from Oklahoma does. I \nsee the Presiding Officer, a former justice on the Texas Supreme Court. \nI don't think he would believe those are extreme views. In fact, they \nare consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court opinion in Adarand. I think \nthey are consistent with the Supreme Court opinion in the University of \nMichigan cases, very consistent with those cases, and respectful and \nunderstanding, as an African American himself, that we have to be \ncareful that we are not moving to a situation in which people receive \nbenefits as a result of the color of their skin only, unless there is a \nshowing of a prior history of discrimination, which can be shown in a \nnumber of cases. Unless you have that, you should not create a legal \nsystem in America that advances someone simply because of the color of \ntheir skin and, therefore, puts at a disadvantage someone because of \nthe color of their skin.\n  So he has made some thoughtful comments about it. I believe they are \nwise. I think he is correct. I am amazed that someone in this Senate \nwould object to his confirmation based on these comments. But we \napparently have that. I am sure we will have a good vote for Mr. Holmes \ntomorrow. I hope we will, and he will be confirmed. But it is rather \nodd to me that we have this objection, and he doesn't go straight \nthrough without any of this kind of debate.\n  I thank the Chair and the Senators from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn and Mr. \nInhofe, for their commitment to this sterling nominee, a minority, with \nan outstanding record--went to Georgetown, clerked for the Tenth \nCircuit, clerked for a Federal district judge, an assistant U.S. \nattorney, worked for one of America's great law firms. He has every \nright to be rated qualified by the American Bar Association, as he was \nunanimously. He should be confirmed for this position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators Inhofe and \nCoburn--my friends and neighbors from the State of Oklahoma--in support \nof this fine nominee to the Federal bench.\n  Jerome Holmes is a leader in Oklahoma's legal community--and a leader \nin the broader community in which he lives. Mr. Holmes has demonstrated \nthe qualifications, character, and temperament that will make him an \noutstanding judge.\n\n[[Page S8122]]\n\n  As a testament to his ability and promise, the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously voted to move Mr. Holmes's nomination to this floor for \nconfirmation. Jerome Holmes enjoys bipartisan support not only here in \nWashington, but, perhaps more telling, he enjoys bipartisan support \nback home in Oklahoma--where people know best this accomplished man and \nhis good work.\n  In fact, Oklahoma's Democrat Governor, Brad Henry, said of Mr. \nHolmes: ``Jerome is a highly qualified candidate, a superb lawyer with \na reputation for fairness, ethics, and integrity . . . In short, I do \nnot think you could have a candidate more highly qualified and regarded \nthan Jerome Holmes.'' Again, Mr. President, that high praise comes from \nOklahoma's Democrat Governor. Other prominent Democrats in Oklahoma \npraise Jerome Holmes as ``a person of unwavering integrity,'' a \n``principled leader,'' and someone with a ``willingness to listen and \nrespect differing views.'' In short, the people who know this man \nbest--Oklahomans of competing political stripes and policy views--think \nJerome Holmes will make a great judge.\n  Those who know Jerome Holmes best know that he served with \ndistinction as a Federal prosecutor for over a decade. They know that \nas an Assistant U.S. Attorney he vigorously--but fairly--prosecuted \npublic corruption and civil rights violations--and that he served as \nhis office's antiterrorism coordinator. In fact, Jerome Holmes worked \non the prosecution team that built a case against the perpetrators of \nthe Oklahoma City bombing.\n  I recall vividly that dark day in 1995, the day the Alfred P. Murrah \nFederal Building was bombed, the day that the people of Oklahoma City \nwere terrorized. The Tenth Circuit's Chief Judge Deanell Reece Tacha \npointed out that ``[i]n some ways,'' her circuit and the people of \nOklahoma ``knew ahead of the rest of the nation of the horrors of \nterrorism.''\n  Those who know Jerome Holmes best know that, he--like so many others \nin his office--took on this difficult assignment with fairness and care \nand dedication to see justice done.\n  President Bush nominated this fine man to the appellate bench for his \nstrong qualifications but also for his demonstrated understanding of \nthe proper, limited role of the Federal judiciary under the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  Jerome Holmes himself said it best:\n\n       I recognize very clearly the distinction between the role \n     of a writer on social policy issues in their personal \n     capacity and the role of a judge in adjudicating the rights \n     and liberties of individual litigants.\n\n  And Mr. Holmes pointed out that as a judge ``it is inappropriate for \nme to import my personal views on policy issues into the decision \nmaking process.''\n  I would submit that this statement by Mr. Holmes is exactly correct. \nJudges should not be seen as politicians in robes. Unfortunately, too \nmany people still view the Federal courts as a vehicle for enacting \npolicy choices that are too extreme to prevail at the ballot box. And, \nas a corollary, these same people view activist judges as a means to \ntheir policy ends.\n  I am confident that Jerome Holmes understands the proper, limited \nrole that this Nation's Founders assigned to the Federal judiciary. I \nsay that because I am confident that this President understands the \njudicial role and continues to nominate like-minded men and women to \nthe bench.\n  The court to which Mr. Holmes is nominated--the Tenth Circuit Court \nof Appeals--covers a large part of the middle and western United \nStates. The territorial jurisdiction of the Tenth Circuit includes six \nStates: Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah. And \nthe circuit also has jurisdiction over those parts of Yellowstone \nNational Park extending into Montana and Idaho.\n  Last week, the Senate confirmed another outstanding nominee to the \nTenth Circuit, Neil Gorsuch. And when the Senate votes to confirm \nJerome Holmes, as I am confident it will, he will join Judge Gorsuch \nand four other fine Bush nominees on the Tenth Circuit.\n  So, in closing, I commend President Bush for submitting another fine \nnominee to the Senate for confirmation, and congratulate my friends \nfrom Oklahoma, their constituents, and the entire Tenth Circuit. I \nbelieve Jerome Holmes will make a fine appellate judge and will serve \nthis Nation with honor and distinction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, the American Bar Association issued a \nrelease today summarizing a report by a blue ribbon task force which \nconcluded that President Bush's signing statements are in violation of \nand undermine the important doctrine of separation of powers. As it has \nbeen widely recorded, President Bush has undertaken a practice of \nissuing a signing statement at the time he signs congressional action \ninto law. The task force said its recommendations ``are intended to \nunderscore the importance of the doctrine of separation of powers and, \ntherefore, represent a call to the President and to all his successors \nto fully respect the rule of law and our constitutional system of \nseparation of powers and checks and balances.''\n  Noting that the Constitution is silent about Presidential signing \nstatements, the task force found that while several Presidents have \nused them, the frequency of signing statements that challenge laws has \nescalated substantially, and their purpose has changed dramatically, \nduring the administration of President Bush. According to a press \nrelease issued today by the ABA, the task force report notes:\n\n       From the inception of the Republic until 2000, Presidents \n     produced fewer than 600 signing statements taking issue with \n     the bills they signed. According to the most recent update, \n     in his one-and-a-half terms so far, President George Walker \n     Bush . . . has produced more than 800.\n\n  The report found that President Bush's signing statements are \n``ritualistic, mechanical, and generally carry no citation of authority \nor detailed explanation.'' Even when ``[a] frustrated Congress finally \nenacted a law requiring the Attorney General to submit to Congress a \nreport of any instance in which that official or any officer of the \nDepartment of Justice established or pursued a policy of refraining \nfrom enforcing any provision of any federal statute, . . . this, too, \nwas subjected to a ritual signing statement, insisting on the \nPresident's authority to withhold information whenever he deemed \nnecessary.''\n  This request raises serious concerns on the proceedings for \nseparation of powers. The ABA states that its report goes on to say:\n\n       If left unchecked, the president's practice does grave harm \n     to the separation of powers doctrine and the system of checks \n     and balances that have sustained our democracy for more than \n     two centuries.\n\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on this subject and \nfound that this practice does threaten the separation of powers \ndoctrine. The hearing showed that the Constitution is clear, that when \nboth Houses of Congress pass legislation and submit that legislation to \nthe President, the Constitution calls either for the President to sign \nthe legislation, to engage in what could be called a pocket veto, or to \nveto the legislation and send it back to Congress. If there is a \nconstitutional issue and the President concludes that portions of the \nstatute are unconstitutional, he has an oath to uphold the\n\n[[Page S8123]]\n\nConstitution. And the way to fulfill that oath is to return the \nlegislation to the Congress with a veto message noting the \nunconstitutionality of the provision and giving Congress the option of \naltering the legislation to satisfy the President's request, passing it \nover the President's veto, or declining to act further.\n  Additionally, the task force has urged the Congress to enact \nlegislation to require the President to submit a report to the Congress \nof any such signing statement and has urged the Congress to enact \nlegislation. During the course of the hearing before the Judiciary \nCommittee, in my capacity as chairman, I made the request to Bruce \nFein, who had been a lawyer in the Department of Justice during the \nReagan administration, to take the lead and prepare legislation on the \nsubject. Mr. Fein and my staff have been working on legislation. It is \nmy expectation that, before the weekend, we will submit legislation to \nthe Senate which will give the Congress standing to seek relief in the \nFederal courts in situations where the President has issued such \nsigning statements and which will authorize the Congress to undertake \njudicial review of those signing statements, with the view to having \nthe President's acts declared unconstitutional. That is our view as to \nthe appropriate status of these signing statements.\n  It is worth noting that the task force members include a very \ndistinguished array of former public servants, including former CIA \nDirector William Sessions; former Republican House Member Mickey \nEdwards; Court of Appeals Judge Patricia M. Wald, and others.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the news \nrelease from the American Bar Association be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      [From American Bar Association, News Release, July 24, 2006]\n\n   Blue-Ribbon Task Force Finds President Bush's Signing Statements \n                     Undermine Separation of Powers\n\n       Washington, DC.--Presidential signing statements that \n     assert President Bush's authority to disregard or decline to \n     enforce laws adopted by Congress undermine the rule of law \n     and our constitutional system of separation of powers, \n     according to a report released today by a blue-ribbon \n     American Bar Association task force.\n       To address these concerns, the task force urges Congress to \n     adopt legislation enabling its members to seek court review \n     of signing statements that assert the President's right to \n     ignore or not enforce laws passed by Congress, and urges the \n     President to veto bills he feels are not constitutional.\n       The Task Force on Presidential Signing Statements and the \n     Separation of Powers Doctrine was created by ABA President \n     Michael S. Greco with the approval of the ABA Board of \n     Governors in June, to examine the changing role of \n     presidential signing statements after the Boston Globe on \n     April 30 revealed an exclusive reliance on presidential \n     signing statements, in lieu of vetoes, by the Bush \n     Administration.\n       In appointing the special task force Greco said, ``The use \n     of presidential signing statements raises serious issues \n     relating to the constitutional doctrine of separation of \n     powers. I have appointed the Task Force to take a balanced, \n     scholarly look at the use and implications of signing \n     statements, and to propose appropriate ABA policy consistent \n     with our Association's commitment to safeguarding the rule of \n     law and the separation of powers in our system of \n     government.''\n       The task force report and recommendations will be presented \n     to the ABA's policymaking House of Delegates for adoption at \n     its upcoming Annual Meeting Aug. 7-8. Until the ABA House has \n     taken formal action, the report and recommendations represent \n     only the views of the task force.\n       The bipartisan task force, composed of constitutional \n     scholars, former presidential advisers, and legal and \n     judicial experts, noted that President George W. Bush is not \n     the first president to use signing statements, but said, ``It \n     was the number and nature of the current President's signing \n     statements which . . . compelled our recommendations.''\n       The task force said its report and recommendations ``are \n     intended to underscore the importance of the doctrine of \n     separation of powers. They therefore represent a call to this \n     President and to all his successors to fully respect the rule \n     of law and our constitutional system of separation of powers \n     and checks and balances.''\n       The task force determined that signing statements that \n     signal the president's intent to disregard laws adopted by \n     Congress undermine the separation of powers by depriving \n     Congress of the opportunity to override a veto, and by \n     shutting off policy debate between the two branches of \n     government. According to the task force, they operate as a \n     ``line item veto,'' which the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled \n     unconstitutional.\n       Noting that the Constitution is silent about presidential \n     signing statements, the task force found that, while several \n     recent presidents have used them, the frequency of signing \n     statements that challenge laws has escalated substantially, \n     and their purpose has changed dramatically, during the Bush \n     Administration.\n       The task force report states, ``From the inception of the \n     Republic until 2000, Presidents produced fewer than 600 \n     signing statements taking issue with the bills they signed. \n     According to the most recent update, in his one-and-a-half \n     terms so far, President George Walker Bush . . . has produced \n     more than 800.''\n       The report found that President Bush's signing statements \n     are ``ritualistic, mechanical an generally carry no citation \n     of authority or detailed explanation.'' Even when ``[a] \n     frustrated Congress finally enacted a law requiring the \n     Attorney General to submit to Congress a report of any \n     instance in which that official or any officer of the \n     Department of Justice established or pursued a policy of \n     refraining from enforcing any provision of any federal \n     statute . . . this too was subjected to a ritual signing \n     statement insisting on the President's authority to withhold \n     information whenever he deemed it necessary.''\n       ``This report raises serious concerns crucial to the \n     survival of our democracy,'' said Greco. ``If left unchecked, \n     the president's practice does grave harm to the separation of \n     powers doctrine, and the system of checks and balances, that \n     have sustained our democracy for more than two centuries. \n     Immediate action is required to address this threat to the \n     Constitution and to the rule of law in our country.''\n       Greco said that the task force's report ``constructively \n     offers procedures that consider the prerogatives both of the \n     president and of the Congress, while protecting the \n     public's right to know what legislation is adopted by \n     Congress and if and how the president intends to enforce \n     it. This transparency is essential if the American people \n     are to have confidence that the rule of law is being \n     respected by both citizens and government leaders.''\n       The bipartisan and independent task force is chaired by \n     Miami lawyer Neal Sonnett, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney \n     and Chief of the Criminal Division for the Southern District \n     of Florida. He is past chair of the ABA Criminal Justice \n     Section, chair of the ABA Task Force on Domestic Surveillance \n     and the ABA Task Force on Treatment of Enemy Combatants; and \n     president-elect of the American Judicature Society.\n       ``Abuse of presidential signing statements poses a threat \n     to the rule of law,'' said Sonnett. ``Whenever actions \n     threaten to weaken our system of checks and balances and the \n     separation of powers, the American Bar Association has a \n     profound responsibility to speak out forcefully to protect \n     those lynchpins of democracy.''\n       The other task force members, whose brief background \n     information follows, are William S. Sessions, Patricia M. \n     Wald, Mickey Edwards, Bruce Fein, Harold Hongju Kho, Charles \n     Ogletree, Stephen A. Saltzburg, Kathleen M. Sullivan, Mark \n     Agrast, Tom Susman, and adviser Alan Rothstein.\n       The task force recommendations urge Congress to adopt \n     legislation to permit the president, Congress or other \n     entities to seek court review any time the president claims \n     he has the authority, or states his intention, to disregard \n     or decline to enforce all or part of a law he has signed, or \n     when he interprets the law in a manner inconsistent with the \n     intent of Congress. Currently, Congress lacks legal authority \n     to seek judicial review in those circumstances.\n       The task force also urges the president to use his veto \n     power, as all prior presidents have done, instead of a \n     signing statement when he believes all or part of a bill is \n     unconstitutional, in keeping with the Constitution's \n     requirement that the president either approve or disapprove \n     in their entirety laws presented to him by Congress.\n       If the president believes a bill pending before Congress \n     would be unconstitutional if enacted, he should communicate \n     his concerns to Congress before the bill is passed, according \n     to the task force.\n       Additionally, the task force urges Congress to enact \n     legislation requiring the president promptly to submit to \n     Congress an official copy of every signing statement he \n     issues. Any time the president claims authority or states his \n     intention to disregard or decline to enforce all or part of a \n     law he has signed, the legislation should require him to \n     submit a report to Congress, available in a public database, \n     setting forth in full the reasons and legal basis for his \n     position, said the task force.\n       Presidential signing statements are not new, according to \n     the task force, which notes that ``Presidents have issued \n     statements elaborating on their views of the laws they sign \n     since the time of President James Monroe.'' But under \n     President Ronald Reagan, ``For the first time, signing \n     statements were viewed as a strategic weapon in a campaign to \n     influence the way legislation was interpreted by the courts \n     and Executive agencies as well as their more traditional use \n     to preserve Presidential prerogatives.'' The report also \n     notes that President Clinton, like his predecessors, used \n     signing statements, but to a significantly lesser degree, and \n     different purpose.\n       Among President Bush's signing statements, the task force \n     noted refusals to carry out laws involving ``Congressional \n     requirements to report back to Congress on the use\n\n[[Page S8124]]\n\n     of Patriot Act authority to secretly search homes and seize \n     private papers, [and] the McCain amendment forbidding any \n     U.S. officials to use torture or cruel and inhumane treatment \n     on prisoners.''\n       Where legislation has mandated reports to Congress on \n     special matters, such as the Intelligence Authorization Act \n     of 2002, the signing statement treated the requirement as \n     only advisory, said the task force. The task force said \n     President Bush's signing statements are ``particularly \n     adamant about preventing any of his subordinates from \n     reporting directly to Congress.''\n       With more than 410,000 members, the American Bar \n     Association is the largest voluntary professional membership \n     organization in the world. As the national voice of the legal \n     profession, the ABA works to improve the administration of \n     justice, promotes programs that assist lawyers and judges in \n     their work, accredits law schools, provides continuing legal \n     education, and works to build public understanding around the \n     world of the importance of the rule oflaw in a democratic \n     society.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/24/senate-section/article/S8124-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CAPITOL SHOOTINGS ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, 8 years ago today, two brave men gave their \nlives in defense of the U.S. Capitol. A plaque in this building \ncommemorates their bravery, their names have been etched indelibly upon \nthe National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial a mile from here, and \nthe headquarters of the U.S. Capitol Police now bears their names.\n  These memorials are fitting and proper. But they do not do these men \nfull justice. We must also remember them in our words and our actions. \nAll Members of Congress, all congressional staff, and, indeed, all \nAmericans owe a great debt of gratitude to Officer Jacob Joseph \nChestnut and Detective John Michael Gibson.\n  For a few moments, I would like to reflect upon the enormous bravery \nof these two men.\n  Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson were both hardworking family \nmen. Gibson had three children; Chestnut, five. Gibson found great \nhappiness in the exploits of the Boston Red Sox and Boston Bruins. He \nknew their rosters by heart. Chestnut loved working in his garden. I \nknew both men by sight. I passed Officer Chestnut most every day on my \nway in to work.\n  On Friday, July 24, 1998, both men were nearing the end of a busy \nwork day. But events unfolded with a quick and horrible speed. At about \n3:40 p.m. police and prosecutors allege that Russell Eugene Weston \nentered the Capitol through the East Entrance. He attempted to evade a \nmetal detector and Chestnut stepped into his path to stop him--to \nprotect all of us. Weston shot him at point-blank range.\n  Weston then allegedly proceeded down the corridor, rushing towards \nthe Office of the Majority Leader of the House of Representatives. \nGibson, those who were in the office say, warned everyone to get down. \nHe yelled ``Drop your weapon'' and exchanged gunfire with Weston. The \ncrazed gunman hit Gibson in the leg and the chest. Gibson hit Weston in \nthe leg and chest as well. A female tourist got caught in the crossfire \nand suffered serious but fortunately non-life threatening wounds. Both \nmen hit the floor, bleeding profusely. Gibson's actions saved lives. As \none staffer put it at the time, ``Thank God there was a good guy with a \ngun.''\n  Sitting in my Dirksen office, I had begun preparations to leave for \nthe weekend when I was notified an emergency was unfolding at the \nCapitol. My instincts and my surgical training took over.\n  I ran to the East ``Law Library Entrance'' at the Capitol. I saw \nblood all over--a horrible scene. Three bodies lay on the ground. I \nturned my attention to treating them. In the chaos, I didn't recognize \nany of the three.\n  I assisted the medical first responders in controlling the \nhemorrhaging and securing an airway, and then helping two of the \nvictims into the ambulances. I rode in the ambulance to help control \nthe hemorrhage of one of the injured. It turned out that patient was \nthe alleged perpetrator.\n  All of us should, every day, give thanks for the bravery and \nsacrifices of Officer Jacob Joseph Chestnut and Detective John Michael \nGibson. Many have contributed funds set up to assist their families and \nrarely a day goes by that I don't remember both of them in my thoughts \nand prayers.\n  The shootings that took place on July 24, 1998, were an attack on \nthis Capitol, a central symbol of our democracy and, thus, an attack on \nthe openness of Congress, and, in turn, upon the very principle of two-\nway communication between the people and their elected representatives.\n  Two brave men stood up for us all. They defended our democracy \nitself. We will not all be called to the same sort of moral heroism but \ncan all learn from their example and all reflect upon their bravery.\n  Today, we mourn for them, we pray for the families, we thank them, \nand we remember them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/24/senate-section/article/S8124-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT ON WILDFIRES\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, wildfires have already burned almost 300,000 \nacres in Nevada this year, and over 1.7 million acres were destroyed by \nfire last year. One particularly devastating fire last year burned over \n500,000 acres in southern Nevada.\n  Well-established science indicates small, normally occurring \nwildfires are part of the healthy life-cycle of forests. Large, \ncatastrophic fires, though, can sometimes cause extreme and \nirreversible damage to the delicate ecosystems in the West.\n  People in Nevada have always been concerned about wildfires and their \nability to destroy homes, businesses, and our State's natural beauty. \nRecently, though, Nevadans and people throughout the West have begun to \nnotice and ask questions about the dramatic changes in wildfire \nintensity and frequency.\n  The Congressional Research Service has concluded that many factors \ncontribute to the threat of wildfires. These factors include \nunnaturally high fuel loads, the urban-wildland interface, the increase \nof invasive plant species, unnatural wildfire suppression, and grazing \nand logging practices.\n  A recent scholarly article titled ``Warming and Earlier Spring \nIncreases Western U.S. Forest Wildfire Activity'' published online on \nJuly 6, 2006, in the Journal of Science focuses on the previously \nunexplored correlation between climate change and wildfires. The \narticle found that the frequency and intensity of wildfires in the West \nare growing as the climate gets hotter.\n  Two of the most telling parts of the article found that ``robust \nstatistical associations between wildfire and hydro-climate in western \nforests indicate that increased wildfire activity over recent decades \nreflects subregional responses to changes in climate.'' In addition, \nthe authors assert that ``large increases in wildfire driven by \nincreased temperatures and earlier spring snowmelts in forests where \nland use history had little impact on fire risks indicates that \necological restoration and fuels management alone will not be \nsufficient to reverse current wildfire trends.''\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that the issue of climate change \nshould be a partisan issue. I hope the mountain of scientific evidence \nthat is piling up on climate change will compel my colleagues on both \nsides and the administration to treat climate change as a moral issue \nand quickly enact mandatory reductions in global greenhouse emissions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/24/senate-section/article/S8124-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8124-S8125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               DULUTH EAST HIGH SCHOOL, DULUTH, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Duluth East \nHigh School, in Duluth, MN, which recently earned an Award for \nExcellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements \nin educating children.\n  Duluth East High School is truly a model of educational success, \nwhich is reflected in the achievements of its students. Duluth East \nHigh School boasts a 98-percent graduation rate. Ninety-one percent of \nits graduates go on to some type of postsecondary education, with over \n66 percent enrolling in a 4-year college. The class of 2005 had two \nstudents who qualified as National Merit semifinalists; nine received \nLetters of Commendation from the National Merit Scholarship \nCorporation; 23 earned a perfect 4.0 grade point average; and, all \ntold, members of the class were offered in excess of $2 million in \nscholarship monies.\n  Duluth East provides many challenging courses for high-achieving \nstudents, offering advanced placement courses in English, calculus, and \nEuropean history. All advanced placement\n\n[[Page S8125]]\n\nstudents are required to take the advanced placement test at the end of \nthe term. Students scoring three or better on the test automatically \nearn college credit. Last year, 70 percent of all Duluth East students \nwho took the advanced placement tests scored three or above.\n  In addition to the advanced placement classes, Duluth East offers \nCollege in the School classes and honors classes in English, biology, \nchemistry, physics, and anatomy/physiology.\n  Two Duluth East teachers received significant recognition last year. \nPeg Zahorick, a special education teacher, was designated Teacher of \nthe Year by Arc of Minnesota. She was honored for her work on behalf of \npersons with developmental disabilities and their families. Cindy \nGrindy, a chemistry teacher at Duluth East, was named the 2005 Star of \nAmerican Teaching for Minnesota. That award is given by the U.S. \nDepartment of Education.\n  Much of the credit for Duluth East High School's success belongs to \nits principal, Laurie Knapp, and to the dedicated teachers. The \nstudents and staff at Duluth East High School understand that, in order \nto be successful, a school must go beyond achieving academic success. \nIt must also provide a nurturing environment where students can develop \nthe knowledge, skills, and attitudes for success throughout life. All \nof the faculty, staff, and students at Duluth East High School should \nbe very proud of their accomplishments.\n  I congratulate Duluth East High School in Duluth for winning the \nAward for Excellence in Education and for its exceptional contributions \nto education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/24/senate-section/article/S8125-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MAYOR MARK ZEIGLER OF STURGIS, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I to pay tribute to the work \nof a distinguished public official in my home State of South Dakota. On \nSeptember 4, Mark Zeigler will step aside as mayor of Sturgis to become \nthe president of Northwestern Health Science University in Bloomington, \nMN.\n  Mark and his wife Gae, an elementary school teacher, arrived in \nSturgis on the last day of the 1980 Sturgis motorcycle rally. Mark \nquickly established his chiropractic practice. Later he began his \npolitical career by completing the term of Maurice LaRue on the Sturgis \nCity Council.\n  For the next 14 years, Mark served on the Sturgis City Council. He \nleft the council in 1997 and was elected mayor in 2001. During the past \n5 years as mayor, and his nearly 20 years of community service to the \nresidents of Sturgis, Mark has worked to make the community a better \nplace to work, live, and raise a family.\n  During Mayor Zeigler's tenure, the city developed a state-of-the-art \nlibrary and city hall complex that will serve the community and area \nresidents for many years into the future. He also worked towards the \nconstruction of a new fire hall that will provide expanded services to \nthe Sturgis community and area.\n  Mayor Zeigler has been especially successful in promoting economic \ndevelopment. Not so many years ago, it appeared the city lacked the \nmeans to expand its industrial base. But Mayor Zeigler succeeded in \nworking with city officials to design and expand the city's industrial \npark complex. Through his leadership, Sturgis has developed a niche \namong gun and ammunition manufacturers. In addition, he has made \nSturgis a more attractive place to live and work by expanding and \nbeautifying the city's greenway and bike path areas.\n  During his years of community service and as mayor of Sturgis, the \nannual Sturgis Motorcycle Classic has grown and expanded in popularity. \nSturgis is a community of roughly 6,000 citizens that hosts this annual \nevent that brings up to a million visitors each year. Hosting an event \nof this magnitude takes considerable effort and skill, which Mayor \nZeigler and his team of local partners have shown in abundance. In \naddition, they have hosted other established and expanding events such \nas Cavalry Days, the national Sheep Dog trials and competition, and the \nMeade County Gas and Threshing Bee.\n  I have had the privilege of working with Mayor Zeigler during his \nterms as mayor.

Mr. President, today I honor Harriet Beecher Stowe \nElementary School, in Duluth, MN, which recently earned an Award for \nExcellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements \nin educating children.\n  Harriet Beecher Stowe Elementary School is truly a model of \neducational success. For past 12 years, the school has embraced an \nenvironmental education emphasis, with a 100-percent commitment to \nrecycling, breakfast and lunch waste reduction, an integrated \nenvironmental education curriculum, a composting shed, an alternative-\nenergy tower, and annual environmentally themed service-learning \nprojects at all grade levels. Stowe Elementary was one of six Minnesota \nschools to receive last year's Spotlight Award from the Minnesota \nAcademic Excellence Foundation.\n  Improving pupils' achievement is also a primary focus at Stowe \nElementary. The teachers and administrators establish annual goals \nrelative to student achievement in reading, math, and writing, in \naddition to a goal related to the school's overall learning \nenvironment. The goals are comprehensive, including individual goals \nfor every staff member. It has a summer ``Jump Start'' EXCEL Program \nfor pupils determined to be at risk for maintaining their grade-level \nperformance. Last year, Stowe Elementary received four stars in both \nreading and math from the Minnesota Department of Education.\n  Much of the credit for Harriet Beecher Stowe Elementary School's \nsuccess belongs to its principal, Terry Cottingham, and to the \ndedicated teachers. The pupils and staff at Harriet Beecher Stowe \nElementary School understand that, in order to be successful, a school \nmust go beyond achieving academic success; it must also provide a \nnurturing environment where students can develop the knowledge, skills, \nand attitudes for success throughout life. All of the faculty, staff, \nand pupils at Harriet Beecher Stowe Elementary School should be very \nproud of their accomplishments.\n  I congratulate Harriet Beecher Stowe Elementary School in Duluth for \nwinning the Award for Excellence in Education and for its exceptional \ncontributions to education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/24/senate-section/article/S8125-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8125-S8126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  STATEMENT ON THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF WILMOT, SOUTH \n                                 DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the 125th \nanniversary of the founding of the progressive city of Wilmot, SD. It \nis my pleasure to recognize the citizens of Wilmot on reaching this \nmilestone.\n  Wilmot is the oldest town in Roberts County and was named after Mr. \nWilmot, a director of the Milwaukee Railroad. Wilmot was first settled \nin 1880 and filed for a town charter with the territorial government on \nJune 3, 1881. In the early years of Wilmot, the community was located \nin Grant County but was shortly thereafter included in the newly \ncreated Roberts County, where it served as county seat for a number of \nyears. The Milwaukee Railroad, which helped bring Wilmot into \nexistence, still runs through the town today.\n  The community has endured its share of hardship. For example, on June \n17, 1944, much of the agricultural area surrounding Wilmot was \ndestroyed by a tornado. Like many rural areas, the community came \ntogether to help one another, cleaning off farmland and rebuilding \nbuildings. This incident shows the strength of the bonds that hold this \nrural community together.\n  According to the 2000 census, Wilmot has 543 people. Small towns like\n\n[[Page S8126]]\n\nWilmot comprise the backbone of our State. These communities are built \non hard work and solid values and serve as a reminder of South Dakota's \nrich agricultural heritage. Wilmot is served by the Wilmot Enterprise \nweekly newspaper.\n  Even 125 years after its founding, Wilmot remains an active and \nvibrant community. As a way of celebrating this achievement, a ``Wilmot \nHistory Book'' is being compiled. This book will feature stories of all \nkinds about the people and events in Wilmot's past and will serve to \nbring this close-knit community even closer. I am proud to honor the \npeople of Wilmot on this memorable occasion and to extend my \ncongratulations to them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/24/senate-section/article/S8126-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              LOWELL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, DULUTH, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I honor Lowell Elementary \nSchool, in Duluth, MN, which recently earned an Award for Excellence in \nEducation for its exceptional and innovative achievements in educating \nchildren.\n  Lowell Elementary School, a music magnet school, is truly a model of \neducational success. In addition to a well-rounded learning experience, \nthe school offers an exceptional music curriculum, including a choir at \neach grade level--kindergarten through fifth grade--piano instruction \nfor second, third, and fourth-grade pupils, string instrument lessons \nfor third through fifth grades, and band instruction for grades four \nand five.\n  Lowell Elementary School's success is reflected in its popularity \nwithin the Duluth community. There are 127 students on a waiting list \nfor enrollment in Lowell, including children for future kindergarten \nenrollment. An English language learner program is housed in the \nbuilding, serving 33 to 38 students per year from 10 different \ncountries. A 21st Century Program, which involves a partnership between \nLowell and the YMCA, provides on-site daily mentoring and tutoring \nservices after school until 6:00 p.m., for pupils in grades K through \n5.\n  Parents further attest to Lowell's success. Joan Lancour states:\n\n       My child has attended Lowell for the past three years. \n     During this time, my child, Chris, has received extra help \n     from all staff that he never received at other schools. The \n     staff have helped him to gain confidence through the music \n     program . . . Over these past three years I have seen him \n     take strides to become an independent student through the \n     excellent training of Lowell staff and administrators.\n\n  Another mother, Sue Wright, adds:\n\n       We feel very fortunate to have the enrichment of music in \n     our children's education. The benefits of the extra music \n     opportunities have shown in their academic success. Lowell is \n     a positive school with very dedicated students, staff and \n     parents. It has been a wonderful place for my family to begin \n     a lifelong education.\n\n  Much of the credit for Lowell Elementary School's success belongs to \nits principal, Monte Wittman, and to the dedicated teachers. The pupils \nand staff at Lowell Elementary School understand that in order to be \nsuccessful a school must go beyond achieving academic success; it must \nalso provide a nurturing environment where students can develop the \nknowledge, skills, and attitudes for success throughout life. All of \nthe faculty, staff, and pupils at Lowell Elementary School should be \nvery proud of their accomplishments.\n  I congratulate Lowell Elementary School in Duluth for winning the \nAward for Excellence in Education and for its exceptional contributions \nto education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/24/senate-section/article/S8126-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IN RECOGNITION OF THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TUSCOLA COUNTY FAIR\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize \nthe Tuscola, Michigan County Fair as it celebrates its 125th \nanniversary. The Tuscola County Fair, in existence since 1881, \nshowcases the local agricultural community in addition to other \nattractions, is an important contributor to the local economy, and \nentertains thousands of fairgoers of all ages each year.\n  The fair, which first took place the year President Garfield was \nassassinated, generates more than $2 million of activity in the county. \nThe impetus to locate a fair in Caro, MI, was the desire of \nagricultural groups in the area to display their harvest, livestock, \nhome canning and baked goods, flowers and needlework, and of local \nmerchants and other industries to demonstrate new products and \nmachinery for the farm and home.\n  Over the years, the Tuscola County Fair has experienced several \nmilestones. The fair first showed a profit in 1891, and in 1892, a \nhalf-mile clay track was constructed. Interestingly, while the track \nwas intended for sulky races, in 1924, female jockeys raced Kentucky \nthoroughbreds every day of the fair. In 1896, a new Agricultural Hall \nwas constructed to showcase the agricultural industry. In addition, the \nFair Office, the oldest building still standing, was constructed in \n1917, and in 1920, the present ``Heritage Hall'' was constructed. \nDuring World War II, the fairgrounds were used to house German \nprisoners, who worked to help the local sugar industry that was so \nvital to our war effort. More recently, in 1981, the Historical Society \nof Michigan designated the fairgrounds a historical site.\n  Many people have contributed to the success of the Tuscola County \nFair, including Emery J. Vandemark, the longest serving board member, \nthe treasurer for 28 years, and the current 13-year President; the late \nJay Kitchen, past president; Walter Jackson, president of the fair \nboard and active 4-H member; James Fitzgerald, past president; Jerry \nVandemark, longtime fundraiser; and longtime members Waldo Garner, \nRobert Nowland, Walter Putnam, and Frank Altizer, among many others.\n  The fair organizers and the many dedicated volunteers over the years \nhave played an integral role in ensuring the success of the fair, and I \nknow my colleagues join me in recognizing and congratulating all those \nwho have contributed to the fair for their efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/24/senate-section/article/S8126-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8126-S8127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            WASHINGTON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, CLOQUET, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Washington \nElementary School, in Cloquet, MN, which recently earned an Award for \nExcellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements \nin educating children.\n  Washington Elementary School is truly a model of educational success. \nThe school's teachers and administrators are to be applauded for their \nleadership in helping children understand the harmful consequences of \nbullying other students. Its Bullying Prevention Program is one of the \nbest in the State.\n  The effort to address bullying at Washington Elementary began last \nyear, after students were surveyed about their thoughts and attitudes \ntoward a variety of school safety matters. Their responses to four key \nquestions were significant: 22 percent of all pupils reported having \nbeen bullied at least two to three times per month; 62 percent said \nthat when they see bullying they want to help, if only they knew what \nto do; children in grades 3 through 5 are the most often bullied; and \nthe three places where bullying most frequently occurs are on the \nplayground, in the lunchroom, and on the bus.\n  All licensed and nonlicensed staff at Washington Elementary received \ntraining using the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program. Staff learned \nwhat bullying is and how they can put an end to it. They learned how to \nteach students to recognize a bully and what steps to take when they \nencounter one. They learned that most bullying is not physical, but \nrather uses verbal taunts, and excludes and degrades the victim. \nChildren who are bullied have lower self-esteem, more absences, and \nmore anxiety, along with depression and thoughts of suicide.\n  The Bullying Prevention Program at Washington Elementary School has \nbecome a communitywide effort. Mailings were sent home to parents. \nLocal business leaders, the mayor, the police chief, the media, and \nother local dignitaries participated in a ``Kick-off Celebration'' held \nearlier this school year. The program's slogan is, ``Take a Bite Out of \nBullying''; the University of Minnesota--Duluth Bulldog serves as the \nprogram's mascot.\n  The school community is rightly proud of the results. Children are \ncoming to school feeling safer. Attendance\n\n[[Page S8127]]\n\nis up. And the school climate has improved. The Bullying Prevention \nProgram has been featured in local newspaper stories. High school \nstudents have come to Washington Elementary to perform skits on the \nbullying theme, and this May the CLIMB Theater group completed a 3-day \nresidency on bullying.\n  In addition, the school can take pride in its Minnesota Comprehensive \nAssessment test scores. Last year, the school received four-star \nratings in both reading and math from the Minnesota Department of \nEducation.\n  Much of the credit for Washington Elementary School's success belongs \nto its principal, Randy Thudin, and to the dedicated teachers. The \npupils and staff at Washington Elementary School understand that in \norder to be successful a school must go beyond achieving academic \nsuccess; it must also provide a nurturing environment where students \ncan develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes for success throughout \nlife. All of the faculty, staff, and pupils at Washington Elementary \nSchool should be very proud of their accomplishments.\n  I congratulate Washington Elementary School in Cloquet for winning \nthe Award for Excellence in Education and for its exceptional \ncontributions to education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/24/senate-section/article/S8127-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JACK MICHAELS\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Jack \nMichaels, a decorated veteran and a lifelong advocate for veterans and \ndisabled persons and their families all over the country. It has been \nmy sincere pleasure to work with him to forward these efforts and I \nwish him all the best in his retirement from his post as Executive \nDirector of the Northwest Paralyzed Veterans Association. His \nremarkable record of service reminds us all that one person's efforts \ncan improve the lives of many.\n  The effects of Jack's advocacy can be felt in many ways. Jack served \ncourageously as a Captain in the United States Army from 1966 to 1971 \nand was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, a Purple Heart, and \nother honors. After being shot down in combat and incurring a severe \nspinal cord injury, Jack realized his service to the United States was \nfar from over; rather, it was just beginning.\n  We see Jack's influence in our national civil rights legislation. \nDuring Jack's tenure as the National President of Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, he worked tirelessly to facilitate the passage of landmark \ncivil rights legislation, the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  We see Jack's influence in the Puget Sound area. He provides \nexpertise in accessibility and has served on public projects including \nSafeco Field, Seahawks Stadium, Benayora and McCaw Halls, and Seattle's \nnew City Hall and Regional Justice Center, just to name a few. His \nleadership enabled the Northwest Paralyzed Veterans Association to \nprovide expertise to enable Amtrak's Cascades to become the first fully \naccessible train in America. His continued efforts to make SeaTac \nInternational Airport more accessible for the disabled will result in a \nnew over-sized disabled passenger vehicle parking lot to be dedicated \nby Memorial Day this spring.\n  We see Jack's influence in Seattle's public transportation system. \nWhile working with the Washington Coalition for Citizens with \nDisabilities, of which he was a co-founder, and the Northwest Chapter \nParalyzed Veterans of America, which he founded, Jack advocated for a \ntotally accessible public transit system, which became a reality at \nKing's County METRO 20 years later.\n  We see Jack's influence in the lives of hundreds of disabled \nveterans, for whom he has delivered, often personally, adaptive \nequipment in a donation program he created that provides free \nwheelchairs and hospital beds to those in need.\n  Throughout his service and advocacy, Jack never forgot his brothers \nand sisters in arms, both past and present. Through his words and his \nworks, Jack constantly reminded American policymakers and citizens \nalike of the bravery, honor, and sacrifice military service entails. He \nreminded us of our national obligation to take care of our veteran \npopulation and to create a system with the capacity to provide for \nfuture veterans. He reminds us that the absolute least we can do to \nthank the courageous men and women who put their lives in jeopardy \nevery day to protect our rights is provide for them and their families \nwhen their service is complete. With the aging Vietnam and Korean war \nveteran population and ever growing number of Iraq veterans returning \nhome, it is on all of us to continue Jack's work for veterans and never \nto forget the example he set.\n  You might notice the frequent use of a single word throughout this \nrecounting of Jack's military and civilian experience: served. Jack \ndedicated his life to service, first when he volunteered for the Army, \nthen in countless other volunteer and advocacy endeavors. He gave his \ntime and expertise in exchange for the satisfaction of effecting change \nand improving the lives of others, many of whom he may never meet. \nRather than react with anger or despair to his harrowing combat injury, \nJack treated it as a call to action. Jack's work has given opportunity \nto thousands of veterans and disabled Americans and left a legacy of \nservice that will continue to touch lives for decades to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/24/senate-section/article/S8127-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WEBSTER, SOUTH DAKOTA, CELEBRATES 125TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 100 Pitcher Street in Utica, New York, as the \n``Captain George A. Wood Post Office Building''; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce legislation \nwhich would designate the facility of the U.S. Postal Service located \nat 100 Pitcher Street in Utica, NY, as the Captain George A. Wood Post \nOffice Building.\n  CAPT George A. Wood bravely served our Nation in Iraq before his \ntragic death on November 20, 2003.\n  Captain Wood was born and raised in Utica, NY, in the heart of the \nMohawk Valley. As a student at Notre Dame Junior-Senior High School, \nWood excelled both in the classroom and on the athletic field, where he \nparticipated in football and track and field.\n  Upon graduation from high school, Wood attended Cornell University. \nHe played on the university's football team, but focused most of his \nattention on his academics, particularly his history coursework. After \nearning his bachelor's degree in 1993, Wood continued in his academic \npursuits, earning master's degrees at SUNY-Albany and SUNY-Cortland.\n  Wood's interest in history continued after he entered the U.S. Army. \nAs a captain in the 4th Infantry Division, Wood's responsibilities \nincluded leading a tank unit in Iraq. He told his wife that his \nexperience leading troops would someday help him prepare for a \ndoctorate in military history.\n  Captain Wood hoped to teach history and coach football at the U.S. \nMilitary Academy at West Point, NY. Unfortunately, his untimely death \nwill prevent this dream from becoming a reality. However, we can honor \nthis great American for the sacrifice he made defending the freedoms we \nall enjoy.\n  Captain Wood's father and grandfather both worked at the Pitcher \nStreet Post Office in Utica, NY, and it would be a fitting honor to \ndesignate this facility in tribute to CAPT George A. Wood.\n  I ask that the Senate come together and honor this brave American \nhero for his service to our Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3716\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CAPTAIN GEORGE A.

Mr. President, I would like to announce for the \ninformation of the Senate and the public that the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs will hold a hearing entitled ``Offshore \nAbuses: The Enablers, The Tools & Offshore Secrecy.''\n  The Subcommittee has held a number of hearings addressing the issue \nof tax havens and offshore abuses which are undermining the integrity \nof the Federal tax system, diverting tens of billions of dollars each \nyear from the U.S. Treasury, and undermining U.S. law enforcement. \nHearings held in 2001 examined the historic and ongoing lack of \ncooperation by some offshore tax havens with international tax \nenforcement efforts and their resistance to divulging information \nneeded to detect, stop, and prosecute U.S. tax evasion. A hearing held \nin December 2002 and report issued in January 2003 provided an in-depth \nexamination of an abusive tax shelter used by Enron. Two days of \nhearings in November 2003, and a bipartisan report issued in 2005, \nprovide an inside look at how some respected accounting firms, banks, \ninvestment advisors, and lawyers have become engines pushing the \ndesign, sale, and implementation of abusive tax shelters to \ncorporations and individuals across the country.\n  The subcommittee's upcoming August 1 hearings will present case \nhistories on the use of offshore trusts and corporations to circumvent \nU.S. tax, securities and anti-money laundering laws. Witnesses for the \nupcoming hearing will be securities firms, banks, law firms, U.S. \ntaxpayers, a trust protector, and tax and securities experts.\n  The subcommittee hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, August 1, 2006, at \n9 a.m. in room 342 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. For further \ninformation, please contact Raymond V. Shepherd III, staff director and \nchief counsel to the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, at 224-\n3721.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/24/senate-section/article/S8134-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8134-S8135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nENHANCING ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES--MOTION \n                               TO PROCEED\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States-India Energy \n     Security Cooperation Act of [2005] 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The December 2004 National Intelligence Council report \n     entitled ``Mapping the Global Future in 2020'' states that \n     the single most important factor affecting the demand for \n     energy will be global economic growth, especially that of \n     China and India. It is estimated that the current economic \n     growth rate in India is approximately 7 percent of gross \n     domestic product. India will need to double its energy \n     consumption within the next 15 years to maintain steady rates \n     of economic growth.\n       (2) The United States and India launched an energy dialogue \n     on May 31, 2005, aimed at building upon a broad range of \n     existing energy cooperation and developing new avenues of \n     collaboration on energy. These efforts will promote increased \n     trade and investment in the energy sector by utilizing \n     resources in the public and private sectors, focusing on oil \n     and gas, power and energy efficiency, new technologies and \n     renewable energy, coal and clean coal technology, and civil \n     nuclear cooperation. In his testimony before the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations of the Senate on July 26, 2005, Under \n     Secretary of Energy David Garman said, ``The United States \n     and India recognize their mutual interests are best served by \n     working together in a collaborative fashion to ensure \n     stability in global energy markets.''.\n       (3) As the sixth largest energy consumer in the world, \n     India satisfies 70 percent of its oil demand with imports and \n     has embarked on an aggressive oil and gas exploration \n     program. The largest discovery of natural gas in the world in \n     2002 occurred in India. In 2003, the largest discovery of oil \n     in the world occurred in the state of Rajasthan in India. \n     External funding and investment in the oil and gas industry \n     in India is necessary to maximize recovery from oil fields, \n     but an improved investment environment in India is needed to \n     attract such investment.\n       (4) India is the world's third largest producer of coal and \n     will continue to rely on coal as a major energy source to \n     support expanding industrial and electric power generation \n     needs. However, many of India's coal-fired plants are \n     inefficient and lack adequate pollution control equipment. In \n     his address to a joint session of the United States Congress \n     on July 19, 2005, Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh \n     noted the importance of allowing greater access for \n     developing countries to clean coal technologies and of \n     exploring partnerships that encourage more efficient use of \n     hydrocarbon resources.\n       (5) India provides a market for United States technologies \n     that promote the clean and efficient use of energy.\n       (6) India has announced plans to develop a 5,000,000 ton \n     strategic crude oil reserve, which is expected to be \n     completed by 2009.\n       (7) United States energy experts have emphasized the need \n     for the United States to increase collaboration with other \n     countries--\n       (A) to develop and deploy energy technologies that will not \n     be pursued absent greater Federal support;\n       (B) to increase investment in cooperative international \n     energy research; and\n       (C) to expand the global network of strategic petroleum \n     reserves.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to cooperate with India to address common energy \n     challenges, to ensure future global energy security, and to \n     increase the world-wide availability of clean energy;\n       (2) to promote dialogue and increased understanding between \n     the United States and India on our respective national energy \n     policies and strategies as an integral part of the expanding \n     strategic partnership between the two countries; and\n       (3) to collaborate with India in energy research that \n     fosters market-based approaches to energy security and offers \n     the promise of technological breakthroughs that reduce oil \n     dependency globally.\n\n     SEC. 4. ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT ENERGY COOPERATION.\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The President is authorized to \n     establish programs in support of greater energy cooperation \n     between the United States and India.\n       (b) Activities.--Assistance may be provided under this \n     section for cooperation related to--\n       (1) research, development, and deployment of clean coal and \n     emission reduction technologies and carbon sequestration \n     projects;\n       (2) research, development, and deployment of alternative \n     fuel sources, such as ethanol, bio-mass, and coal-based \n     fuels[, and hydrogen];\n       (3) research, development, and deployment of energy \n     efficiency projects;\n       (4) research related to commercially available technologies \n     that promote the clean and efficient use of energy in India; \n     and\n       (5) technical assistance in support of the development by \n     the Government of India of a strategic oil reserve to allow \n     India to cope with short-term disruptions to global oil \n     supplies without causing shocks to India's market or the \n     global market.\n\n     SEC. 5. REPORT ON ENERGY COOPERATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall, in \n     coordination with the Secretary of Energy, submit to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Energy and Commerce and the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives a report on energy \n     security cooperation between the United States and India.\n       (b) Content.--The report required under subsection (a) \n     shall describe--\n       (1) the ways in which the United States and India have \n     cooperated on energy research and development activities;\n       (2) joint projects that have been initiated using \n     assistance authorized under section 4, and the contribution \n     such assistance has made to improving global energy security; \n     and\n       (3) plans for future energy cooperation and joint projects \n     between the United States and India.\n\n\n[[Page S8136]]\n\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
