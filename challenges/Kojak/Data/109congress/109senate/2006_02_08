Mr. President, as of this morning, 2,262 American soldiers \nhave died in Iraq and 17,000, 18,000 have been injured, wounded; over \n16,000 have been wounded so seriously that they could not return to \nbattle. Each of these deaths and every one of these individuals who \nhave been wounded, many of whom have been maimed, is a national \ntragedy. Yesterday, I was speaking to one of my friends with whom I \ncame to Washington in 1982. We keep in touch with each other. He now \nlives in Santa Rosa, CA. He said, ``Harry, you know, we just lost our \nsixth soldier in this little community.''\n  I have attended funerals of Nevada servicemen who have been killed. I \nwant to make sure we do everything we can so that fewer of our loyal, \npatriotic men and women are not killed in Iraq. I want to make sure \nthey have all the equipment--anything they need.\n  As we speak, there are other tragedies in America, one of which deals \nwith the legislation that is on the floor today. This year, 2006, \n10,000 people will die from asbestos-related diseases. That is the case \nevery year. These people did nothing wrong. They were simply exposed to \na substance that corporate America knew would make them sick and cause \nthem to die. But because of corporate America's willingness to exchange \nthe lives of these men and women, they went ahead and did this. People \nwere exposed to this at work, at home by hugging their father or \nhusband when he came home from work, or in a schoolyard where asbestos \nequipment was, in their neighborhoods, in trucks hauling this substance \nall over America, and people got sick. They die painful, slow, horrible \ndeaths. So there is a debate going on today dealing with asbestos.\n  This is not a fair bill. Look, I believe we need legislation to \ncompensate the victims, but this is not it. I have said--and I don't \nhave the experience in the legislature of the President pro tempore, \nbut I have been in legislative bodies a long time; more than 30 years I \nhave served in legislatures. This is the worst piece of legislation I \nhave ever seen in the 30-plus years I have been serving in \nlegislatures.\n  I don't doubt how hard Senator Specter has worked and how badly he \nwants this done, but that doesn't make the legislation good; it is bad. \nPerhaps because he has tried so hard, he doesn't see the trees for the \nforest, as they say.\n  To show the strength of corporate America, 13 companies that will \nbenefit greatly from this legislation have paid lobbyists, within a 2-\nyear period of time, $144.5 million. That should send a message to \neveryone. This legislation is not good for asbestos victims. It\n\n[[Page S782]]\n\nstrips victims of their legal right to obtain compensation in the court \nsystem and puts them in an administrative trust fund that is \nunderfunded and doomed to fail. That is why all the leading asbestos \nvictims organizations oppose this bill.\n  Here is a letter from the Asbestos Victims Group United, dated \nFebruary 1, 2006, written to me and to Senator Frist. I will read parts \nof it:\n\n       We represent a diverse group of national asbestos victims' \n     groups. We are writing this letter as a matter of urgency to \n     ask Members to vote against S. 852. This legislation is not \n     primarily intended, nor is it good, for victims. In fact, in \n     its current form, the legislation would make recovery of \n     compensation dramatically worse for victims. It would deny \n     whole classes of cancer-ridden victims, who, today, are able \n     to recover compensation for their injuries, any ability to be \n     compensated.\n        . . . We oppose this legislation. We do not want this \n     proposed government policy forced upon us. We believe the \n     program will fail to treat victims fairly, while benefiting \n     the very companies that caused the problem. We have said it \n     before and now we say it louder.\n        . . . We have said it before and now we say it louder: We \n     believe it would be wholly irresponsible for Congress to \n     proceed with consideration and passage of this legislation. \n     Please do not allow the families who already have lost so \n     much to be victimized once again.\n\n  The first signatory on this letter is Susan Vento, the wife of a man \nI served in Congress with, who never worked around asbestos--or so he \nthought. But he did work around it as a young man during a summer job \nwhile in school, and he got this disease. He was a big, strong man who \nworked out in the gym every day, and he died within a year, a slow, \nagonizing death. So the first signatory on this letter is Susan Vento, \nChairperson, Committee to Protect Mesothelioma Victims.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Asbestos Victims Groups United,\n\n                                                 February 1, 2006.\n     Hon. William Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leaders Frist and Reid: We represent a diverse group \n     of national asbestos victims' groups. We are writing this \n     letter as a matter of urgency to ask Members to vote against \n     S. 852. This legislation is not primarily intended, nor is it \n     good, for victims. In fact, in its current form, the \n     legislation would make recovery of compensation dramatically \n     worse for victims. It would deny whole classes of cancer-\n     ridden victims, who, today, are able to recover compensation \n     for their injuries, any ability to be compensated.\n       If we have not made our position clear in our previous \n     letters, we would like to make it very clear here: We oppose \n     this legislation. We do not want this proposed government \n     policy forced upon us. We believe the program will fail to \n     treat victims fairly, while benefiting the very companies \n     that caused the problem. We may not have the power of these \n     corporations, but we have a voice, and we intend to use our \n     voice to its maximum volume to defeat this bill.\n       And, if it passes, we plan to use our voice to inform the \n     American people in every state and every district of this \n     tragic fate of justice and to urge every victim to demand \n     their right of compensation from the federal government.\n       We have listed below the specific substantive reasons we \n     oppose S. 852:\n       It removes the fundamental right to a trial by jury and \n     replaces it with an untried and unsound entitlement program \n     that, we believe, is set to fail on day one.\n       Victims will face long delays in receiving compensation \n     while the fund is set up and the bill is challenged on \n     constitutional grounds. Many victims, especially those with \n     mesothelioma, will die during that time period.\n       $140 billion is too low and has been, at best, deemed a \n     questionable minimum by the CBO. For the victim, this means \n     the fund could leave them empty-handed. (For the taxpayer, it \n     could mean excessive Federal borrowing).\n       Thousands of victims will fail to qualify because of newer \n     more restrictive legal and medical standards--this is not a \n     ``no-fault'' system. Despite not being allowed into the \n     system, victims will likely be locked out of the trial \n     system.\n       The bill excludes thousands who worked at, or lived near, \n     hundreds of addresses around the country where Libby \n     vermiculite was shipped.\n       The bill is structured to make it nearly impossible for \n     victims who were exposed to asbestos in their own homes, and \n     who did not live with an asbestos worker, to prove their \n     exposure and eligibility for compensation. Assurances that \n     these people will be taken care of via the ``medical \n     exceptions panel'' are false promises given thousands would \n     fall into this category and the fund will not be able to \n     handle that many cases.\n       Trust funds have a dismal history: most have failed, all \n     have been bogged down at the start-up and all have \n     underestimated the amount of claims by large margins, as was \n     shown in the recent GAO Report: Federal Compensation \n     Programs.\n       Future victims of asbestos exposure, notably those exposed \n     during 9/11 and Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, will receive no \n     compensation and have no access to the court system.\n       Many asbestos victims with lung cancer, particularly \n     smokers, are excluded despite the medical consensus that \n     people with heavy asbestos exposure are at a substantially \n     increased risk of cancer.\n       There is no automatic sunset provision--if the fund is not \n     paying claims, victims must be able to gain access back into \n     the courts without relying on the administrator's discretion.\n       The bill does not account for those who may have been \n     exposed to naturally occurring asbestos.\n       Before allowing this legislation to move to the floor, \n     please consider these questions:\n       Will the proposed funding be sufficient to compensate all \n     victims?\n       How many victims will be left out from being compensated \n     for asbestos injuries?\n       How much will the fund be forced to borrow from the federal \n     government?\n       How many companies will contribute and how much will each \n     be assessed?\n       Can the bill, if enacted, withstand the numerous legal and \n     constitutional challenges already threatened by a wide range \n     of parties?\n       We have said it before and now we say it louder: We believe \n     it would be wholly irresponsible for Congress to proceed with \n     consideration and passage of this legislation. Please do not \n     allow the families who already have lost so much to be \n     victimized once again.\n           Sincerely,\n       Susan Vento, Chairperson, Committee to Protect Mesothelioma \n     Victims, Washington, DC.\n       Linda Reinstein, Co-Founder and Executive Director, \n     Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization, Redondo Beach, CA.\n       Michael Bowker, Founder and Executive Director, Asbestos \n     Victims Organization; Author, Fatal Deception: The Untold \n     Story of Asbestos: Why It Is Still Legal and Why It Is Still \n     Killing Us, Placerville, CA.\n       Jim Fite, National Secretary, White Lung Association, \n     Baltimore, MD.\n       Barbara Zeluck, Secretary, White Lung Asbestos Information \n     Center, New York, NY.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had placed in the Record yesterday one of \nthe petitions. We have 150,000 signatures on that--150,000 signatures \nhere in the Capitol in boxes. We debate this bill. There is a lot of \ntechnical talk about startups, sunsets, and payment tiers. But let's \nnot lose sight of what this debate is about. It is about whether the \nSenate will keep faith with the victims of a disease which they had no \nopportunity to avoid.\n  The problem in America today, as it relates to what is going on on \nthe Senate floor, is not a crisis created by the legal system; it is a \ncrisis created by the people who expose these people to asbestos. If \nthere were ever a cry for fairness and equity and justice, it is this. \nWe cannot let corporate America do what they are trying to do to these \ninnocent men and women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/08/senate-section/article/S782-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, several weeks ago, after a highly \nclassified program was leaked to the media, the President described \ncertain activities of the National Security Agency that he authorized \nin the weeks following our Nation coming under direct attack on our own \nsoil by Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida terrorists.\n  As described by the President, the Vice President, the Attorney \nGeneral, and experts from the Department of Justice and the \nintelligence community, the terrorist surveillance program at NSA \ntargets very specific\n\n[[Page S783]]\n\ninternational communications of suspected and known al-Qaida operatives \nin a foreign country who are communicating with associates around the \nworld and, occasionally, in a limited way, with individuals inside the \nUnited States. The purpose of the program is to collect foreign \nintelligence in an effort to identify and prevent another devastating \nattack on our homeland.\n  As we have learned, the terrorist surveillance program is designed \nwith the goal of preventing terrorist attacks in the United States and \nprotecting the lives of Americans. Given the imperative to reliably and \nimmediately detect and disrupt the plots of international terrorists \nwho are intent on killing Americans, the President is acting well \nwithin his constitutional authorities.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has been, and continues to \nbe, a valuable tool in protecting our national security interests in \nmany cases. However, the world changed on September 11, 2001, \ndemonstrating the importance that the President have the power and \nauthority to protect the American people from future attacks of \nterrorism. Both the Constitution and the Congress grant the President \nthat authority. FISA lacks the speed and agility necessary to fight the \nwar on terror, and its bureaucratic requirements prevent the ``hot \npursuit'' of international communications necessary to prevent attacks.\n  As vitally important as it is to protect American lives, it is also \nimportant that Americans' rights are protected. That is exactly why the \nadministration has put in place a system of responsible measures to \nensure our civil liberties are also protected. In doing so, \ncongressional leaders from both parties have been kept informed about \nthe program from the start. Furthermore, this program is reauthorized \napproximately every 45 days to ensure it is still necessary, and that \nit is being used properly, and the activities conducted within this \nprogram are thoroughly reviewed by lawyers within the National Security \nAgency and the Department of Justice to ensure the program is only \ncollecting the international communications of suspected terrorists \nhere in the United States and elsewhere.\n  Their oversight includes assuring an aggressive program is in place \nto assist the highly trained intelligence professionals at NSA verify \nthat all activities are consistent with minimization procedures that \nweed out the identities of ordinary Americans and preserve civil \nliberties.\n  I note that FISA, which has been the alternative that the critics of \nthis program have looked to as the real program that should be used, \nrequires a reauthorization every 90 days. Here the President and the \nadministration have taken an additional precaution to protect the \nprivacy rights of Americans by reauthorizing this program approximately \nevery 45 days.\n  On September 11, 2001, terrorists operating covertly inside the \nUnited States, and in contact with al-Qaida members overseas, \nperpetrated the worst attack on domestic soil in American history. \nOsama bin Laden recently reiterated publicly al-Qaida's intention to \nattack us again with operatives hiding within our borders.\n  Congress identified al-Qaida as an enemy of this country by passing \nthe authorization for the use of force, authorizing the President to \nuse all necessary and appropriate force to protect our homeland.\n  When the enemy is behind your lines, you must use every lawful tool \nat your disposal to find and stop them. That is why the President has \nauthorized the terrorist surveillance program.\n  As the 9/11 Commission pointed out, and as also the joint House-\nSenate Intelligence Committee investigation, as well as the report from \nthe Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security in the House, which \nwas filed in July of 2002, reported, two of the terrorist hijackers who \nflew a jet into the Pentagon, Nawaf al Hamzi and Khalid al Mihdhar, \nwere communicating with members of al-Qaida overseas while they were \ninside the United States preparing for the deadly attack of September \n11.\n  Regrettably, we did not know this until it was too late. GEN Mike \nHayden, the former Director of the National Security Agency and the \nDeputy Director of National Intelligence, indicated that had this \nprogram been in place before 9/11, these terrorists could have been \ndetected and identified.\n  Unfortunately, as a result of the public disclosure of this highly \nclassified program, our enemies have learned information they should \nnot have. Our national security has been damaged and Americans have \nbeen put at greater risk.\n  In our recent Intelligence Committee open hearing, CIA Director \nPorter Goss commented that as a consequence of leaks in general, damage \nhas been very severe to our capabilities to carry out our mission. \nGeneral Hayden observed that our intelligence capabilities are not \nimmune to leaks in the public domain.\n  It is clear that this is an important program necessary to address \nthe previous flaws in our early warning system that allowed at least \ntwo of the 9/11 murderers to live among us while they plotted our \ndestruction. This vital program makes it more likely that terrorists \nwill be identified and located in time to prevent another disaster. In \nfact, that may have already happened. It is a program that is conducted \nwithin the President's constitutional authority and is subject to \nreview and oversight.\n  It is also clear that continued leaks over this program are degrading \nour ability to continue to protect the lives of Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/08/senate-section/article/S783-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S783-S784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEFENSE OF NSA TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today America is at war. We were \nawakened to this war on September 11, 2001, even though our enemies had \nbeen waging it against us for a number of years. The enemy, of course, \nis al-Qaida, a treacherous terrorist group whose goal is simply to kill \nas many Americans as possible and to strike such fear into civilized \nnations that freedom itself is forced into retreat.\n  To combat this deadly threat, the President has rightly--rightly--\nasserted his constitutional authority to use every tool at his disposal \nto fight the war on terror. One of those tools is the NSA's terrorist \nsurveillance program.\n  Yet despite the grave terrorist threat, I fear too many have \nforgotten that we are, indeed, a nation at war, and so have forgotten \nthe vital need for the terrorist surveillance program. Perhaps it is \nbecause we have not seen another attack on American soil since \nSeptember 11, despite, I might add, the terrorists' best efforts.\n  But there can be no doubt that al-Qaida terrorists are still plotting \nbrutal attacks against this country and other freedom-loving countries. \nFor proof of this, look no further than a recent audiotape made by \nOsama bin Laden himself. In a tape aired on Al-Jazeera television last \nmonth, bin Laden said this:\n\n       The mujahadeen, with God's grace, have managed repeatedly \n     to penetrate all security measures adopted by the unjust \n     allied countries. The proof of that is the explosions you \n     have seen in the capitals of the European nations who are in \n     this aggressive coalition.\n\n  He went on:\n\n       Similar operations happening in America. . . . are under \n     preparation, and you will see them in your homes the minute \n     they are through.\n\n  A not-so-veiled threat for another attack here at home. It couldn't \nbe any clearer than that: ``Similar operations,'' so Osama bin Laden \nsaid, ``are under preparation, and you will see them in your homes the \nminute they are through.''\n  At this very moment, al-Qaida operatives in America, right here at \nhome--madmen such as Mohamed Atta--may be plotting attacks. What kinds \nof attacks could they be hatching? Here is one example.\n  In 2003, authorities apprehended a man named Iyman Faris for \nassisting al-Qaida in plotting and planning a terrorist attack. Faris \nis an American citizen. He lived in Ohio before being taken into \nFederal custody.\n  In 2002, Faris traveled to Pakistan where he met with known members \nof al-Qaida. The terrorists told him they were planning attacks in New \nYork and here in Washington, and asked if he would help.\n\n[[Page S784]]\n\n  So Faris elected to return to America, visit New York City, and \nreconnoiter the Brooklyn Bridge with the intent of finding the best \nmeans to destroy it. He even went so far as to research how to sever \nthe cables supporting the bridge. Approximately 135,000 vehicles cross \nthe Brooklyn Bridge every day.\n  According to the Washington Post, Government officials have privately \ncredited Faris's arrest to the President's terrorist surveillance \nprogram. Faris has since pleaded guilty to having plotted to destroy \nthe Brooklyn Bridge, a direct result of the terrorism surveillance \nprogram.\n  This time the terrorists did not succeed, but as we all know, while \nour goal is to stop them every time, their goal is to succeed just \nonce.\n  Let me repeat that. We have to stop them every time. They only have \nto succeed once.\n  To uncover and disrupt attacks such as this, the President must \naggressively use every tool at his disposal to exercise his authority \nunder the Constitution to protect America. To do any less would be a \ndereliction of duty.\n\n  A major part of the war on terror is the terrorist surveillance \nprogram. This very narrowly tailored program intercepts international \ncommunications--not domestic, even though that word has been used a lot \nin error--international communications by members of al-Qaida or other \nsuspected terrorist groups outside America into this country, or by \nthose terrorists' allies in this country out to terrorists in foreign \nlands. So the universe is international communications. Public \nmischaracterizations have portrayed this terrorist surveillance program \nas something ominous, as if the Government is listening in to domestic \nphone calls made by average, law-abiding Americans. That is flat out \nwrong, and those mischaracterizations ought to cease.\n  If someone is calling from Tora Bora, they are not calling to order a \npizza. Let me repeat: If someone is calling from Tora Bora, they are \nnot calling to order a pizza.\n  The NSA is only interested in al-Qaida sleeper agents in the United \nStates, men such as Iyman Faris, the Brooklyn Bridge bomber, who call \nor receive calls from known agents of al-Qaida or affiliated terrorist \ngroups abroad with instructions for their next deadly mission.\n  The NSA terrorist surveillance program is not only entirely \nnecessary, it is entirely lawful. The President enjoys broad authority \nunder the Constitution to protect all Americans. And the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court of Review, the court charged with \nreviewing the legality of measures such as the terrorism surveillance \nprogram, has confirmed that the President has broad powers with respect \nto foreign intelligence gathering.\n  The court wrote in 2002 that, with respect to conducting searches \nwithout warrants in order to obtain foreign intelligence information:\n\n       We take for granted that the President does have that \n     authority, and, assuming that is so, FISA could not encroach \n     upon the President's constitutional power.\n\n  That could not be more clear. That is the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court of Review saying:\n\n       We take for granted that the President does have that \n     authority, and, assuming that is so, FISA could not encroach \n     upon the President's constitutional power.\n\n  If that is not enough legal authority, here is more. Congress \ndelegated broad war powers to the President when it authorized the war \non terror in 2001. The Senate passed that authorization 98 to 0 with \nthe support of many of the same Democrats who vehemently speak against \nthe program today.\n  That authorization empowered the President to ``use all necessary and \nappropriate force'' to fight terror. It did not say ``some force.'' It \ndid not say ``all force except when it comes to international \ncommunications intercepts.'' It did not even say ``all force now, less \nlater, depending on the political landscape.'' It said ``all force,'' \nand ``all force'' means ``all force.''\n  However, opponents of the terrorism surveillance program apparently \ndo not want to allow the President to use all the force at his disposal \nto fight terror. Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic Party, \nrecently expressed his strong disapproval, and this is how he put it:\n\n       President Bush's secret program to spy on the American \n     people reminds Americans of the abuse of power during the \n     days of President Nixon and Vice President Agnew.\n\n  That is Howard Dean's appraisal of the terrorism surveillance \nprogram. That is from the leader of the Democratic Party. Obviously, he \ncompletely misses the point.\n  The terrorist surveillance program intercepts calls between known al-\nQaida terrorists and their affiliates overseas and the al-Qaida \nterrorist accomplices here in America. As the President has said, if \nyou are calling al-Qaida, we want to know why.\n  The only conclusion one can draw from statements such as Governor \nDean's--statements that explicitly compare programs that stop \nterrorists who want to destroy the Brooklyn Bridge to illegal activity \nfrom a generation ago--is that he opposes the program and wants it \nstopped.\n  We cannot fight the war on terror with one hand tied behind our \nbacks. That is exactly the wrong direction we need to take in the war \non terror. After more than 4 years since the devastating attack of \nSeptember 11, this is still a hard-fought battle. Al-Qaida's leader, \nOsama bin Laden himself, has bragged--has bragged--about impending \nattacks.\n  If anyone doubts the death-crazed tenacity of our enemies, let them \nhear these words, also from the bin Laden audiotape I quoted from \nearlier. Here is what he had to say further:\n\n       We will seek revenge all our lives. The nights and days \n     will not pass without us taking vengeance, like on September \n     11, God permitting. Your minds will be troubled and your \n     lives embittered.\n\n  Clearly our enemy is cunning and our enemy is cruel. We must be \naggressive about using every tool at our disposal to fight the war on \nterror.\n  I applaud the President for doing just that, and for remaining \nunbowed in the face of loud criticism from a few as he continues to \ncarry out his duty to protect America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/08/senate-section/article/S784-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S784-S785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE PRESIDENT'S INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I want to take just a moment to say a few \nwords in support of the President's intelligence program and associate \nmyself with the comments that have been made both by the Senator from \nGeorgia as well as the Senator from Kentucky. They focused a lot on the \nlegal arguments, but I thought perhaps I would approach this from what \nis best for the security of this country and how the American people \nare reacting to the President's intelligence program. I will have to \nbase my observations on town meetings I have recently held in Colorado. \nI had several town meetings. I think they help me better understand the \nissues of importance to my constituents, and I think my constituents in \nColorado are a cross-section, pretty much, of the United States.\n  Interestingly enough, the top issues facing most Coloradans at those \ntown meetings had to do with the war in Iraq, whether we should be in \nthe conflict or not; the Federal deficit--we had a lot of discussion \nabout getting the debt in order, getting the deficit in order--and \nobviously, because we are a cold weather State, there was a lot of talk \nabout the cost of energy and our continued reliance on foreign energy \nresources.\n  The National Security Agency surveillance program was not a top \nissue. Indeed, it was hardly mentioned. This tells me a couple of \nthings. First, it tells me that Coloradans are not particularly alarmed \nby the use of those tools that seem to be used by the President which \nare creating so much objection from the other side of the aisle. I \nthink most Coloradans view this as just a commonsense thing. They know \nit is important to national security and we have to conduct such a \nprogram. They understand that we need to protect this country. I think \nthey understand this Nation is at war. It is at war with terrorism. And \nI think they are beginning to understand, as I am beginning to \nunderstand, that this didn't start with 9/11, it started in the 1990s--\nmaybe even as far back as 1979 when we began to have terrorist attacks \non embassies and ships and\n\n[[Page S785]]\n\nplanes and various symbols of prosperity in the Western World. \nUnfortunately, it took a devastating attack such as 9/11 for us to \nreally begin to realize that this war is a war to the finish.\n  In the 9/11 attack there were more people killed than at Pearl \nHarbor. This was a serious assault on America. It was an attack on \nAmerica. We began to realize that al-Qaida is not interested in talking \nabout peace. As a group of extremists, they are not interested in \nconducting diplomatic relations. They don't want to compromise. They \nare fanatics who only want to kill, maim, and destroy.\n  Al-Qaida is a very sophisticated enemy that operates in dozens of \ncountries, including the United States. They have global reach, as seen \nby their bombings in London, Madrid, and Jordan. This organization \nworks clandestinely, in the shadows, and is very hard to track much \nless to stop. Most Americans realize that. We have been fortunate that \nwe have not been attacked again since September 11. We all know those \nattacks could come at any time, but that does not make these attacks \ninevitable. These terrorists can be stopped. We have the tools at our \ndisposal that we can and must use to defeat al-Qaida. The President's \nuse of the National Security Agency program has to be one of those.\n  Let's be clear. The President promised after September 11 that he \nwould direct every resource at his command--whether it is diplomatic, \nintelligence, or military tools--to disrupt and defeat the global \nnetwork of terror. Americans all over stood up and praised him for \nstepping forward. The media praised him for stepping forward because we \nall realized this was unprecedented in American history, and it could \nnot be ignored. It had to be addressed immediately.\n  The terrorist surveillance program is a very important tool in that \neffort. The program is narrowly focused. It only targets communications \nwhen one party is outside the United States and the reasonable \ninformation suggests that at least one party is a member of al-Qaida or \nan affiliated terrorist group. This program is not being used to listen \nin on communications of innocent Americans. Those people who want to \nput a slant against this program, they call it a domestic program. It \nis not a domestic spy program. It is an extension of our information \ngathering outside the borders of the United States. It just so happens \nthat we have people in the United States who have aligned themselves \nwith those terrorist groups to harm American citizens.\n  I think most Americans understand that if they want to have a secure \nhome, if they want to have security for their families, these \nindividuals have to be followed and we have to do what we can to \nprevent these catastrophic, terrorist-driven events from occurring.\n  The President takes full responsibility for moving forward. He even \nmentioned it in his State of the Union Address. But he has done it in a \nresponsible way. He has followed the reauthorization process every 45 \ndays to ensure that innocent Americans are not being targeted and that \nthe program is working successfully. Republican and Democratic leaders \nof the Congress have been briefed on this program more than a dozen \ntimes since 2001, and no Member of Congress, Republican or Democrat, \nexpressed any concern about this program until it was reported publicly \nin the press last December.\n\n  Here is a problem that this brings up: so many times reports about \nthese intelligence programs, when they come out in the press, are \nwrong. I have served on the Intelligence Committee. I have taken the \nopportunity to be briefed on these intelligence programs. But most of \nwhat shows up in the press out there is wrong. Those of us who really \nknow the story and would respond cannot respond because in the process \nof response you may actually validate the fact that it is an \nintelligence program--which you don't want al-Qaida or the terrorists \nto know. And the other thing is, if you respond to those accusations \nthat are made in those news articles that are wrong, you have to bring \nout the facts which just fully discloses what our intelligence program \nis. With full disclosure, then you tip off the terrorists as to what we \nare up to.\n  I think it has been reported time and time again in the testimony \nbefore our committees that it is hurting our intelligence program. We \nare not gathering the information that we were gathering before \nbecause, in effect, the terrorists have simply shut down because they \nhave realized what has happened and what our capabilities are in \ngathering this intelligence. At times, with disclosure of some of these \nintelligence programs, we have actually had Americans who are in the \nprocess of collecting information die as a result--perhaps individuals \noverseas who are acting on behalf of the United States.\n  We need to protect this tool because we all know that the enemy \nlistens. They have not stopped their intelligence gathering and would \nlove nothing better than for us to begin a discussion about the \noperational aspects of these sensitive programs. Compounding this \ndifficulty is the fact that many of the press reports, according to \nAttorney General Gonzales, have in almost every case--and he confirms \nwhat I just said--been misinformed, inaccurate, or just outright wrong.\n  I support the President. I believe it is a responsible tool to use in \nthe war against terrorism. If we do not use it, we are going to lose \nour ability to secure the homes of Americans. I think most Americans \nunderstand that. We must use these tools provided by law to combat our \ncontinued threat. We cannot sit and hope that terrorists will not \nattack us again.\n  We should not play into the hands of the terrorists. We now see the \ndanger in front of us. We see what must be done. We simply must go out \nand do it and do it in a responsible way. The President's intelligence-\ngathering program is effective and it is responsible to support him if \nwe want to have security for our families and our homes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the time has come to put our money into \naction and expand educational opportunities in science, math, and \nforeign languages.\n  I began my professional career as an educator. Fighting to ensure a \nprosperous future for our country and for Hawaii's children is why I am \nin Congress today. I hope this year we will see real progress by the \nenactment of legislation to make a real difference, for both the short- \nand long-term, in science, math, and foreign language education.\n  I applaud President Bush's call in his State of the Union Address for \nincreasing the number of teachers in math and science and making \ncollege-level courses more available to low income high school \nstudents. It is unfortunate that the budget reconciliation bill \nrecently passed by the House cut $12 billion from the Federal student \nloan program, while the tax reconciliation bill we considered last week \nprovides $70 billion in tax cuts for the wealthy. I know I am not alone \nwhen I say supporting college level courses in high school is no \nsubstitute for going to college. We need both and more of each.\n  Robbing Peter to pay Paul robs our youth of their future.\n  We need to make a sustained commitment to addressing critical \neducational issues in science, math, and foreign languages. The \nPresident is correct that America's ability to compete in global \nmarkets, and to defend ourselves against foreign threats, depend on our \nability to educate future generations.\n  Four years ago, Senator Durbin and I joined forces with a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators to introduce legislation to strengthen national \nsecurity by encouraging the development and expansion of programs to \nmeet critical needs in science, math, and foreign languages at the \nelementary, secondary, and higher education levels. I also introduced \nlegislation to strengthen education opportunities for Federal employees \nin these critical areas, and improve the government's recruitment and \nretention of individuals possessing these skills. Last year, Senators \nCochran, Dodd, and I introduced legislation\n\n[[Page S786]]\n\nto develop a national foreign language strategy.\n  Some of our proposals have become law. Others were passed by the \nSenate, but the House refused to consider them. The Intelligence Reform \nAct of 2004 established two things promoted in our legislation. First, \na rotation program to help mid-level Federal employees in the \nintelligence community improve their skills; and second, a scholarship \nprogram for individuals who possess critical skills, especially those \nin science, math, and foreign language, in exchange for service with \nthe Federal Government.\n  Still, America should rightly ask: why has it been so hard to make \neven these modest improvements? Especially when there have been \nnumerous national studies and commissions that conclude we need to do \nbetter at educating Americans.\n  In 2001, the Hart-Rudman Commission said that America needs a \nworkforce skilled in science, math, computer science, and engineering. \nThey said that the failure to foster these skills was jeopardizing \nAmerica's position as a global leader. The commission also found that \nthe maintenance of American power in the world depends upon the quality \nof U.S. Government personnel. It requires employees with more expertise \nin more countries, regions, and issues. This includes a commitment to \nlanguage education.\n  Legislation that I introduced along with my colleagues, some of which \ndates back to 2001, contains vital components that should be considered \nas we debate the President's proposed education initiatives.\n  Some of these programs include: Funding the Federal Government's \nstudent loan repayment program for positions critical to national \nsecurity and for staff with science and foreign language skills; \nproviding financial incentives, including subsidized loans, for \nstudents earning degrees in science, mathematics, engineering, or a \nforeign language; establishing grant programs for local educational \nagencies that engage in public-private partnerships to improve science \nand math education; awarding fellowships to students who agree to work \nfor the Federal Government and to Federal workers who wish to develop \nskills in critical national security fields; encouraging early foreign \nlanguage study in our elementary and secondary schools by establishing \nforeign language partnerships for teacher training; promoting \ninnovative foreign language programs through grants to higher education \ninstitutions; and establishing a National Foreign Language Coordination \nCouncil and language director to develop and oversee the implementation \nof a national language strategy that reflects input from all sectors of \nsociety.\n  The intent of these programs is to support a revitalized, re-\nenergized educational system in these critical areas from elementary \nthrough graduate school and improve the skills of our current labor \nforce.\n  Some of the programs would enhance certain skills of our Nation's \nteachers at all levels while providing them with the tools they need to \nsustain the development of our Nation's youth.\n  For example, one program would develop foreign language partnerships \nbetween local schools and higher education foreign language departments \nto enhance teacher training and develop appropriate foreign language \ncurricula.\n  If we want to ensure America's future competitiveness in global \nmarkets, we need to engage America's industry in assisting our youth to \ndevelop the skills industry needs to compete.\n  Another program proposed in our legislation establishes public-\nprivate partnerships to encourage the donation of scientific laboratory \nequipment, provide internship and mentoring opportunities, and to award \nscholarship funds for students in critical areas.\n  To survive in a diverse world, Americans need to harness their \nnatural diversity and expand linkages to their larger community. \nEducation must be seen as a community effort.\n  We must think more broadly when it comes to foreign languages. The \nprogram that Senator Durbin and I envisioned includes immersion \nprograms where students take a science or technology related class in a \nnon-English speaking country, or a cultural awareness program in which \nforeign language students study the science and technology issues of \nthat country. It is important to understand what other countries are \ndoing in science and technology before foreign innovations surpass our \nown.\n  I am glad that President Bush has recognized that action must be \ntaken to improve education in these critical areas by calling for \nincreasing the ranks of advanced placement and international \nbaccalaureate teachers and expanding access to AP and IB classes. I \nalso thank him for finally taking steps to strengthen foreign language \neducation in the U.S. with the National Security Language Initiative.\n  However, real commitments need to be made.\n  If we do not see education as a continual process for both the \nstudent and the teacher, a process designed to engage younger and older \ngenerations alike, then we will have created a product of only limited \nduration--a band-aid for our intellectual security.\n  We need to think beyond high school and college level work. We need \nto engage all levels of schooling and, beyond that, we need to enhance \nour current workforce. We cannot afford to neglect today's workforce if \nwe want to be successful building our future.\n  I yield the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Millions of Americans have been exposed to forms of \n     asbestos that can have devastating health effects.\n       (2) Various injuries can be caused by exposure to some \n     forms of asbestos, including pleural disease and some forms \n     of cancer.\n       (3) The injuries caused by asbestos can have latency \n     periods of up to 40 years, and even limited exposure to some \n     forms of asbestos may result in injury in some cases.\n       (4) Asbestos litigation has had a significant detrimental \n     effect on the country's economy, driving companies into \n     bankruptcy, diverting resources from those who are truly \n     sick, and endangering jobs and pensions.\n       (5) The scope of the asbestos litigation crisis cuts across \n     every State and virtually every industry.\n       (6) The United States Supreme Court has recognized that \n     Congress must act to create a more rational asbestos claims \n     system. In 1991, a Judicial Conference Ad Hoc Committee on \n     Asbestos Litigation, appointed by Chief Justice William \n     Rehnquist, found that the ``ultimate solution should be \n     legislation recognizing the national proportions of the \n     problem . . . and creating a national asbestos dispute \n     resolution scheme . . .''. The Court found in 1997 in Amchem \n     Products Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 595 (1997), that \n     ``[t]he argument is sensibly made that a nationwide \n     administrative claims processing regime would provide the \n     most secure, fair, and efficient means of compensating \n     victims of asbestos exposure.'' In 1999, the Court in Ortiz \n     v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 819, 821 (1999), found that the \n     ``elephantine mass of asbestos cases . . . defies customary \n     judicial administration and calls for national legislation.'' \n     That finding was again recognized in 2003 by the Court in \n     Norfolk & Western Railway Co. v. Ayers, 123 S. Ct. 1210 \n     (2003).\n       (7) This crisis, and its significant effect on the health \n     and welfare of the people of the United States, on interstate \n     and foreign commerce, and on the bankruptcy system, compels \n     Congress to exercise its power to regulate interstate \n     commerce and create this legislative solution in the form of \n     a national asbestos injury claims resolution program to \n     supersede all existing methods to compensate those injured by \n     asbestos, except as specified in this Act.\n       (8) This crisis has also imposed a deleterious burden upon \n     the United States bankruptcy courts, which have assumed a \n     heavy burden of administering complicated and protracted \n     bankruptcies with limited personnel.\n       (9) This crisis has devastated many communities across the \n     country, but hardest hit has been Libby, Montana, where \n     tremolite asbestos, 1 of the most deadly forms of asbestos, \n     was contained in the vermiculite ore mined from the area and \n     despite ongoing cleanup by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, many still suffer from the deadly dust.\n       (10) The asbestos found in Libby, Montana, tremolite \n     asbestos, has demonstrated an unusually high level of \n     toxicity, as compared to chrysotile asbestos. Diseases \n     contracted from this tremolite asbestos are unique and highly \n     progressive. These diseases typically manifest in a \n     characteristic pleural disease pattern, and often result in \n     severe impairment or death without radiographic interstitial \n     disease or typical chrysotile markers of radiographic \n     severity. According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and \n     Disease Registry previous studies by the National Institutes \n     of Occupational Safety and Health document significantly \n     increased rates of pulmonary abnormalities and disease \n     (asbestosis and lung cancer) among former workers.\n       (11) In Libby, Montana, exposure pathways are and were not \n     limited to the workplace, rather, for decades there has been \n     an unprecedented 24 hour per day contamination of the \n     community's homes, playgrounds, gardens, and community air, \n     such that the entire community of Libby, Montana, has been \n     designated a Superfund site and is listed on the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's National Priorities List.\n       (12) These multiple exposure pathways have caused severe \n     asbestos disease and death not only in former workers at the \n     mine and milling facilities, but also in the workers' spouses \n     and children, and in community members who had no direct \n     contact with the mine. According to the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, some potentially important alternative \n     pathways for past asbestos exposure include elevated \n     concentrations of asbestos in ambient air and recreational \n     exposures from children playing in piles of vermiculite. \n     Furthermore, the Environmental Protection Agency has \n     determined that current potential pathways of exposure \n     include vermiculite placed in walls and attics as thermal \n     insulation, vermiculite or ore used as road bed material, ore \n     used as ornamental landscaping, and vermiculite or \n     concentrated ore used as a soil and garden amendment or \n     aggregate in driveways.\n       (13) The Environmental Protection Agency also concluded, \n     ``Asbestos contamination exists in a number of potential \n     source materials at multiple locations in and around the \n     residential and commercial area of Libby. . . While data are \n     not yet sufficient to perform reliable human-health risk \n     evaluations for all sources and all types of disturbance, it \n     is apparent that releases of fiber concentrations higher than \n     Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards may \n     occur in some cases . . . and that screening-level estimates \n     of lifetime excess cancer risk can exceed the upper-bound \n     risk range of 1E-04 usually used by the Environmental \n     Protection Agency for residents under a variety of exposure \n     scenarios. The occurrence of non-occupational asbestos-\n     related disease that has been observed among Libby residents \n     is extremely unusual, and has not been associated with \n     asbestos mines elsewhere, suggesting either very high and \n     prolonged environmental exposures and/or increased toxicity \n     of this form of amphibole asbestos.''.\n       (14) According to a November 2003 article from the Journal \n     Environmental Health Perspectives titled, Radiographic \n     Abnormalities and Exposure to Asbestos-Contaminated \n     Vermiculite in the Community of Libby, Montana, USA, Libby \n     residents who have evidence of ``no apparent exposure'', \n     i.e., did not work with asbestos, were not a family member of \n     a former worker, etc., had a greater rate of pleural \n     abnormalities (6.7 percent) than did those in control groups \n     or general populations found in other studies from other \n     states (which ranged from 0.2 percent to 4.6 percent). \n     ``Given the ubiquitous nature of vermiculite contamination in \n     Libby, along with historical evidence of elevated asbestos \n     concentrations in the air, it would be difficult to find \n     participants who could be characterized as unexposed.''.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to--\n       (1) create a privately funded, publicly administered fund \n     to provide the necessary resources for a fair and efficient \n     system to resolve asbestos injury claims that will provide \n     compensation for legitimate present and future claimants of \n     asbestos exposure as provided in this Act;\n       (2) provide compensation to those present and future \n     victims based on the severity of their injuries, while \n     establishing a system flexible enough to accommodate \n     individuals whose conditions worsens;\n       (3) relieve the Federal and State courts of the burden of \n     the asbestos litigation; and\n       (4) increase economic stability by resolving the asbestos \n     litigation crisis that has bankrupted companies with asbestos \n     liability, diverted resources from the truly sick, and \n     endangered jobs and pensions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

If the aggregate amount offered by all \n     defendants exceeds the limitation in this clause, all offers \n     shall be deemed reduced pro-rata until the aggregate amount \n     equals the amount provided under section 131.\n       [(vi) Acceptance or rejection.--Within 20 days after the \n     service of the last offer of judgment, the claimant shall \n     either accept or reject such offers.

If the Administrator refuses to grant full or \n     partial indemnification based on collusive action, the \n     defendant may pursue any available remedy against the \n     claimant.\n       [(x) Refusal to make offer.--If a defendant refuses to make \n     an offer of judgment, the claimant may continue to seek a \n     judgment or order for monetary damages from the court where \n     the case is\n\n     [currently pending in an amount not to exceed 150 percent of \n     what the claimant would receive if the claimant had filed a \n     claim with the Fund.

If the court determines that \n     another forum would be the most appropriate forum for a \n     claim, the court shall dismiss the claim. Any otherwise \n     applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled beginning \n     on the date the claim was filed and ending on the date the \n     claim is dismissed under this subparagraph.]\n       [(D) State venue requirements.--Nothing in this paragraph \n     shall preempt or supersede any State's law relating to venue \n     requirements within that State which are more restrictive.\n       [(E) Credit of claim and effect of operational or \n     nonoperational fund.--\n       [(i) Credit of claim.--If an asbestos claim is pursued in \n     Federal or State court in accordance with this paragraph, any \n     recovery by the claimant shall be a collateral source \n     compensation for purposes of section 134.\n       [(ii) Operational fund.--If the Administrator subsequently \n     certifies to Congress that the Fund has become operational \n     and paying all valid asbestos claims at a reasonable rate, \n     any claim in a civil action in Federal or State court that is \n     not actually on trial before a jury which has been impaneled \n     and presentation of evidence has commenced, but before its \n     deliberation, or before a judge and is at the presentation of \n     evidence, may, at the option of the claimant, be deemed a \n     reinstated claim against the Fund and the civil action before \n     the Federal or State court shall be null and void.\n       [(iii) Nonoperational fund.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, if the Administrator subsequently \n     certifies to Congress that the Fund cannot become operational \n     and paying all valid asbestos claims at a reasonable rate, \n     all asbestos claims that have a stay may be filed or \n     reinstated.]\n       (f) Stay of Claims; Return to Tort System.--\n       (1) Stay of claims.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, any asbestos claim pending on the date of enactment \n     of this Act, other than a claim to which section 403(d)(2) \n     applies, shall be subject to a stay.\n       (2) Exigent health claims.--\n       (A) Procedures for settlement of exigent health claims.--\n       (i) In general.--Any person that has filed an exigent \n     health claim, as provided under subsection (c)(2), seeking a \n     judgment or order for monetary damages in any Federal or \n     State court before the date of the enactment of this Act, may \n     seek a settlement in accordance with this paragraph. Any \n     person with an exigent health claim, as provided under \n     subsection (c)(2), that arises after such date of enactment \n     may seek a settlement offer in accordance with this \n     paragraph.\n       (ii) Filing.--\n\n       (I) In general.--At any time before the Fund or claims \n     facility being certified as operational and paying exigent \n     health claims at a reasonable rate, any person with an \n     exigent health claim as described under clause (i) shall file \n     a notice of their intent to seek a settlement or shall file \n     their exigent health claim with the Administrator or claims \n     facility. Filing of an exigent health claim with the \n     Administrator or claims facility may serve as notice of \n     intent to seek a settlement.\n       (II) Stay.--If the claimant fails to file under this \n     clause, the stay shall remain in effect except as provided \n     under subparagraph (B).\n\n       (iii) Exigent health claim information.--To file an exigent \n     health claim, each individual shall provide all of the \n     following information:\n\n       (I) The amount received or entitled to be received as a \n     result of all settlements that would qualify as a collateral \n     source under section 134, and copies of all settlement \n     agreements and related documents sufficient to show the \n     accuracy of that amount.\n       (II) All information that the claimant would be required to \n     provide to the Administrator in support of a claim under \n     sections 113 and 121.\n       (III) A certification by the claimant that the information \n     provided is true and complete. The certification provided \n     under this subclause shall be subject to the same penalties \n     for false or misleading statements that would be applicable \n     with regard to information provided to the Administrator or \n     claims facility in support of a claim.\n       (IV) For exigent health claims arising after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the claimant shall identify each \n     defendant that would be an appropriate defendant in a civil \n     action seeking damages for the asbestos claim of the \n     claimant. The identification of a defendant under this \n     subclause shall be required to comply with rule 11 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n       (iv) Timing.--A claimant who has filed a notice of their \n     intent to seek a settlement under clause (ii) shall within 60 \n     days after filing notice provide to the Administrator or \n     claims facility, and all affected defendants the information \n     required under clause (iii). If a claimant has filed an \n     exigent health claim under clause (ii) the Administrator \n     shall provide all affected defendants the information \n     required under clause (iii).\n       (v) Administrator or claims facility certification of \n     settlement.--\n\n       (I) Determination.--Within 60 days after the information \n     under clause (iii) is provided, the Administrator or claims \n     facility shall determine whether or not the claim meets the \n     requirements of an exigent health claim.\n       (II) Requirements met.--If the Administrator or claims \n     facility determines that the claim meets the requirements of \n     an exigent health claim, the Administrator or claims facility \n     shall immediately--\n\n       (aa) issue and serve on all parties a certification of \n     eligibility of such claim;\n       (bb) determine the value of such claim under the Fund by \n     subtracting from the amount in section 131 the total amount \n     of collateral source compensation received by the claimant; \n     and\n       (cc) pay the award of compensation to the claimant under \n     clause (xi).\n\n       (III) Requirements not met.--If the requirements under \n     clause (iii) are not met, the claimant shall have 30 days to \n     perfect the claim. If the claimant fails to perfect the claim \n     within that 30-day period or the Administrator or claims \n     facility determines that the claim does not meet the \n     requirements of an exigent health claim, the claim shall not \n     be eligible to proceed under this paragraph. A claimant may \n     appeal any decision issued by a claims facility with the \n     Administrator in accordance with section 114.\n\n       (vi) Failure to certify.--If the Administrator or claims \n     facility is unable to process the claim and does not make a \n     determination regarding the certification of the claim as \n     required under clause (v), the Administrator or claims \n     facility shall within 10 days after the end of the 60-day \n     period referred to under clause (v)(I) provide notice of the \n     failure to act to the claimant and the defendants in the \n     pending Federal or State court action or the defendants \n     identified under clause (iii)(IV). If the Administrator or \n     claims facility fails to provide such notice within 10 days, \n     the claimant may elect to provide the notice to the affected \n     defendants to prompt a settlement offer.\n       (vii) Failure to pay.--If the Administrator or claims \n     facility does not pay the award as required under clause \n     (xi), the Administrator shall refer the certified claim \n     within 10 days as a certified exigent health claim to the \n     defendants in the pending Federal and State court action or \n     to the potential defendants identified under clause (iii)(IV) \n     for exigent claims arising after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (viii) Settlement offer.--Any defendant or defendants may, \n     within 30 days after receipt of such notice as provided under \n     clause (vi) or (vii), file and serve on all parties and the \n     Administrator a good faith settlement offer in an aggregate \n     amount not to exceed the total amount to which the claimant \n     may be entitled under section 131. If the aggregate amount \n     offered by all defendants exceeds the award determined by the \n     Administrator, all offers shall be deemed reduced pro-rata \n     until the aggregate amount equals the award amount. An \n     acceptance of such settlement offer in a pending court action \n     shall be subject to approval by the trial judge or authorized \n     magistrate in the court where the claim is pending. The court \n     shall approve any such accepted offer within 20 days after a \n     request, unless there is evidence of bad faith or fraud. No \n     court approval is necessary if the exigent health claim was \n     certified by the Administrator or claims facility under \n     clause (v).\n       (ix) Opportunity to cure.--If the settlement offer is \n     rejected for being less than what the claimant was entitled \n     to under the Fund, the defendants shall have 10 business days \n     to make an amended offer. If the amended offer equals 100 \n     percent of what the claimant would receive under the Fund, \n     the claimant shall accept such settlement offer in writing. \n     If the settlement offer is again rejected as less than what \n     the claimant is entitled to under the Fund or if defendants \n     fail to make an amended offer, the claimant shall be entitled \n     to recover 150 percent of what the claimant would receive \n     under the Fund before the stay being lifted under \n     subparagraph (B). If the amount of the amended settlement \n     offer made by the Administrator, claims facility, or \n     defendants equals 150 percent of what the claimant would \n     receive under the Fund, the claimant shall accept such \n     settlement in writing.\n       (x) Acceptance or rejection.--Within 20 days after receipt \n     of the settlement offer, or the amended settlement offer, the \n     claimant shall either accept or reject such offer in writing. \n     If the amount of the settlement offer made by the \n     Administrator, claims facility, or defendants equals 100 \n     percent of what the claimant would receive under the Fund, \n     the claimant shall accept such settlement in writing.\n       (xi) Payment schedule.--\n\n       (I) Mesothelioma claimants.--For mesothelioma claimants--\n\n       (aa) an initial payment of 50 percent shall be made within \n     30 days after the date the settlement is accepted and the \n     second and final payment shall be made 6 months after date \n     the settlement is accepted; or\n       (bb) if the Administrator determines that the payment \n     schedule would impose a severe financial hardship on the \n     Fund, or if the court determines that the settlement offer \n     would impose a severe financial hardship on the defendant, \n     the payments may be extended 50 percent in 6 months and 50 \n     percent 11 months after the date the settlement offer is \n     accepted.\n\n       (II) Other exigent claimants.--For other exigent claimants, \n     as defined under section 106(c)(2)(B and (C)--\n\n       (aa) the initial payment of 50 percent shall be made within \n     6 months after the date the settlement is accepted and the \n     second and final payment shall be made 12 months after date \n     the settlement is accepted; or\n       (bb) if the Administrator determines that the payment \n     schedule would impose a severe financial hardship on the \n     Fund, or if the court determines that the settlement offer \n     would impose a severe financial hardship on the defendants, \n     the payments may be extended 50 percent within 1 year after \n     the date the settlement offer is accepted and 50 percent in 2 \n     years after date the settlement offer is accepted.\n\n       (III) Release.--Once a claimant has received final payment \n     of the accepted settlement offer the claimant shall release \n     any outstanding asbestos claims.\n\n       (xii) Recovery of costs.--\n\n       (I) In general.--Any defendant whose settlement offer is \n     accepted may recover the cost of such settlement by deducting \n     from the defendant's next and subsequent contributions to the \n     Fund the full amount of the payment made by\n\n[[Page S793]]\n\n     such defendant to the exigent health claimant, unless the \n     Administrator finds, on the basis of clear and convincing \n     evidence, that the defendant's offer is not in good faith. \n     Any such payment shall be considered a payment to the Fund \n     for purposes of section 404(e)(1) and in response to the \n     payment obligations imposed on defendant and insurer \n     participants in title II.\n       (II) Reimbursement.--Notwithstanding subclause (I), if the \n     deductions from the defendant participant's next and \n     subsequent contributions to the Fund do not fully recover the \n     cost of such payments on or before its third annual \n     contribution to the Fund, the Fund shall reimburse such \n     defendant for such remaining cost not later than 6 months \n     after the date of the third scheduled Fund contribution.\n\n       (xiii) Failure to make offer.--If defendants fail to make a \n     settlement offer within the 30-day period described under \n     clause (viii) or make amended offers within the 10 business \n     day cure period described under clause (ix), the claimant \n     shall be entitled to recover 150 percent of what the claimant \n     would receive under the Fund before the stay being lifted \n     under subparagraph (B).\n       (xiv) Failure to pay.--If defendants fail to pay an \n     accepted settlement offer within the payment schedule under \n     clause (xi), the claimant shall be entitled to recover 150 \n     percent of what the claimant would receive under the Fund \n     before the stay being lifted under subparagraph (B). If the \n     stay is lifted under subparagraph (B) the claimant may seek a \n     judgment or order for monetary damages from the court where \n     the case is currently pending or the appropriate Federal or \n     State court for claims arising after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (B) Continuation of exigent health claims.--If 9 months \n     after an exigent health claim has been filed under \n     subparagraph (A)(ii), a claimant has not received a \n     settlement under subparagraph (A)(xi) and the Administrator \n     has not certified to Congress that the Fund or claims \n     facility is operational and paying exigent health claims at a \n     reasonable rate, such exigent health claimant, may seek a \n     judgment or order for monetary damages from the court where \n     the case is currently pending or the appropriate Federal or \n     State court for claims arising after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (C) Credit of claim and effect of operational fund.--\n       (i) Collateral source.--If an asbestos claim is pursued in \n     Federal or State court in accordance with this paragraph, any \n     recovery by the claimant shall be a collateral source \n     compensation for purposes of section 134.\n       (ii) Recovery of costs.--Any defendant may recover the cost \n     of any claim continued in court for up to the amount the \n     claimant would receive under the Fund by deducting from the \n     defendant's next and subsequent contributions to the Fund for \n     the full amount of the payment made by such defendant to the \n     exigent health claimant.\n       (3) Pursual of non-exigent asbestos claims in federal or \n     state court.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, if not later than 24 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator cannot certify to \n     Congress that the Fund is operational and paying all valid \n     claims at a reasonable rate, any person with a non-exigent \n     asbestos claim stayed, except for any person whose claim does \n     not exceed a Level I claim, may pursue that claim in the \n     Federal district court or State court located within--\n       (i) the State of residence of the claimant; or\n       (ii) the State in which the asbestos exposure occurred.\n       (B) Defendants not found.--If any defendant cannot be found \n     in the State described under subparagraph (A) (i) or (ii), \n     the claim may be pursued in the Federal district court or \n     State court located within any State in which the defendant \n     may be found.\n       (C) Determination of most appropriate forum.--If a person \n     alleges that the asbestos exposure occurred in more than 1 \n     county (or Federal district), the trial court shall determine \n     which State and county (or Federal district) is the most \n     appropriate forum for the claim. If the court determines that \n     another forum would be the most appropriate forum for a \n     claim, the court shall dismiss the claim. Any otherwise \n     applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled beginning \n     on the date the claim was filed and ending on the date the \n     claim is dismissed under this subparagraph.\n       (D) State venue requirements.--Nothing in this paragraph \n     shall preempt or supersede any State law relating to venue \n     requirements within that State which are more restrictive.\n       (E) Credit of claim and effect of operational or \n     nonoperational fund.--\n       (i) Credit of claim.--If an asbestos claim is pursued in \n     Federal or State court in accordance with this paragraph, any \n     recovery by the claimant shall be a collateral source \n     compensation for purposes of section 134.\n       (ii) Operational certification.--Operational certification \n     shall be a filing in the Federal Register confirming that the \n     Fund is operational and paying all valid asbestos claims at a \n     reasonable rate.\n       (iii) Operational preconditions.--\n\n       (I) The Administrator may not issue a operational \n     certification until--\n\n       (aa) 60 days after the funding allocation information \n     required under section 221(e) has been published in the \n     Federal Register; and\n       (bb) insurers subject to section 212(a)(3) submit their \n     names and information to the Administrator within 30 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act and 60 days after the \n     Administrator publishes such information in the Federal \n     Register.\n       (iv) Operational fund.--If the Administrator issues an \n     operational certification and notifies Congress that the Fund \n     has become operational and paying all valid asbestos claims \n     at a reasonable rate, any nonexigent asbestos claim in a \n     civil action in Federal or State court that is not on trial \n     before a jury which has been impaneled and presentation of \n     evidence has commenced, but before its deliberation, or \n     before a judge and is at the presentation of evidence shall \n     be deemed a reinstated claim against the Fund and the civil \n     action before the Federal or State court shall be null and \n     void.\n       (v) Nonoperational fund.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, if the Administrator subsequently \n     issues a nonoperational certification and notifies Congress \n     that the Fund is unable to become operational and pay all \n     valid asbestos claims at a reasonable rate, all asbestos \n     claims that have a stay may be filed or reinstated.\n\n     SEC. 107.

\n     or\n        (B) discovered facts that would have led a reasonable \n     person to obtain a medical diagnosis with respect to an \n     eligible disease or condition,\n\n      any claim relating to that injury,  and any other asbestos \n     claim related to that injury,  If a claim is not filed with \n     the Office within the limitations period specified in this \n     subsection for that category of claim, such claim shall be \n     extinguished, and any recovery thereon shall be prohibited.\n       (2) Initial claims.--An initial claim for an award under \n     this Act shall be filed within 5 years after the date on \n     which the claimant first received a medical diagnosis and \n     medical test results sufficient to satisfy the criteria for \n     the disease level for which the claimant is seeking \n     compensation.\n       (3) Claims for additional awards.--\n       (A) Non-malignant diseases.--If a claimant has previously \n     filed a timely initial claim for compensation for any non-\n     malignant disease level, there shall be no limitations period \n     applicable to the filing of claims by the claimant for\n\n[[Page S794]]\n\n     additional awards for higher disease levels based on the \n     progression of the non-malignant disease.\n       (B) Malignant diseases.--Regardless of whether the claimant \n     has previously filed a claim for compensation for any other \n     disease level, a claim for compensation for a malignant \n     disease level shall be filed within 5 years after the \n     claimant first obtained a medical diagnosis and medical test \n     results sufficient to satisfy the criteria for the malignant \n     disease level for which the claimant is seeking compensation.\n       (2) [Exception.--The statute of limitations in paragraph \n     (1) does not apply to the progression of nonmalignant \n     diseases once the initial claim has been filed.]\n       [(3)] (4) Effect on pending claims.--\n       (A) In general.--If, on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     an asbestos claimant has any timely filed asbestos claim that \n     is preempted under section 403(e), such claimant shall file a \n     claim under this section within 5 years after such date of \n     enactment, or any claim relating to that injury, and any \n     other asbestos claim related to that injury shall be \n     extinguished, and recovery there shall be prohibited.\n       (B) Special rule.--For purposes of this paragraph, a claim \n     shall not be treated as pending with a trust established \n     under title 11, United States Code, solely because a claimant \n     whose claim was previously compensated by the trust has or \n     alleges--\n       (i) a non-contingent right to the payment of future \n     installments of a fixed award; or\n       (ii) a contingent right to recover some additional amount \n     from the trust on the occurrence of a future event, such as \n     the reevaluation of the trust's funding adequacy or projected \n     claims experience.\n       [(4) Effect of multiple injuries.--\n       (A) In general.--An asbestos claimant who receives an award \n     under this title for an eligible disease or condition, and \n     who subsequently develops another such injury, shall be \n     eligible for additional awards under this title (subject to \n     appropriate setoffs for such prior recovery of any award \n     under this title and from any other collateral source) and \n     the statute of limitations under paragraph (1) shall not \n     begin to run with respect to such subsequent injury until \n     such claimant obtains a medical diagnosis of such other \n     injury or discovers facts that would have led a reasonable \n     person to obtain such a diagnosis.\n       (B) Setoffs.--Except as provided in subparagraph (C), any \n     amounts paid or to be paid for a prior award under this Act \n     shall be deducted as a setoff against amounts payable for the \n     second injury claim.\n       (C) Exception.--Any amounts paid or to be paid for a prior \n     claim for a nonmalignant disease (Levels I through V) filed \n     against the Fund shall not be deducted as a setoff against \n     amounts payable for the second injury claim for a malignant \n     disease (Levels VI through IX), unless the malignancy was \n     diagnosed, or the asbestos claimant had discovered facts that \n     would have led a reasonable person to obtain such a \n     diagnosis, before the date on which the nonmalignancy claim \n     was compensated.]\n       (c) Required Information.--A claim filed under subsection \n     (a) shall be in such form, and contain such information in \n     such detail, as the Administrator shall by regulation \n     prescribe.

In making such determinations, \n     the Administrator shall consider the claim presented by the \n     claimant, the factual and medical evidence submitted by the \n     claimant in support of the claim, the medical determinations \n     of any Physicians Panel to which a claim is referred under \n     section 121, and the results of such investigation as the \n     Administrator may deem necessary to determine whether the \n     claim satisfies the criteria for eligibility established by \n     this Act.\n       (2) Additional evidence.--The Administrator may request the \n     submission of medical evidence in addition to the minimum \n     requirements of section 113(c) if necessary or appropriate to \n     make a determination of eligibility for an award, in which \n     case the cost of obtaining such additional information or \n     testing shall be borne by the Office.\n       (b) Proposed Decisions.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     filing of a claim, the Administrator shall provide to the \n     claimant (and the claimant's representative) a proposed \n     decision accepting or rejecting the claim in whole or in part \n     and specifying the amount of the proposed award, if any. The \n     proposed decision shall be in writing, shall contain findings \n     of fact and conclusions of law, and shall contain an \n     explanation of the procedure for obtaining review of the \n     proposed decision.\n       (c) Payments if No Timely Proposed Decision.--If the \n     Administrator has received a complete claim and has not \n     provided a proposed decision to the claimant under subsection \n     (b) within 180 days after the filing of the claim, the claim \n     shall be deemed accepted and the claimant shall be entitled \n     to payment under section 133(a)(2). If the Administrator \n     subsequently rejects the claim the claimant shall receive no \n     further payments under section 133. If the Administrator \n     subsequently rejects the claim in part, the Administrator \n     shall adjust future payments due the claimant under section \n     133 accordingly. In no event may the Administrator recover \n     amounts properly paid under this section from a claimant.\n       (d) Review of Proposed Decisions.--\n       (1) Right to hearing.--\n       (A) In general.--Any claimant not satisfied with a proposed \n     decision of the Administrator under subsection (b) shall be \n     entitled, on written request made within 90 days after the \n     date of the issuance of the decision, to a hearing on the \n     claim of that claimant before a representative of the \n     Administrator. At the hearing, the claimant shall be entitled \n     to present oral evidence and written testimony in further \n     support of that claim.\n       (B) Conduct of hearing.--When practicable, the hearing will \n     be set at a time and place convenient for the claimant.

For \n     this purpose, the representative shall receive such relevant \n     evidence as the claimant adduces and such other evidence as \n     the representative determines necessary or useful in \n     evaluating the claim.\n       (C) Request for subpoenas.--\n       (i) In general.--A claimant may request a subpoena but the \n     decision to grant or deny such a request is within the \n     discretion of the representative of the Administrator. The \n     representative may issue subpoenas for the attendance and \n     testimony of witnesses, and for the production of books, \n     records, correspondence, papers, or other relevant documents. \n     Subpoenas are issued for documents only if such documents are \n     relevant and cannot be obtained by other means, and for \n     witnesses only where oral testimony is the best way to \n     ascertain the facts.\n       (ii) Request.--A claimant may request a subpoena only as \n     part of the hearing process.

Such fees and mileage shall be \n     paid from the Fund.\n       (2) Review of written record.--In lieu of a hearing under \n     paragraph (1), any claimant not satisfied with a proposed \n     decision of the Administrator shall have the option, on \n     written request made within 90 days after the date of the \n     issuance of the decision, of obtaining a review of the \n     written record by a representative of the Administrator. If \n     such\n\n[[Page S795]]\n\n     review is requested, the claimant shall be afforded an \n     opportunity to submit any written evidence or argument which \n     the claimant believes relevant.\n       (e) Final Decisions.--\n       (1) In general.--If the period of time for requesting \n     review of the proposed decision expires and no request has \n     been filed, or if the claimant waives any objections to the \n     proposed decision, the Administrator shall issue a final \n     decision. If such decision materially differs from the \n     proposed decision, the claimant shall be entitled to review \n     of the decision under subsection (d).\n       (2) Time and content.--If the claimant requests review of \n     all or part of the proposed decision the Administrator shall \n     issue a final decision on the claim not later than 180 days \n     after the request for review is received, if the claimant \n     requests a hearing, or not later than 90 days after the \n     request for review is received, if the claimant requests \n     review of the written record. Such decision shall be in \n     writing and contain findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n       (f) Representation.--A claimant may authorize an attorney \n     or other individual to represent him or her in any proceeding \n     under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 115.

Until 5 years after the Administrator certifies that \n     the Fund is paying claims at a reasonable rate, the \n     industries, occupations and time periods identified by the \n     Administrator shall at a minimum include those identified in \n     the 2002 Trust Distribution Process of the Manville Personal \n     Injury Settlement Trust as of January 1, 2005, as industries, \n     occupations and time periods in which workers were presumed \n     to have had significant occupational exposure to asbestos. \n     Thereafter, the Administrator may by rule modify or eliminate \n     those exposure presumptions required to be adopted from the \n     Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust, if there is \n     evidence that demonstrates that the typical exposure for \n     workers in such industries and occupations during such time \n     periods did not constitute substantial occupational exposure \n     in asbestos.\n       (B) Claimants entitled to presumptions.--Any claimant who \n     demonstrates through meaningful and credible evidence that \n     such claimant was employed during relevant time periods in \n     industries or occupations identified under subparagraph (A) \n     shall be entitled to a presumption that the claimant had \n     substantial occupational exposure to asbestos during those \n     time periods. That presumption shall not be conclusive, and \n     the Administrator may find that the claimant does not have \n     substantial occupational exposure if other information \n     demonstrates that the claimant did not in fact have \n     substantial occupational exposure during any part of the \n     relevant time periods.\n       (C) Criteria requirements.--Nothing in subparagraphs (A) or \n     (B) shall negate the exposure or medical criteria \n     requirements in section 121, for the purpose of receiving \n     compensation from the Fund.\n       (6) Penalty for false statement.--Any false information \n     submitted under this subsection shall be subject to section \n     1348 of\n\n[[Page S797]]\n\n     title 18, United States Code (as added by this Act).\n       (d) Asbestos Disease Levels.--\n       (1) Nonmalignant level i.--To receive Level I compensation, \n     a claimant shall provide--\n       (A) a diagnosis of bilateral asbestos-related nonmalignant \n     disease;

or\n       (III) when measured against the percentage of the prior \n     asbestos expenditures of the defendant that were incurred \n     with respect to claims that neither resulted in an adverse \n     judgment against the defendant, nor were the subject of a \n     settlement that required a payment to a plaintiff by or on \n     behalf of that defendant;\n\n       (ii) shall qualify for a two-tier main tier and a two-tier \n     subtier adjustment reducing the defendant participant's \n     payment obligation based on inequity by demonstrating that \n     not less than 95 percent of such person's prior asbestos \n     expenditures arose from claims related to the manufacture and \n     sale of railroad locomotives and related products, so long as \n     such person's manufacture and sale of railroad locomotives \n     and related products is temporally and causally remote, and \n     for purposes of this clause, a person's manufacture and sale \n     of railroad locomotives and related products shall be deemed \n     to be temporally and causally remote if the asbestos claims \n     historically and generally filed against such person relate \n     to the manufacture and sale of railroad locomotives and \n     related products by an entity dissolved more than 25 years \n     before the date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (iii) shall be granted a two-tier adjustment reducing the \n     defendant participant's payment obligation based on inequity \n     by demonstrating that not less than 95 percent of such \n     participant's prior asbestos expenditures arose from asbestos \n     claims based on successor liability arising from a merger to \n     which the participant or its predecessor was a party that \n     occurred at least 30 years before the date of enactment of \n     this Act, and that such prior asbestos expenditures exceed \n     the inflation-adjusted value of the assets of the company \n     from which such liability was derived in such merger, and \n     upon such demonstration the Administrator shall grant such \n     adjustment for the life of the Fund and amounts paid by such \n     defendant participant prior to such adjustment in excess of \n     its adjusted payment obligation under this clause shall be \n     credited against next succeeding required payment \n     obligations.\n       (B) Payment rate.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the \n     payment rate of a defendant participant is the payment amount \n     of the defendant participant as a percentage of such \n     defendant participant's gross revenues for the year ending \n     December 31, 2002.\n       (C) Term.--Subject to the annual availability of funds in \n     the defendant hardship and inequity adjustment account \n     established under subsection (j), an inequity adjustment \n     under this subsection shall have a term of 3 years.\n       (D) Renewal.--A defendant participant may renew an inequity \n     adjustment every 3 years by demonstrating that the adjustment \n     remains justified.\n       (E) Reinstatement.--\n       (i) In general.--Following the termination of an inequity \n     adjustment under subparagraph (A), and during the funding \n     period prescribed under subsection (a), the Administrator \n     shall annually determine whether there has been a material \n     change in conditions which would support a finding that the \n     amount of the defendant participant's payment under the \n     statutory allocation was not inequitable. Based on this \n     determination, the Administrator may, consistent with the \n     policies and legislative intent underlying this Act, \n     reinstate any or all of the payment obligations of the \n     defendant participant as if the inequity adjustment had not \n     been granted for that 3-year period.\n       (ii) Terms and conditions.--In the event of a reinstatement \n     under clause (i), the Administrator may require the defendant \n     participant to pay any part or all of amounts not paid due to \n     the inequity adjustment on such terms and conditions as \n     established by the Administrator.\n       (4) Limitation on adjustments.--The aggregate total of \n     financial hardship adjustments under paragraph (2) and \n     inequity adjustments under paragraph (3) in effect in any \n     given year shall not exceed $300,000,000, except to the \n     extent that--\n       (A) additional monies are available for such adjustments as \n     a result of carryover of prior years' funds under subsection \n     (j)(3) or as a result of monies being made available in that \n     year under subsection (k)(1)(A)[.]; or\n       (B) the Administrator determines that the $300,000,000 is \n     insufficient and additional adjustments as provided under \n     paragraph (5) are needed to address situations in which a \n     defendant participant would otherwise be rendered insolvent \n     by its payment obligations without such adjustment.\n       (5) Bankruptcy relief.--\n       (A) In general.--Any defendant participant may apply for an \n     adjustment under this paragraph at any time during the period \n     in which a payment obligation to the Fund remains outstanding \n     and may qualify for such adjustment by demonstrating, to a \n     reasonable degree of certainty, evidence that the amount of \n     its payment obligation would render the defendant participant \n     insolvent, as defined under section 101 of title 11, United \n     States Code, and unable to pay its debts as they become due.\n       (B) Information required.--Any defendant participant \n     seeking an adjustment or renewal of an adjustment under this \n     paragraph shall provide the Administrator with the \n     information required under section 521(1) of title 11 of the \n     United States Code.\n       (C) Limitation.--Any adjustment granted by the \n     Administrator under subparagraph (A) shall be limited to the \n     extent reasonably necessary to prevent insolvency of a \n     defendant participant.\n       (D) Term.--To the extent the Administrator grants any \n     relief under this paragraph, such adjustments shall have a \n     term of 1 year. An adjustment may be renewed or modified on \n     an annual basis upon the defendant participant demonstrating \n     that the adjustment or modification remains justified under \n     this paragraph.\n       (E) Reinstatement.--During the funding period prescribed \n     under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall annually \n     determine whether there has been a material change in the \n     financial condition of any defendant participant granted an \n     adjustment under this paragraph such that the Administrator \n     may, consistent with the policies and legislative intent \n     underlying this Act, reinstate under terms and conditions \n     established by the Administrator any part or all of the \n     defendant participant's payment obligation under the \n     statutory allocation that was not paid during the adjustment \n     term.\n       [(5)](6) Advisory panels.--\n       (A) Appointment.--The Administrator shall appoint a \n     Financial Hardship Adjustment Panel and an Inequity \n     Adjustment Panel to advise the Administrator in carrying out \n     this subsection.\n       (B) Membership.--The membership of the panels appointed \n     under subparagraph (A) may overlap.\n       (C) Coordination.--The panels appointed under subparagraph \n     (A) shall coordinate their deliberations and advice.\n       (e) Limitation on Liability.--The liability of each \n     defendant participant to pay to the Fund shall be limited to \n     the payment obligations under this Act, and, except as \n     provided in subsection (f) and section 203(b)(2)(D), no \n     defendant participant shall have any liability for the \n     payment obligations of any other defendant participant.\n       (f) Consolidation of Payments.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of determining the payment \n     levels of defendant participants, any affiliated group \n     including 1 or more defendant participants may irrevocably \n     elect, as part of the submissions to be made under paragraphs \n     (1) and (3) of subsection (i), to report on a consolidated \n     basis all of the information necessary to determine the \n     payment level under this subtitle and pay to the Fund on a \n     consolidated basis.\n       (2) Election.--If an affiliated group elects consolidation \n     as provided in this subsection--\n       (A) for purposes of this Act other than this subsection, \n     the affiliated group shall be treated as if it were a single \n     participant, including with respect to the assessment of a \n     single annual payment under this subtitle for the entire \n     affiliated group;\n       (B) the ultimate parent of the affiliated group shall \n     prepare and submit each submission to be made under \n     subsection (i) on behalf of the entire affiliated group and \n     shall be solely liable, as between the Administrator and the \n     affiliated group only, for the payment of the annual amount \n     due from the affiliated group under this subtitle, except \n     that, if the ultimate parent does not pay when due any \n     payment obligation for the affiliated group, the \n     Administrator shall have the right to seek payment of all or \n     any portion of the entire amount due (as well as any other \n     amount for which the affiliated group may be liable under \n     sections 223 and 224) from any member of the affiliated \n     group;\n       (C) all members of the affiliated group shall be identified \n     in the submission under subsection (i) and shall certify \n     compliance with this subsection and the Administrator's \n     regulations implementing this subsection; and\n       (D) the obligations under this subtitle shall not change \n     even if, after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     beneficial ownership interest between any members of the \n     affiliated group shall change.\n       (3) Cause of action.--Notwithstanding section 221(e), this \n     Act shall not preclude actions among persons within an \n     affiliated group with respect to the payment obligations \n     under this Act.\n       (g) Determination of Prior Asbestos Expenditures.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of determining a defendant \n     participant's prior asbestos expenditures, the Administrator \n     shall prescribe such rules as may be necessary or appropriate \n     to assure that payments by indemnitors before December 31, \n     2002, shall be counted as part of the indemnitor's prior \n     asbestos expenditures, rather than the indemnitee's prior \n     asbestos expenditures, in accordance with this subsection.\n\n[[Page S805]]\n\n       (2) Indemnifiable costs.--If an indemnitor has paid or \n     reimbursed to an indemnitee any indemnifiable cost or \n     otherwise made a payment on behalf of or for the benefit of \n     an indemnitee to a third party for an indemnifiable cost \n     before December 31, 2002, the amount of such indemnifiable \n     cost shall be solely for the account of the indemnitor for \n     purposes under this Act.\n       (3) Insurance payments.--When computing the prior asbestos \n     expenditures with respect to an asbestos claim, any amount \n     paid or reimbursed by insurance shall be solely for the \n     account of the indemnitor, even if the indemnitor would have \n     no direct right to the benefit of the insurance, if--\n       (A) such insurance has been paid or reimbursed to the \n     indemnitor or the indemnitee, or paid on behalf of or for the \n     benefit of the indemnitee; and\n       (B) the indemnitor has either, with respect to such \n     asbestos claim or any similar asbestos claim, paid or \n     reimbursed to its indemnitee any indemnifiable cost or paid \n     to any third party on behalf of or for the benefit of the \n     indemnitee any indemnifiable cost.\n       (4) Treatment of certain expenditures.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of this Act, where--\n       (A) an indemnitor entered into a stock purchase agreement \n     in 1988 that involved the sale of the stock of businesses \n     that produced friction and other products; and\n       (B) the stock purchase agreement provided that the \n     indemnitor indemnified the indemnitee and its affiliates for \n     losses arising from various matters, including asbestos \n     claims--\n       (i) asserted before the date of the agreement; and\n       (ii) filed after the date of the agreement and prior to the \n     10-year anniversary of the stock sale,\n\n     then the prior asbestos expenditures arising from the \n     asbestos claims described in clauses (i) and (ii) shall not \n     be for the account of either the indemnitor or indemnitee.\n       (h) Minimum Annual Payments.--\n       (1) In general.--The aggregate annual payments of defendant \n     participants to the Fund shall be at least $3,000,000,000 for \n     each calendar year in the first 30 years of the Fund, or \n     until such shorter time as the condition set forth in \n     subsection (a)(2) is attained.\n       (2) Guaranteed payment account.--To the extent payments in \n     accordance with sections 202 and 203 [(as modified by \n     subsections (b), (d), (f) and (g) of this section)] (as \n     modified by subsections (b), (d), (f), (g), and (m) of this \n     section) fail in any year to raise at least $3,000,000,000 \n     [net of any adjustments under subsection (d)], after \n     applicable reductions or adjustments have been taken \n     according to subsections (d) and (m), the balance needed to \n     meet this required minimum aggregate annual payment shall be \n     obtained from the defendant guaranteed payment account \n     established under subsection (k).\n       (3) Guaranteed payment surcharge.--To the extent the \n     procedure set forth in paragraph (2) is insufficient to \n     satisfy the required minimum aggregate annual payment [net of \n     any adjustments under subsection (d)], after applicable \n     reductions or adjustments have been taken according to \n     subsections (d) and (m), the Administrator [may] shall unless \n     the Administrator implements a funding holiday under section \n     205(b), assess a guaranteed payment surcharge under \n     subsection (l).\n       (i) Procedures for Making Payments.--\n       (1) Initial year: tiers ii-vi.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than [120] 90 days after \n     enactment of this Act, each defendant participant that is \n     included in Tiers II, III, IV, V, or VI shall file with the \n     Administrator--\n       (i) a statement of whether the defendant participant \n     irrevocably elects to report on a consolidated basis under \n     subsection (f);\n       (ii) a good-faith estimate of its prior asbestos \n     expenditures;\n       (iii) a statement of its 2002 revenues, determined in \n     accordance with section 203(a)(2); [and]\n       (iv) payment in the amount specified in section 203 for the \n     lowest subtier of the tier within which the defendant \n     participant falls, except that if the defendant participant, \n     or the affiliated group including the defendant participant, \n     had 2002 revenues exceeding $3,000,000,000, it or its \n     affiliated group shall pay the amount specified for Subtier 3 \n     of Tiers II, III, or IV or Subtier 2 of Tiers V or VI, \n     depending on the applicable Tier[.];

If the amount that the \n     defendant participant is required to pay is less than\n\n[[Page S806]]\n\n     any previous payment made by the participant under this \n     subsection, the Administrator shall credit any excess payment \n     against the future payment obligations of that defendant \n     participant.

The Administrator shall \n     publish a notice in the Federal Register of any change in a \n     defendant participant's tier or subtier assignment or payment \n     obligation as a result of a rehearing.\n       (j) Defendant Hardship and Inequity Adjustment Account.--\n       (1) In general.--To the extent the total payments by \n     defendant participants in any given year exceed the minimum \n     aggregate annual payments required under subsection (h), \n     excess monies up to a maximum of $300,000,000 in any such \n     year shall be placed in a defendant hardship and inequity \n     adjustment account established within the Fund by the \n     Administrator.\n       (2) Use of account monies.--Monies from the defendant \n     hardship and inequity adjustment account shall be preserved \n     and administered like the remainder of the Fund, but shall be \n     reserved and may be used only--\n       (A) to make up for any relief granted to a defendant \n     participant for severe financial hardship or demonstrated \n     inequity under subsection (d) or to reimburse any defendant \n     participant granted such relief after its payment of the \n     amount otherwise due; and\n       (B) if the condition set forth in subsection (a)(2) is met, \n     for any purpose that the Fund may serve under this Act.\n       (3) Carryover of unused funds.--To the extent the \n     Administrator does not, in any given year, use all of the \n     funds allocated to the account under paragraph (1) for \n     adjustments granted under subsection (d), remaining funds in \n     the account shall be carried forward for use by the \n     Administrator for adjustments in subsequent years.\n       (k) Defendant Guaranteed Payment Account.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to subsections (h) and (j), if \n     there are excess monies paid by defendant participants in any \n     given year, including any bankruptcy trust credits that may \n     be due under section 222[(e)](d), such monies--\n       (A) at the discretion of the Administrator, may be used to \n     provide additional adjustments under subsection (d), up to a \n     maximum aggregate of $50,000,000 in such year; and\n       (B) to the extent not used under subparagraph (A), shall be \n     placed in a defendant guaranteed payment account established \n     within the Fund by the Administrator.\n       (2) Use of account monies.--Monies from the defendant \n     guaranteed payment account shall be preserved and \n     administered like the remainder of the Fund, but shall be \n     reserved and may be used only--\n       (A) to ensure the minimum aggregate annual payment [set \n     forth in] required under subsection (h) [net of any \n     adjustments under subsection (d)], after applicable \n     reductions or adjustments have been taken according to \n     subsections (d) and (m) is reached each year; and\n       (B) if the condition set forth in subsection (a)(2) is met, \n     for any purpose that the Fund may serve under this Act.\n       (l) Guaranteed Payment Surcharge.--\n       (1) In general.--To the extent there are insufficient \n     monies in the defendant guaranteed payment account \n     established in subsection (k) to attain the minimum aggregate \n     annual payment required under subsection (h) [net of any \n     adjustments under subsection (d)] in any given year, the \n     Administrator [may] shall, unless the Administrator \n     implements a funding holiday under section 205(b), impose on \n     each defendant participant a surcharge as necessary to raise \n     the balance required to attain the minimum aggregate annual \n     payment required under subsection (h) [net of any adjustments \n     under subsection (d)] as provided in this subsection. Any \n     such surcharge shall be imposed on a pro rata basis, in \n     accordance with each defendant participant's relative annual \n     liability under sections 202 and 203 [(as modified by \n     subsections (b), (d), (f), and (g) of this section)] (as \n     modified by subsections (b), (d), (f), (g), and (m) of this \n     section).\n       (2) Limitation.--\n       (A) In general.--In no case shall the Administrator impose \n     a surcharge under this subsection on any defendant \n     participant included in Subtier 3 of Tiers V or VI as \n     described under section 203.\n       (B) Reallocation.--Any amount not imposed under \n     subparagraph (A) shall be reallocated on a pro-rata basis, in \n     accordance with each defendant participant's (other than a \n     defendant participant described under subparagraph (A)) \n     relative annual liability under sections 202 and 203 (as \n     modified by subsections (b), (d), (f), and (g) of this \n     section).\n       [(2)](3) Certification.--\n       (A) In general.--Before imposing a guaranteed payment \n     surcharge under this subsection, the Administrator shall \n     certify that he or she has used all reasonable efforts to \n     collect mandatory payments for all defendant participants, \n     including by using the authority in subsection (i)(9) of this \n     section and section 223.\n       (B) Notice and comment.--Before making a final \n     certification under subparagraph (C), the Administrator shall \n     publish a notice in the Federal Register of a proposed \n     certification and provide in such notice for a public comment \n     period of 30 days.\n       (C) Final certification.--\n       (i) In general.--The Administrator shall publish a notice \n     of the final certification in the Federal Register after \n     consideration of all comments submitted under subparagraph \n     (B).\n       (ii) Written notice.--Not later than 30 days after \n     publishing any final certification under clause (i), the \n     Administrator shall provide each defendant participant with \n     written notice of that defendant participant's payment, \n     including the amount of any surcharge.\n       (m) Adjustments for Distributors.--\n       (1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term \n     ``distributor'' means a person--\n       (A) whose prior asbestos expenditures arise exclusively \n     from the sale of products manufactured by others;\n       (B) who did not prior to December 31, 2002, sell raw \n     asbestos or a product containing more than 95 percent \n     asbestos by weight;\n       (C) whose prior asbestos expenditures did not arise out \n     of--\n       (i) the manufacture, installation, repair, reconditioning, \n     maintaining, servicing, constructing, or remanufacturing of \n     any product;\n       (ii) the control of the design, specification, or \n     manufacture of any product; or\n       (iii) the sale or resale of any product under, as part of, \n     or under the auspices of, its own brand, trademark, or \n     service mark; and\n       (D) who is not subject to assignment under section 202 to \n     Tier I, II, III or VII.\n       (2) Tier reassignment for distributors.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding section 202, the \n     Administrator shall assign a distributor to a Tier for \n     purposes of this title under the procedures set forth in this \n     paragraph.\n       (B) Designation.--After a final determination by the \n     Administrator under section 204(i), any person who is, or any \n     affiliated group in which every member is, a distributor may \n     apply to the Administrator for adjustment of its Tier \n     assignment under this subsection. Such application shall be \n     prepared in accordance with such procedures as the \n     Administrator shall promulgate by rule. Once the \n     Administrator designates a person or affiliated group as a \n     distributor under this subsection, such designation and the \n     adjustment of tier assignment under this subsection are \n     final.\n       (C) Payments.--Any person or affiliated group that seeks \n     adjustment of its Tier assignment under this subsection shall \n     pay all amounts required of it under this title until a final \n     determination by the Administrator is made under this \n     subsection. Such payments may not be stayed pending any \n     appeal. The Administrator shall grant any person or \n     affiliated group a refund or credit of any payments made if \n     such adjustment results in a lower payment obligation.\n       (D) Adjustment.--Subject to paragraph (3), any person or \n     affiliated group that the Administrator has designated as a \n     distributor under this subsection shall be given an \n     adjustment of Tier assignment as follows:\n       (i) A distributor that but for this subsection would be \n     assigned to Tier IV shall be deemed assigned to Tier V.\n       (ii) A distributor that but for this subsection would be \n     assigned to Tier V shall be deemed assigned to Tier VI.\n\n[[Page S807]]\n\n       (iii) A distributor that but for this subsection would be \n     assigned to Tier VI shall be deemed assigned to no Tier and \n     shall have no obligation to make any payment to the Fund \n     under this Act.\n       (E) Exclusive to inequity adjustment.--Any person or \n     affiliated group designated by the Administrator as a \n     distributor under this subsection shall not be eligible for \n     an inequity adjustment under subsection 204(d).\n       (3) Limitation on adjustments.--The aggregate total of \n     distributor adjustments under this subsection in effect in \n     any given year shall not exceed $50,000,000. If the aggregate \n     total of distributors adjustments under this subsection would \n     otherwise exceed $50,000,000, then each distributor's \n     adjustment shall be reduced pro rata until the aggregate of \n     all adjustments equals $50,000,000.\n       (4) Rehearing.--A defendant participant has a right to \n     obtain a rehearing of the Administrator's determination on an \n     adjustment under this subsection under the procedures \n     prescribed in subsection (i)(10).\n\n     SEC. 205. STEPDOWNS AND FUNDING HOLIDAYS.\n\n       (a) Stepdowns.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the minimum \n     aggregate annual funding obligation under section 204(h) \n     shall be reduced by 10 percent of the initial minimum \n     aggregate funding obligation at the end of the tenth, \n     fifteenth, twentieth, and twenty-fifth years after the date \n     of enactment of this Act. The reductions under this paragraph \n     shall be applied on an equal pro rata basis to the funding \n     obligations of all defendant participants, except with \n     respect to defendant participants in Tier 1, Subtiers 2 and \n     3, and class action trusts.\n       (2) Limitation.--The Administrator shall suspend, cancel, \n     reduce, or delay any reduction under paragraph (1) if at any \n     time the Administrator finds, in accordance with subsection \n     (c), that such action is necessary and appropriate to ensure \n     that the assets of the Fund and expected future payments \n     remain sufficient to satisfy the Fund's anticipated \n     obligations.\n       (b) Funding Holidays.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Administrator determines, at any \n     time after 10 years following the date of enactment of this \n     Act, that the assets of the Fund at the time of such \n     determination and expected future payments, taking into \n     consideration any reductions under subsection (a), are \n     sufficient to satisfy the Fund's anticipated obligations \n     without the need for all, or any portion of, that year's \n     payment otherwise required under this subtitle, the \n     Administrator shall reduce or waive all or any part of the \n     payments required from defendant participants for that year.\n       (2) Annual review.--The Administrator shall undertake the \n     review required by this subsection and make the necessary \n     determination under paragraph (1) every year.\n       (3) Limitations on funding holidays.--Any reduction or \n     waiver of the defendant participants' funding obligations \n     shall--\n       (A) be made only to the extent the Administrator determines \n     that the Fund will still be able to satisfy all of its \n     anticipated obligations; and\n       (B) be applied on an equal pro rata basis to the funding \n     obligations of all defendant participants, except with \n     respect to defendant participants in Subtiers 2 and 3 of Tier \n     I and class action trusts, for that year.\n       (4) New information.--If at any time the Administrator \n     determines that a reduction or waiver under this section may \n     cause the assets of the Fund and expected future payments to \n     decrease to a level at which the Fund may not be able to \n     satisfy all of its anticipated obligations, the Administrator \n     shall revoke all or any part of such reduction or waiver to \n     the extent necessary to ensure that the Fund's obligations \n     are met. Such revocations shall be applied on an equal pro \n     rata basis to the funding obligations of all defendant \n     participants, except defendant participants in Subtiers 2 and \n     3 of Tier I and class action trusts, for that year.\n       (c) Certification.--\n       (1) In general.--Before suspending, canceling, reducing, or \n     delaying any reduction under subsection (a) or granting or \n     revoking a reduction or waiver under subsection (b), the \n     Administrator shall certify that the requirements of this \n     section are satisfied.\n       (2) Notice and comment.--Before making a final \n     certification under this subsection, the Administrator shall \n     publish a notice in the Federal Register of a proposed \n     certification and a statement of the basis therefor and \n     provide in such notice for a public comment period of 30 \n     days.\n       (3) Final certification.--\n       (A) In general.--The Administrator shall publish a notice \n     of the final certification in the Federal Register after \n     consideration of all comments submitted under paragraph (2).\n       (B) Written notice.--Not later than 30 days after \n     publishing any final certification under subparagraph (A), \n     the Administrator shall provide each defendant participant \n     with written notice of that defendant's funding obligation \n     for that year.\n\n     SEC. 206. ACCOUNTING TREATMENT.\n\n       Defendant participants payment obligations to the Fund \n     shall be subject to discounting under the applicable \n     accounting guidelines for generally accepted accounting \n     purposes and statutory accounting purposes for each defendant \n     participant. This section shall in no way reduce the amount \n     of monetary payments to the Fund by defendant participants as \n     required under section 202(a)(2).\n\n                Subtitle B--Asbestos Insurers Commission\n\n     SEC. 210.

ESTABLISHMENT OF ASBESTOS INSURERS COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established the Asbestos \n     Insurers Commission (referred to in this subtitle as the \n     ``Commission'') to carry out the duties described in section \n     212.\n       (b) Membership.--\n       (1) Appointment.--The Commission shall be composed of 5 \n     members who shall be appointed by the President, by and with \n     the advice and consent of the Senate.\n       (2) Qualifications.--\n       (A) Expertise.--Members of the Commission shall have \n     sufficient expertise to fulfill their responsibilities under \n     this subtitle.\n       (B) Conflict of interest.--\n       (i) In general.--No member of the Commission appointed \n     under paragraph (1) may be an employee or immediate family \n     member of an employee of an insurer participant. No member of \n     the Commission shall be a shareholder of any insurer \n     participant.

DUTIES OF ASBESTOS INSURERS COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Determination of Insurer Payment Obligations.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Definitions.--For the purposes of this Act, the terms \n     ``insurer'' and ``insurer participant'' shall, unless stated \n     otherwise, include direct insurers and reinsurers, as well as \n     any run-off entity established, in whole or in part, to \n     review and pay asbestos claims.\n       (B) Procedures for determining insurer payments.--The \n     Commission shall determine the amount that each insurer \n     participant shall be required to pay into the Fund under the \n     procedures described in this section. The Commission shall \n     make this determination by first promulgating a rule \n     establishing a methodology for allocation of payments among \n     insurer participants and then applying such methodology to \n     determine the individual payment for each insurer \n     participant. The methodology may include 1 or more allocation \n     formulas to be applied to all insurer participants or groups \n     of similarly situated participants. The Commission's rule \n     shall include a methodology for adjusting payments by insurer \n     participants [to make up, during any applicable payment year, \n     any amount by which aggregate insurer payments fall below the \n     level required in paragraph (3)(C).] to make up, during the \n     first 5 years of the life of the Fund and any subsequent \n     years as provided in section 405(e) for any reduction in an \n     insurer participant's annual allocated amount caused by the \n     granting of a financial hardship or exceptional circumstance \n     adjustment under this section, and any amount by which \n     aggregate insurer payments fall below the level required \n     under paragraph (3)(C) by reason of the failure or refusal of \n     any insurer participant to make a required payment, or for \n     any other reason that causes such payments to fall below the \n     level required under paragraph (3)(C). The Commission shall \n     conduct a thorough study (within the time limitations under \n     this subparagraph) of the accuracy of the reserve allocation \n     of each insurer participant, and may request information from \n     the Securities and Exchange Commission or any State \n     regulatory agency. Under this procedure, not later than 120 \n     days after the initial meeting of the Commission, the \n     Commission shall commence a rulemaking proceeding under\n\n[[Page S808]]\n\n     section 213(a) to propose and adopt a methodology for \n     allocating payments among insurer participants. In proposing \n     an allocation methodology, the Commission may consult with \n     such actuaries and other experts as it deems appropriate. \n     After hearings and public comment on the proposed allocation \n     methodology, the Commission shall as promptly as possible \n     promulgate a final rule establishing such methodology. After \n     promulgation of the final rule, the Commission shall \n     determine the individual payment of each insurer participant \n     under the procedures set forth in subsection (b).\n       (C) Scope.--Every insurer, reinsurer, and runoff entity \n     with asbestos-related obligations in the United States shall \n     be subject to the Commission's and Administrator's authority \n     under this Act, including allocation determinations, and \n     shall be required to fulfill its payment obligation without \n     regard as to whether it is licensed in the United States. \n     Every insurer participant not licensed or domiciled in the \n     United States shall, upon the first payment to the Fund, \n     submit a written consent to the Commission's and \n     Administrator's authority under this Act, and to the \n     jurisdiction of the courts of the United States for purposes \n     of enforcing this Act, in a form determined by the \n     Administrator. Any insurer participant refusing to provide a \n     written consent shall be subject to fines and penalties as \n     provided in section 223.\n       (D) Issuers of finite risk policies.--\n       (i) In general.--The issuer of any policy of retrospective \n     reinsurance purchased by an insurer participant or its \n     affiliate after 1990 that provides for a risk or loss \n     transfer to insure for [incurred] asbestos losses and other \n     losses (both known and unknown), including those policies \n     commonly referred to as ``finite risk'', ``aggregate stop \n     loss'', ``aggregate excess of loss'', or ``loss portfolio \n     transfer'' policies, shall be obligated to make payments \n     required under this Act directly to the Fund on behalf of the \n     insurer participant who is the beneficiary of such policy, \n     subject to the underlying retention and the limits of \n     liability applicable to such policy.\n       (ii) Payments.--Payments to the Fund required under this \n     Act shall be treated as loss payments for asbestos bodily \n     injury (as if such payments were incurred as liabilities \n     imposed in the tort system) and shall not be subject to \n     exclusion under policies described under clause (i) as a \n     liability with respect to tax or assessment. Within 90 days \n     after the scheduled date to make an annual payment to the \n     Fund, the insurer participant shall, at its discretion, \n     direct the reinsurer issuing such policy to pay all or a \n     portion of the annual payment directly to the Fund up to the \n     full applicable limits of liability under the policy. The \n     reinsurer issuing such policy shall be obligated to make such \n     payments directly to the Fund and shall be subject to the \n     enforcement provisions under section 223. The insurer \n     participant shall remain obligated to make payment to the \n     Fund of that portion of the annual payment not directed to \n     the issuer of such reinsurance policy.\n       (2) Amount of payments.--\n       (A) Aggregate payment obligation.--The total payment \n     required of all insurer participants over the life of the \n     Fund shall be equal to $46,025,000,000, less any bankruptcy \n     trust credits under section 222(d).\n       (B) Accounting standards.--In determining the payment \n     obligations of participants that are not licensed or \n     domiciled in the United States or that are runoff entities, \n     the Commission shall use accounting standards required for \n     United States licensed direct insurers.\n       (C) Captive insurance companies.--No payment to the Fund \n     shall be required from a captive insurance company, unless \n     and only to the extent a captive insurance company, on the \n     date of enactment of this Act, has liability, directly or \n     indirectly, for any asbestos claim of a person or persons \n     other than and unaffiliated with its ultimate parent or \n     affiliated group or pool in which the ultimate parent \n     participates or participated, or unaffiliated with a person \n     that was its ultimate parent or a member of its affiliated \n     group or pool at the time the relevant insurance or \n     reinsurance was issued by the captive insurance company.\n       (D) Several liability.--Unless otherwise provided under \n     this Act, each insurer participant's obligation to make \n     payments to the Fund is several. Unless otherwise provided \n     under this Act, there is no joint liability, and the future \n     insolvency by any insurer participant shall not affect the \n     payment required of any other insurer participant.\n       (3) Payment of criteria.--\n       (A) Inclusion in insurer participant category.--\n       (i) In general.--Insurers that have paid, or been assessed \n     by a legal judgment or settlement, at least $1,000,000 in \n     defense and indemnity costs before the date of enactment of \n     this Act in response to claims for compensation for asbestos \n     injuries arising from a policy of liability insurance or \n     contract of liability reinsurance or retrocessional \n     reinsurance shall be insurer participants in the Fund. Other \n     insurers shall be exempt from mandatory payments.\n       (ii) Inapplicability of section 202.--Since insurers may be \n     subject in certain jurisdictions to direct action suits, and \n     it is not the intent of this Act to impose upon an insurer, \n     due to its operation as an insurer, payment obligations to \n     the Fund in situations where the insurer is the subject of a \n     direct action, no insurer subject to mandatory payments under \n     this section [212] shall also be liable for payments to the \n     Fund as a defendant participant under section 202.\n       (B) Insurer participant allocation methodology.--\n       (i) In general.--The Commission shall establish the payment \n     obligations of individual insurer participants to reflect, on \n     an equitable basis, the relative tort system liability of the \n     participating insurers in the absence of this Act, \n     considering and weighting, as appropriate (but exclusive of \n     workers' compensation), such factors as--\n\n       (I) historic premium for lines of insurance associated with \n     asbestos exposure over relevant periods of time;\n       (II) recent loss experience for asbestos liability;\n       (III) amounts reserved for asbestos liability;\n       (IV) the likely cost to each insurer participant of its \n     future liabilities under applicable insurance policies; and\n       (V) any other factor the Commission may determine is \n     relevant and appropriate.\n\n       (ii) Determination of reserves.--The Commission may \n     establish procedures and standards for determination of the \n     asbestos reserves of insurer participants. The reserves of a \n     United States licensed reinsurer that is wholly owned by, or \n     under common control of, a United States licensed direct \n     insurer shall be included as part of the direct insurer's \n     reserves when the reinsurer's financial results are included \n     as part of the direct insurer's United States operations, as \n     reflected in footnote 33 of its filings with the National \n     Association of Insurance Commissioners or in published \n     financial statements prepared in accordance with generally \n     accepted accounting principles.\n       (C) Payment schedule.--The aggregate annual amount of \n     payments by insurer participants over the life of the Fund \n     shall be as follows:\n       (i) For years 1 and 2, $2,700,000,000 annually.\n       (ii) For years 3 through 5, $5,075,000,000 annually.\n       (iii) For years 6 through 27, $1,147,000,000 annually.\n       (iv) For year 28, $166,000,000.\n       (D) Certain runoff entities.--\n       [(i) In general.--Whenever the Commission requires payments \n     by a runoff entity that has assumed asbestos-related \n     liabilities from a Lloyd's syndicate or names that are \n     members of such a syndicate, the Commission shall not require \n     payments from such syndicates and names to the extent that \n     the runoff entity makes its required payments. In addition, \n     such syndicates and names shall be required to make payments \n     to the Fund in the amount of any adjustment granted to the \n     runoff entity for severe financial hardship or exceptional \n     circumstances.]\n       [(ii) Included runoff entities.--Subject to clause (i), a] \n     A runoff entity shall include any direct insurer or reinsurer \n     whose asbestos liability reserves have been transferred, \n     directly or indirectly, to the runoff entity and on whose \n     behalf the runoff entity handles or adjusts and, where \n     appropriate, pays asbestos claims.\n       (E) Financial hardship and exceptional circumstance \n     adjustments.--\n       (i) In general.--Under the procedures established in \n     subsection (b), an insurer participant may seek adjustment of \n     the amount of its payments based on exceptional circumstances \n     or severe financial hardship.\n       (ii) Financial adjustments.--An insurer participant may \n     qualify for an adjustment based on severe financial hardship \n     by demonstrating that payment of the amounts required by the \n     Commission's methodology would jeopardize the solvency of \n     such participant.\n       (iii) Exceptional circumstance adjustment.--An insurer \n     participant may qualify for an adjustment based on \n     exceptional circumstances by demonstrating--\n\n       (I) that the amount of its payments under the Commission's \n     allocation methodology is exceptionally inequitable when \n     measured against the amount of the likely cost to the \n     participant of its future liability in the tort system in the \n     absence of the Fund;\n       (II) an offset credit as described in subparagraphs (A) and \n     (C) of subsection (b)(4); or\n       (III) other exceptional circumstances.\n\n     The Commission may determine whether to grant an adjustment \n     and the size of any [such adjustment, but adjustments shall \n     not reduce the aggregate payment obligations] such \n     adjustment, but except as provided under paragraph (1)(B), \n     subsection (f)(3), and section 405(e), any such adjustment \n     shall not affect the aggregate payment obligations of insurer \n     participants specified in paragraph (2)(A) and subparagraph \n     (C) of this paragraph.\n       (iv) Time period of adjustment.--Except for adjustments for \n     offset credits, adjustments granted under this subsection \n     shall have a term not to exceed 3 years. An insurer \n     participant may renew its adjustment by demonstrating to the \n     Administrator that it remains justified.\n       (F) Funding holidays.--\n       (i) In general.--If the Administrator determines, at any \n     time after 10 years following the date of enactment of this \n     Act, that the assets of the Fund at the time of such \n     determination and expected future payments are sufficient to \n     satisfy the Fund's anticipated obligations without the need \n     for all, or any portion of, that year's payment otherwise \n     required under this subtitle, the Administrator shall reduce \n     or waive all or any part of the payments required from \n     insurer participants for that year.\n       (ii) Annual review.--The Administrator shall undertake the \n     review required by this subsection and make the necessary \n     determination under clause (i) every year.\n\n[[Page S809]]\n\n       (iii) Limitations of funding holidays.--Any reduction or \n     waiver of the insurer participants' funding obligations \n     shall--\n\n       (I) be made only to the extent the Administrator determines \n     that the Fund will still be able to satisfy all of its \n     anticipated obligations; and\n       (II) be applied on an equal pro rata basis to the funding \n     obligations of all insurer participants for that year.\n\n       (iv) New information.--If at any time the Administrator \n     determines that a reduction or waiver under this section may \n     cause the assets of the Fund and expected future payments to \n     decrease to a level at which the Fund may not be able to \n     satisfy all of its anticipated obligations, the Administrator \n     shall revoke all or any part of such reduction or waiver to \n     the extent necessary to ensure that the Fund's obligations \n     are met. Such revocations shall be applied on an equal pro \n     rata basis to the funding obligations of all insurer \n     participants for that year.\n       (b) Procedure for Notifying Insurer Participants of \n     Individual Payment Obligations.--\n       (1) Notice to participants.--Not later than 30 days after \n     promulgation of the final rule establishing an allocation \n     methodology under subsection (a)(1), the Commission shall--\n       (A) directly notify all reasonably identifiable insurer \n     participants of the requirement to submit information \n     necessary to calculate the amount of any required payment to \n     the Fund under the allocation methodology; and\n       (B) publish in the Federal Register a notice--\n       (i) requiring any person who may be an insurer participant \n     (as determined by criteria outlined in the notice) to submit \n     such information; and\n       (ii) that includes a list of all insurer participants \n     notified by the Commission under subparagraph (A), and \n     provides for 30 days for the submission of comments or \n     information regarding the completeness and accuracy of the \n     list of identified insurer participants.\n       (2) Response required by individual insurer participants.--\n       (A) In general.--Any person who receives notice under \n     paragraph (1)(A), and any other person meeting the criteria \n     specified in the notice published under paragraph (1)(B), \n     shall respond by providing the Commission with all the \n     information requested in the notice under a schedule or by a \n     date established by the Commission.\n       (B) Certification.--The response submitted under \n     subparagraph (A) shall be signed by a responsible corporate \n     officer, general partner, proprietor, or individual of \n     similar authority, who shall certify under penalty of law the \n     completeness and accuracy of the information submitted.\n       (3) Notice to insurer participants of initial payment \n     determination.--\n       (A) In general.--\n       (i) Notice to insurers.--Not later than 120 days after \n     receipt of the information required by paragraph (2), the \n     Commission shall send each insurer participant a notice of \n     initial determination requiring payments to the Fund, which \n     shall be based on the information received from the \n     participant in response to the Commission's request for \n     information. An insurer participant's payments shall be \n     payable over the schedule established in subsection \n     (a)(3)(C), in annual amounts proportionate to the aggregate \n     annual amount of payments for all insurer participants for \n     the applicable year.\n       (ii) Public notice.--Not later than 7 days after sending \n     the notification of initial determination to insurer \n     participants, the Commission shall publish in the Federal \n     Register a notice listing the insurer participants that have \n     been sent such notification, and the initial determination on \n     the payment obligation of each identified participant.\n       (B) No response; incomplete response.--If no response is \n     received from an insurer participant, or if the response is \n     incomplete, the initial determination requiring a payment \n     from the insurer participant shall be based on the best \n     information available to the Commission.\n       (4) Commission review, revision, and finalization of \n     initial payment determinations.--\n       (A) Comments from insurer participants.--Not later than 30 \n     days after receiving a notice of initial determination from \n     the Commission, an insurer participant may provide the \n     Commission with additional information to support adjustments \n     to the required payments to reflect severe financial hardship \n     or exceptional circumstances, including the provision of an \n     offset credit for an insurer participant for the amount of \n     any asbestos-related payments it made or was legally \n     obligated to make, including payments released from an \n     escrow, as the result of a bankruptcy judicially confirmed \n     after May 22, 2003, but before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (B) Additional participants.--If, before the final \n     determination of the Commission, the Commission receives \n     information that an additional person may qualify as an \n     insurer participant, the Commission shall require such person \n     to submit information necessary to determine whether payments \n     from that person should be required, in accordance with the \n     requirements of this subsection.\n       (C) Revision procedures.--The Commission shall adopt \n     procedures for revising initial payments based on information \n     received under subparagraphs (A) and (B), including a \n     provision requiring an offset credit for an insurer \n     participant for the amount of any asbestos-related payments \n     it made or was legally obligated to make, including payments \n     released from an escrow, as the result of a bankruptcy \n     confirmed after May 22, 2003, but before the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (5) Examinations and subpoenas.--\n       (A) Examinations.--The Commission may conduct examinations \n     of the books and records of insurer participants to determine \n     the completeness and accuracy of information submitted, or \n     required to be submitted, to the Commission for purposes of \n     determining participant payments.\n       (B) Subpoenas.--The Commission may request the Attorney \n     General to subpoena persons to compel testimony, records, and \n     other information relevant to its responsibilities under this \n     section. The Attorney General may enforce such subpoena in \n     appropriate proceedings in the United States district court \n     for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena was \n     addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.\n       (6) Escrow payments.--Without regard to an insurer \n     participant's payment obligation under this section, any \n     escrow or similar account established before the date of \n     enactment of this Act by an insurer participant in connection \n     with an asbestos trust fund that has not been judicially \n     confirmed by final order by the date of enactment of this Act \n     shall be the property of the insurer participant and returned \n     to that insurer participant.\n       (7) Notice to insurer participants of final payment \n     determinations.--Not later than 60 days after the notice of \n     initial determination is sent to the insurer participants, \n     the Commission shall send each insurer participant a notice \n     of final determination.\n       (c) Insurer Participants Voluntary Allocation Agreement.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the \n     Commission proposes its rule establishing an allocation \n     methodology under subsection (a)(1), direct insurer \n     participants licensed or domiciled in the United States, \n     other direct insurer participants, reinsurer participants \n     licensed or domiciled in the United States, or other \n     reinsurer participants, may submit an allocation agreement, \n     approved by all of the participants in the applicable group, \n     to the Commission.\n       (2) Allocation agreement.--To the extent the participants \n     in any such applicable group voluntarily agree upon an \n     allocation arrangement, any such allocation agreement shall \n     only govern the allocation of payments within that group and \n     shall not determine the aggregate amount due from that group.\n       (3) Certification.--The Commission shall determine whether \n     an allocation agreement submitted under subparagraph (A) \n     meets the requirements of this subtitle and, if so, shall \n     certify the agreement as establishing the allocation \n     methodology governing the individual payment obligations of \n     the participants who are parties to the agreement. The \n     authority of the Commission under this subtitle shall, with \n     respect to participants who are parties to a certified \n     allocation agreement, terminate on the day after the \n     Commission certifies such agreement. Under subsection (f), \n     the Administrator shall assume responsibility, if necessary, \n     for calculating the individual payment obligations of \n     participants who are parties to the certified agreement.\n       (d) Commission Report.--\n       (1) Recipients.--Until the work of the Commission has been \n     completed and the Commission terminated, the Commission shall \n     submit an annual report, containing the information described \n     under paragraph (2), to--\n       (A) the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate;\n       (B) the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (C) the Administrator.\n       (2) Contents.--The report under paragraph (1) shall state \n     the amount that each insurer participant is required to pay \n     to the Fund, including the payment schedule for such \n     payments.\n       [(e) Interim Payments.--\n       [(1) Authority of administrator.--During the period between \n     the date of enactment of this Act and the date when the \n     Commission issues its final determinations of payments, the \n     Administrator shall have the authority to require insurer \n     participants to make interim payments to the Fund to assure \n     adequate funding by insurer participants during such period.\n       [(2) Amount of interim payments.--During any applicable \n     year, the Administrator may require insurer participants to \n     make aggregate interim payments not to exceed the annual \n     aggregate amount specified in subsection (a)(3)(C).\n       [(3) Allocation of payments.--Interim payments shall be \n     allocated among individual insurer participants on an \n     equitable basis as determined by the Administrator. All \n     payments required under this subparagraph shall be credited \n     against the participant's ultimate payment obligation to the \n     Fund established by the Commission. If an interim payment \n     exceeds the ultimate payment, the Fund shall pay interest on \n     the amount of the overpayment at a rate determined by the \n     Administrator. If the ultimate payment exceeds the interim \n     payment, the participant shall pay interest on the amount of \n     the underpayment at the same rate. Any participant may seek \n     an exemption from or reduction in any payment required under \n     this subsection under the financial hardship and exceptional \n     circumstance standards established in subsection (a)(3)(D).\n\n[[Page S810]]\n\n       [(4) Appeal of interim payment decisions.--A decision by \n     the Administrator to establish an interim payment obligation \n     shall be considered final agency action and reviewable under \n     section 303, except that the reviewing court may not stay an \n     interim payment during the pendency of the appeal.]\n       (e) Interim Payments.--\n       (1) Amount of interim payment.--Within 90 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, insurer participants shall \n     make an aggregate payment to the Fund not to exceed 50 \n     percent of the aggregate funding obligation specified under \n     subsection (a)(3)(C) for year 1.\n       (2) Reserve information.--Within 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, each insurer participant shall submit \n     to the Administrator a certified statement of its net held \n     reserves for asbestos liabilities as of December 31, 2004.\n       (3) Allocation of interim payment.--The Administrator shall \n     allocate the interim payment among the individual insurer \n     participants on an equitable basis using the net held \n     asbestos reserve information provided by insurer participants \n     under subsection (a)(3)(B). Within 60 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall publish in the \n     Federal Register the name of each insurer participant, and \n     the amount of the insurer participant's allocated share of \n     the interim payment. The use of net held asbestos reserves as \n     the basis to determine an interim allocation shall not be \n     binding on the Administrator in the determination of an \n     appropriate final allocation methodology under this section. \n     All payments required under this paragraph shall be credited \n     against the participant's ultimate payment obligation to the \n     Fund established by the Commission. If an interim payment \n     exceeds the ultimate payment, the Fund shall pay interest on \n     the amount of the overpayment at a rate determined by the \n     Administrator. If the ultimate payment exceeds the interim \n     payment, the participant shall pay interest on the amount of \n     the underpayment at the same rate. Any participant may seek \n     an exemption from or reduction in any payment required under \n     this subsection under the financial hardship and exceptional \n     circumstance standards established under subsection \n     (a)(3)(E).\n       (4) Appeal of interim payment decisions.--A decision by the \n     Administrator to establish an interim payment obligation \n     shall be considered final agency action and reviewable under \n     section 303, except that the reviewing court may not stay an \n     interim payment during the pendency of the appeal.\n       (f) Transfer of Authority From the Commission to the \n     Administrator.--\n       (1) In general.--Upon termination of the Commission under \n     section 215, the Administrator shall assume all the \n     responsibilities and authority of the Commission, except that \n     the Administrator shall not have the power to modify the \n     allocation methodology established by the Commission or by \n     certified agreement or to promulgate a rule establishing any \n     such methodology.\n       (2) Financial hardship and exceptional circumstance \n     adjustments.--Upon termination of the Commission under \n     section 215, the Administrator shall have the authority, upon \n     application by any insurer participant, to make adjustments \n     to annual payments upon the same grounds as provided in \n     subsection (a)(3)(D). Adjustments granted under this \n     subsection shall have a term not to exceed 3 years. An \n     insurer participant may renew its adjustment by demonstrating \n     that it remains justified. Upon the grant of any adjustment, \n     the Administrator shall increase the payments, consistent \n     with subsection (a)(1)(B), required of all other insurer \n     participants so that there is no reduction in the aggregate \n     payment required of all insurer participants for the \n     applicable years. The increase in an insurer participant's \n     required payment shall be in proportion to such participant's \n     share of the aggregate payment obligation of all insurer \n     participants.\n       (3) Credits for shortfall assessments.--If insurer \n     participants are required during the first 5 years of the \n     life of the Fund to make up any shortfall in required insurer \n     payments under subsection (a)(1)(B), then, beginning in year \n     6, the Administrator shall grant each insurer participant a \n     credit against its annual required payments during the \n     applicable years that in the aggregate equal the amount of \n     shortfall assessments paid by such insurer participant during \n     the first 5 years of the life of the Fund. The credit shall \n     be prorated over the same number of years as the number of \n     years during which the insurer participant paid a shortfall \n     assessment. Insurer participants which did not pay all \n     required payments to the Fund during the first 5 years of the \n     life of the Fund shall not be eligible for a credit. The \n     Administrator shall not grant a credit for shortfall \n     assessments imposed under section 405(e).\n       [(3)](4) Financial security requirements.--Whenever an \n     insurer participant's A.M. Best's claims payment rating or \n     Standard and Poor's financial strength rating falls below A-, \n     and until such time as either the insurer participant's A.M. \n     Best's Rating or Standard and Poor's rating is equal to or \n     greater than A-, the Administrator shall have the authority \n     to require that the participating insurer either--\n       (A) pay the present value of its remaining Fund payments at \n     a discount rate determined by the Administrator; or\n       (B) provide an evergreen letter of credit or financial \n     guarantee for future payments issued by an institution with \n     an A.M. Best's claims payment rating or Standard & Poor's \n     financial strength rating of at least A+.\n       (g) Accounting Treatment.--Insurer participants' payment \n     obligations to the Fund shall be subject to discounting under \n     the applicable accounting guidelines for generally accepted \n     accounting purposes and statutory accounting purposes for \n     each insurer participant. This subsection shall in no way \n     reduce the amount of monetary payments to the Fund by insurer \n     participants as required under subsection (a).\n       [(g)](h) Judicial Review.--The Commission's rule \n     establishing an allocation methodology, its final \n     determinations of payment obligations and other final action \n     shall be judicially reviewable as provided in title III.\n\n     SEC. 213. POWERS OF ASBESTOS INSURERS COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Rulemaking.--The Commission shall promulgate such rules \n     and regulations as necessary to implement its authority under \n     this Act, including regulations governing an allocation \n     methodology. Such rules and regulations shall be promulgated \n     after providing interested parties with the opportunity for \n     notice and comment.\n       (b) Hearings.--The Commission may hold such hearings, sit \n     and act at such times and places, take such testimony, and \n     receive such evidence as the Commission considers advisable \n     to carry out this Act.

In pursuing an investment strategy under this \n     subparagraph, the Administrator shall consider, to the extent \n     relevant to an investment decision or action--\n       (A) the size of the Fund;\n       (B) the nature and estimated duration of the Fund;\n       (C) the liquidity and distribution requirements of the \n     Fund;\n       (D) general economic conditions at the time of the \n     investment;\n       (E) the possible effect of inflation or deflation on Fund \n     assets;\n       (F) the role that each investment or course of action plays \n     with respect to the overall assets of the Fund;\n       (G) the expected amount to be earned (including both income \n     and appreciation of capital) through investment of amounts in \n     the Fund;

No court, Federal or State, may \n     enjoin the transfer of assets by a trust to the Fund in \n     accordance with this subsection pending resolution of any \n     litigation challenging such transfer or the validity of this \n     subsection or of any provision of the Fairness in Asbestos \n     Injury Resolution Act of 2005, and an interlocutory order \n     denying such relief shall not be subject to immediate appeal \n     under section 1291(a) of title 28.\n       ``(B) Availability of fund assets.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, once such a transfer has been made, \n     the assets of the Fund shall be available to satisfy any \n     final judgment entered in such an action and such transfer \n     shall no longer be subject to any appeal or review--\n       ``(i) declaring that the transfer effected a taking of a \n     right or property for which an individual is constitutionally \n     entitled to just compensation; or\n       ``(ii) requiring the transfer back to a trust of any or all \n     assets transferred by that trust to the Fund.\n       ``(4) Jurisdiction.--Solely for purposes of implementing \n     this subsection, personal jurisdiction over every covered \n     trust, the trustees thereof, and any other necessary party, \n     and exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over every question \n     arising out of or related to this subsection, shall be vested \n     in the United States District Court for the District of \n     Columbia. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     including section 1127 of this title, that court may make any \n     order necessary and appropriate to facilitate prompt \n     compliance with this subsection, including assuming \n     jurisdiction over and modifying, to the extent necessary, any \n     applicable confirmation order or other order with continuing \n     and prospective application to a covered trust. The court may \n     also resolve any related challenge to the constitutionality \n     of this subsection or of its application to any trust, \n     trustee, or individual claimant. The Administrator of the \n     Fund may bring an action seeking such an order or \n     modification, under the standards of rule 60(b) of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or otherwise, and shall be \n     entitled to intervene as of right in any action brought by \n     any other party seeking interpretation, application, or \n     invalidation of this subsection. Any order denying relief \n     that would facilitate prompt compliance with the transfer \n     provisions of this subsection shall be subject to immediate \n     appeal under section 304 of the Fairness in Asbestos Injury \n     Resolution Act of 2005. Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of this paragraph, for purposes of implementing the sunset \n     provisions of section 402(f) of such Act which apply to \n     asbestos trusts and the class action trust, the bankruptcy \n     court or United States district court having jurisdiction \n     over any such trust as of the date of enactment of such Act \n     shall retain such jurisdiction.''.\n       (g) No Avoidance of Transfer.--Section 546 of title 11, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(h) Notwithstanding the rights and powers of a trustee \n     under sections 544, 545, 547, 548, 549, and 550 of this \n     title, if a debtor is a participant (as that term is defined \n     in section 3 of the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution \n     Act of 2005), the trustee may not avoid a transfer made by \n     the debtor under its payment obligations under section 202 or \n     203 of that Act.''.\n       (h) Confirmation of Plan.--Section 1129(a) of title 11, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(14) If the debtor is a participant (as that term is \n     defined in section 3 of the Fairness in Asbestos Injury \n     Resolution Act of 2005), the plan provides for the \n     continuation after its effective date of payment of all \n     payment obligations under title II of that Act.''.\n       (i) Effect on Insurance Receivership Proceedings.--\n       (1) Lien.--In an insurance receivership proceeding \n     involving a direct insurer, reinsurer or runoff participant, \n     there shall be a lien in favor of the Fund for the amount of \n     any assessment and any such lien shall be given priority over \n     all other claims against the participant in receivership, \n     except for the expenses of administration of the receivership \n     and the perfected claims of the secured creditors. Any State \n     law that provides for priorities inconsistent with this \n     provision is preempted by this Act.\n       (2) Payment of assessment.--Payment of any assessment \n     required by this Act shall not be subject to any automatic or \n     judicially entered stay in any insurance receivership \n     proceeding. This Act shall preempt any State law requiring \n     that payments by a direct insurer, reinsurer or runoff \n     participant in an insurance receivership proceeding be \n     approved by a court, receiver or other person. Payments of \n     assessments by any direct insurer or reinsurer participant \n     under this Act shall not be subject to the avoidance powers \n     of a receiver or a court in or relating to an insurance \n     receivership proceeding.\n       (j) Standing in Bankruptcy Proceedings.--The Administrator \n     shall have standing in any bankruptcy case involving a debtor \n     participant.

and\n       (ii) the resolution of claims for reimbursement or coverage \n     of liability or paid or incurred loss for which notice was \n     provided to the insurer before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (E) Scheduled payment amounts.--The term ``scheduled \n     payment amounts'' means the future payment obligation to the \n     Fund under this Act from a defendant participant in the \n     amount established under sections 203 and 204.\n       (F) Unearned erosion amount.--The term ``unearned erosion \n     amount'' means, in the event of any early sunset under \n     section 405(f), the difference between the deemed erosion \n     amount and the earned erosion amount.\n       (2) Quantum and timing of erosion.--\n       (A) Erosion upon enactment.--The collective payment \n     obligations to the Fund of the insurer and reinsurer \n     participants as assessed by the Administrator shall be deemed \n     as of the date of enactment of this Act to erode remaining \n     aggregate products limits available to a defendant \n     participant only in an amount of 38.1 percent of each \n     defendant participant's scheduled payment amount.\n       (B) No assertion of claim.--No insurer or reinsurer may \n     assert any claim against a defendant participant or captive \n     insurer for insurance, reinsurance, payment of a deductible, \n     or retrospective premium adjustment arising out of that \n     insurer's or reinsurer's payments to the Fund or the erosion \n     deemed to occur under this section.\n       (C) Policies without certain limits or with exclusion.--\n     Except as provided under subparagraph (E), nothing in this \n     section shall require or permit the erosion of any insurance \n     policy or limit that does not contain an aggregate products \n     limit, or that contains an asbestos exclusion.\n       (D) Treatment of consolidation election.--If an affiliated \n     group elects consolidation as provided in section 204(f), the \n     total erosion of limits for the affiliated group under \n     paragraph (2)(A) shall not exceed [59.64] 38.1 percent of the \n     scheduled payment amount of the single payment obligation for \n     the entire affiliated group. The total erosion of limits for \n     any individual defendant participant in the affiliated group \n     shall not exceed its individual share of [59.64] 38.1 percent \n     of the affiliated group's scheduled payment amount, as \n     measured by the individual defendant participant's percentage \n     share of the affiliated group's prior asbestos expenditures.\n       (E) Rule of construction.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section, nothing in this Act shall be \n     deemed to erode remaining aggregate products limits of a \n     defendant participant that can demonstrate by a reponderance \n     of the evidence that 75 percent of its prior asbestos \n     expenditures were made in defense or satisfaction of asbestos \n     claims alleging bodily injury arising exclusively from the \n     exposure to asbestos at premises owned, rented, or controlled \n     by the defendant participant (a ``premises defendant''). In \n     calculating such percentage, where expenditures were made in \n     defense or satisfaction of asbestos claims alleging bodily \n     injury due to exposure to the defendant participant's \n     products and to asbestos at premises owned, rented, or \n     controlled by the defendant participant, half of such \n     expenditures shall be deemed to be for such premises \n     exposures. If a defendant participant establishes itself as a \n     premises defendant, 75 percent of the payments by such \n     defendant participant shall erode coverage limits, if any, \n     applicable to premises liabilities under applicable law.\n       (3) Method of erosion.--\n       (A) Allocation.--The amount of erosion allocated to each \n     defendant participant shall be allocated among periods in \n     which policies with remaining aggregate product limits are \n     available to that defendant participant pro rata by policy \n     period, in ascending order by attachment point.\n       (B) Other erosion methods.--\n       (i) In general.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the \n     method of erosion of any remaining aggregate products limits \n     which are subject to--\n\n       (I) a coverage-in-place or settlement agreement between a \n     defendant participant and 1 or more insurance participants as \n     of the date of enactment; or\n       (II) a final and nonappealable judgment as of the date of \n     enactment or resulting from a claim for coverage or \n     reimbursement pending as of such date, shall be as specified \n     in such agreement or judgment with regard to erosion \n     applicable to such insurance participants' policies.\n\n       (ii) Remaining limits.--To the extent that a final \n     nonappealable judgment or settlement agreement to which an \n     insurer participant and a defendant participant are parties \n     in effect as of the date of enactment of this Act \n     extinguished a defendant participant's right to seek coverage \n     for asbestos claims under an insurer participant's policies, \n     any remaining limits in such policies shall not be considered \n     to be remaining aggregate products limits under subsection \n     (a)(1)(A).\n       (4) Restoration of aggregate products limits upon early \n     sunset.--\n       (A) Restoration.--In the event of an early sunset, any \n     unearned erosion amount will be\n\n[[Page S820]]\n\n     deemed restored as aggregate products limits available to a \n     defendant participant as of the date of enactment.\n       (B) Method of restoration.--The unearned erosion amount \n     will be deemed restored to each defendant participant's \n     policies in such a manner that the last limits that were \n     deemed eroded at enactment under this subsection are deemed \n     to be the first limits restored upon early sunset.\n       (C) Tolling of coverage claims.--In the event of an early \n     sunset, the applicable statute of limitations and contractual \n     provisions for the filing of claims under any insurance \n     policy with restored aggregate products limits shall be \n     deemed tolled after the date of enactment through the date 6 \n     months after the date of early sunset.\n       (5) Payments by defendant participant.--Payments made by a \n     defendant participant shall be deemed to erode, exhaust, or \n     otherwise satisfy applicable self-insured retentions, \n     deductibles, retrospectively rated premiums, and limits \n     issued by nonparticipating insolvent or captive insurance \n     companies. Reduction of remaining aggregate limits under this \n     subsection shall not limit the right of a defendant \n     participant to collect from any insurer not a participant.\n       (6) Effect on other insurance claims.--Other than as \n     specified in this subsection, this Act does not alter, \n     change, modify, or affect insurance for claims other than \n     asbestos claims.\n       (b) Dispute Resolution Procedure.--\n       (1) Arbitration.--The parties to a dispute regarding the \n     erosion of insurance coverage limits under this section may \n     agree in writing to settle such dispute by arbitration. Any \n     such provision or agreement shall be valid, irrevocable, and \n     enforceable, except for any grounds that exist at law or in \n     equity for revocation of a contract.\n       (2) Title 9, united states code.--Arbitration of such \n     disputes, awards by arbitrators, and confirmation of awards \n     shall be governed by title 9, United States Code, to the \n     extent such title is not inconsistent with this section. In \n     any such arbitration proceeding, the erosion principles \n     provided for under this section shall be binding on the \n     arbitrator, unless the parties agree to the contrary.\n       (3) Final and binding award.--An award by an arbitrator \n     shall be final and binding between the parties to the \n     arbitration, but shall have no force or effect on any other \n     person. The parties to an arbitration may agree that in the \n     event a policy which is the subject matter of an award is \n     subsequently determined to be eroded in a manner different \n     from the manner determined by the arbitration in a judgment \n     rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction from which no \n     appeal can or has been taken, such arbitration award may be \n     modified by any court of competent jurisdiction upon \n     application by any party to the arbitration. Any such \n     modification shall govern the rights and obligations between \n     such parties after the date of such modification.\n       (c) Effect on Nonparticipants.--\n       (1) In general.--No insurance company or reinsurance \n     company that is not a participant, other than a captive \n     insurer, shall be entitled to claim that payments to the Fund \n     erode, exhaust, or otherwise limit the nonparticipant's \n     insurance or reinsurance obligations.\n       (2) Other claims.--Nothing in this Act shall preclude a \n     participant from pursuing any claim for insurance or \n     reinsurance from any person that is not a participant other \n     than a captive insurer.\n       (d) Finite Risk Policies Not Affected.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, except subject to section 212(a)(1)(D), this Act \n     shall not alter, affect or impair any rights or obligations \n     of--\n       (A) any party to an insurance contract that expressly \n     provides coverage for governmental charges or assessments \n     imposed to replace insurance or reinsurance liabilities in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act; or\n       (B) subject to paragraph (2), any person with respect to \n     any insurance [or reinsurance] purchased by a participant \n     after December 31, 1990, that expressly (but not necessarily \n     exclusively) provides coverage for asbestos liabilities, \n     including those policies commonly referred to as ``finite \n     risk'' policies.\n       (2) Limitation.--No person may assert that any amounts paid \n     to the Fund in accordance with this Act are covered by any \n     policy described under paragraph (1)(B) purchased by a \n     defendant participant, unless such policy specifically \n     provides coverage for required payments to a Federal trust \n     fund established by a Federal statute to resolve asbestos \n     injury claims.\n       (e) Effect on Certain Insurance and Reinsurance Claims.--\n       (1) No coverage for fund assessments.--[No] Subject to \n     section 212(a)(1)(D), no participant or captive insurer may \n     pursue an insurance or reinsurance claim against another \n     participant or captive insurer for payments to the Fund \n     required under this Act, except under a [contract] written \n     agreement specifically providing insurance [or reinsurance], \n     reinsurance, or other reimbursement for required payments to \n     a Federal trust fund established by a Federal statute to \n     resolve asbestos injury claims or, where applicable, under \n     finite risk policies under subsection (d).\n       (2) Certain insurance assignments voided.--Any assignment \n     of any rights to insurance coverage for asbestos claims to \n     any person who has asserted an asbestos claim before the date \n     of enactment of this Act, or to any trust, person, or other \n     entity not part of an affiliated group as defined in section \n     201(1) of this Act established or appointed for the purpose \n     of paying asbestos claims which were asserted before such \n     date of enactment, or by any Tier I defendant participant, \n     before any sunset of this Act, shall be null and void. This \n     subsection shall not void or affect in any way any \n     assignments of rights to insurance coverage other than to \n     asbestos claimants or to trusts, persons, or other entities \n     not part of an affiliated group as defined in section 201(1) \n     of this Act established or appointed for the purpose of \n     paying asbestos claims, or by Tier I defendant participants.\n       (3) Insurance claims preserved.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, this Act shall not alter, affect, or \n     impair any rights or obligations of any person with respect \n     to any insurance or reinsurance for amounts that any person \n     pays, has paid, or becomes legally obligated to pay in \n     respect of asbestos or other claims, including claims filed, \n     pursued, or revived under section 405(g), except to the \n     extent that--\n       [(A) such person pays or becomes legally obligated to pay \n     claims that are superseded by section 403;]\n       (A) such claims are preempted, barred, or superseded by \n     section 403;\n       (B) any such rights or obligations of such person with \n     respect to insurance or reinsurance are prohibited by \n     paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (e); or\n       (C) the limits of insurance otherwise available to such \n     participant in respect of asbestos claims are deemed to be \n     eroded under subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 405.

The report shall include a description of changes in \n     the diagnostic, exposure, or medical criteria of section 121 \n     that the Administrator believes may be necessary to protect \n     the Fund from compensating claims not caused by exposure to \n     asbestos.]\n       (c) Claims Analysis and Verification of Unanticipated \n     Claims.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Administrator concludes, on the \n     basis of the annual report submitted under this section, \n     that--\n       (A) the average number of claims that qualify for \n     compensation under a claim level or designation exceeds 125 \n     percent of the number of claims expected to qualify for \n     compensation under that claim level or designation in the \n     most recent Congressional Budget Office estimate of asbestos-\n     injury claims for any 3-year period, the Administrator shall \n     conduct a review of a statistically significant sample of \n     claims qualifying for compensation under the appropriate \n     claim level or designation; or\n       (B) the average number of claims that qualify for \n     compensation under a claim level or designation is less than \n     75 percent of the number of claims expected to qualify for \n     compensation under that claim level or designation in the \n     most recent Congressional Budget Office estimate of asbestos-\n     injury claims for any 3-year period, the Administrator shall \n     conduct a review of a statistically significant sample of \n     claims deemed ineligible for compensation under the \n     appropriate claim level or designation.\n       (2) Determinations.--The Administrator shall examine the \n     best available medical evidence and any recommendation made \n     under subsection (b)(5) in order to determine which 1 or more \n     of the following is true:\n       (A) Without a significant number of exceptions, all of the \n     claimants who qualified for compensation under the claim \n     level or designation suffer from an injury or disease for \n     which exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing \n     factor.\n       (B) A significant number of claimants who qualified for \n     compensation under the claim level or designation do not \n     suffer from an injury or disease for which exposure to \n     asbestos was a substantial contributing factor.\n       (C) A significant number of claimants who were denied \n     compensation under the claim level of designation did suffer \n     from an injury or disease for which exposure to asbestos was \n     a substantial contributing factor.\n       (D) The Congressional Budget Office projections \n     underestimated or overestimated the actual number of persons \n     who suffer from an injury or disease for which exposure to \n     asbestos was a substantial contributing factor.\n       (3) Recommendations concerning claims criteria.--If the \n     Administrator determines that a significant number of the \n     claimants who qualified for compensation under the claim \n     level under review do not suffer from an injury or disease \n     for which exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing \n     factor, or that a significant number of the claimants who \n     were denied compensation under the claim level under review \n     suffered from an injury or disease for which exposure to \n     asbestos was a substantial contributing factor, the \n     Administrator shall recommend to Congress, under subsection \n     (e), changes to the compensation criteria in order to ensure \n     that the Fund provides compensation for injury or disease for \n     which exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing \n     factor, but does not provide compensation to claimants who do \n     not suffer from an injury or disease for which asbestos \n     exposure was a substantial contributing factor.\n       (d) Recommendations of Administrator and Advisory \n     Committee.--\n       (1) Referral.--If the Administrator recommends changes to \n     this Act under subsection (c), the recommendations and \n     accompanying analysis shall be referred to the Advisory \n     Committee on Asbestos Disease Compensation established under \n     section 102 (in this subsection referred to as the ``Advisory \n     Committee'').\n       (2) Advisory committee recommendations.--The Advisory \n     Committee shall hold expedited public hearings on the \n     alternatives and recommendations of the Administrator and \n     make its own recommendations for reform of the program under \n     titles I and II.\n       (3) Transmittal to congress.--Not later than 90 days after \n     receiving the recommendations of the Administrator, the \n     Advisory Committee shall transmit the recommendations of the \n     Administrator and the recommendations of the Advisory \n     Committee to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and \n     the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       [(d)](e) Shortfall Analysis.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Analysis.--If the Administrator concludes, on the basis \n     of the information contained in the annual report submitted \n     under this section, that the Fund may not be able to pay \n     claims as such claims become due at any time within the next \n     5 years, the Administrator shall include in the report an \n     analysis of the reasons for the situation, an estimation of \n     when the Fund will no longer be able to pay claims as such \n     claims become due, a description of the range of reasonable \n     alternatives for responding to the situation, and a \n     recommendation as to which alternative best serves the \n     interest of claimants and the public. The report may include \n     a description of changes in the diagnostic, exposure, or \n     medical criteria of section 121 that the Administrator \n     believes may be necessary to protect the Fund.\n       (B) Range of alternatives.--The range of alternatives under \n     subparagraph (A) may include--\n       (i) triggering the termination of this Act under subsection \n     (f) at any time after the date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (ii) reform of the program set forth in titles I and II of \n     this Act (including changes in the diagnostic, exposure, or \n     medical criteria, changes in the enforcement or application \n     of those criteria, changes in the timing of payments, changes \n     in contributions by defendant participants, insurer \n     participants (or both such participants), or changes in award \n     values).\n       (C) Insurer shortfall assessments.--Beginning in year 6 of \n     the life of the Fund, if the Administrator determines that a \n     shortfall in payment of the annual amounts required to be \n     paid by insurer participants under section 212(a)(3)(C) is \n     the substantial factor that would cause the Administrator to \n     recommend the termination of this Act under subsection (f), \n     then the Administrator may impose shortfall assessments on \n     insurer participants in addition to the payments imposed \n     under section 212, except that the Administrator shall not \n     impose such assessments if the additional amounts would not \n     be sufficient to permit the Administrator to avoid \n     recommending termination of this Act. During any given year, \n     the total of such shortfall assessments shall not exceed the \n     amount by which, during the prior year, total payments by \n     insurer participants fell short of the aggregate amounts \n     required to be paid under section 212(a)(3)(C). Shortfall \n     assessments shall be allocated among insurer participants \n     using the methodology adopted by the Asbestos Insurers \n     Commission under section 212(a)(1)(B).\n       (2) Considerations.--In formulating recommendations, the \n     Administrator shall take into account the reasons for any \n     shortfall, actual or projected, which may include--\n       (A) financial factors, including return on investments, \n     borrowing capacity, interest rates, ability to collect \n     contributions, and other relevant factors;\n       (B) the operation of the Fund generally, including \n     administration of the claims processing, the ability of the \n     Administrator to collect contributions from participants, \n     potential problems of fraud, the adequacy of the criteria to \n     rule out idiopathic mesothelioma, and inadequate flexibility \n     to extend the timing of payments;\n       (C) the appropriateness of the diagnostic, exposure, and \n     medical criteria, including the adequacy of the criteria to \n     rule out idiopathic mesothelioma;\n       (D) the actual incidence of asbestos-related diseases, \n     including mesothelioma, based on epidemiological studies and \n     other relevant data;\n       (E) compensation of diseases with alternative causes; and\n       (F) other factors that the Administrator considers \n     relevant.\n       (3) Recommendation of termination.--Any recommendation of \n     termination should include a plan for winding up the affairs \n     of the Fund (and the program generally) within a defined \n     period, including paying in full all claims resolved at the \n     time the report is prepared. Any plan under this paragraph \n     shall provide for priority in payment to the claimants with \n     the most serious illnesses.\n       (4) Resolved claims.--For purposes of this section, a claim \n     shall be deemed resolved when the Administrator has \n     determined the amount of the award due the claimant, and \n     either the claimant has waived judicial review or the time \n     for judicial review has expired.\n       [(e) Recommendations of Administrator and Commission.--\n       [(1) In general.--If the Administrator recommends changes \n     to this Act under subsection (c), the recommendations and \n     accompanying analysis shall be referred to a special \n     commission consisting of the Attorney General, the Secretary \n     of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Commerce, or \n     their designees. The Commission shall hold expedited public \n     hearings on the Administrator's alternatives and \n     recommendations and then make its own recommendations for \n     reform of the program set forth in titles I and II of this \n     Act. Within 180 days after receiving the Administrator's \n     recommendations, the Commission shall transmit its own \n     recommendations to the Congress in the same manner as set \n     forth in subsection (a).\n       [(2) Referral.--If the Administrator recommends changes to, \n     or termination of, this Act under subsection (d), the \n     recommendations and accompanying analysis shall be referred \n     to the Commission. The Commission\n\n[[Page S822]]\n\n     shall hold expedited public hearings on the Administrator's \n     alternatives and recommendations and then make its own \n     recommendations for reform of the program set forth in titles \n     I and II of this Act. Within 180 days after receiving the \n     Administrator's recommendations, the Commission shall \n     transmit its own recommendations to Congress in the same \n     manner as set forth in subsection (a).]\n       (f) Sunset of Act.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Termination.--Subject to paragraph (4), titles I \n     (except subtitle A) and II and sections 403 and 404(e)(2) \n     shall terminate as provided under paragraph (2), if the \n     Administrator--\n       (i) has begun the processing of claims; and\n       (ii) as part of the review conducted to prepare an annual \n     report under this section, determines that if any additional \n     claims are resolved, the Fund will not have sufficient \n     resources when needed to pay 100 percent of all resolved \n     claims while also meeting all other obligations of the Fund \n     under this Act, including the payment of--\n\n       (I) debt repayment obligations; and\n       (II) remaining obligations to the asbestos trust of a \n     debtor and the class action trust.\n\n       (B) Remaining obligations.--For purposes of subparagraph \n     (A)(ii), the remaining obligations to the asbestos trust of \n     the debtor and the class action trust shall be determined by \n     the Administrator by assuming that, instead of a lump-sum \n     payment, such trust had transferred its assets to the Fund on \n     an annual basis, taking into consideration relevant factors, \n     including the most recent projections made by the trust's \n     actuary before the date of enactment of this Act of the \n     amount and timing of future claim payments and administrative \n     and operating expenses.\n       (2) Effective date of termination.--A termination under \n     paragraph (1) shall take effect 180 days after the date of a \n     determination of the Administrator under paragraph (1) and \n     shall apply to all asbestos claims that have not been \n     resolved by the Fund as of the date of the determination.\n       (3) Resolved claims.--If a termination takes effect under \n     this subsection, all resolved claims shall be paid in full by \n     the Fund.\n       (4) Extinguished claims.--A claim that is extinguished \n     under the statute of limitations provisions in section 113(b) \n     is not revived at the time of sunset under this subsection.\n       (5) Continued funding.--If a termination takes effect under \n     this subsection, participants will still be required to make \n     payments as provided under subtitles A and B of title II. If \n     the full amount of payments required by title II is not \n     necessary for the Fund to pay claims that have been resolved \n     as of the date of termination, pay the Fund's debt and \n     obligations to the asbestos trusts and class action trust, \n     and support the Fund's continued operation as needed to pay \n     such claims, debt, and obligations, the Administrator may \n     reduce such payments. Any such reductions shall be allocated \n     among participants in approximately the same proportion as \n     the liability under subtitles A and B of title II.\n       (6) Sunset claims.--\n       (A) Definitions.--In this paragraph--\n       (i) the term ``sunset claims'' means claims filed with the \n     Fund, but not yet resolved, when this Act has terminated; and\n       (ii) the term ``sunset claimants'' means persons asserting \n     sunset claims.\n       (B) In general.--If a termination takes effect under this \n     subsection, the applicable statute of limitations for the \n     filing of sunset claims under subsection (g) shall be tolled \n     for any past or pending sunset claimants while such claimants \n     were pursuing claims filed under this Act. For those \n     claimants who decide to pursue a sunset claim in accordance \n     with subsection (g), the applicable statute of limitations \n     shall apply, except that claimants who filed a claim against \n     the Fund under this Act before the date of termination shall \n     have 2 years after the date of termination to file a sunset \n     claim in accordance with subsection (g).\n       (7) Asbestos trusts and class action trust.--On and after \n     the date of termination under this subsection, the trust \n     distribution program of any asbestos trust and the class \n     action trust shall be replaced with the medical criteria \n     requirements of section 121.\n       (8) Payment to asbestos trusts and class action trust.--The \n     amounts determined under paragraph (1)(B) for payment to the \n     asbestos trusts and the class action trust shall be \n     transferred to the respective asbestos trusts of the debtor \n     and the class action trust within 90 days.\n       (g) Nature of Claim After Sunset.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Relief.--On and after the date of termination under \n     subsection (f), any individual with an asbestos claim who has \n     not previously had a claim resolved by the Fund, may in a \n     civil action obtain relief in damages subject to the terms \n     and conditions under this subsection and paragraph (6) of \n     subsection (f).\n       (B) Resolved claims.--An individual who has had a claim \n     resolved by the Fund may not pursue a court action, except \n     that an individual who received an award for a nonmalignant \n     disease (Levels I through V) from the Fund may assert a claim \n     for a subsequent or progressive disease under this \n     subsection, unless the disease was diagnosed or the claimant \n     had discovered facts that would have led a reasonable person \n     to obtain such a diagnosis before the date on which the \n     previous claim against the Fund was disposed.\n       (C) Mesothelioma claim.--An individual who received an \n     award for a nonmalignant or malignant disease (except \n     mesothelioma) (Levels I through VIII) from the Fund may \n     assert a claim for mesothelioma under this subsection, unless \n     the mesothelioma was diagnosed or the claimant had discovered \n     facts that would have led a reasonable person to obtain such \n     a diagnosis before the date on which the nonmalignant or \n     other malignant claim was disposed.\n       (2) Exclusive remedy.--As of the effective date of a \n     termination of this Act under subsection (f), an action under \n     paragraph (1) shall be the exclusive remedy for any asbestos \n     claim that might otherwise exist under Federal, State, or \n     other law, regardless of whether such claim arose before or \n     after the date of enactment of this Act or of the termination \n     of this Act, except that claims against the Fund that have \n     been resolved before the date of the termination \n     determination under subsection (f) may be paid by the Fund.\n       (3) Venue.--\n       (A) In general.--Actions under paragraph (1) may be brought \n     in--\n       (i) any Federal district court;\n       (ii) any State court in the State where the claimant \n     resides; or\n       (iii) any State court in a State where the asbestos \n     exposure occurred.\n       (B) Defendants not found.--If any defendant cannot be found \n     in the State described in clause (ii) or (iii) of \n     subparagraph (A), the claim may be pursued only against that \n     defendant in the Federal district court or the State court \n     located within any State in which the defendant may be found.\n       (C) Determination of most appropriate forum.--If a person \n     alleges that the asbestos exposure occurred in more than one \n     county (or Federal district), the trial court shall determine \n     which State and county (or Federal district) is the most \n     appropriate forum for the claim. If the court determines that \n     another forum would be the most appropriate forum for a \n     claim, the court shall dismiss the claim. Any otherwise \n     applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled beginning \n     on the date the claim was filed and ending on the date the \n     claim is dismissed under this subparagraph.\n       (D) State venue requirements.--Nothing in this paragraph \n     shall preempt or supersede any State's law relating to venue \n     requirements within that State which are more restrictive.\n       (4) Class action trusts.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section--\n       (A) after the assets of any class action trust have been \n     transferred to the Fund in accordance with section 203(b)(5), \n     no asbestos claim may be maintained with respect to asbestos \n     liabilities arising from the operations of a person with \n     respect to whose liabilities for asbestos claims a class \n     action trust has been established, whether such claim names \n     the person or its successors or affiliates as defendants; and\n       (B) if a termination takes effect under subsection (f), the \n     exclusive remedy for all asbestos claims (including sunset \n     claims and claims first arising or first presented after \n     termination of the Fund) arising from such operations will be \n     a claim against the class action trust to which the \n     Administrator has transferred funds under subsection (f)(8) \n     to pay asbestos claims, if necessary in proportionally \n     reduced amounts.\n       (5) Expert witnesses.--If scientific, technical, or other \n     specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to \n     understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue in an \n     action permitted under paragraph (1), a witness qualified as \n     an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or \n     education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or \n     otherwise, if--\n       (A) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data;\n       (B) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and \n     methods; and\n       (C) the witness has applied the principles and methods \n     reliably to the facts of the case.\n\n     SEC. 406.

Mr. President, I understand there is no time limit on \nspeeches. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Many Senators on both sides of the aisle find the \nconcept of a trust fund to compensate the victims of asbestos-related \ndiseases appealing. I have consistently said that I would support a \nproperly designed and adequately funded trust fund bill that would \nfairly compensate all the victims of asbestos-induced disease in a \ntimely way. The problem is that S. 852 does not meet that standard. It \nis not properly designed and it is not adequately funded. Many \nseriously ill victims of asbestos disease are completely excluded from \ncompensation under the fund. And the legislation does not even provide \nadequate revenue to ensure that all the victims who are eligible for \ncompensation under the terms of the trust fund will actually receive \nwhat the legislation promises them. These are fundamental flaws that \ncannot be corrected by a few last minute amendments. They go to the \nheart of the bill.\n  The problem is that powerful corporate interests responsible for the \nasbestos epidemic have fought throughout this process to escape full \naccountability for the harm they have inflicted. As a result, the focus \nhas shifted from what these companies should pay victims to what they \nare willing to pay them. That is preventing the Senate from enacting \ntrust fund legislation that will truly help the workers who have been \nseriously injured by this industrial plague.\n  This legislation was constructed backwards. The first decision made \nwas that the size of the trust fund could not exceed $140 billion over \n30 years. Why? Because that was all the corporations whose reckless \nconduct created the asbestos problem were willing to pay. The Asbestos \nStudy Group, the chief lobbyists for this legislation, began this \nprocess by promising ``an evergreen fund'' that would provide as much \nmoney as necessary over time to fairly compensate the victims of \nasbestos disease. But they soon reneged on that commitment. Instead, \nthese companies are now insisting on an absolute cap on their \nliability--no matter how many victims are suffering from asbestos-\ninduced disease or how serious their illnesses. Asbestos diseases take \nyears, sometimes decades, to develop after the exposure to asbestos \nfibers. Thus, no one can say for sure how many victims there will be. \nThe companies claim that they need financial certainty to plan for the \nfuture. What about the millions of victims of asbestos exposure who \nlive every day under\n\n[[Page S826]]\n\nthe cloud of asbestos disease? What about the ability of these workers \nand their families to plan for their future?\n  Each year, more than 10,000 of them die from lung cancer and other \ndiseases caused by asbestos. Each year, hundreds of thousands of them \nsuffer from lung conditions which make breathing so difficult that they \ncannot function at all. Even more become unemployable due to their \nmedical condition. And, because of the long latency period of these \ndiseases, all of them live with fear of a premature death due to \nasbestos-induced disease. These are the real victims. Aren't they \nentitled to the certainty of knowing that, should the worst happen, \nthey and their families will be fairly compensated? All S. 852 offers \nthem is an inadequately funded trust fund that most experts believe \nwill be insolvent within a few years.\n  The real crisis which confronts us is not an ``asbestos litigation \ncrisis,'' it is an asbestos-induced disease crisis. All too often, the \ntragedy these workers and their families are enduring becomes lost in a \ncomplex debate about the economic impact of asbestos litigation. We \ncannot allow that to happen. The litigation did not create these costs. \nExposure to asbestos created them. They are the costs of medical care, \nthe lost wages of incapacitated workers, and the cost of providing for \nthe families of workers who died years before their time. Those costs \nare real. No legislative proposal can make them disappear. All \nlegislation can do is shift those costs from one party to another. \nUnfortunately, S. 852 would shift more of the financial burden onto the \nbacks of injured workers. That is unacceptable.\n  Senators Specter and Leahy have devoted an enormous amount of time \nand effort to this asbestos trust fund legislation. They did not set \nthe arbitrary $140 billion ceiling. The Republican leadership made \nclear that the trust fund could not exceed that amount regardless of \nthe legitimate needs of asbestos victims. The sponsors were left with \nthe unenviable task of deciding which worthy claims to exclude. As a \nresult, the bill before us contains fundamental flaws, which make it \nboth unfair and unworkable. It does not provide a reliable guarantee of \njust compensation to the enormous number of workers who are suffering \nfrom asbestos-induced disease.\n  The argument that there are serious inadequacies in the way asbestos \ncases are adjudicated today does not mean that any legislation is \nbetter than the current system. Our first obligation is to do no harm. \nWe should not be supporting legislation that excludes many seriously \nill victims from receiving compensation and that fails to provide a \nguarantee of adequate funding to make sure that these injured workers \ncovered by the trust fund will actually receive what the bill promises \nthem. This bill will do harm to these asbestos victims.\n  The list of serious flaws in S. 852 is, unfortunately, a long one. I \nwill focus my remarks on several of the most egregious.\n  Experts tell us that the asbestos trust created by this legislation \nis seriously underfunded. The funding plan in this bill relies on very \nsubstantial borrowing in the early years as the only way to pay the \nflood of claims. The result will be huge debt service costs over the \nlife of the trust that could reduce the $140 billion intended to pay \nclaims by as much as 40 percent. The amount remaining would be far too \nlittle to pay the claims of all of those who are entitled to \ncompensation under the terms of the bill.\n  In addition, there is a strong constitutional argument that the \nexisting bankruptcy trusts cannot be forced to turn over all their \nassets, which will place $7.6 billion of the projected funding in \njeopardy. Many companies are also likely to challenge their obligation \nto finance the asbestos trust. It is not at all clear how much money \nwill actually be available to pay eligible victims what the legislation \npromises they will receive.\n  There is likely to be a serious shortfall in the early years, when \nnearly 300,000 pending cases will be transferred to the trust for \npayment. Studies show the trust will not have the resources to pay \nthose claims in a timely manner. Payments to critically ill people may \nbe delayed for years.\n\n  One way to reduce the enormous financial burden on the fund in the \nearly years would be to leave many of those cases in the tort system, \nespecially cases which were close to resolution. That would be fair to \nthe parties in those cases and it would greatly improve the financial \nviability of the fund. Unfortunately, that proposal has been repeatedly \nrejected by the sponsors of the bill. As a result, there will be a \nserious mismatch between the number of claims the trust fund will face \nwhen its doors open and the payments coming into the fund. That will \nforce major borrowing in the first 5 years. The debt service resulting \nfrom that borrowing will financially cripple the trust.\n  In its August report, CBO recognizes the seriousness of this debt-\nservice problem, explaining:\n\n       Because expenses would exceed revenues in many of the early \n     years of the fund's operations, the Administrator would need \n     to borrow funds to make up the shortfall. The interest cost \n     of this borrowing would add significantly to the long-term \n     costs faced by the fund and contributes to the possibility \n     that the fund might become insolvent.\n\n  In a response to inquiries from Judiciary Committee members last \nweek, CBO issued an even more dire warning about the likelihood of \ninsolvency:\n\n       There is a significant likelihood that the fund's revenues \n     would fall short of the amount needed to pay valid claims, as \n     well as debt-service and administrative costs. There is also \n     some likelihood that the fund's revenues would be sufficient \n     to meet those needs. The final outcome cannot be predicted \n     with great certainty. Without a substantial increase in the \n     resources available to the fund, there is no way to guarantee \n     that the fund will not either revert to the court system or \n     require additional funding.\n\n  That statement should trouble every Senator on both sides of the \naisle. There is ``a significant likelihood that the fund's revenues \nwould fall short.'' While we may disagree on other issues regarding \ncompensation for asbestos victims, each of us knows that it would be \ndisastrous--for victims and businesses alike--to create a trust fund \nthat cannot meet its financial commitment to victims and is destined \nfor insolvency. None of us want to see that result. We cannot in good \nconscience ignore the warnings from the Congressional Budget Office and \nfrom other experts.\n  In addition to the concerns CBO has identified, there are other major \nproblems with S. 852 related to the projections of pending and future \nclaims that could push the trust fund even further out of balance.\n  For example, there has been a significant increase in the number of \nmesothelioma cases in recent years. The only known cause of \nmesothelioma is asbestos exposure. This new information suggests that \nthe CBO cost estimate may understate the cost of the mesothelioma \nclaims that the trust fund will incur by more than $15 billion. This is \nby no means the only instance where there is strong evidence to suggest \nthat the number of eligible claimants will substantially exceed CBO \nestimates.\n  If S. 852 is enacted, the U.S. Government will be making a commitment \nto compensate hundreds of thousands of seriously ill asbestos victims, \nbut will not have ensured that adequate dollars are available to honor \nits commitment. That will precipitate a genuine asbestos crisis, and \nthis Congress will bear the responsibility for it. Since the trust fund \nwill be borrowing extensively from the U.S. Treasury in its first few \nyears of operation; if it does become insolvent, there will be a direct \nimpact on American taxpayers.\n  The legislation before us would close the courthouse doors to \nasbestos victims on the day it passes, long before the trust fund will \nbe able to pay their claims. Their cases will be stayed immediately. \nSeriously ill workers will be forced into a legal limbo for up to 2 \nyears. Their need for compensation to cover medical expenses and basic \nfamily necessities will remain, but they will have nowhere to turn for \nrelief.\n  Under the legislation, even exigent health claims currently pending \nin the courts will be automatically stayed for 9 months as of the date \nof enactment. An exigent health claim is one in which the victim has \nbeen diagnosed ``as being terminally ill from an asbestos-related \nillness and having a life expectancy of less than one year.''\n  By definition, these cases all involve people who have less than a \nyear to live due to mesothelioma or some other disease caused by \nasbestos exposure. Their cases would all be stayed\n\n[[Page S827]]\n\nfor 9 months. Nine months is an eternity for someone with less than a \nyear to live. Many of them will die without receiving either their day \nin court or compensation from the trust fund.\n  The stay language is written so broadly that it would even stop all \nforward movement of a case in the court system. A trial about to begin \nwould be halted. An appellate ruling about to be issued would be \nbarred. Even the deposition of a dying witness could not be taken to \npreserve his testimony. The stay would deprive victims of their last \nchance at justice. I cannot believe that the authors of this bill \nintended such a harsh result, but that is what the legislation does.\n  The bill does contain language allowing an ``offer of judgment'' to \nbe made during the period of the stay in the hope of producing a \nsettlement. However, this provision is unlikely to resolve many cases \nbecause it requires the agreement of the defendants. There is no \nincentive for defendants to agree to a settlement when the case has \nbeen stayed. Those who have tried cases know that it is only the \nimminence of judicial action which produces a settlement in most cases. \nDelay is the defendant's best ally; and under this bill, the case is at \nleast delayed for 9 months and may never be allowed to resume if the \nfund becomes operational. If, however, these exigent cases were not \nstayed, and judicial proceedings could continue, there would be far \nmore likelihood of cases settling under the offer of judgment process.\n  I strongly believe that, at a minimum, all exigent cases should be \nexempted from the automatic stay in the legislation. Victims with less \nthan a year to live certainly should be allowed to continue their cases \nin court uninterrupted until the trust fund became operational. Their \nability to recover compensation in the court should not be halted until \nthe trust fund is open for business and they are able to receive \ncompensation from that fund. It is grossly unfair to leave these dying \nvictims in a legal limbo. For them, the old adage is especially true--\njustice delayed is justice denied.\n  Under the legislation, defendants would receive a credit against what \nthey must contribute to the trust fund for whatever payments they make \nto these dying victims; so they would not be ``paying twice,'' as some \nhave claimed.\n  Allowing the exigent cases to go forward in the courts without \ninterruption is a matter of simple fairness. Staying the cases of \nvictims who have less than a year to live is bureaucratic insensitivity \nat its worst. Most of these victims will not live to see the doors of \nthe trust fund open.\n  We should not deprive them of their last chance--their only chance--\nto receive some measure of justice before asbestos-induced disease \nsilences them. They should be allowed to receive compensation in their \nfinal months to ease their suffering. They should be allowed to die \nknowing that their families are financially provided for. S. 852 in its \ncurrent form takes that last chance away from them.\n  I intend to offer an amendment to allow these severely ill victims to \nhave their day in court.\n  The way the legislation is written, victims will lose out at the back \nend of the process as well, should the trust fund run out of money \nafter several years of operation.\n  If the trust fund does become insolvent, a very real possibility, \nworkers will not have an automatic right to immediately return to the \ncourt system. The process outlined in the current bill could take \nyears. Workers could end up trapped in the trust with reduced benefits \nand long delays in receiving their payments. There needs to be a clear, \nobjective trigger--inability of the trust to pay a certain percentage \nof claims within a set period of time--that will automatically allow \nvictims to pursue their claims in court if the trust runs out of money. \nThe Judiciary Committee's 2003 legislation contained such a provision, \nbut this bill does not. We cannot allow seriously injured workers with \nvalid claims who are not paid in a timely manner by the trust to be \ndenied their day in court. That would be a shameful injustice.\n  The asbestos trust is being presented as an alternative source of \ncompensation for victims suffering from asbestos-induced disease. If \nthat alternative runs out of money and can no longer compensate those \nvictims in a full and timely manner, their right to seek compensation \nthrough the judicial system should be immediately restored with no \nstrings attached. No principle is more basic. Yet this bill violates \nthat principle.\n  I am particularly upset by the way lung cancer victims are treated in \nthis bill. Under the medical criteria adopted by the Judiciary \nCommittee overwhelmingly 2 years ago, all lung cancer victims who had \nat least 15 years of weighted exposure to asbestos were eligible to \nreceive compensation from the fund. However, that was changed in S. \n852. Under this bill, lung cancer victims who have had very substantial \nexposure to asbestos over long periods of time are denied any \ncompensation unless they can show asbestos scarring on their lungs. The \ncommittee heard expert medical testimony that prolonged asbestos \nexposure dramatically increases the probability that a person will get \nlung cancer even if they do not have scarring on their lungs. Deleting \nthis category will deny compensation to more than 40,000 victims \nsuffering with asbestos-related lung cancers. Under the legislation as \nnow drafted, these victims are losing their right to go to court, but \nreceiving nothing from the fund. How can any of us support such an \nunconscionable provision?\n  Since we began considering asbestos legislation, no aspect has \nconcerned me more than the treatment of lung cancer victims. My top \npriority has been to make sure that these severely ill workers receive \njust and fair compensation.\n  And I have not been alone. A number of other Members have spoken out \nabout the importance of adequately providing for lung cancer victims \nwho have been exposed to substantial amounts of asbestos over long \nperiods of time.\n  Now we find that these victims, many of whom will have their lives \ncut short because of asbestos-induced disease, will not receive one \npenny in compensation from the trust fund. They are losing their right \nto go to court, but being denied any right to compensation under the \nfund. They are, in essence, being told to suffer in a legally imposed \nsilence with no recourse whatsoever.\n  One of the arguments we hear most frequently in favor of creating an \nasbestos trust fund is that in the current system, too much money goes \nto people who are not really sick and too little goes to those who are \nseriously ill. Well, lung cancer victims who have years of exposure to \nasbestos are the ones who are seriously ill. They are the ones this \nlegislation is supposed to be helping. Yet they are being completely \nexcluded.\n  The committee heard extensive testimony from distinguished medical \nexperts--Dr. Laura Welsh and Dr. Philip Landrigan--that prolonged \nexposure to asbestos can cause lung cancer even if the victim does not \nalso have markers of nonmalignant asbestos disease. They cited numerous \nmedical authorities supporting their position. They even described \ntreating lung cancer victims whose disease was clearly caused by \nasbestos but who had neither pleural thickening or asbestosis.\n  In a situation where people are undeniably severely ill and \nundeniably had 15 or more years of weighted exposure to asbestos, it is \nwrong to completely exclude them from compensation under the trust \nfund. Some of the proponents of S. 852 have attempted to justify \nexcluding them by claiming that smoking probably caused their lung \ncancers. But, the evidence refutes this contention.\n  First, even those lung cancer victims with 15 or more weighted years \nof exposure to asbestos who had never smoked were removed from \neligibility for compensation under the trust fund. So this is about \nmore than just the relationship between asbestos and smoking.\n  Second, regarding the smoking issue, Dr. Landrigan testified that \nsmokers who have substantial exposure to asbestos have 55 times the \nbackground risk of developing lung cancer, while smokers who were not \nexposed to asbestos have 10 times the background risk of developing \nlung cancer. Clearly, the asbestos exposure makes a huge difference.\n  There is a powerful synergistic effect between asbestos and tobacco \nin the\n\n[[Page S828]]\n\ncausation of lung cancer. Both are substantial contributing factors to \nthe disease. The smoker with substantial asbestos exposure should \nreceive less compensation from the trust fund than the nonsmoker with \nlung cancer. That principle appears throughout the bill. But smoking is \nnot a reason to exclude the smoker from all compensation.\n  Without prolonged exposure to asbestos, the smoker would have been \nfar less likely to contract lung cancer. It is a gross injustice to \ncompletely exclude these severely ill workers.\n  Any person who was exposed to asbestos for 15 or more weighted years \nand now has lung cancer should be eligible for compensation from the \ntrust fund. It would not be automatic. Their cases would be reviewed \nindividually by a panel of physicians to determine whether asbestos was \na ``substantial contributing factor'' to their lung cancer. These \n40,000 victims of asbestos should not be arbitrarily excluded from \nreceiving compensation. They were included in the original legislation, \nit was agreed to by medical experts for both business and labor, and \nthat provision should be restored to the bill. I will be proposing an \namendment to rectify this serious injustice.\n  This bill also tampers with the agreed-upon medical criteria \ncarefully negotiated between representatives of business and labor by \nraising the standard of proof for each disease category. The language \nin S. 852 requires the workers to prove that asbestos was ``a \nsubstantial contributing factor'' to their disease, instead of just ``a \ncontributing factor.'' This is a major increase in the burden workers \nmust overcome to receive compensation. It is significantly higher than \nmost states currently require in a court of law. Rather than having to \nshow that asbestos exposure contributed to their illness, they will now \nhave to address the relative impact of asbestos and other potential \nfactors. This change is a serious step in the wrong direction, raising \nthe bar even higher on injured workers.\n  Another major shortcoming of this legislation is its failure to \ncompensate the residents of areas that have experienced large-scale \nasbestos contamination. S. 852 simply pretends that this problem does \nnot exist. It fails to compensate the victims of all asbestos-induced \ndiseases, other than mesothelioma, whose exposure was not directly tied \nto their work. There is very substantial scientific evidence showing \nthat the men, women and children who lived in the vicinity of asbestos-\ncontaminated sites, such mining operations and processing plants, can \nand do contract asbestos-induced disease.\n  The reason that this legislation needs a special provision to \ncompensate the residents of Libby, MT, is because it does not \ncompensate victims of community contamination generally. The residents \nof Libby are certainly entitled to compensation, but so are the \nresidents who lived near the many processing plants from Massachusetts \nto California that received the lethal ore from the Libby mine. The \ndeadly dust from Libby, MT, was spread across America. W.R. Grace \nshipped almost 10 billion pounds of Libby ore to its processing \nfacilities between the 1960s and the mid 1990s. One of the places it \nwas shipped was to the town of Easthampton, MA, where the operations of \nan expanding plant spread the asbestos to the surrounding environment, \ninto the air and onto the soil. I intend to discuss this problem in \ngreat detail as the debate moves forward.\n  I raise it now as a dramatic example of one of the major injustices \ncaused by the arbitrary exclusion of a large number of asbestos victims \nfrom compensation under the trust fund. Nor is the problem of community \ncontamination limited to the sites receiving ore from Libby. Community \nasbestos contamination can result from many different sources. For \nexample, medical experts believe it may result from exposure to \nasbestos after the collapse of the World Trade Center. Because of the \nlong latency period, we often do not learn about community asbestos \ncontamination until long after it occurs. Certainly these victims of \nasbestos are entitled to fair treatment as well. They should not be \narbitrarily excluded from compensation as if their suffering is somehow \nless worthy of recognition than the suffering of other asbestos \nvictims. Yet that is what S. 852 does.\n  This is a bill that shifts more of the financial burden of asbestos-\ninduced disease to injured workers by unfairly and arbitrarily limiting \nthe liability of defendants. It does not establish a fair and reliable \nsystem that will compensate all those who are seriously ill due to \nasbestos. It lacks a dependable funding stream which can ensure that \nall who are entitled to compensation actually receive full and timely \npayment. These are very basic shortcomings.\n  We cannot allow what justice requires to be limited by what the \nwrongdoers are willing to pay. I intend to vote no and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of S. 852, \nthe bipartisan Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005. I \ncommend the majority leader and Chairman Specter and Senator Leahy for \nseizing the bull by the horns and proceeding with this vitally \nimportant litigation. And it is bipartisan legislation.\n  Make no mistake about this--this bill is not perfect. There are some \nthings in the act that I wish were different, but that is the nature of \nthe legislative process. It is about compromise and negotiation.\n  In a moment, I will speak to specific aspects of this bill. But \nbefore I do, I would like to take a moment to respond to some of the \nallegations that my colleagues made on the floor yesterday.\n  Some of them spoke of corruption. They spoke of undue influence \nwielded by lobbyists. And they spoke of fairness.\n  The truth is, this legislation is badly needed. Personal injury \nlawyers--some personal injury lawyers--are profiting at the expense of \nasbestos victims and manufacturers alike.\n  This bill is about fairness, justice, and certainty. It has become a \nbill that has tried to do away with fraud because this situation is \nfraught with fraud--fraud on American businesses, fraud on American \nconsumers, and, more importantly, fraud on asbestos victims.\n  Let me tell you what this bill does. This bill provides real \ncompensation to real victims with real injuries. This bill stops a \nrampaging personal injury trial bar. This bill fixes a broken legal \nsystem that benefits personal injury lawyers at the expense of asbestos \nvictims. And this bill provides certainty to everyone involved.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side have called S. 852 special \ninterest legislation. If helping sick people and preventing fraud \nconstitutes special interest action, then maybe they could get away \nwith that charge. But I am very proud--and I think anybody who supports \nthis bill would be proud--to support legislation that assists those \nspecial interests.\n  I ask my colleagues: Do you know who opposes this bill? It is the \npersonal injury lawyers involved. They are a small cadre of the total \nnumber of American Trial Lawyers Association members. These trial \nlawyers have fought this legislation the same way the old gunslingers \nfought the law in the Wild West. Some of my colleagues have spoken of \nbragging lobbyists. The only people I have ever heard bragging about \nthe scams that are going on are some of these personal injury lawyers.\n  Do you know when I heard them bragging? Last Congress, when we failed \nto invoke cloture on this bill's predecessor. It was not lobbyists or \nmanufacturers or asbestos victims who were having some celebratory \nsteak and champagne dinners in 2004; it was the personal injury \nlawyers. Why would they celebrate? They were celebrating because they \nsuccessfully preserved their 40-percent payout on massive class action \nlawsuits and the exorbitant transaction costs that raise the amounts \ntaken from victims to almost 60 percent, with only about 40 percent \ngiven to the victims. They were celebrating because their meal ticket \nwas not taken away from them. Not this time.\n  Before I continue, I wish to point out not all personal injury \nlawyers are bad, certainly not all trial lawyers. I was a trial lawyer \nin my younger days. I know most of them are good people with good \nintentions. However, as they say, it only takes one bad apple to spoil \nthe whole bushel.\n\n[[Page S829]]\n\n  We face an asbestos litigation crisis of unparalleled magnitude. Real \nasbestos victims with horrific injuries are receiving pennies on the \ndollar, while people who are not sick, or at least their lawyers, are \nreceiving millions of dollars. American companies, businesses both \nlarge and small, many of which never produced or used asbestos fibers, \nare being forced into bankruptcy by fraudulent lawsuits. These \nbankruptcies hurt all Americans. Pensions are destroyed, jobs are lost, \nand all because our current legal system is vulnerable to unscrupulous \ntrial lawyers. We have had the Supreme Court ask the Congress three \ntimes to weigh in on this and stop this mess from continuing. That is \nwhat we are trying to do with this bill.\n  According to the RAND Institute for Civil Justice, the asbestos \ncrisis has been called the worst occupational health disaster in U.S. \nhistory. The personal injury bar has compounded that disaster by filing \ncountless meritless claims that deprive the truly injured of their just \nand deserved compensation. The RAND Institute has found that \napproximately 730,000 people have filed asbestos claims through 2002. \nDespite the fact that asbestos claims should decrease each year due to \nOSHA and, to some extent, EPA actions in the 1970s and 1980s which \nseverely curtailed national asbestos exposure, we have seen a \nsignificant increase in the number of claims, particularly nonmalignant \nclaims, during the last 15 years. It is a gravy train for some of these \nlawyers. That does not dismiss the fact that there are people who are \nhurt by this, many of whom are not going to get a dime because a large \nnumber of their companies are bankrupt.\n  The large number of claims--expected to burgeon to the million-plus \nmark in the not-so-distant future--has resulted in 77 bankruptcies, the \nloss of some 60,000 jobs, or workers' privileges, and the depletion of \ncountless pension programs. Moreover, due to the nature and number of \nthese claims, compensation for the truly ill is often arbitrary and \ninequitable. According to the RAND Institute study, only 42 cents of \nevery dollar spent on asbestos litigation actually goes to the asbestos \nvictims; 31 cents goes to defense costs, and 27 cents goes to \nplaintiffs' attorneys. The situation becomes all the more deplorable \nwhen one factors in the ghastly specter of fraud. One study has shown \nthat 41 percent of audited claims of alleged asbestosis or pleural \ndisease were found to have either no disease or a less severe disease \nthan alleged by the personal injury experts. That is simply \nunacceptable. We are trying to solve that problem.\n  At present there are more than 300,000 asbestos-related claims \npending before this Nation's courts. Company after company has plunged \ninto bankruptcy with disastrous results. Some victims have gone without \ncompensation and many have nowhere to turn. Thousands have lost their \njobs. The only winners in most cases are the personal injury lawyers. \nAsbestos trial lawyers have pulled in over $20 billion in attorney's \nfees. One actuarial firm estimates that personal injury lawyers are \nexpected to filch another $40 billion before they run out of victims. I \ndon't have any problem with lawyers getting contingent fees for \nlegitimate cases. I don't have any problem with that. But the fact is, \nmany of these cases are not legitimate. It is time to make a choice. \nThat choice is between private jets for trial lawyers and meaningful \ncompensation for asbestos victims.\n  Before I move on to the operational aspects of this legislation, I \nwish to take a moment to talk about the victims of asbestos exposure. \nUnfortunately, veterans comprise a large percentage of this group. I \nwish to make a plea on their behalf. This may be the last chance to \nhelp the men and women who served this country with such distinction \nand who, as a result of that service, were exposed to asbestos fibers. \nTime is rapidly running out for this group and many, if not most, of \nthe companies they could turn to are now bankrupt, mainly because of \nthese lawsuits. Even if they are not bankrupt, lawsuits take so much \ntime and the verdicts are so uncertain that many will be cheated out of \ntheir just compensation. Even if some of these fine men and women \nmanage to obtain a verdict against a company with sufficient assets to \nmake good on the obligation, about 58 percent of the award would be \nconsumed not by the victim but by trial lawyers. That is plain wrong.\n\n  Let me tell you how this bill works. S. 852 will compensate \nlegitimate asbestos victims in a timely fashion on a no-fault basis. \nThey are not going to have to go to court to prove their case. \nClaimants must demonstrate they meet certain medical criteria--and \nthose criteria were agreed on in a bipartisan agreement--but once that \nthreshold showing has been made, thereby assuring that only the truly \nsick are compensated, the claimants will receive timely compensation \nbased upon the nature of the injury.\n  Some of my colleagues asserted that all claimants under this bill \nobtain a one-size-fits-all settlement if they meet the medical criteria \nrequirements. As Chairman Specter has pointed out, that is plain wrong. \nThere are nine tiers and corresponding awards under this bill, and it \nallows for further compensation if the condition worsens, meaning if a \nclaimant had a level 2 injury that later developed into a level 8 \ninjury or more serious injury, that individual can obtain compensation \nup to the level 8 or more serious tier. That makes sense to me.\n  It is worth pointing out that in addition to providing a no-fault and \ntimely compensation system, the FAIR Act provides certainty to asbestos \nvictims by taking away the whims of juries and the avarice of some of \nthese personal injury lawyers. Under this bill, if you are sick, you \nwill be compensated. Furthermore, this bill promotes economic stability \nand preserves jobs by taking the uncertain burden of direct and \nresidual asbestos liability away from manufacturers, insurers, and \nothers, and levying a measurable, known, and beneficial sum that will \nhelp those truly in need. In other words, they will have to pay, but it \nwill be done on a reasonable, decent basis, so that those who are \nsuffering will get paid in the end, where many of them will not under \nthe current system.\n  For the victims, it provides meaningful compensation in a relatively \nshort order. It is no-fault compensation for them. For the \nmanufacturers and other defendant entities, it removes the parasitic \npersonal injury bar from the picture and assures that asbestos dollars \nreach asbestos victims.\n  Finally, this bill contains an asbestos ban that will help lower \nasbestos exposure beyond what OSHA has achieved.\n  I was surprised to hear some opponents of this bill say S. 852 is not \nready, that any action on this measure would be premature. Frankly, I \nam somewhat shocked by this. I will not go into the full history of the \nbill. In fact, I will limit my discussion of its development to the \n107th Congress and beyond. But I must note that efforts in this area \npredate my efforts and the efforts of then-Chairman Leahy in the 107th \nCongress.\n  Now with tremendous effort, Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy \nhave worked this through in a way that has greatly improved what we \nwere trying to do back then. The Judiciary Committee has held at least \na half dozen hearings on asbestos issues, and we have held several \nexhaustive markups over the years. In addition, I note that Chief Judge \nEmeritus of the Third Circuit, Edward R. Becker, and now-Chairman \nSpecter held at least 36 meetings with stakeholders to reach the \ncompromise before us. This was a monumental effort by Senator Specter \nand Former Chief Judge Edward R. Becker. I just saw Chief Judge Becker \nover in the Dirksen Building. I know the sacrifices he has made to try \nand help us on this matter. And to have this bill called special \ninterest legislation, when we have had people such as Judge Becker work \nout these details by meeting with all concerned, including the trial \nlawyers, including businesses and individuals and groups and so forth, \nI don't know when anybody has made such an effort as both Chairman \nSpecter and Judge Becker.\n  We are currently on the third asbestos bill since the beginning of \nthe 108th Congress. We have moved from S. 1125, which was the subject \nof a 4-day markup over 2 months, to S. 2290, to S. 852. Finally, after \na 6-day markup, which also spanned 2 full months, the Judiciary \nCommittee reported the current bill with a bipartisan 13-to-5 vote. \nThat doesn't sound like special interest legislation to me. And it \nisn't.\n\n[[Page S830]]\n\n  With that in mind, it is hard to understand how opponents of this \nbill can claim with a straight face that this bill is not ready for \nconsideration by the full Senate. That is ridiculous. Can it be \namended? Surely. That is why we debate. Can we change aspects of it? \nSurely. That is why we debate. That is why we have this debate on the \nfloor, if we are ever allowed to debate it.\n  This brings me to some of the outstanding criticisms of this \nlegislation. First, we have heard it hurts small businesses. Since it \nis unclear to me what the deleterious effects on small business may be, \nI find it difficult to even spend time trying to refute those types of \nbaseless charges. I would ask my colleagues who hold this belief to \nexpound upon the allegation so we can better understand their concerns. \nHowever, before they do so, I ask my colleagues to look at the small \nbusiness exception contained within S. 852, specifically section 204(b) \nof this act. Small businesses do not have to contribute to the fund \nwhile at the same time they receive its benefits. I have a hard time \nunderstanding why this is bad for small businesses. After all, they do \nget something for nothing.\n  The next major objection focuses on the removal of pending cases from \ncourt. Such action is unfair, they say. Well, I am puzzled by this \nassertion as well. First, cases that have proceeded to the evidentiary \nstage of the trial are not touched by this act. Secondly, the \nunderlying premise of this bill focuses on two things: one, the \nuncertainty of jury trials and the ability of defendants to pay; two, \nthe parasitical impact some of these voracious trial lawyers have on \nthe process. This bill will provide certainty to the process, ensure \nthose who have been injured will receive compensation, and make sure \ncompensation so awarded goes to the victims and not to the trial bar in \nsuch dimensions as we have had so far. In fact, the trial bar will be \nentitled to fees under this bill; they just won't be as high because \nthe proof is a no-fault proof. It is like rolling off a log. I ask my \ncolleagues, how is that unfair?\n  The next assertion focuses on the amount of the trust fund. It is not \nenough to say it is not enough. That is what they say. To that I say, \nthe CBO seems to think the amount falls within the estimated range of \nclaims and, further, that this amount was agreed upon by Majority \nLeader Frist and then-Minority Leader Daschle after extensive \nnegotiation. Overall, it would seem some Members on the other side of \nthe aisle want to prevent us from proceeding to this bill. While I am \nnot surprised by obstructive tactics--we have seen them before; I saw a \ngood deal of them during the last Congress and I know enough to be able \nto say with confidence that what looks like a duck and quacks like a \nduck is, in fact, a duck--it is obstruction. Why can't we debate this \nbill up and down? Why don't we get into it? If we have legitimate \nobjections, I am sure the distinguished chairman and ranking member \nwill consider them. That is why we debate these things. I am \nnonetheless disturbed by the tactics of some on the other side, given \nthe tremendous importance of this legislation to our country.\n  As I say, the Supreme Court no less than three times asked us to do \nthis--or at least to find some solution to this massive litigation \ncrisis that is clogging our courts, hurting the country, and costing \neverybody an arm and a leg, without doing the justice to victims that \nthis bill will do.\n  It is troubling when we consider that without the FAIR Act, more and \nmore Americans are certain to lose their jobs, and more and more \nvictims of asbestos exposure will go without compensation. This all \ngoes to show that personal injury lawyers are a powerful force, and \nsome on the other side of the aisle are willing to hear the voice of \nthe personal injury bar over the voices of hard-working Americans who \nwant to keep their jobs and pensions. Don't tell me about special \ninterest legislation. We all know what special interest is driving the \nopponents of this bill.\n  The fact is that this bill continues to create a fair and efficient \nalternative compensation system to resolve the claims for injury caused \nby asbestos exposure. The fund is capitalized through private \ncontributions from defendants and insurers, not the Government, and \ncompensates victims under medical criteria that we reached on a \nbipartisan basis. I thought once we got the medical criteria, this bill \nshould go forward. We had a lot of people on both sides saying they \nwant to support it. Now we are here, and this is the chance to do it. \nIf you don't like it, file amendments. I am sure the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member will give consideration to the amendments. \nThe bill brings uniformity and rationality to a broken system so that \nresources are more effectively directed toward those who are truly \nsick.\n  I know the last asbestos bill contained no fewer than 53 compromise \nmeasures demanded by the Democrats last year. Moreover, I know this \nbill contains many more. Chairman Specter and Ranking Minority Member \nLeahy are still working with the labor unions and others to improve the \nbill. This bill did not sneak up on anybody. It is not the instrument \nof a wayward group of influential lobbyists. The bipartisan FAIR Act is \nthe product of years of negotiation and hard work--bipartisan people \nwho are interested in solving problems, not creating them.\n  Not only does this bill guarantee fair compensation to victims, it \nguarantees faster and more certain compensation at that. We anticipate \nthat claimants will not have to endure years of discovery battles and \nendless litigation before they get paid. Currently, whether some \nvictims get paid depends on the solvency of businesses. But under the \nFAIR Act, these victims will no longer have to go without payment. It \nis time to end the current system of jackpot justice, where only some \nwin and many lose.\n  Let me mention one group--the mesothelioma victims. Most of them have \nno chance at being fairly compensated because they work for companies \nthat are now bankrupt. This bill takes care of them and helps them with \ntheir problem. Given that this bill is a clear net monetary gain for \nlegitimate victims and provides payments faster and with more \ncertainty, I am at a loss as to why anybody would object to this bill \nor object to a full and fair debate and a vote up or down. Quite \nfrankly, the only entities that stands to lose under this bill are a \nhandful of personal injury lawyers who have guzzled more than $20 \nbillion of the costs incurred on this issue as of the end of last year. \nIf the improved FAIR Act is passed, they will not be able to leverage \nunimpaired claims to squeeze a projected $40 billion more for \nthemselves from remotely connected companies by abusing a broken \nsystem.\n  I support compensating attorneys for the value of their work, no \nquestion. Honest lawyers deserve to be paid. But when the lawyers get \nrich while diverting valuable resources away from sick victims and to \npeople who are not victims, people who don't deserve compensation, \nwhich is going on here, something is wrong with the system. But you \ndon't need me to tell you this; the Supreme Court, think tanks, and \nother nonpartisan commentators have been saying it for years.\n  We have a serious problem on our hands which demands this body's full \nattention. I applaud our majority leader, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Specter, and his ranking member, Senator Leahy, for \nbringing this bill to the floor. The time to act is now. I would like \nto see us go forward in a legitimate, honest way to try to solve these \nproblems. If people on either side have objections to the bill or have \na reason to try to change it, they can bring amendments forward, and \nlet's battle it out. The chairman has been very open to accepting good \nideas. He has consistently done that throughout this process. I don't \nthink anybody can find fault with our chairman for the way he has \noperated on this bill and how hard he has worked.\n  We have studied this asbestos problem at length, for decades. We have \nheld numerous hearings, considered legislative proposals, and even \nunderwent several marathon markups in the Judiciary Committee over the \nyears. To the extent there are issues that remain unresolved, we can \nopenly debate them on the floor of the Senate.\n  The time has come to stop talking about doing something and take \ndecisive action. Every day that passes is a day we withhold meaningful \nrecovery to truly sick victims. Every day that passes is a day in which \nhard-working Americans at companies that had little\n\n[[Page S831]]\n\nor nothing to do with asbestos face decreased pensions and an uncertain \nemployment future. Every day that passes is a day that we deny \nconsideration of a comprehensive solution to one of the most plaguing \ncivil justice issues of our time.\n  This is step one. If we can get a bill out of the Senate, this would \nmove forward so fast. The House would have to come up with its \nlegislation, and we would then go to conference. I have no doubt, \nhaving watched the chairman and ranking member, that they would be \nworking in good faith to try to accommodate and please all legitimate \npoints of view on these very profound and difficult issues. I \ncompliment them one more time. These folks deserve that we debate this \nbill fully, that we have a vote up or down on the bill in the end, and \nthat we go through this process and hopefully continue to improve the \nlegislation so that we can do justice in our society.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, let me acknowledge the obvious. A \nlot of work has gone into this bill. Senator Specter, Senator Leahy, \nand members of the Judiciary Committee, including Senator Hatch, have \nspent hours, days, weeks, and months preparing this bill. It is a bill \nthat should have taken a long time because it is a bill that says \nsomething very basic and fundamental and, in many ways, revolutionary: \nIt says we can no longer trust the court system in America. It says the \ncourt system is inadequate in America to compensate victims. That is a \ncharge not made lightly, I am sure, by the sponsor of this legislation. \nIt is one we should not take lightly on the floor of the Senate because \nwe have established over the course of this Nation's history some \nthings which are generally accepted by most Americans.\n  It is true that Congress and legislatures write the law. The \nPresident and executive branch enforce it. And when it comes to making \ndecisions of how that law applies to our lives, we trust the courts. \nThe decision has been made by those who are pushing this bill that we \ncan no longer trust the courts. The decision has been made that we have \nto replace our court system with something else. If we are going to \nstep away from a time-honored institution and tradition in America to \ncreate an alternative, it is a daunting task.\n  Those of us who have been critical of this legislation are going to \nhold the sponsors to some very fundamental questions. The first: Can \nyou provide the same level of fairness and compensation in your new \nsystem that the courts of America provide today? The answer can be \nfound in responses from victims groups around the country. The victims \nof asbestos have been writing to Members of Congress saying: Don't pass \nthis legislation. The compensation you will give to the victims and \ntheir families is inadequate and unpredictable. Those families have \ncome to see me. They have heartbreaking stories--stories of young men \nand young women whose lives were snuffed out because of exposure to \nasbestos. In not a single case have I ever met somebody who said: I \nguess I knew I had it coming to me; I decided to expose myself to \nasbestos. I never ran into a person like that or heard a story like \nthat.\n  The victims of asbestos are as surprised by the diagnosis as they can \nbe. It is no surprise to us when we consider this insidious disease. \nThese flaky fibers which are breathed into the lungs can sit there like \na timebomb for decades. Do you recall the movie actor named Steve \nMcQueen? He died from mesothelioma. He was exposed to asbestos at some \npoint in his life, which later exploded into a fatal lung disease. \nEarlier this week on the floor, I talked about my former colleague, \nBruce Vento, of Minnesota, a Congressman from St. Paul. He was a \npicture of health and was in the gym every morning, and then he didn't \nfeel well. He went to the doctor, and after a chest x-ray, they said: \nYou were somehow in your life exposed to asbestos. Now you have \nmesothelioma and just months to live.\n  Those stories are repeated over and over again about men who worked \nin asbestos mines who got off scot-free and never developed a problem, \nbut their wives at home, who shook out their work clothes before \nputting them into the washer, breathed in the fibers and contracted \nasbestosis and mesothelioma and died. It is insidious.\n  I could spend more than an hour telling you that, since 1934, the \ncompanies which have been creating asbestos products have known how \ndangerous this product is. I could, and maybe I will at some point, go \nthrough the extensive evidence of deception and cover-up by these \ncompanies so that their employees did not understand the serious \ndangers they were exposed to in the workplace, and the dangers that \nmany of them took home in their work clothes. These victims and their \nfamilies come to visit me--lovely young women from the Chicago suburbs \nwith beautiful children, and they show pictures of families whose \nhusbands were lost in their early forties to mesothelioma.\n  This bill says that compensation for victims of asbestos is capped at \n$1.1 million. If you happen to be a mesothelioma victim, that's only \n$1.1 million for medical bills, lost wages, and to raise children. That \nis a figure which might have sounded pretty large to start with, but it \nbegins to be very modest when you look at individual victims and their \nfamilies. That is why the victims have come to us and said: Don't \nreplace the court system in America with this approach. It is not fair \nto the victims.\n  Others have come to us as well and said that the way you put the \nmoney into the trust fund, which is supposed to pay the victims, is a \nmystery. We have repeatedly asked the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee who is the sponsor of the legislation, to provide us with the \ndocumentation. Please show us how $140 billion will adequately \ncompensate the victims of asbestos exposure over the 50-year life span \nof this bill. We are still waiting for the information. So we are going \nto replace the court system with a trust fund. We are going to say that \n$140 billion will be enough for 50 years, without any evidence of how \nthat number was arrived at or whether that number will really meet the \nneeds of the victims. I will speak in a few moments about those experts \nwho have analyzed this bill and found that the numbers underlying the \nassumptions are totally wrong.\n  Another group that comes to us to discuss this bill are those being \nasked to pay into the trust fund that will be created by this bill. The \nargument has been made on the floor, thank goodness, that the taxpayers \nwon't have to pay into this. These will be businesses and insurance \ncompanies which will put money in the trust fund so they don't have to \npay out asbestos claims any longer in court. Well, it turns out that \nsome businesses will do quite well. Some of them are going to receive a \nwindfall in terms of what they have put into this fund as opposed to \nwhat they might pay in court.\n  U.S. Gypsum is a company that has a large legal exposure for \nasbestos. Because of corporate reports they made public in the last \ncouple of weeks, we now know that, in order for the company to pay out \nall the existing claims filed against USG by victims of asbestos, they \nestimate it will cost them in the range of $4 billion. This chart is an \nexcerpt of an article from BusinessWeek dated January 27, 2006, which \nsays, USG is willing to cough up $4 billion to settle victims' claims. \nThat is $4 billion of asbestos exposure for this one corporation. So if \nthey didn't pay that amount in court settlements, and instead came into \nthis bill, what would they pay into this trust fund? That figure is \n$900 million, according to USG's own corporate report.\n  This is a windfall. They have to be smiling and praying this bill is \ngoing to pass because if it does, the company is off the hook for over \n$3 billion of legal liability that they even admit to in court. And who \nwill make up the difference? Who is going to make up the $3.1 billion \nthis company should be paying the victims? Other companies. Companies \nthat may never have had many lawsuits filed against them because of \nasbestos, and companies that have never paid out a penny in terms of \nasbestos claims, even if they were sued. These smaller companies will \nbe expected to pay millions and millions of dollars into this trust \nfund when larger companies are walking away with a windfall.\n  So we asked again to the sponsor of this legislation: If you cannot \ntell us how you arrived at the figure of $140\n\n[[Page S832]]\n\nbillion, can you at least give us the names of the companies and how \nmuch they are expected to contribute into this trust fund? And we are \nstill waiting.\n  The chairman spoke yesterday about how he was going to subpoena these \nrecords. I hope they will be produced during the course of this debate. \nI hope we will have a list of all the businesses with----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois yield for \na question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is the Senator from Illinois aware of the fact that the \nJudiciary Committee, on which he serves, issued a subpoena and has the \nnames of the companies that are going to be contributing to the trust \nfund.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I know the chairman made that statement yesterday, and I \nam hoping he will share that information.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am advised by staff, since I posed the \nquestion, in a note to the effect that Senator Durbin's staff did come \nto look at the list. Is the Senator from Illinois aware of that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I respond to the chairman by stating that I \nunderstand this information on the list has been characterized as \nconfidential information before the committee and cannot be shared \npublicly.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The pending question--and I will be glad to answer his--\nis, Does the Senator from Illinois know that his staff came to look at \nthe list?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am aware of the fact they reviewed it, but I am also \naware of the fact this has not been made public as part of this \nconversation and part of this record.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, with all due respect, the issue isn't \nwhether it has been made public, the issue is whether it is in \nexistence, and the issue beyond being in existence is whether it is \navailable to Members who have to vote on the bill. So when the Senator \nfrom Illinois asserts that you don't know who is making contributions, \nit is simply not so.\n  The issue of confidentiality is true. It has been raised by the \ncompanies because they are concerned that if it is disclosed how much \nthey have contributed or are proposing to contribute that they may be \ntargets for more litigation.\n  I don't wish to interrupt the Senator from Illinois further. I simply \nwish to make the point that he is wrong when he says we don't know who \nis going to contribute the money, and his own staffer has taken a look \nat the list.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me respond, if I may. Why is this cloaked in secrecy? \nWhy is this a secret conversation? How can we have confidence that the \n$140 billion figure has any validity? How can we have confidence that \nthe businesses that will be called on are going to be able to \ncontribute to this fund if this is cloaked in secrecy and \nconfidentiality? Most of these lawsuits are open, public record. It is \nhard for me to imagine that a business is going to be sued because \nsomeone has identified them as a potential contributor to this trust \nfund.\n  Nevertheless, if we are expected to replace the court system in \nAmerica with this new trust fund system, how can we do it with any \nconfidence if all the information is not on the table? Why the secrecy? \nWhat are we concealing? What we are concealing, frankly, is the most \ncontroversial elements of this bill: a question of whether $140 billion \nwill actually pay the victims--and I doubt that it will--a question of \nwhether companies are going to be asked to pay into this trust fund who \nshouldn't be asked to pay into the trust fund and, subsequently, may be \nforced into bankruptcy, closing their doors because of it. These are \nquestions of great moment. To say a staff person can have access to \nsecret files in an office hardly gives any comfort in the midst of a \npublic debate about an issue of this magnitude.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois yield \nfurther?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is the Senator from Illinois aware, putting it in the \nform of a question, that he has made a shift in positions, first \nasserting that we don't know who is going to contribute the money, then \nfinding out that we do know who is going to contribute the money, that, \nin fact, his staffer has looked at that list, and he is now raising a \ndifferent issue as to what is the need for secrecy?\n  That is not the point about which I raised the question. When he \ntalks about litigation, there are many confidential matters in \nlitigation which remain confidential on a showing of cause. So my \nquestion to the Senator from Illinois is, does he realize that he has \nshifted his position from objecting to the status where nobody knows \nwho is contributing, changing to why the reason for the secrecy?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania----\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. As a couple of experienced trial lawyers and debaters, \nor at least he is an experienced trial lawyer and debater.\n  Mr. DURBIN. As the Senator from Pennsylvania is as well. In response, \nunless and until we put this information out to be reviewed in a \ncomprehensive and honest way, I don't believe we can stand before the \nAmerican people and say this is a good replacement for the courts of \nAmerica.\n  Let me tell the Senator what happened. A member of my staff was \ninvited to the Senator's office to view the secret list. He was warned \nahead of time not to take any notes, not to make any copies, and not to \ndisclose the nature and substance of the secret list because they were \ntreated as committee confidential. My staffer went to view the list and \nreported to me the information wasn't very helpful in answering the \nmost basic questions about the companies, their liability, and, of \ncourse, the impact on each company and whether they can survive the \ncontributions to the trust fund.\n  Under the committee confidential rule the chairman has imposed on all \nstaff members reviewing this list, I am not sure I can say much more \nabout this secret list on the floor, but I will say this is a highly \nunusual process to have secret lists, secret information, and \nconfidentiality, when we are literally talking about people's lives and \nhealth. I don't think the Senator can come forward and meet his burden \nof proof, to go back to the language of trial lawyers, that we should \nreplace the court system in America based on secret lists kept in his \noffice. That strikes me as a far cry from the kind of public debate \nwhich we should invite for this bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield further for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have been more than happy to yield, and I will continue \nto yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How can the Senator call it a secret list when it is \navailable for his inspection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, when he makes it available for the \ninspection of all Members and the American people, it is no longer a \nsecret list. Mr. President, is the Senator prepared to do that? That is \nmy question, without yielding the floor to the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will review the matter with the view to see if we can \nmake it public. I am open to any modification which is reasonable. I am \nnot bound by any protocol, and I will go back to the providers of the \nlist to see if it can be made available. But when the Senator from \nIllinois asserts that it is secret, he is simply wrong. It is not \nsecret. He can look at it. I think he raises a good point when he says \nthat nobody can make a copy of it.\n  Offhand, on horseback, on one foot, I think staffers should be able \nto make a copy of it. Take the copy and show it to the Senator. I think \nthat is reasonable, with the agreement of the staffer and the Senator \nthat if we decide to retain the confidentiality, they will respect \nthat. I trust Senator Durbin and I trust his staff to honor \nconfidentiality if we stick with it.\n  As I say, I will review that as well. But Senator Durbin has to make \na decision. I am sure Senator Durbin has an open mind on this question. \nNow that I reflect on it, I am not so sure he does have an open mind on \nthis question, and he doesn't have to have an open mind on this \nquestion. I think he raises a good point when he says we ought to know \nwho contributes the money. I raised hell to get the information and \nfinally had to raise a subpoena to get the information. We have it so \nthat it is available for those who have to make a decision.\n\n[[Page S833]]\n\n  When he carries the point further that he would like to see it made \npublic, if I can accommodate that, I will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was happy to yield again to the Senator, whom I respect \nvery much. I tell him, for the record, on May 25 of last year, we sent \na letter to him about Goldman Sachs, asking that we have some \ninformation about the $140 billion figure, how it was arrived at, and \nhow it will be paid for. So this is not the first time this issue has \ncome up.\n  It is curious to me that we are writing a bill that is going to \nchange the laws of all the States of America, and if we are going to \nclose those courtrooms across America. Yet the Senator from \nPennsylvania had to issue a subpoena to obtain a list of the names of \nthe companies that are going to contribute to the trust fund. This is a \nvery strange process.\n  Usually, legislation emanates from within Congress and affects the \noutside world. It appears that the secret list at issue emanated from \nthe outside and whoever created it wasn't anxious to share it. So if \nthere is skepticism by those of us critical of the bill, I think there \nis good reason.\n  We never received a reply to our May letter of last year. It is an \nindication to me that this whole process has been very unusual and very \ndifferent from any process I have seen.\n  Somewhere, someone has come up with a number as to how much we need \nto compensate these victims, and someone has come up with a source on \nhow that number will be arrived at, and the chairman had to go to the \nlengths of subpoenaing the information that was the basis for this bill \nthat will affect hundreds of thousands of Americans and their lives.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will the Senator will yield further?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. When he says I haven't responded to his letter, I have \nresponded to his letter by getting him the information. The Senator \nfrom Illinois is diligent, resourceful, and raises lots of questions. I \nwould challenge him to say I haven't responded to all of them.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the chairman, he is the most responsive Member I \ncan think of, and I thank him for his service and friendship. I have \nshared with him my concerns on this issue, and he has gone so far as to \nissue a subpoena.\n\n  The point I wanted to make to the chairman is raising this issue was \nnot sua sponte. I started asking this question long ago as to why we \ncouldn't get the most fundamental----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry: Does sua sponte apply to this \ndiscussion? I withdraw the parliamentary inquiry.\n  When the Senator from Illinois says the chairman had to issue a \nsubpoena, I consider it a compliment. I have had to deal with \nstakeholders on all sides who have been recalcitrant. We haven't--I, \nwe, Senator Leahy and I--haven't left any stone unturned. If people who \nwant this bill and are obligated to provide money won't give the \ninformation I want, if they are for the bill and they are for the \nposition I am sponsoring, I am going to get tough about it. I am going \nto get a subpoena so that Senator Durbin knows what is going on, and I \nthink the American people, through their elected representatives, will \nknow what is going on.\n  Does the Senator want me to yield? If I can get wider distribution, I \nwill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me reclaim my time but also say to the chairman, \nparenthetically, what we engaged in--yielding back and forth--draws \nperilously close to debate on the Senate floor, which we try to avoid \nat any cost. I will do my best to always yield to meaningful questions \nand comments as those made by the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. But I want to return to my comments.\n  This is a curious situation, where the chairman of the committee who \nwrote the bill had to issue a subpoena to get the information about \nwhat the bill meant. Now that is a curious situation. It leads one to \nbelieve that someone else, other than this committee, is writing the \nbill. Who could that possibly be? Who has enough interest in this \nmatter to want to move forward with passing this bill outside of \nCapitol Hill? I gave one example earlier of one corporation which \nstands to gain $3.1 billion if this bill passes. Those are companies \nvery interested in this bill.\n  There has been a lot of talk on the floor about the lobbying effort \non behalf of this legislation. It has been huge.\n  (Ms. MURKOWSKI assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, will the Senator from Illinois yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. After I finish my sentence, I will yield. I concede this \nbill is a clash of special-interest titans on both sides. I think \nproponents of the bill have invested a lot more in its passage than \nthose who oppose it. Maybe we will never know the true figures, but the \ninteresting thing is that the first bill of this Senate session is not \na bill to address the Medicare prescription drug crisis, it is not a \nbill to provide affordable, accessible health care to Americans, it is \nnot a bill to deal with the energy crisis and the heating bills that \nare killing us in the Midwest and the Northeast, it is not a bill to \ndeal with pension security for workers who are losing a lifetime of \npension investment to a merger or a bankruptcy or corporate sleight of \nhand. It is a bill that is brought by lobby groups and special \ninterests that have invested tens of millions of dollars trying to \nforce this issue and bring this matter before us on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: Has the Senator \nfrom Illinois finished that sentence?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I just finished. That was a period.\n  Mr. SPECTER. There are a lot of semicolons in that sentence, then.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am not yielding the floor unless the Senator wishes to \nask a question. Then I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. There is a lot of competition for the floor. There are \nthree of us on the floor. A lot of competition for it.\n  When the Senator from Illinois talks about special interest groups, \nthere are others involved in this legislation and they are the victims. \nThey are thousands, tens of thousands of victims who are suffering \ndeadly diseases. Those are the people about whom this Senator is \nconcerned.\n  Yesterday I put into the Record an article from the front page of the \nHill about $3 million being spent by lobbyists to defeat this bill. \nToday the New York Times has a detailed story about how much money is \nbeing spent to defeat this bill.\n  It is true there are some who want this bill--the manufacturers and \nsome insurance companies. But the people who really want this bill are \nthe victims.\n  I take just a little umbrage at one sentence, one statement made by \nthe Senator from Illinois when he says that because I have to subpoena \nmaterial, it raises a question about who is writing the bill, that \nsomebody else is writing the bill.\n  Let me assure you, Madam President, and anybody who may be watching \non C-SPAN--if we had anybody, we lost them a long time ago--no special \ninterest has written this bill. It is a non sequitur. I have to respond \nin some way to sua sponte. It is a non sequitur to say that because it \nwas necessary to subpoena information that somebody else wrote the \nbill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Without yielding the floor, would the Senator please tell \nus what Government agency he subpoenaed for the information to produce \nthe secret list?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will be glad to respond. I didn't subpoena any \ngovernmental agency. We subpoenaed the companies who were obligated to \nprovide the money.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Without yielding the floor, would the Senator please \nstate for the Record the names of the nongovernment agencies, private \ncompanies he had to subpoena to understand the underlying basis for \nthis trust fund and how $140 billion was arrived at?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I didn't have to subpoena anybody to understand the \nunderlying basis for this bill. This is my bill. I understood it when I \nthought it through and when I wrote it. Will I provide the names of \nthose who are to be contributors? I do not have them at my disposal, \nand I certainly don't have them in my mind. But the staffer from the \nSenator from Illinois has already seen them and I would be glad to \npersonally take the Senator from Illinois to look at the list.\n\n[[Page S834]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, if this were a courtroom I would say the \nwitness is not responsive. I asked the Senator a very direct question: \nWho did you send the subpoena to if it wasn't a government agency? And \nthe answer, he knows, is: A private company. The obvious question is: \nWhy are private companies writing a bill we have on the floor of the \nSenate today? They are writing that bill because they have a deep, \npersonal interest in this bill. They are going to do quite well, thank \nyou. Some companies are going to end up, as a result of this \nlegislation, walking away from their legal liabilities in court for \nasbestos injury and asbestos death. These are the companies that want \nto see us close down the court system for these victims and create \nsomething else because they are the winners.\n  I hope the Senator from Pennsylvania--I don't want to create any \numbrage, or raise any questions about his integrity. I am not. But I \nhope he will at a later point in the day come to the floor and disclose \nthe names of the private companies that created the secret list that \nsuggests there may be thousands of corporations across America that \nwill have to contribute to this trust fund.\n  I wish to go to the most basic questions about the $140 billion. \nWhere did we come up with $140 billion? How can we suggest that over \nthe next 50 years or more that will be enough? It is important that it \nis enough. Yesterday my friend, the Senator from Pennsylvania, \naddressed this issue. He came to the floor and this is what Senator \nSpecter said about this $140 billion figure:\n\n       The figure of $140 billion was worked out by Senator Frist \n     and Senator Daschle about a year and half ago. It is a figure \n     which rose from that which was originally put in the trust \n     fund to that figure where CBO has given us the assurance that \n     the range of cost will be somewhere between $120 billion and \n     $135 billion. Under one contingency, it could go to $150 \n     billion, but that is unlikely.\n\n  Senator Specter went on to say something else, and I think is a very \nimportant statement. It is a long sentence, but bear with me:\n\n       We have within the structure of the bill a provision that \n     the administrator can make a reevaluation going through \n     certain preconditions so that if it looks like we're going to \n     exceed the $140 billion, we can make modifications in the \n     medical standards and criteria to stay within the $140 \n     billion.\n\n  End of quote from the Senate floor. A statement by the chairman of \nthe Judiciary committee yesterday stating there will be modifications \nin medical standards and criteria. Make no mistake what that means. It \nmeans less money for victims. It means if this fund runs out of money, \nthe victims will receive even less. So the winners will be winning \nmore, the losers losing more. And the victims will be the ultimate all-\ntime losers in this situation.\n  I think it was an honest answer. I believe Chairman Specter was very \ncandid in what he said. He could have said that if we exceed $140 \nbillion in claims, that we would return all the cases to the tort \nsystem and the court system. But he knows if he said that, it would be \nhard to explain how we get into this trust fund for a few years, close \nthe courthouse door, cut off all the pending lawsuits, and then declare \nthe trust fund doesn't work. He didn't say that.\n\n  He could have said the Federal taxpayers will have to step in at that \npoint and take care of the victims. But he knew that would cause a \nproblem, not just on his side of the aisle but across the Senate. A \nFederal bailout is not viewed very positively when our Federal budget \nis facing the deepest deficits in the history of the United States.\n  So he said, and I admire his candor, we will just reduce the amounts \nwe pay the victims. That is how we will make $140 billion work. That is \na very candid and straightforward, but harrowing answer.\n  To say to people, if you were in the midst of a lawsuit, if you have \nworked around asbestos and have asbestosis and you are limited in your \nactivities and maybe in the span of your life, and you filed a lawsuit \nagainst the company that exposed you to this asbestos, and you worked--\nand I know this because I used to do this for a living--worked for \nyears to get that case into court with great sacrifices and \nfrustrations and motions and continuances, and you are finally there--\nwhen this bill passes, if you don't have your case before a jury, you \nare finished. Close the door. Take your file home. You get to start all \nover.\n  Then what happens? You go into this trust fund, which on balance will \nprobably pay you less, and you hope and pray there will be enough money \nthere to pay you. If there is not, Senator Specter has said we will cut \nback your pay and your compensation for being injured by asbestos until \nwe can hit this magic $140 billion number. That is the reality of this \nbill.\n  I think it is fair to ask, Is the $140 billion figure accurate? I \nhave been through this on the Senate Judiciary Committee for several \nyears. Senator Orrin Hatch offered a version of this bill. He began by \nsaying all we need is $90 billion over 50 years. Then we got into a \ncommittee debate and markups, and the figure moved up to $154 billion \nduring the course of committee process. At that time the CBO, the \nCongressional Budget Office, estimated it would cost between $124 and \n$136 billion for anticipated claims.\n  Since this virtual endorsement of the trust fund bill from 3 years \nago, the Congressional Budget Office has progressively but \nunquestionably expressed greater and greater reservations about that \nnumber, about the viability of the trust fund and whether the figure we \nare talking about today is an honest figure to compensate victims.\n  Let me share this report from the Congressional Budget Office. I will \nread it:\n\n       There is a significant likelihood that the fund's revenues \n     would fall short of the amount needed to pay valid claims, as \n     well as debt-service and administrative costs. There is also \n     some likelihood that the fund's revenues would be sufficient \n     to meet those needs. The final outcome cannot be predicted \n     with great certainty. Without a substantial increase in the \n     resources available to the fund, there is no way to guarantee \n     the fund will not either revert to the court system or \n     require additional funding.\n\n  That is an honest answer. When we ask this official organization of \nCongress that is supposed to assess whether $140 billion is enough, \ntheir honest answer is, we can't say either way, but we certainly can't \ngive you a guarantee that $140 billion is all that will be needed.\n  The Congressional Budget Office went on to say, in analyzing the bill \nbefore us:\n\n       CBO expects the value of valid claims likely to be \n     submitted to the fund over the next 50 years could be between \n     $120 and $150 billion, not including possible financing (debt \n     services) costs.\n\n  Remember those words. Because it turns out the money from companies \nwill not come into the trust fund fast enough to pay the massive influx \nof claims right at the start, the trust fund is going to have to borrow \nthat money. And in borrowing money, the trust fund has to pay interest \nand finance costs. And all of the lamentations on the floor here about \nattorney's fees notwithstanding, at the end of the day, we will find \nthat substantial amounts of money in the trust fund will be paid in \ninterest costs, from the borrowing to try to keep this fund afloat as \nlegitimate asbestos victims ask for their fair compensation.\n  That is a reality. It is a reality that suggests the $140 billion \nfigure cannot be substantiated. If this were an idea of Senator Daschle \nand Senator Frist a year and a half ago, as much as I respect both of \nthem, and I respect them very much, I don't know that either one of \nthem is actuaries, nor do I know that they have the expertise to come \nup with a magic figure to predict the cost of this trust fund over a \n50-year lifespan.\n  Let's take some of these concerns directly.\n\n       The CBO states that the expected $120-$150 billion in \n     qualified asbestos injury claims on the trust fund ``does not \n     include possible financing costs and administrative expenses. \n     The interest cost of this borrowing [they say] would add \n     significantly to the long-term costs faced by the fund. . . \n     .''\n\n  What are the financing costs? We are talking about debt service, \nmoney the Federal Government has to expend in order to either lend on \nits own to the new trust fund or go to private capital markets. The \ndebt service costs could reach $50 billion or more.\n  We would find, then, that more than a third of the money going into \nthe trust fund would be used to pay out in interest costs, not in \nvictim compensation. Why? Because the secret and maybe soon public list \nof contributions by companies and insurance companies\n\n[[Page S835]]\n\nindicates not enough will be coming into the fund to match all of the \ninjured victims across America who are going to be turning to this new \nfund, which, at the same time, closes down the court system for \nhundreds of thousands of American citizens.\n\n  Here is more of the CBO's analysis:\n\n       Because expenses would exceed revenues in many of the early \n     years of the fund's operations, the administrator would need \n     to borrow funds to make up the shortfall. The interest cost \n     of this borrowing would add significantly to the long-term \n     costs faced by the fund and contributes to the possibility \n     that the fund might become insolvent.\n\n  Is it worth the gamble? Is it worth the gamble for us to pass a fund \nto close down the court system, to tell people who have worked for \nmonths and years to bring their case to a judge or a jury that they are \nnow out of the system, then close the courtroom doors? Is it worth the \ngamble to them and their families that our calculations are right? \nShould we replace the court system on the possibility that we have \nguessed right about $140 billion, that in fact it would not become \ninsolvent? Or should we shrug our shoulders and say, well, if we \nguessed wrong, what is the worst thing that could happen? According to \nthe author of this bill, the victims will receive less money.\n  So when the chairman of the Judiciary Committee suggests that the \nchorus of voices of victims is what brings us to the floor today, I \nwould say to him I am sure there are some who are in that chorus, but \nit might not be much more than a small quartet. The larger choir of \nvictims across America has told us about their opposition to this bill. \nI could read that list of victims, unions, and other groups into the \nrecord. They are telling us this is the wrong thing to do. It is unjust \nto close the courthouse door to thousands of people across America and \nto say to them: Trust us, we have an idea for a trust fund. It has \nnever been tried before, we are not quite sure of the figure, the \ncontributors to the trust fund are on the secret list which may become \npublic, but trust us. It is well worth your life and your health.\n  There is a group called Bates White which testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, a group that has represented businesses and \nvarious organizations.\n  In September 2005, this economic consulting firm issued a report \nabout this bill. I don't know why they conducted this report, but I \nhave read it and attended a Judiciary Committee hearing where Dr. \nCharles Bates of that firm testified. According to the author, the \nreport examined the viability of the fund. They focused on two primary \ncategories of claimants who posed the greatest threat to the fund's \nfinancial viability.\n  First, they conclude that the bill would create entitlements for many \nindividuals with lung and other cancers who were not compensated in the \nhistorical tort environment. The Bates White report states this \nentitlement likely will result in at least a tenfold increase in the \nnumber of other cancer victims relative to the cases being brought in \nour courts today.\n  Here is why. Based on epidemiological studies between 2000 and 2055, \nsome 3.5 million people in the eligible population covered by this bill \nwill develop lung or other cancers, not including mesothelioma. \nAsbestos is only one of the myriad of significant risk factors that may \nbe causally related to lung and ``other'' cancers. But S. 852 would \ncompensate all cancer claimants who have minimal pleural or lung \nchanges based on subjective x-ray readings.\n  According to this study, the filing rates for the trust fund are also \nexpected to increase substantially over the historical rates in the \ntort system due to the relative ease of the filing which is to be \ncreated by this trust fund bill. Thus, according to Bates White, the \nbill would compensate for a dramatically larger number of patients.\n  Second, the Bates White report concludes that the bill is going to \nrevive what they call ``dormant claims,'' which are asbestos injury \nlawsuits that have been settled with most but not all defendants. The \nbill allows some claimants who filed their lawsuits prior to 2000 to be \neligible for payment in the trust fund if those claims have not been \nfully resolved. Thousands of such cases currently remain on court \ndockets.\n  This incremental entitlement for the differential between the amounts \ncollected in such suits in settlement or judgments, and the amount \nawardable from the fund, they estimate, could total up to $26 billion. \nAnd if these victims seek to recover the difference, that would add \nsignificantly to the cost of the trust fund.\n  Let me say at the outset that I think the court system as well as the \ntrust fund should be generous to victims. As I said earlier, I don't \nknow of a single victim of asbestos exposure who knowingly and \nwillingly exposed themselves. Many of them were duped by deception of \ncorporate officers who insisted there was no danger involved.\n  I am not questioning the decision in the bill to extend such \npayments, but I do join Bates White in questioning whether the programs \nset forth in the bill can be paid for. What Bates White has said is, if \nyou look at the bill as it is written, and the people who will be \ncompensated, it is going to cost dramatically more than earlier \nestimates.\n  Based on these two factors and using very conservative economic \nassumptions, the Bates White study concludes the bill would create \nentitlement claims valued between $301 billion and $561 billion.\n  The bill's trust fund is capped at $140 billion. This study says the \namount of payouts could be more than double, or as much as three times, \nor even more than that in actual payouts. That is how far we could have \nmissed the mark when it comes to this economic analysis underlying this \nbill.\n  What this study found raises serious questions about the solvency of \nthis fund: Saying to the thousands of victims, Close up your court \ncase, stop working with your attorney, stop going to the courthouse, we \nare going to take care of you, and then we don't. We come up with a \n$140 billion trust fund that is inadequate to the needs of these \nvictims.\n  I also want to point out that Bates White updated their study \nyesterday. The economists at this firm announced this week that they \nfound a $90 billion error in the Congressional Budget Office's analysis \nof this same bill.\n  This is a serious issue. It should be serious enough to take this \nbill off the calendar. If the CBO's estimate is wrong by $90 billion, \nwe have to stop where we are. We shouldn't go forward. Bates White's \nnew analysis demonstrates this oversight.\n  According to the numbers the Congressional Budget Office presents in \nits own report, CBO asserts that 1.5 million individuals will receive \ncompensation for nonmalignant conditions, meaning they have bilateral \npleural disease and 5 or more years of exposure. Under this bill, these \nvictims are entitled to medical monitoring.\n  Yet, national cancer incidence rates establish that more than 200,000 \nof these claimants among the 1.5 million will eventually develop lung \nor other cancers.\n  This means, if we take the CBO numbers as the baseline, there could \nbe an additional 200,000 claimants who will qualify for lung and other \ncancer claims, which are paid out much higher levels of compensation in \nthis bill. Yet the Congressional Budget Office's current estimate takes \ninto consideration only 28,000 people in this category.\n  So, the new information from Bates White presents a real concern that \nthe Congressional Budget Office may have missed at least 170,000 \npotential victims who weren't considered in the CBO's earlier analysis.\n  The Congressional Budget Office relied on an arbitrary standard \nassumption that only 15 percent of the population will ever file for \nthe higher claim. These additional claimants represent more than $90 \nbillion in additional costs to the fund.\n  CBO's estimate currently assumes that 85 percent of qualifying \nclaimants who took the trouble to sign up for medical monitoring under \nthis bill would not file the paperwork to collect their entitlement if \nthey ever developed a more serious illness down the road. This is not a \ncredible scenario.\n\n  After all, isn't the purpose of medical monitoring to provide early \ndetection of these and other diseases, which means that more people \nrather than fewer would have the opportunity to learn about such \nillnesses?\n  As late as yesterday, there are new, fundamental questions being \nraised about whether this trust fund at $140\n\n[[Page S836]]\n\nbillion gives us an honest figure to work with. If it is not an honest \nfigure, it means as the years progress, we are going to have to reduce \npayments to victims.\n  To suggest this is a victims bill is to overlook the obvious: the \nstarting point of the bill is so flawed. Let me show you some charts \nabout how this will be funded because I think they are a good \nindication of the problem that the fund faces in convincing a majority \nof the Senate to support this bill.\n  This is a chart which addresses the timing of this bill, comparing \nwhen the liabilities will arise for claims coming into the fund, versus \nwhen the revenues from the companies will come into the trust fund. As \nyou can see, the red line shows liabilities which are very high in the \nearlier years, but you will notice the low green line is never adequate \nto meet the needs of liability. From the outset, the fund is falling \nbehind. Simply stated, it is not collecting enough money to compensate \nvictims.\n  One of the arguments being made is we have to replace the court \nsystem because it takes so long; there are delays. What is going to \nhappen when this fund doesn't have enough money and hundreds of \nthousands of Americans who are sick and dying come for compensation?\n  At best, we will borrow money, adding more cost to the fund \ndramatically, or we will tell them to wait in line until we have \nreceived enough trust fund revenue to pay them. Or, I suppose, as the \nchairman said yesterday, we will just say we can pay them now, but we \nwill have to pay them less than what we promised in this bill. That \nappears to be the range of options based on the way we are dealing with \nthis issue.\n  Take a look at this chart which shows that liabilities will greatly \nexceed the assets of the trust fund from the very start, and the \nexcess--the red line--continues to build over the years. This is a 50-\nyear period of time. You can see even with the revenue coming in that \nit never matches the liabilities they anticipate. This chart doesn't \neven include the new information from the Bates White study, which \ncould mean there is even a greater amount of shortfall in this trust \nfund.\n  Let's talk about interest costs for a moment. The fund borrows in its \nearly years because, obviously, all the corporations on the secret list \ncan't come up with all the money they are supposed to produce \ninitially. Some of them will take a period of time. In fact, some of \nthem have told us to forget it, that this bill will end up bankrupting \nthem. So those companies will disappear.\n  But in the meantime, there are still needy victims and people who \nwould otherwise go to courts for compensation. The fund starts to \nborrow in its first years to meet the shortfall but realizes barely \nhalf the value of future revenue, and the other half has to be used to \npay interest.\n  Senator Hatch was here a few moments ago speaking about attorney's \nfees and how that is taking money away from victims. Some would argue \nthat without an attorney, many victims would never have their day in \ncourt or a chance to succeed in court. What we have here is the fact \nthat we will be paying into this trust fund and almost half of the \nrevenues will be spent on interest and administration. Out of the $140 \nbillion in the trust fund--which may not be enough--almost half of it \nis going to go to pay creditors, financial institutions, banks, maybe \nforeign governments. I don't know who will lend money to this trust \nfund. We will pay out interest to them, and we will have less to pay to \nthe victims.\n  This was really supposed to be an upfront, no-fault system to help \nvictims with $140 billion compensation over 50 years. It turns out that \nthe real steady winners are creditors of the fund. According to one \nanalysis, as little as 52 percent of the trust fund could be used to \npay the claimants and 48 percent for interest, which is almost half of \nthe amount of money during the life of this fund.\n  Some suggest that we are doing a great favor by creating this trust \nfund. Well, it is a great favor for sure to credit institutions but to \nthe victims, it is not. As more money is paid out in interest, less is \navailable for the victims.\n  What the Senator who authored this bill said yesterday is, We will \njust cut the compensation. That is the way we will make up the \ndifference. For every dollar of interest paid, we pay one dollar less \nto someone who is dying of mesothelioma. That is how this is being \nconducted.\n  The sponsors have put a lot of time in this bill, and it was a \nHerculean task to try to address something 50 years in the future. I \nconcede to all of that. But shouldn't the people who are pushing for a \nchange have the burden of proving that change is an improvement over \nstatus quo? Shouldn't that be the starting point of a debate?\n  If you want to change the current system, shouldn't you have the \nburden of establishing that your change is a good one, and that $140 \nbillion is the right figure, rather than to say that Senator Daschle \nand Senator Frist thought it was a good figure? Shouldn't you have the \nburden of showing that the input of money into the trust fund from the \nsecret list of corporations and insurance companies is going to be \nadequate to meet the payouts of the victims? Shouldn't you have the \nresponsibility of showing that $140 billion is going to go to the \nvictims rather than to creditors and financial institutions and \ninterest and administrative costs?\n  Isn't that the starting point? I think it is. Once they have met that \nburden of proof, then we can say: All right, we will compare the court \nsystem to your trust fund and decide which is the better way to go. But \nthey have not met that burden of proof. They have asked us to accept on \nfaith that this trust fund is going to treat victims fairly on a timely \nbasis. I think many people are concerned about that.\n  There will be enormous amounts of claims that are expected to flood \ninto this trust fund on day one, and by that time all the cases in \ncourt will be shut down if they are not at the jury stage. Let me \nrepeat that important fact. If the litigants are not presenting any \nevidence in court, all of those cases will be shut down, according to \nthis bill.\n  You know those victims are going to turn around and say: My husband \nis dying. My husband has limited activity and can't work. Where do I go \nnow?\n  They will be told: Come to the trust fund. Come to this $140 billion \ntrust fund.\n  We can expect a flood of applications in the early stages if this \ntrust fund is created. Will the Department of Labor be able to create \nthis new office and new bureaucracy to manage this flood of claims?\n  For those of you who have any doubts about the efficiency of \ngovernment and its ability to respond to millions of people in need, I \nwould suggest the following words: the Medicare prescription drug bill. \nYou know what I mean.\n  This system which was created 2 years ago by the Senate and the House \nand signed by the President was supposed to compensate some 40 million \nMedicare recipients for their prescription drugs. Ask any Senator in \nthis Chamber what they have heard back home. This is a disaster. They \nhad 2 years to be ready. And, unfortunately, this system is fatally \nflawed. One critic said it is an unsalvageable fiasco and lives are at \nstake. Senior citizens now wonder if they can get their prescription \ndrugs filled, and for some of those it is critical for them to just \nkeep going on a day-to-day basis.\n  Now they are being told in this bill to trust us again.\n  We are going to create a Federal trust fund where hundreds of \nthousands of claims may come in initially and ask that they be \ncompensated on a timely basis, and they will be told by the Federal \nGovernment, trust us, we will give you the money right away.\n  That is cold comfort for someone who has been sitting for a year or \ntwo with medical records and lawyers getting ready to present their \ncase in court. But if they aren't among the fortunate few who have \nbrought their case to a jury or to a judge, presented their evidence, \nand ended up with a verdict or settlement, then, unfortunately, \neverything they have done is for naught. They are tossed out of the \nsystem.\n  These victims deserve better than empty promises in this bill. They \nand the Senate deserve solid information about how this bill will work \nand remain solvent throughout the entire lifetime. Without such \ninformation, the Senate should reject this bill.\n\n[[Page S837]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the recess has arrived.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Professor Thomas \nCrombie Schelling, distinguished university professor emeritus in the \nDepartment of Economics and the School of Public Policy at the \nUniversity of Maryland at College Park, recipient of the 2005 Nobel \nMemorial Prize in Economics for his work in game theory analysis. \nProfessor Schelling shares this prestigious award with Robert J. Aumann \nof Hebrew University in Jerusalem to whom I also offer my most \nheartfelt congratulations.\n  I had the privilege and the pleasure of being one of Professor \nSchelling's students at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard \nUniversity in the early 1970s. Having just graduated from West Point, I \nwas pursuing a masters degree in public policy at the Kennedy School. \nThe public policy program, then, was a new initiative to train recent \ncollege graduates for careers in public service. The Kennedy School had \nassembled a stellar collection of scholars in the fields of political \nscience, economics, quantitative methods, and statistics. Tom Schelling \nwas already recognized as one of the preeminent economists of his \ngeneration and was a leader in the economics instruction of the public \npolicy program.\n  Professor Schelling's classes were fascinating discussions about \ntopics ranging from social costs and externalities to the incentive \nstructures necessary to diminish conflict. Rather than being couched in \njargon and equations, he was able to talk in familiar terms and used \nfamiliar examples, such as cows grazing on common areas or an informal \neconomy based on the trading of cigarettes in a POW camp. I must \nconfess, I was not altogether prepared for his folksy but penetrating \nintellect. But on reflection over many years, I have come to see it as \none of the most useful and powerful courses that I have ever been \nfortunate to take. I realize that his point was to make us think, not \njust to give us some techniques. His insightful framework of analysis \nhas been extremely useful to me in all my endeavors.\n  Professor Schelling's professional standing was matched by the \npersonal regard that his colleagues and students displayed for him. I \nwas fortunate to associate with a gentleman whose integrity and decency \nand kindness left a lasting impression.\n  Professor Schelling received the Nobel Prize ``for having enhanced \nour understanding of conflict and cooperation through game-theory \nanalysis.'' His first book: ``The Strategy of Conflict,'' published in \n1960, ``set forth his vision of game theory as a unifying framework for \nthe social sciences. Professor Schelling showed that a party can \nstrengthen its position by overtly worsening its own options, that the \ncapability to retaliate can be more useful than the ability to resist \nan attack, and that uncertain retaliation is more credible and more \nefficient than certain retaliation.''\n  Professor Schelling's groundbreaking work laid the foundation for \n``new developments in game theory and accelerated its use and \napplication throughout the social sciences. Notably, his analysis of \nstrategic commitments has explained a wide range of phenomena, from the \ncompetitive strategies of firms to the delegation of political decision \npower.''\n  As a result of Professor Schelling's work, the theoretical realm of \ngame theory can now be applied to the real world. This real-world \napplication is known as interactive decisionmaking theory and is used \nto explain why some individuals, organizations, and countries succeed \nin promoting cooperation while others suffer from conflict. His \ninsights have proven extremely relevant in conflict resolution and \nefforts to avoid war.\n  Born on April 14, 1921, in Oakland, CA, Professor Schelling's \ndistinguished career spans five decades. After earning a degree in \neconomics at the University of California at Berkeley in 1944, \nProfessor Schelling worked at the U.S. Bureau of the Budget and served \nin Copenhagen and Paris under the Marshall Plan. He received a Ph.D. in \neconomics from Harvard University in 1951 and worked for the Truman \nadministration. He later became a professor of economics at Yale \nUniversity, held a position at the RAND Corporation, and, in 1958, \njoined the faculty of Harvard University as a professor of economics. \nIn 1969, Professor Schelling also began to teach at Harvard's Kennedy \nSchool of Government, where he held the chair as the Lucius N. Littauer \nProfessor of Political Economy. He left Harvard in 1990 to teach at the \nUniversity of Maryland.\n  Professor Schelling has been elected to the National Academy of \nSciences, the Institute of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and \nSciences, and was president of the American Economic Association, at \nwhich he is a distinguished fellow. He was the recipient of the Frank \nE. Seidman Distinguished Award in Political Economy and the National \nAcademy of Sciences Award for Behavioral Research Relevant to the \nPrevention of Nuclear War. Professor Schelling has written 10 books and \npublished extensively on military strategy and arms control, energy and \nenvironmental policy, climate change, nuclear proliferation, terrorism, \norganized crime, foreign aid, international trade, conflict and \nbargaining theory, racial segregation and integration, the military \ndraft, health policy, tobacco and drug policy, and ethical issues in \npublic policy and in business. His range of inquiry and his searching \nmind have covered a vast panorama of the issues of most concern to \nAmerica over the last 50 years.\n\n  Professor Schelling is a member of a generation that has borne \nwitness to many extraordinary events; however, in his own words ``the \nmost spectacular event of the past half century is one that did not \noccur. We have enjoyed fifty-eight years without any use of nuclear \nweapons.'' His work, and the work of Professor Aumann, has been guided \nby the desire to enhance the understanding of conflict and cooperation \nand deepen the world's understanding of human behavior, relationships, \nand motivation in an effort to prevent the catastrophe of nuclear war.\n  Professor Schelling, thank you for all of your contributions to the \npreservation of peace and, again, congratulations on your outstanding \nachievement.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/08/senate-section/article/S837-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S837-S853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     FAIRNESS IN ASBESTOS INJURY RESOLUTION ACT OF 2005--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to spend the next 20 minutes or so \ntalking about the asbestos reform legislation that is pending before \nthe Senate.\n  During the 3 years I have been in the Senate, I have had the great \nhonor and privilege of serving under two great chairmen of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, Chairman Orrin Hatch and Chairman Arlen Specter. \nThis bill that has come to the floor is the product of a Herculean \neffort, starting with Senator Hatch as chairman of the committee, and \nnow in the able hands of Senator Specter. Along with our ranking \nmember, Senator Leahy, they are cosponsors of this bill.\n  I am one of 18 members of the Judiciary Committee who voted to get \nthe product out of the committee and to the floor of the Senate because \nI believe it is imperative we find a solution to the scandal-ridden \nasbestos litigation crisis facing this Nation. But I was one of seven \nSenators who expressed some strong reservations about the bill in its \ncurrent form, and I think I owe it to my colleagues to explain what we \nwere thinking, what at least I was thinking, and what some of those \nreservations are.\n\n[[Page S838]]\n\n  First, to address the problem confronting this country when it comes \nto the asbestos litigation crisis, the RAND Institute has documented \nthat out of every dollar that goes into this asbestos litigation \ncompensation system, only 42 cents actually goes to the claimant. A \nperson who may have mesothelioma--a terrible and fatal cancer that is \ncaused by inhalation of asbestos fibers--gets only 42 cents on the \ndollar. The rest of it is consumed in what might sort of innocuously be \ncalled transaction costs; that is, the costs of a lawyer to pursue that \nclaim in court, as well as the lawyer hired by the defendant or \ndefendants, as the case may be, together with court costs and other \nassociated expenses of litigation.\n  Well, obviously, with an override of 58 cents on every dollar paid, \nthe transaction costs are steep indeed and cry out for some redress.\n  The other problem in the current system is that over the years there \nhave been so many claims brought on behalf of individuals who may have \nbeen exposed to asbestos but who have no current impairment--in fact, \nmay never get sick as a result of that exposure--that dozens, indeed, I \nthink the number is somewhere in excess of 80 different companies in \nthis country, have been bankrupted. What happens when companies get \nbankrupted is people lose their jobs, and retirees lose their pension \nbenefits or may perhaps receive only pennies on the dollar for what \nthey believe they were entitled to and which they may have expected to \ndepend upon during their later years in life.\n  Because of the huge volume of claims of people who are not sick and \nwho are not impaired but who may have been exposed, that means people \nwho have bona fide claims that are clearly traceable to asbestos-\nrelated disease may end up undercompensated as well or even left \nwithout an adequate remedy.\n  In fairness, the people who have made claims and who are not \npresently impaired are kind of in a catch-22 scenario because under our \nlaws, and under the laws of most States, you usually have--for example, \nin my State of Texas, you have 2 years--if you have been damaged, but \nyou do not yet know the extent of your damage but you have a claim, you \nare required under our laws, under the statute of limitations, to bring \nthat claim within 2 years or else you will be forever barred.\n  So in all fairness to those people who have brought claims, while \nthey have been exposed but may not yet have manifestations of the \ndisease, they are in a box with no way out unless we reform the law. \nAnd, obviously, people who are very sick and may die of asbestos-\nrelated disease, from mesothelioma or some other type of cancer related \nto asbestos, being left with virtually pennies on the dollar, perhaps \nrecovered from a bankruptcy trust, is not justice either.\n  So this has been an issue that cries out for reform. Some have said--\nand I think they are correct--this is not tort reform; this is scandal \nreform. It is an outrage and an injustice that cries out for a \nsolution. Indeed, the U.S. Supreme Court, on three different occasions, \nhas said this is an issue that is beyond the power of the judiciary to \nsolve and asked Congress to come up with a solution to this problem.\n  We have worked to try to come up with a solution, but until this week \nno proposal has come so far as to get to the Senate floor to help \naddress this problem. So I want to give credit where credit is due to \nSenator Specter, the chairman, and the ranking member, Senator Leahy, \nand all the members of the Judiciary Committee who tried to keep this \nprocess moving so we could have a bill ultimately that we could send to \nthe President, that we could be proud of, and that would address this \nterrible injustice.\n  My observation has been that everyone involved in this process has \nbeen, in good faith, trying to find a solution to fix this situation. \nBut it is important to note that while Congress has debated this issue \nand tried to come up with a solution, a number of States, including my \nhome State of Texas--notably, Ohio and a handful of other States--have \nstepped in and passed what are commonly called medical criteria bills, \nwhich, simply stated, allow people who are sick to bring their claims, \nand people who have been exposed but are not currently sick--have no \nimpairment--to toll the statute of limitations so that if and when they \nbecome sick they can bring their claims to court. That seemed to have \nworked pretty well.\n  That is not what this bill does. This bill makes a different choice. \nI want to explain in the few minutes that follow the concerns I have \nabout this particular bill.\n  Here again, Senator Specter has led the way, along with Senator Hatch \nand Senator Leahy and others, to bring us to where we are today. This \nis not easy.\n\n  The bill before the Senate today is vastly better and more improved \nas a result of the work done in the committee and the negotiations and \nthe services of people such as Judge Edward Becker, senior judge on the \nThird Circuit Court of Appeals, who has acted as a mediator among the \nstakeholders to come up with a solution.\n  My fear is that we would replace the current broken litigation system \nfor asbestos injury claims with a complicated, expensive, and \nultimately unsustainable entitlement program. Let me explain what those \nconcerns are in particular.\n  Asbestos liability reform, whether it is a trust fund or medical \ncriteria legislation such as some States have, whatever the type, \nrequires sound medical criteria to filter out fraudulent claims. My \nconviction is that the criteria employed in S. 852, the current \nlegislation before us, are faulty and would unnecessarily include \npayments to individuals whose illnesses are not connected to asbestos \nexposure. There are two examples I can think of. One has to do with \ncancer claims. This trust fund would purportedly compensate those with \ncancer claims yet without evidence of asbestos-related disease. \nObviously, we know this is not designed to be a cancer trust fund; it \nis designed to be an asbestos trust fund. We have to have sound medical \ncriteria which would distinguish between cancer and asbestos because if \nwe open up the criteria too broadly, chances are the claims are going \nto overwhelm the fund and it will be unsustainable and unsuccessful.\n  My second concern, beyond the medical criteria that are not tight \nenough to filter out fraudulent or unrelated claims, is that the $140 \nbillion, which is the current amount of the trust fund, will not be \nadequate to meet the claims. This admittedly is an area in which there \nis no scientific precision because we are looking out years from now \nand trying to estimate how many people are going to have claims, what \nthe mix of those claims is going to be. For example, if you have more \nmesothelioma cases than you think, then it will drain the fund \nprecipitously and make it unsustainable.\n  Chairman Specter and the Judiciary Committee have heard from a number \nof experts, including the Congressional Budget Office, as well as \nindependent estimates, that conclude--I am sorry to say--that the $140 \nbillion fund will likely be too small to cover the cost and, \nultimately, will render the fund insolvent. The CBO estimates that the \ntrust fund would be presented with claims totaling between $100 and \n$150 billion, but it also projects that total costs would be higher \nbecause the fund must also cover administrative expenses and any \nfinancing costs.\n  I heard the Democratic whip, Senator Durbin, talk about the financing \ncosts associated with the cash-flow requirements of this fund. I share \nsome, but not all, of his concerns in that regard. The CBO makes clear \nthat ``there is a significant likelihood that the fund's revenues would \nfall short of the amount needed to pay valid claims, debt service, and \nadministrative costs.''\n  It gets worse, not better. An economic consulting firm by the name of \nBates White has estimated that the trust fund will generate far more \nclaims than the tort system and the existing trust and will result in \nclaims perhaps ranging from $300 billion to $695 billion. In other \nwords, the trust fund proposed by this legislation would be $140 \nbillion, but Bates White, in a different analysis, has said they think \nthe claims could reach $695 billion, ultimately forcing the fund into \ninsolvency and sunsetting the fund within 1 to 3 years of its \ninception.\n  Even if you agree with the CBO estimate, it is clear that $140 \nbillion will at least, under their estimate, not satisfy\n\n[[Page S839]]\n\nthe claims made on the fund in administrative costs and the like \nbecause the CBO cost estimate does not include potential dormant \nclaims, possible take-home exposure claims by family members, \nexceptional medical claims, claims from people living near Libby-like \nsites--and I will explain what I mean by that in a moment--as well as \nthe impact of allowing CT scans to serve as documentation of pleural \nabnormalities. In other words, the diagnostic test used to determine \nimpairment from asbestos-related disease is important to screen out \npeople who are impaired from people who are not impaired. All of these \nadditional factors that CBO's cost estimate does not take into account \ncould add billions of dollars of cost to the trust fund.\n  Even more troubling, the CBO's own analysis provides that 1.2 million \nclaimants will be deemed to have qualified for medical monitoring. In \nother words, they have been exposed. They are not impaired. Yet under \nthe trust fund, they would be monitored to see if they do become \nimpaired and thus qualify for a claim under the fund.\n  Unfortunately, the CBO misses the fact that if we apply standard \nepidemiological statistics, as many as 200,000 of the 1.2 million \nclaimants who qualify for medical monitoring will one day develop \ncancer of some form, and thus the total cost of the fund could be as \nmuch as $90 billion more than the CBO has estimated.\n  Just a footnote here, another problem. I don't mean to have a laundry \nlist of criticisms of the bill because, as I said, miraculously we have \nreached this point, but there remains some of the hardest issues we \nneed to find solutions to if we are going to solve this scandal that \notherwise goes by the name of the asbestos litigation crisis.\n  This trust fund--here again, I don't know whether all of our \ncolleagues have had a chance to look at the bill in the kind of detail \nI am discussing, so that is the reason I wanted to identify these \nconcerns, to see if we can find some solution--also provides $600 \nmillion, not to pay claims, not for administrative costs, but for \nadditional screening to find new claimants. In other words, it is \nbasically a marketing program to go out and try to find individuals who \nmight also make a claim to the fund rather than those who have self-\nidentified or have been referred to the fund.\n  I don't have to tell my colleagues; all they have to do is read the \nnewspaper or current court cases that are pending. For example, in the \nSouthern District of Texas, in front of Judge Janis Jack of Corpus \nChristi, fraudulent medical screenings have produced an enormous number \nof bogus cases that have created a huge burden on the current civil \njustice system. It is beyond me why we would want to go out and shop, \nin essence, or market to try to find more claimants to the fund over \nand above the ones CBO or Bates White or other educated guesses \nestimate will be made against the fund. That is a problem, too.\n  My point is that with regard to the number of claims and the demands \nmade upon the fund, one of the concerns I have is that if the trust \nfund sunsets in 1 to 3 years the way Bates White says it might do, or 5 \nyears or 10 years, it forces reversion; that is, claims go back to the \nsame broken tort system that brings us here today. So what might happen \nis that companies would have to pay into the fund, but the fund would \nbe overwhelmed and thus leave people without a remedy under the fund. \nThen it would revert to the same broken tort system, with all of the \nscandal associated with it, with all of the injustice associated with \nthe status quo.\n\n  It is also worth noting--and this ought to caution us--that previous \nattempts to establish national trust funds largely have failed because \ntotal costs have exceeded those originally predicted. I am thinking \nparticularly about the General Accounting Office report on black lung \nand similar funds.\n  We know there have been many bankruptcies associated with the current \nasbestos litigation system. Indeed, there is currently about $7.5 \nbillion of bankruptcy trust funds that would be swept into this bill by \nthe Federal Government to help make the $140 billion total proceeds \navailable under the fund. These are existing bankruptcy trust funds \nwhich are currently paying claimants, people who were exposed to \nasbestos fibers and who are sick. But what this fund does--this is part \nof the problem--in an effort to get up to the $140 billion, it \nbasically is a Federal confiscation of existing bankruptcy trust funds \nto the order of $7.5 billion. Noted constitutional lawyers, whose names \nare very familiar to the Members of the Senate, have come to me, as I \nknow they have others on the committee, and said: How can it be that \nthe Federal Government can take $7.5 billion in existing funds that are \ncurrently paying claims to sick asbestos victims and scoop it into this \n$140 billion fund? So at minimum, we would have to concede there will \nbe litigation, and likely successful litigation, challenging the \nconstitutionality of this taking by the Federal Government.\n  I mentioned earlier that Libby-like issue. Let me explain the \nchallenge we have. In Libby, MT, a number of residents were apparently \nexposed to asbestos fibers generated from a W. R. Grace plant located \nin that city. What the Senators from Montana have done in this bill--\nand I congratulate them for their advocacy on behalf of their \nconstituents--is establish an automatic qualification and a floor of \n$400,000 for any individual who qualifies living within 20 miles of \nthat town. Why is that exceptional? Most of the claimants under this \nfund have to be those exposed in the course and scope of their \nemployment. The Libby exception is not an occupational exposure but one \nbecause you happen to be a resident of that town and establishes an \nautomatic qualification of a $400,000 floor to anyone who lives within \n20 miles.\n  Whatever the merits of that special treatment for Libby, the problem \nwe have is that there are as many as 28 other sites in the country, \nincluding my State of Texas, that may well deserve to be eligible for \nthe same or similar special treatment. In other words, if we say people \nwho are exposed not occupationally but environmentally because of the \nrelease of asbestos fibers due to an asbestos company operating in \ntheir State, if we are going to say Libby, MT, residents are entitled \nto that, I don't know how we cannot, in fairness, say that other \nsimilarly situated persons are not entitled to the same benefit.\n  The challenge, though, the problem that presents is it threatens to \nrender the fund insolvent because of the volume of claims that will be \nmade under this provision if expanded to include other individuals in \nthese 28 other sites. I don't know how this fund can remain solvent \nunless the Libby, MT, provision is removed.\n  The challenge the chairman has had is, every time he has someone ask \nfor a change in the bill, he risks losing someone else who is on the \nbill and vice versa. So I know he has tried his best to try to balance \nthis wobbly entity known as the asbestos trust fund. That creates an \nanomaly and potentially an unfairness, one which would render the trust \nfund asunder.\n  The next issue that I have concerns about is this. There is no \nquestion that some very large companies in this country that have been \nexposed to almost endless asbestos litigation are desperate to bring \nthat to a conclusion, to be able to cap off their liability and be able \nto put that behind them and get back to work providing jobs and \ncontributing to the engine of the American economy. So there are some \ncompanies that are desperate to bring this to a conclusion. They are so \ndesperate, they are willing to accept this trust fund on the faith, \nhope, and wish that it will be made better through this process--the \namendment process and in conference.\n  But there are others who have come forward and demonstrated to me and \nother Senators that if they are forced to contribute to the trust fund \nunder the current allocation system, it exceeds the profit of their \nongoing business. In other words, if forced by the Federal Government \nto contribute to the trust fund at the current amount created in this \nallocation scheme, we will, in effect, render a number of companies--no \none knows how many--bankrupt, and they will go out of business; and the \npeople they employ, the hard-working Americans they employ, will be out \nof work. Potentially, the pensions of the retirees will be put in \njeopardy.\n  Now, that is not the intention of the trust fund designers. Believe \nme, the\n\n[[Page S840]]\n\nwork is ongoing to try to find an equitable allocation scheme. But I \npoint out that in trying to effect a cure, we need to make sure the \ncure isn't worse than the underlying disease for many of the companies \nand individuals affected.\n  Let me end my remarks on a couple of other final matters that I think \ncall out for resolution or improvement in this bill. I have told \nSenator Specter that I want to be part of the solution to this problem; \nI don't want to be an impediment to trying to reach some equitable and \nfair resolution because this scandal should not continue a minute \nlonger than it has before we come up with some good solution to this \nterrible problem.\n  One of the things I am concerned about in this bill, as well, is that \nthe Department of Labor would have to administer this $140 billion \nfund, however it works. Obviously, there are going to have to be a lot \nof new people hired to perform those duties, and I believe it will, in \nfairness, create a new Government bureaucracy, designed to administer \nthis program in the Department of Labor.\n  I am wary about creating new Government bureaucracies and programs in \nWashington, DC. I am reminded of the quote of former President Ronald \nReagan. He said: The closest thing to eternal life here on Earth is a \ntemporary Government program. This is supposed to be a temporary \nGovernment program, but I fear that we will create a new and mammoth \nbureaucracy within the Department of Labor that will never go away, \neven after the trust fund has come and gone.\n  So I look forward, during the course of the debate, to have the \nopportunity to offer amendments in the form of alternatives, which I \nthink may provide a better solution to the problem that we all agree \nexists; and failing that, to offer amendments that will, I hope, \nnarrowly address some of the problems presented in the list of issues I \nhave spoken about. We need to make sure our good intentions don't \nexacerbate the problem. In a way, I sort of look at this as a \nlegislative or congressional Hippocratic oath. Doctors take a \nHippocratic oath which says: First, do no harm. You want to make sure \nthe cure doesn't kill the patient. Indeed, I think we need to take a \ncongressional Hippocratic oath that also says: First, do no harm. That \nought to be our initial focus, to try to find a solution to this very \ndifficult, complicated problem.\n  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues in good faith, in \nan effort to try to find that solution, even in the form of an \nalternative, if necessary, or, failing that, to come up with some \ntargeted amendments which will address some of the concerns, which will \nmake sure that sick people get paid and people who are not sick don't \nget paid--to make sure we don't explode the fund by underestimating the \ndemands made upon it--and that we have some fairness when it comes to \nthe allocation of who pays into the fund and that we proceed to a full \nand final solution to the problem, not a temporary patch that, \nultimately, leads then back into the ditch in which we currently find \nourselves, known as the asbestos liability crisis.\n  I see my colleague from Alabama, with whom I proudly serve on the \nJudiciary Committee, who is steeped in the details and has been part of \na Herculean effort to come up with a solution. At this time, I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I urge everybody who has questions about \nthis legislation and who did not hear Senator Cornyn's remarks, to get \na copy and review it. I think he made some terrific points and has gone \nto the heart of the issue and explained a lot of what we are doing.\n  Mr. President, the asbestos system, as it is operating today, is \nfraught with misconduct and inefficiencies and unfairness. That is an \nabsolute fact. I had been involved, as a private lawyer, many years \nago--I guess in the late 1970s--with some of these cases. I wish to say \nthat I was representing plaintiffs who were injured badly as a result \nof severe asbestos exposure--people inside ships and submarines, \ncutting asbestos with electric saws where the air was so filled with \nasbestos dust that they could hardly breathe. They had to leave the \nsubmarine to get fresh air, and then go back in to work. They were \nseverely damaged and disabled as a result of that. People like the \nplaintiffs I represented deserve compensation, there is no doubt about \nit.\n  Since sometime in the 1970s, it has become clear that asbestos is a \ndangerous product and there have been complete changes in how it is \nhandled. Asbestos today is almost treated similar to nuclear waste. We \nhave had laws to prohibit it altogether. If you see somebody removing \nasbestos from a building, they have masks on, and they do all these \nthings with the greatest of care so they are not exposed. But some \nexposure for most people does not result in serious illness, or any \nillness at all. But certain exposure can. So it is a dangerous \nsubstance, and it creates a lot of stress and concern that a person \nmight get sick. For those who are currently sick, they deserve \ncompensation. So I say it is rational that some people have filed \nlawsuits to seek recovery.\n  But the way these lawsuits are now proceeding through the system \nmakes very little sense. We have 300,000 cases pending today. Plaintiff \nlawyers get a chunk of those fees or recoveries on a contingent basis. \nWe have criticized them for taking their third or 40 percent, or \nwhatever they get out of a recovery--money that on the docket sheet \nmight look like the plaintiff got $100,000, but the truth is, right off \nthe top comes $30,000 to $40,000 that goes to the attorneys, not to \nmention the cost of buying depositions and the cost of medical \nwitnesses who testify at trial. That all comes out before the plaintiff \ngets any money. That is the fact, the way it works. I was never been \nproud of how this system worked in the asbestos cases I saw when I was \ninvolved with it. It has gotten worse today.\n  Groups of lawyers have made hundreds and hundreds of millions of \ndollars out of these cases, and they file thousands of suits. They may \nhave 10,000 cases pending. Plaintiffs are grouped, and then are not \ngiven individual attention. The lead lawyers probably don't even know \nthe plaintiffs' names, and probably have paralegals interview them. So \nthe system is even worse than when it initially started.\n  What else has occurred with the system? We are having people who are \nnot sick, as Senator Cornyn noted, recovering money and putting \ncompanies into bankruptcy; they may never get sick and probably will \nnot get sick. Those cases are crowding out the cases of people who are \nsick. As I noted last night, there are widows of mesothelioma victims, \na deadly cancer that is clearly tied to asbestos. We have those \nwidows--some are for the bill and some are against the legislation--\nlobbying us. I say to those widows that the sad thing is that your \nhusband--or it could be a wife--did not get paid before they died. Why \ncan we not create a system in which widows are not out here trying to \nclaim the money, but instead we have a system where money goes straight \nto the victims, in their days of illness, before they pass away. Isn't \nthat a better system?\n  Under the national fund, if a person has mesothelioma and can show an \nexposure to asbestos, they can walk into the Administrator's office--\nthe office that will receive the claims, with a doctor and a medical \nreport that demonstrates that this person has a disease--and if it is \nnot contested--and I don't think many mesothelioma cases would be--they \nget a check right there for 50 percent of the $1.1 million. And then \nthe other 50 percent has to be paid, as I recall, within 6 months. So \nthey get a million dollars while they are alive to take care of their \nlast days and their families, instead of having these lawsuits out here \npending literally for years while people are dying without receiving \ncompensation. That is happening today.\n  These cases are not going to trial with big verdicts returned. They \nare clogging up the system. They are suing hundreds of defendants per \nplaintiff. Some defendants agreed to pay 250, others 150. The lawyer is \ntaking out their fee, and little checks are going off to people who are \nsick. They never know how much they are going to end up with before it \nis over. They started out with 300 defendant companies, I believe, that \nshipped asbestos, that knew asbestos was dangerous and did not put \nwarnings out, allowed people to breathe it and injure themselves, \ndestroy their health. Those 300 companies\n\n[[Page S841]]\n\nwere the only ones originally sued. There was a long battle over that.\n  Then there was the decision that said, Well, if you were one of the \ncompanies that shipped asbestos into Engel's Shipyard, and you cannot \nprove when you shipped it, but if you shipped it in at any time, you \nare jointly and severally liable with everybody else. So plaintiffs \nwould not have to prove that they breathed this asbestos--whether it \nwas Owens Corning or Johns Manville or anybody else; as long as the \ncompany shipped it in there, they were liable, too. So that opened \nthings up and more cases were filed. And then good lawyers figured out \na way to add more defendants and find more deep pockets with insurance. \nAnd from 300 defendants, we now have 8,400 companies that have been \nsued.\n  One of them I remember several years ago came to me and told me this \nstory. He said: We bought a company, a subsidiary, that for 2 years had \nsold asbestos. They had not sold asbestos for many years before we \nbought them. We bought them, and now we are as liable as any company in \nthe country. It is like they put an IV system running through the \nsubsidiary right into the heart of another company that never was \ninvolved in shipping asbestos without warning the recipients. Yet they \nare responsible for funding all this.\n  So this is the way this issue has mushroomed. This is the way it has \nreally happened. That is why we have thousands of companies willing to \npay into this fund to get relief.\n  I mention the cost of the plaintiff lawyers, but think about these \ncompanies. They have lawyers, too. They have to pay them, and these are \nsome high-paid lawyers. If you are, indeed, being sued for $100 million \na person, and you have a number of claimants out there, you have to \nhire good lawyers to defend you.\n  The RAND Corporation study has concluded that 58 percent of the money \nactually paid out by companies that are defendants did not get to the \nvictims but was eaten up in these kinds of costs, like fees for \nplaintiff and defense attorneys. It is really tremendous.\n  It started out with some tough litigation. Dickie Scruggs of \nMississippi, a brilliant lawyer, believes these cases were justified. \nHe thought up the cause of action. He battled these cases for years. He \novercame all the legal defenses and then found the evidence that was \ncritical to these cases. Then they found evidence that the company that \nshipped asbestos had known all along this was dangerous and did not \ntell anybody. They had a smoking-gun memorandum. That is how it started \nand went forward.\n  Dickie Scruggs, just a few days ago, appeared with Chairman Arlen \nSpecter and said: We are beyond that now. These cases ought to be \nsettled based on the health of the person. It is not necessary to have \nthem all in courtrooms all over America. It should not cost so much. It \nis a whole different ball game now.\n  Now the companies are willing to pay money. They are not defending on \nthe basis of whether they should pay. They only want to pay a fair \namount, and they want some certainty in how much they pay. Dickie \nScruggs thought that was reasonable. He said people who are not sick \nare being paid and the costs are too great.\n  It is interesting that the real architect of these cases who \nrepresented the first plaintiffs and who battled those cases forward \nthrough all the objections and battles that occurred now says this bill \nis good for the plaintiffs.\n  Some say some businesses might pay too much. I don't know that they \nknow how much they are going to pay and how much they should pay. We \nare not here as Senators to decide whether companies ought to pay more \nto plaintiffs, or which defendants should pay more, and how much a \nplaintiff really should get, except to say we need to create a system \nthat fairly allocates the money to the people who deserve to be \ncompensated, and that the money is fairly distributed.\n  There is a limited amount of money for asbestos cases. Quite a number \nof companies have gone into bankruptcy, and many more will follow. If \nthey go into bankruptcy, they do not have to pay anymore. You can't get \nblood from a turnip. You are not going to be able to recover from \nbankrupt companies. Creating a system that allows the companies a \nchance to survive, to make money and to create wealth that they can \nthen pay to people who are sick makes sense. That is what this bill \ntries to do.\n  Those are achievable goals. The simple matter is, when you have \nalmost 60 percent of the money paid out by these defendant companies \ngoing to costs, why in the world can't Congress come up with a plan to \ntake that 60 percent, not let it be eaten up in costs, and send it \nstraight to the victims? We can do that. That is what Senator Specter, \nSenator Hatch, and others have worked for years to accomplish.\n  Lester Brickman, a professor of law at Yeshiva University in New \nYork, who published an extensive article in the Pepperdine Law Review, \nhad this to say about the asbestos litigation:\n\n       The rules of ethics don't apply to asbestos litigation. \n     Everything you see with asbestos is slimy. It's all under the \n     radar screen and it's infected with self-interest and illegal \n     behavior.\n\n  That is a pretty strong statement. I have to tell you, Mr. President, \nthere is too much truth in it. It shouldn't be that way. We can clean \nit up. It is time for reform, and that is what we are about today: \ncleaning up what has become a haven for abuse. We need to establish a \nsystem where real victims, those truly and currently sick from asbestos \nexposure, can receive immediate compensation.\n  I know there are some who have concerns about S. 852. You can count \nme among those who believe this is not perfect legislation, that there \nare still some things that have to be done to fix it. However, it does \nrepresent a good start, and I think with certain amendments on the \nSenate floor and in conference it can be made better. If we work \ntogether, we can pass a bill that will help solve this current asbestos \ncrisis.\n  The asbestos litigation affects our economy adversely in a \nsignificant way. It has had an undeniable impact on jobs and economic \ngrowth. Instead of spending money on increasing production, expanding \njobs, research and development, companies have had to spend millions of \ndollars paying claimants and fending off lawsuits.\n  The runaway asbestos litigation system has forced many companies into \nbankruptcy. Seventy-seven companies are in bankruptcy or on the verge \nof bankruptcy because they have been the target of asbestos-related \nlawsuits, causing them to lay off 60,000 American workers who have in \nturn lost $200 million in wages. That is not a small matter.\n  Companies are not saying we don't have to pay anymore. In fact, they \nare prepared to pay $140 billion. They are saying: Give us certainty so \nwe can go to our shareholders and plan our future over the next 30 \nyears, and then we can provide more money to actually go to the people \nwho are sick and less to overhead costs, lawsuits, and lawyers. We will \nbe happy; we will take that. That is the opportunity we have today.\n\n  We must be sure that the trust fund we created preserves limited \nresources for the truly sick and does not pay claimants who have no \nreal injury or whose sicknesses were not caused by asbestos. We are \ntalking hundreds of thousands of people who have had some exposure to \nasbestos. Only those truly sick should be compensated.\n  For example, thousands of people have developed colorectal cancer. \nAre the asbestos companies liable for everybody who at one time worked \nfor them or was exposed in even a slight way to an asbestos product? \nAre they liable for diseases unlikely to be caused by asbestos? If you \nget skin cancer, are they liable for that, or heart disease or throat \ncancer? Maybe, maybe not; it depends on what the science says.\n  Efforts have been made to place into this system liability \nrequirements on defendants to pay damages for diseases that may have \nhad no connection whatsoever to asbestos. That is the way you kill this \nsystem. We can't do that. We cannot have this fund, which has a limited \namount of money--huge as it is--with these thousands of claimants--to \npay people who are not sick because of asbestos--we have to be generous \nwith victims, but we cannot be paying people whose sickness is not \nrelated to asbestos.\n  Again, there is very little evidence, if any, that colorectal cancer \nwould be connected to asbestos.\n  As I noted, we now have 8,400 companies that are being sued as a part \nof\n\n[[Page S842]]\n\nthis process. Many of these have a limited link, if any at all, to \nasbestos but are named in the lawsuit because most of the original \nmanufacturers that were sued have gone bankrupt.\n  In a statement to the New York City Bar Association, U.S. District \nJudge Jack Weinstein--one of the most famous judges in the country, I \nwould add--had this to say about the impact asbestos litigation was \nhaving on certain companies' ability to stay in business:\n\n       If the acceleration of asbestos lawsuits continues \n     unaddressed, it is not impossible that every company with \n     even a remote connection to asbestos may be driven into \n     bankruptcy.\n\n  These bankruptcies are not only a threat to jobs and the incomes of \nAmerican workers, they threaten retirement savings. The average worker \nat a bankrupt asbestos-related firm with a 401(k) plan suffered $8,300 \nin pension losses. Of course, in a number of instances, when a person \nloses his job, he loses his health insurance as well. So this \nlitigation is having an impact on real people.\n  Judge Weinstein said even a company with a remote connection to \nasbestos could go bankrupt. One could ask, How is this possible? It is \nlike I said before; this litigation is like an IV system that goes \nthrough one person, sucking all the blood out of them, and if they can \nfind another person that has blood in them, they will begin to suck it \nout of them, too. It is just that simple. Whoever has the money is who \nthey will go to next. Whoever is left standing is the next one this \nlitigation turns on and in an attempt to show they are liable.\n  We need to bring predictability to this system by creating a national \ntrust fund. If we succeed, I believe the companies with asbestos \nliability will then be able to start creating jobs rather than \neliminating them.\n  We have a lot of important issues we are going to confront as we \nhammer out the final language in this legislation. It would be a shame \non this Congress if somehow, some way, we cannot pass solid legislation \nthat takes 60 percent of the money that is now going to overhead and \nlawyer's fees and use that to create better benefits for the plaintiffs \nand provide certainty to the defendants so they can plan their future \nwithout going bankrupt.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I don't think we have ever seen anything as \ncomplicated as the issue before us. We have a vested interest in this \nissue in Libby, MT.\n  I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning business for 10 \nminutes, not thinking I will use all the 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Burns pertaining to the introduction of S. 2256 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the comments of the Senator and his \nleadership on this important issue. It is certainly one important for \nour State and all States.\n  I see the Senator from New Mexico. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is it appropriate \nfor the Senator from New Mexico to speak as in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 5 minutes and ask I be permitted to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             LEASEHOLD 181\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a matter that is \nobviously dear to the occupant of the chair because it has to do with \nleasehold 181, off the coast of Florida, Alabama, Louisiana. The bill, \nwhich was introduced yesterday by Senator Bingaman, myself, Senator \nTalent, and Senator Dorgan, seeks to permit drilling on a portion of \nsection 181 within 1 year. The bill protects a 100-mile buffer from the \ncoastline of the State of Florida. This bill protects a portion of 181 \nthat the U.S. Armed Forces indicated they might someday need to perform \non and use for some military purposes.\n  These two exceptions and protections are explicit. That is, how far \nfrom the coast of Florida and the military protection area. But more \nthan this, this bill seeks to protect the American people from the \nrising cost of heating their homes and filling up their cars, and, yes, \nsoon, cooling their homes.\n  Today, the price of oil is about $65 a barrel, and the price of \nnatural gas, while lower than a few months ago, is $8.24 for a million \nBtu's. To put that in perspective, if you go back only 6 years, the \nUnited States in its totality was spending $50 billion on natural gas. \nToday, we are spending $200 billion, and rising. That means many \nAmerican businesses have already gone broke because they cannot pay for \nthe price of natural gas. It means the petrochemical industry in \nAmerica is hanging on, can't grow, and certainly, where they were going \nto build here, they are building elsewhere. The fertilizer industry is \nalmost bankrupt, and the manufacturing industry is suffering from many \nthings, but they will tell you the highest priority is to get natural \ngas prices under control.\n  While we are protecting Florida, we are charged with the \nresponsibility of doing what we can to help the American consumer.\n  This year, we were very lucky, although Katrina was unlucky. The \nprice of natural gas did not stay high, as high as it was going, \nbecause we had a warm winter. It still is at an enormously high price, \nand I just told you about that. Many Americans had their budgets and \nhad disposable income. They woke up when they got their natural gas \nbill and half of their disposable income was gone. Where? To their gas \nbill, because many of them went up from $100 to $200, $200 to $400.\n  I must say to Senators, we have been told--the Energy Committee, \nSenator Bingaman and I have been told--that the highest priority for \nnatural gas production in the United States--not second, not third, not \nfourth; the highest--is Leasehold 181. It is ready. It is known. They \nhave drilled all around it with no damage. We had Katrina and no \nspills. It is 100 miles from Florida, and it will produce a minimum \napproximating 6 trillion cubic feet. What is that? It is one-fourth of \nthe entire natural gas use of the United States per year; 10 million \nhouses cooled and heated for 6 years. This piece of coast, offshore \nland.\n  It seems to me that every year we come into session, we hope we can \nprove to the American people that we can do something. We say: Can't we \nprove that we can move? We are going to move this bill out of committee \nwithin 3 weeks. If the leader permits, we will bring it to the floor. \nWe are going to tell the Senate: You can let us help the American \npeople or you can play games; you can take 3 weeks on this bill. It \ndoesn't require but 2 or 3 days of debate. If somebody wants to \nfilibuster, that is learned quickly. Let us decide whether we want to \nkill the bill or not. At least everybody is going to know they are not \nall so tough, that we have to tell the American people we just can't do \nit, too complicated, too many committees, too much argument. Not so.\n  The highest supply production issue for the United States and our \npeople today is this little bill. If we do it, we take one high-\npriority item off the table and we say: Well, we can do something for a \nchange.\n  It is bipartisan. My good friend from my State and I have the luxury \nof being the only committee for many years which has two Senators from \nthe same State being the lead Republican and the lead Democrat. We are \ngoing to bring this down here together. It was introduced together. We \njust had a press conference. We say the same things. We both speak \ndifferently, obviously, but we are going to do it because it brings \nimmediate relief to millions.\n  That is probably 6 minutes instead of the 5 I reserved. If so, I ask \nconsent that it be all right with the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico should be \ncongratulated for his leadership on this issue. He has understood it \nfrom the beginning. He warned us about the dangers of surging natural \ngas prices for years and years. As a matter of fact, I can remember a \nhost of committee hearings in which Alan Greenspan\n\n[[Page S843]]\n\nwarned us that we need to do something about natural gas.\n  Isn't it true that we have now not only homes being heated and \nbusinesses being heated and we are using natural gas for fertilizer and \nother things, but electricity is using more natural gas than ever, to \ncreate our electricity? Is that the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct. Not only is that correct, every single \nnew powerplant--98 percent of powerplants built in the United States in \nthe last 15 years--is natural gas.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Natural gas wells. I live in Mobile, AL, on the gulf \ncoast. We have a lot of production right around where we live. We have \nnever had any serious spills, to my knowledge, that amounted to real \ndamage to the environment since the beginning. They are more safe and \ncareful today than they have ever been, and the technology is better \nthan it has ever been.\n  We are having a debate now about liquefied natural gas and building \nterminals where we send our money off to some foreign country that may \nbe hostile to us, and they freeze, liquefy this natural gas at great \nexpense, transfer it all the way over the ocean, and then they have to \nheat it up, which causes environmental problems, and then put it in our \npipelines, and instead of the money staying in our country, it goes \naround the world.\n  When we have these huge reserves right off our own shore, doesn't it \nmake sense to the Senator that we ought to go forward and produce? I \nsee the smile on the Senator's lips. We have been through this before. \nBut it is really pretty basic.\n  I hope the American people are beginning to understand that we can't \ndeny ourselves. Do you know where they get the oil and gas from the \nPersian Gulf? They get it out in the water. If it is an environmental \nissue, it is as bad to get it out of the Persian Gulf, I suppose, as \nout of the Gulf of Mexico, and certainly economically it makes more \nsense, I believe.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I guess this shouldn't get me started \nbecause I should not be here, I have something else to do, but I guess \nwhen you are in the Senate, you ought to stay in the Senate.\n  But on liquefied natural gas--I might as well make sure the Senate \nhears this--we can't get along without liquefied natural gas for the \nnext 25 years, and when you add up demands, unless something really \nbreaks--maybe if we had all of the Alaskan plants for natural gas down \nhere, but it takes long enough to--I think the statement is we must \nhave energy. But we were counting on a lot of it. It is happening, \nhowever. It is being bought in place by foreign countries.\n  Let me tell you that what means. Qatar, a country with huge supplies \nof natural gas, may very well decide that they could sell the whole \nnatural gas field to China. There won't be any ships on the sea on \nwhich to bid. That could happen.\n  Right now, natural gas in the form of liquefied natural gas is not \ncoming to America in large quantities. We need a lot more ports to get \nready. But they are paying more for it to go to Spain than what we pay \nto bring it here because there is such a demand.\n  While we sit on the natural gas expecting LNG, the LNG is being bid \nup and going elsewhere, and we sit here wondering whether we should \npass this bill to use our own, which is 100 miles offshore.\n  It isn't all so clear where we are going to get this natural gas, \nthis beautiful product. It is so good that we burn it right in our \nkitchens. That ought to show you it is pretty safe. It is so good that \nwe said no nuclear, no coal; let's just use it to make electricity. We \ndecided to do that. That is when we got into this problem. I am not so \nsure we should have done it differently, but that is what happened.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from New Mexico to add me \nas a cosponsor of the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBurns be made a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, that bill was introduced yesterday. I \ndon't have the number, but the clerk has it. Senator Sessions is not on \nthat bill.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would be pleased to be part of it and \nsign onto it. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his leadership in \nconstantly pressing to make sure this Nation does not make a mistake. \nWe have made a lot of them in our energy policy. We have been blessed \nto have the Senator there.\n  We are now talking in Mobile about a new LNG terminal. Some people \nare concerned about it. We need to be very careful about it. But it \ncosts so much more to import liquefied natural gas and then to regasify \nit and ship it around our Nation than to produce it off our own shore. \nAnd when we produce it off our own shore, the money stays in the United \nStates; it doesn't go to these foreign countries.\n  I believe, from an economic point of view, we have huge reserves out \nthere. I will share, maybe, my thoughts a little later. Maybe Florida \nwas legitimately nervous in the early days about these wells and \nwhether they would damage their beaches. But this far offshore, \nproduction has proven now year after year after year to be safe. It is \nnot their waters. These deep waters are not Florida waters; they are \nU.S. waters.\n  We need to begin in a careful way to examine how we deal with this \nand see if we can't increase our production in the gulf. Alabama has \nfound it to be safe. It is somewhat beneficial to our Treasury.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to make two more observations \nwhile my friend from Alabama is still here, and one in a general way.\n  I say to Senator Sessions that we spoke a little bit about the Energy \nPolicy Act which we passed last August. It is a phenomenal bill. People \nstopped paying attention to it. But in the proposals the President put \nforth, all but one of those were in the Energy bill. They are waiting \nto be funded. He proposed them, so we are going to fund them. But from \nthat day that it was passed until today--on the day it was passed, \nthere were zero applications, permit applications for nuclear \npowerplants. Zero. Today, there are 18. It is not in China that they \nwant to build 20, or something like that; it is in the U.S.A. because \nof that bill. I am not saying all of them are going to be built, I am \nnot saying they have turned a shovel, but clearly the strong indication \nfrom consortia and individual companies is that because of what we did \nin that bill, it is time to add to the diversity.\n  What does that mean? That means had we had those, we wouldn't have a \nnatural gas shortage today because little of the gas would have gone \ninto powerplants and would have been available for what we are arguing \nabout today. We would have been able to tell Florida, although we don't \nthink it is the case, You will never have to drill there, but that \ndidn't happen. There are many other things that are going to happen \nbecause of that bill, but we didn't do this one, the offshore, because \nwe were told there would be a filibuster on the bill, the big bill, and \nwe had to make a decision. It was open and made right here. Everybody \nheard it. So now we have to take our one shot at a time. This is one.\n  My last observation would be just in advance--I know the floor is a \nvaluable tool for every Senator. They can offer amendments, and they \ncan delay things. We are going to work very hard to make this one, \nsingle, big consumer present all by itself. Please, if you have big \nideas, we will bring another energy bill, and put it on that.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. As I listened to the statement of my good friend from \nTexas, I thought I would clear up a few things as the debate on this \nasbestos bill moves forward. I know that Members have some very real \nconcerns with the size of this trust fund and who may make claim to it. \nI think the Libby language that we have in the bill now is fair, and I \nwill make the case for that because we think it is perceived to be \ninequitable in its treatment.\n  The only inequity for Libby residents will occur if their recovery in \nthis bill is removed. The medical criteria as it currently stands are \nactually insufficient for Libby victims. So members of this body, in \nparticular, my good friend from Texas, is mistaken to conclude that \nthey confer such enormous benefits on Libby's residents. That is not\n\n[[Page S844]]\n\nreally the case as I illustrated yesterday.\n  The bill as it is currently drafted will exclude 40 percent of the \nfolks that live in Libby, MT. Now, to remedy that problem, I filed an \namendment to strengthen the Libby provisions rather than remove them \nentirely. I felt I had to do that.\n  While I understand that my colleagues will take issue with specific \nmedical criterion in Libby, I fail to see how the exposure in Libby is \nequal to the suffering in any other cities. The exposure to asbestos \nwas limited in some of those cities into confined areas. If any \ncommunity exposures existed, they were the result of a factory worker \nexposing his family through his clothing.\n  As I explained yesterday the circumstances in Libby are much worse. \nThe main thing in Libby, MT, is that the community was exposed. The \nentire community was exposed by the wind from an open pit mine as \nopposed to communities that had enclosed facilities that processed the \nore from the Libby mines. So we are talking about an entire valley, an \nentire city that was exposed by the wind from an open-pit mine. Not \nonly did family members of the mine workers fall ill, but the entire \ntown was contaminated.\n  Yesterday I showed a picture of a baseball field of little-guy \nbaseball, and it was contaminated. In fact, the amounts of asbestos \nmeant the asbestos in the playing field were as high as 15 percent in \nsome areas. So it has been reported that concentrations as low as .001 \npercent in asbestos contamination generates dangerous exposures. So the \nchildren that were playing on that baseball field in 1978 are now \nexperiencing health problems, and we believe they were caused by that \nexposure.\n  This is a unique incident. It is a unique area. And we are not \ntalking about a structure. And we are not talking about a factory. We \nare talking about an entire community that was exposed to asbestos.\n  I think I read yesterday where this Memorial Day they will put up \nover 200 crosses for people who died from asbestos. They have added 20. \nTwenty crosses due to asbestos diseases in the last year. So I think we \nhave a unique situation.\n  And also, the disease is a little bit different, we are finding now \nfrom talking to medical people who understand, and pulmonary doctors \nwho under stand this asbestos and the related diseases around it.\n  So I would ask my colleagues to study this very closely.\n  I thank my friend from Alabama, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I see the other Senator from Montana in \nthe Chamber. I thank both of them for their strong advocacy on this \nquestion. Senator Burns is, again, offering an amendment, I believe.\n  To carry this further, I will say this to our colleagues. Now is a \ngood time for debate. If you have amendments, let's bring them on and \ndiscuss them. Senator Specter and Senator Leahy, the chairman and \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, with bipartisanship, are \ncommitted to this legislation and trying to make it work. We are \ndelighted to hear the debate. We cannot accept everything. But your \nideas are being listened to. Some will be voted on. We will have a \nbetter bill when we complete the process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my colleague, \nSenator Burns, for helping out in our effort to help the people of \nLibby, MT. In all the years I have been in public service, I am hard \npressed to think of any situation that has bothered me more, that has \nurged me more to solve, or to help people out, than the people of \nLibby, MT. They have been put out by so much. It is a community that \nhas faced hardship in so many ways up in northwestern Montana. The \nsawmills fold up and they go under. The economy there has been \nextremely difficult to sustain. And on top of that, we have this \nproblem of asbestos, a particularly vicious form of asbestos in Libby, \nMT, called tremolite.\n  I would like to help remind my colleagues what goes on in Libby and \nintroduce Libby to those who have not paid much attention to Libby.\n  Libby is a very special, very small community up in a remote part of \nMontana, up in northwest Montana. In a valley deep in the Rocky \nMountains, Libby resides on the Kootenai River.\n  And this is not an exaggeration: The people of Libby are struggling. \nThey are struggling mightily day in and day out. They have been \nuniquely impacted by asbestos exposure. I do not know of any community \nin the United States that comes close to the level of suffering that \nthe people of Libby have suffered on account of asbestos. Once you \nvisit Libby, you realize very quickly this is a situation which is very \ndifferent from other asbestos problems in other parts of our country. \nThere is no comparison.\n  First, just a bit about Libby. It is surrounded by staggering natural \nbeauty. It is up near the Cabinet Mountains, next to a divide, the \nKootenai River. It is a very special part of the world. The wonder of \nthe mountains and the beauty of the river, however, contrast \ndramatically to Libby's other major distinction; that is, a community \nsuffering from the worst concentration of asbestos poisoning in \nAmerica.\n  Many of the people of Libby do not have the luxury now, as a \nconsequence of asbestos, of enjoying all of this natural beauty and \nluxury I mentioned. They cannot hike the Cabinets. They cannot go up in \nthe mountains to hunt elk. They can no longer scale down the river bank \nof the Kootenai to enjoy their favorite fishing holes.\n  Why, might you ask, can't people do that anymore? I will tell you a \nvery basic reason. They cannot breathe. They have such difficulty and \nstruggle so much with the very basic human activity of breathing--\nbreathing in, breathing out. They are just out of breath. They just \ncannot breathe.\n  So you are asking, why can't the people of Libby breathe? Why are \nthey struggling so much to breathe? The simple answer is W.R. Grace. \nUntil 1990, a company called W.R. Grace used to mine vermiculite from a \nmountain called Zonolite Mountain, just on the outskirts of there. \nUntil the mid-1970s, W.R. Grace processed that vermiculite mined in \nLibby in a nearby mill.\n  I remember years ago when I was meeting people up in Libby, going up \nto that mill, I was just stunned with how dusty it was, the conditions \nup there. I assumed it was just a dusty mill, not poisoning the air. If \nit were, people would know about it. But I was wrong. The people of \nLibby made that same assumption. The workers made the same assumption, \nand they were wrong. In fact, the mill was so dusty that workers often \ncould not see their hands when they were sweeping with their brooms.\n  It is hard for me to find the words to describe the situation. I can \nremember guys coming off the hill, coming out of the mine, getting off \nthe bus, and it was just a dust bag, just caked with dust. I never had \nseen anything like it. Mill workers swept dust outside and tried to do \nthe best they could. They dumped it. Once they swept the mill, the dust \nand stuff outside, what did they do with it? They just dumped it down \nthe mountain. And the mill's ventilation stack spewed dust up into the \nair. The ventilation stack released 5,000 pounds of asbestos every \nday--5,000 pounds of asbestos every day. When the wind blew from the \neast, a deadly white dust would cover the town. It would just cover it \nwith dust.\n  For decades, 24 hours a day, the dust fell all over Libby. It fell on \nLibby's gardens, fell on the homes. Dust fell on Libby's high school \ntrack, Libby's playgrounds. Everywhere there was this dust from the \nmine, this asbestos dust.\n  Now, some of the vermiculite went downtown to a plant, right next to \nthe baseball diamond. I know right where that baseball diamond is: \nright next to the Kootenai River. Vermiculite is a shiny material. You \nheat it and it pops like popcorn. People used to pop vermiculite to \nmake building insulation. They called that popped vermiculite Zonolite.\n  The plant popped the vermiculite into Zonolite, and batches of \nZonolite spilled all over the plant, all around the plant.\n  What happened? Well, kids played in this stuff. Kids played in the \nZonolite. Workers at the mine brought back bags of Zonolite to pour in \ntheir attics as insulation. They put Zonolite in their\n\n[[Page S845]]\n\nwalls for insulation. They put Zonolite in their gardens. I guess it \nhelped make things grow--they thought. They put vermiculite in road \nbeds. Families used vermiculite and ore to build their driveways. They \nused to use this stuff.\n  But the layers of rock where people found the vermiculite contained \nharmful asbestos. Nobody knew it at the time. The people did not. The \npeople did not. The company did. And the vermiculite outside Libby is \nlaced with a particularly dangerous type of asbestos. It is called \ntremolite. This is not ordinary asbestos, which is bad enough. This is \na very pernicious, special, terrible kind of asbestos called tremolite. \nThe usual, more common asbestos is chrysotile asbestos. This is not \nchrysotile asbestos. This is tremolite.\n  Why is tremolite so terrible? Why is it even worse? Well, tremolite \nhas long fibers that are barbed like fishhooks. These fibers work their \nway into soft lung tissue. These fibers do not come out; like \nfishhooks, they are stuck.\n  Now, the Zonolite Mountain now sits peacefully with the damage that \nhas already been done. People in Libby are sick--very sick. They suffer \nfrom asbestos-related disease at a rate 40 to 60 times the national \naverage--40 to 60 times the national average. People from Libby suffer \nfrom asbestos cancer. They suffer from mesothelioma, which is a form of \nasbestos-related cancer. And they suffer that mesothelioma at a rate \n100 times the national average.\n  This sickness does not just affect the people who worked in the mill. \nW.R. Grace infected the whole town.\n  An article in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives concludes \nthat based on the unique nature of vermiculite contamination in Libby, \nalong with elevated asbestos concentrations in the air, it would be \ndifficult to find Libby residents unexposed. They are all exposed.\n  Every day men from the valley went to the mountain to work in the \nmine and the mill. Every day, these men came home covered with the \nfine, deadly white powder. The powder got in their clothes. It got in \ntheir curtains. It covered their floors.\n  I talked to one miner. His name was Les Skramstad. And this is when I \nreally got radicalized about this.\n  In talking to Les several years ago in his living room, to hear Les, \na young fellow who is very ill now, he has a hard time breathing. He \nwould come off the mine. He would go home to see his wife. His wife \nwould embrace him. His children would jump up into his lap. They all \nhave asbestos-related disease now, not just Les but Les's wife, his \nchildren. And the prognosis is not good.\n  The fine fibers of tremolite asbestos are very easy to inhale. Miners \ninhaled fibers in the mine. Workers inhaled the fibers in the mill. \nWives inhaled the fibers when they washed their husband's clothes, and \nchildren inhaled the fibers when they played on the carpet or hugged \ntheir fathers.\n  The fibers are deadly. They cause respiratory disease. Those fibers \ncaused a serious lung disease called asbestosis. Those fibers caused a \nserious form of cancer, mesothelioma, which infects the chest and \nabdominal cavities. Asbestos in Libby is tremolite asbestos. Tremolite \nasbestos is far different from the other chrysotile asbestos, which is \nthe predominant cause of asbestos-related diseases. Let me explain the \ndifference. Tremolite diseases are highly progressive and also highly \ndeceptive. People with initial markers of chrysotile asbestos, the \nusual asbestos disease, have a 25-percent chance of progressive \nillness. Patients with initial markers of tremolite asbestos are more \nthan 75 percent likely to develop more destructive diseases.\n  Because of the W.R. Grace mine and mill, hundreds of people in Libby \ndied from asbestos-related diseases already. Hundreds of current and \nformer area residents are now ill. Hundreds of people live in \ndiscomfort, and hundreds of people live in pain. Seventy percent of \nthose affected with tremolite asbestos disease never worked in the \nmine.\n  Let me introduce you to some people from Libby. Arthur Bundrock \nworked in the mine for 19 years. He suffered from asbestosis for 21 \nyears and his suffering was made worse from the knowledge that he \ncarried the asbestos dust back home to his family. Arthur's son applied \nfor work at W.R. Grace, had to get an x ray before they would hire him. \nThe x ray showed he already had asbestosis. Grace never told him the \nresults of the screening. The company never told him. Arthur's work in \nthe mine affected his whole family. When Arthur died in 1998, six out \nof seven members of his family had asbestosis.\n  Then there is Toni Riley. Toni Riley never worked in the mine. But \nsimilar to many kids in Libby, she played in piles of vermiculite ore \nas a child. These piles were all over the town. Similar to playing in a \nsandbox, kids played in piles of asbestos. Toni Riley was a member of \nthe local research and rescue team and an emergency medical technician \nwith the Libby volunteer ambulance. She was also a reserve deputy at \nthe sheriff's office for 5 years. In 1996, she was diagnosed with \nmesothelioma. Toni died on December 4, 1998. Toni is 1 of the more than \n200 known cases where people from Libby have died as a result of \nasbestos-related disease.\n  W.R. Grace may have closed its doors, but the people of Libby will be \nplagued with asbestos for years to come. The company has closed its \ndoors, but the people will be plagued probably forever.\n  These diseases can take 40 years to appear. Hundreds more will fall \nvictim to these diseases in the future. The people of Libby must watch \ntheir neighbors struggle to tend their gardens, to walk into the cafe. \nThey must watch their neighbors struggle to provide a future for their \nchildren, and they must wonder if they, too, will fall ill. Remember, \nthese diseases can take up to 40 years to appear.\n  In 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency started to investigate. \nThe EPA found tremolite contamination in the air around the nursery. \nThey found it near the ballfields. They found it inside homes. Last \nyear, we learned that trees near the Grace mine contained asbestos. \nRecently, a University of Montana study revealed another example of the \nhorrific level of contamination in Libby. In the new study, asbestos \nfibers were found in the bark of trees growing near Libby Middle \nSchool.\n  Libby is not a rich city. In 2000, the median family income of Libby \nwas just under $30,000. That compares with just over $40,000 in the \nwhole State of Montana and just over $50,000 in all of America. The \nmedian family income is much below the national average. Libby is \nworking to overcome years of asbestos exposure from W.R. Grace. They \nhave been through enough. They did not ask for this lot. That is why I \nhave fought to make sure that asbestos bills working through the Senate \naddress the needs of the people of Libby, MT. The good people of Libby \nneed our help. They are dying up there. The town has risen mightily to \nthe challenge it has faced, but they need our help. They deserve our \nhelp.\n  I made a commitment to the people of Libby, and I intend to work \ntogether with my colleagues to see that commitment honored. Asbestos \ndisease has devastated many communities across the country, but \ntremolite asbestos hit Libby hardest of all. Libby is unique. The type \nof asbestos at Libby is unique. The duration of exposure at Libby is \nunique. The manner in which asbestos disease manifests itself in Libby \nis unique, and the communitywide exposure in Libby was unique. That is \nwhy the tailored solution that the committee has proposed makes sense.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Libby provisions in the asbestos \nbill and help us right this terrible wrong. Help these hundreds of \nsuffering people to get health care and help save the life of this \ntown.\n  There are not many things that I have experienced in the last, \nroughly, 30 years I have been in public service that equal the tragedy \nwhich is Libby, a tragedy caused by W.R. Grace and asbestos, a \nparticularly pernicious form of asbestos in Libby, tremolite asbestos, \nwhich is so harmful to the community. Libby is struggling mightily. \nLibby wants to put this chapter behind them. The people of Libby are \ndoing all they can. They don't complain. It is a wonderful feature of \nwesterners, generally, and especially of the people of Libby, MT. They \nare not crybabies. They don't whine. But they want justice. They \ndeserve justice.\n  We must take advantage of this unique opportunity we have in the \nlegislation before us to make sure that the people of Libby get their \nfair due.\n\n[[Page S846]]\n\nThe provisions in this bill help assure that compensation is given to \nthe people of Libby who are affected by asbestos so they can pay the \nmedical bills, so they can somehow, some way, get back to normal lives, \nknowing all along that for many of them, for the indefinite future, \nthey are still going to have a terrible infliction and difficulty \nbreathing in and breathing out.\n  I implore my colleagues, please listen to the people of Libby. \nPlease, in your heart, help the people of Libby, MT. That is the very \nleast they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. THUNE). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Martinez are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, under arrangements worked out between the \nleaders of the two parties, we will be open for amendments tomorrow. \nSenator Leahy and I wrote to all Senators back on January 24, urging \nSenators to let us know what amendments they intended to offer so that \nwe could schedule the business of the Senate. I renew that request at \nthis time. We have a bill where, as previously announced, we are open \nfor modification. During the some 36 negotiating sessions which Judge \nBecker and I have presided over during the course of the past 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, we have made many modifications. We accepted many amendments in \ncommittee. Some were voted upon and defeated. But we are interested in \nmaking this the best bill we can.\n  We have carried the offer beyond amendments. If any companies are \nhaving special problems, we are interested to hear of the problems to \nsee if we can find a way to accommodate them. We are dealing here with \nan enormously complex subject and we have limited time. In order to \nmanage the bills, in order to conserve the time of the Senate, it is \nour request that Members bring forward to us amendments they want to \nhave offered, which they intend to offer, with suggestions for time \nlimits so we can proceed to manage the bill.\n  There has been extensive debate on the bill. The Washington Post \nreported today about the success of moving forward with the motion to \nproceed and, as I say, tomorrow we will be proceeding with the \namendment process. The Post noted, as they put it, referring to me, \nthat I had ``a bit of an obsession with the passage of this bill.'' I \nthink that is an erroneous statement. I don't have a bit of an \nobsession; I have a total obsession with the passage of this bill. I \nsay that because I have been working on this bill for the entire time I \nhave been in the Senate.\n  Shortly after I was elected in 1980, Senator Gary Hart came to me and \nwas with a constituent, Johns Manville, and said there is a terrible \nasbestos problem. I have been a party to efforts over the course of the \npast two and one-half decades-plus to try to find an answer. It has \nbeen extremely elusive. Finally, Senator Hatch came up with the idea of \na trust fund. When we passed the bill out of committee during the 108th \nCongress in July 2003, I then enlisted the aid of a senior Federal \njudge, Edward Becker, who had been chief judge of the Third Circuit, \nand who is very knowledgeable on asbestos matters. Judge Becker had \nwritten the opinion which was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates, which said you could not use class actions on asbestos. That \nmight have been an answer on consolidation class action status to \nhandle the issue in the courts. The Supreme Court of the United States \nsaid that mode of procedure was not suitable for asbestos. Then the \nSupreme Court of the United States issued a challenge to the Congress \nto provide a legislative solution. That challenge has been issued by \nthe Supreme Court on some four occasions, telling us that it was our \nbusiness to come up with a solution. Judge Becker agreed to mediate \nand, as I say, we have had some 36 meetings in my conference room, \nattended by anywhere from 20 to 60 people. Stakeholders were \nprincipally involved, and that is defined as labor, AFL-CIO, which was \nrepresented ably at those meetings; we invited the trial lawyers and \nthey attended the meetings, even though we knew there would be \nopposition from them because, realistically, it impacted their \nlivelihoods; we had the manufacturers and we had the insurers.\n  Last week, we saw come forward a very prominent plaintiffs' lawyer in \nthe asbestos field, Dickie Scruggs, Esq., of Mississippi. He is also \nSenator Lott's brother-in-law. Senator Lott put the two of us in touch \nand we talked about the matter. He was one of the originators, if not \nthe originator, of the litigation involving asbestos. From what he has \nseen over the years, he came to the conclusion that it was not a good \nidea to keep these asbestos cases in the courts; that a better idea was \nto have the trust fund, and he came in and made public statements. I \nbelieve he may even be on a commercial. I don't have a chance to watch \ntoo much television, except for C-SPAN. But he pointed out that the \nvictims are simply not being compensated. When we have had a lot of \ntalk on the Senate floor about special interests, this is one interest \ngroup which is not a special interest; it is a general interest, and \nthat general interest is the large group of victims who are suffering \nfrom deadly diseases--mesothelioma and lung cancer and other ailments \nfrom exposure to asbestos--who are not being compensated. It is their \ninterest we are seeking to take care of.\n  When their companies go bankrupt, they don't have anybody to sue and \nthat is why the trust fund has been created--a trust fund where the \nfigure was established jointly by Senator Frist on behalf of the \nRepublicans and then-Senator Daschle on behalf of the Democrats at $140 \nbillion. !1The interested parties, the manufacturers and insurers, \nagreed to put up that money. The fund had started out with \nsubstantially less, but it was calculated that that would be an amount \nrealistically calculated to take care of the problem. It is very hard \nwhen making projections to know with certainty what is going to happen. \nThe Congressional Budget Office has made an exhaustive study and \nconcluded it would cost in the range of $120 billion to $135 billion. \nThey outlined one contingency which might be a little higher than $150 \nbillion, but they said it was impossible to make the calculation, as \nthey put it, ``with great certainty.'' !1Well, you cannot function in \nall cases with great certainty, but these projections are realistically \ncalculated to do the job. If we are wrong, and when you talk about \nthousands of cases projected over decades, if our projections are not \naccurate, the claimants have the right to go back to court so that they \nare no worse off than they would be at the present time. They are \nlimited to either Federal or State courts--but they cannot judge shop \nfor special counties anywhere in the country, which is the practice \ntoday. Madison County, IL, was singled out and some counties in some \nother States. They have to go to the State courts where they live or \nwhere they worked. So we have a realistic plan to take care of this \nissue. !1But if we can have a better bill, we are very anxious to have \nthat better bill. That is why we have invited our colleagues to come \nforward with any amendments they may have. The three Senators from the \nother side of the aisle who have spoken in opposition to the bill have \nconceded the very grave, difficult problem. They say this bill is not \nright, but they don't deny the transparency of how we have worked, and \nthey don't deny the evidence that has gone into it or the comprehensive \nanalysis. I have said I believe this is the most complicated piece of \nlegislation that has ever confronted a legislative body. That is a very \ngrandiose, sweeping statement, but I believe it to be true. I repeat \nthat I challenge anybody who knows of some legislative activity that is \nmore complicated than the one at hand. There have been extensive \nhearings, extensive negotiations, extensive analyses, extensive \namendments, and we are still open for the amendment process. !1It is my \nhope we will do what the Democratic leader said yesterday, and that is \ngo to the amendments and take them up, and that we will not face \nadditional procedural challenges. If we do, we are prepared. There has \nbeen some talk in the cloakrooms and hallways about challenging them on \na budget point of order, and we are prepared for that. The underlying \nmerits\n\n[[Page S847]]\n\nare that there is no realistic budget problem, because there is no \nFederal money involved here. We have made the bill airtight that the \nFederal Government cannot be involved. It is all private contributions. \nIf the plan does not succeed, we have alternative ways of dealing with \nthe issue, but not to come back to the Federal Government. There are \nthree possibilities of points of order. One is you cannot have \nlegislation before there is a budget resolution. But on that situation, \nconsulting with the experts on procedure, we can have the date of \nOctober 1 in the next fiscal year to solve that. !1There is an issue \nabout an allocation that was made at the discretion of the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, and we believe that will be accomplished with \nthat allocation being released by the chairman. All of this is a bit \npresumptive, but I think that is how it will work out.\n  There is a third concern, which is that there not be more than $5 \nbillion spent in any 10-year period between 1960 and about 40 years \nbeyond that. So we will see what eventuates. We are working to cap \nexpenditures so that we stay within that $5 billion limit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that three additional letters \nfrom the International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and \nAsbestos Workers, the United Automobile Workers, and the International \nUnion of Painters and Allied Trades in support of S. 852, the Fairness \nin Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         International Association of Heat & Frost Insulators & \n           Asbestos Workers,\n                                     Lanham, MD, February 6, 2006.\n       Dear Senator, we strongly support the courageous and bi-\n     partisan work of Senator Arlen Specter (R.) and Senator \n     Patrick Leahy (D.), co-sponsors of the Fairness in Asbestos \n     Injury Resolution (FAIR) Act of 2005 (S. 852) which comes to \n     the Senate Floor this week.\n       We support the Bill as presently drafted. We ask that you \n     support the Bill as well.\n       Our U.S. Supreme Court has held that federal legislation is \n     necessary to solve the asbestos compensation crisis--and we \n     agree. Currently, only 42 cents of every dollar spent in this \n     broken system goes to victims, their widows and kids.\n       I recently wrote our membership across the country to \n     advise them of our support for this Bill, and to urge them to \n     contact you in support of S. 852. I advised our membership \n     that this Bill is not perfect. But nothing ever is when \n     problems of this magnitude are addressed.\n       We believe S. 852 offers the best hope of providing fair \n     and equitable compensation on a national basis for those who \n     have suffered, or will suffer from the devastating effects of \n     asbestos exposure in decades to come.\n       We urge you to reject amendments of special interest groups \n     on either side of the issue that would change the core \n     provisions of the Bill.\n       Such amendments can only be hostile to the interests of \n     fundamental fairness and equity. We have promised our \n     membership that we would fight vigorously to oppose any \n     change that would make this Bill unfair or inequitable.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                   James A. Grogan\n     General President.\n                                  ____\n\n         International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators & \n           Asbestos Workers,\n                                     Lanham, MD, January 31, 2006.\n     To: Members of the International Association Heat and Frost \n         Insulators and Asbestos Workers.\n\n       Dear Brothers and Sisters: The Fairness in Asbestos Injury \n     Resolution Act of 2005 (Asbestos Bill S. 852) is scheduled to \n     be brought to the floor of the United States Senate in early \n     February of this year.\n       Bi-Partisan Co-Sponsors of S. 852: Senator Arlen Specter \n     (R.) and Senator Patrick Leahy (D.): Nobody has worked harder \n     than Senate Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter (R.) of \n     Pennsylvania and Ranking Minority Member Senator Patrick \n     Leahy (D.) of Vermont in trying to get a fair and equitable \n     and bi-partisan Bill that helps those who have suffered the \n     devastating effects of exposure to asbestos. These two \n     courageous Senators have worked tirelessly during the last \n     three years--to craft changes to the Bill after listening to \n     reasonable suggestions from Labor, Business and Insurance \n     negotiators.\n       Special interest groups on both sides of the issue have \n     tried to de-rail their good work. But Senators Specter and \n     Leahy have stood tall in search of an equitable legislative \n     solution.\n       This Office Has Actively Participated in the Negotiating \n     Process of this Bill Over the Last Three Years: Your \n     International has been actively involved in extended and \n     complicated negotiations to bring about this legislative is \n     necessary to solve the asbestos compensation crisis--and we \n     agree.\n       Let us begin by stating that this Bill is not perfect. \n     Nothing ever is. For the last 10-20 years the current \n     asbestos compensation system has produced inequitable and \n     unfair results. Tens of Billions of dollars have gone to \n     people who are not sick. This is wrong. The current system is \n     broken, notwithstanding what special interest groups may \n     claim. We believe this Bill offers the best hope of providing \n     equitable compensation while expediting the compensation and \n     review process on a national basis, regardless of where you \n     live, or who your attorney might be.\n       Over 300,000 Pending or Current Asbestos Claims Cry out for \n     a Fair Legislative Solution from Congress: Currently it is \n     estimated that there are more than 300,000 pending asbestos-\n     related claims. In a recent study by RAND, it was determined \n     that only $0.42 (42 cents) of every dollar spent on \n     litigation is awarded to the actual victims, their widows and \n     kids. A majority of the funds is paid to transaction costs, \n     including lawyers' fees for corporations and claimants.\n       $140,000,000,000 ($140 Billion) Trust Fund For Victims of \n     Asbestos Induced Mesothelioma, Lung Cancer and Asbestosis \n     under a No-Fault System with Set Awards Based on Severity of \n     Disease: This Bill would establish a $140 Billion Trust Fund \n     to compensate victims who are truly sick from asbestos \n     exposure under a no-fault compensation system administered by \n     the Department of Labor. Objective medical criteria that will \n     rule in asbestos induced disease, and will rule out disease \n     not caused by asbestos exposure has been negotiated and \n     approved by us and medical experts we have retained. This \n     legislation will offer the following expedited settlements:\n       Mesothelioma: $1,100,000 per case.\n       Lung Cancer with Asbestosis: $600,000-975,000 per case.\n       Lung Cancer with Asbestos Pleural Markers: $300,000-725,000 \n     per case.\n       Disabling Asbestosis (not cancerous): $850,000 per case.\n       Asbestosis with Some Impairment: $100,000-400,000 per case.\n       Attorneys' fees have been limited to 5% under the \n     legislation. It is to be expected that lawyers who have \n     received tens of millions of dollars in asbestos fees might \n     voice some objection to the Bill. Insurance companies who \n     will have to pay hundreds of millions of dollars into the \n     Trust are likewise objecting to this courageous attempt by \n     Senators Specter and Leahy to solve the asbestos compensation \n     crisis.\n       The Pipefitters, Painters and United Auto Workers Have \n     Joined With Us: The leadership of the Plumbers and \n     Pipefitters (the UA), the Painters (IUPAT) and the United \n     Auto Workers (UAW), have joined with us in supporting this \n     Asbestos Bill S. 852. We believe the leadership of other \n     trade unions will come to join us in the weeks ahead in \n     support of this Bill.\n       Funding: We are aware of those who, in good faith, question \n     whether $140,000,000,000 ($140 Billion) will be sufficient to \n     fund the Trust to compensate all American victims of asbestos \n     induced cancer and asbestosis. We share their good faith \n     concern.\n       But there have been too many bankruptcies as a result of \n     the current asbestos litigation crisis. If funding mandated \n     under the Bill proves insufficient, the Bill provides that \n     individuals may return to the court system and pursue a \n     lawsuit in their State or Federal Court before a jury of \n     their peers. This was a hard fought and fair compromise.\n       Let me close by saying that this International Union \n     remains deeply committed to supporting a meaningful, \n     comprehensive solution to our national asbestos litigation \n     crisis. Be assured if we become aware of changes or \n     amendments to this Bill that will be to the detriment of \n     workers and their families, we will fight them, and will not \n     hesitate to change our position if needed.\n       We urge you to contact your Senators to gain their full \n     support for this legislation. Attached is a complete listing \n     of Senators and their contact information for your \n     convenience.\n       With kind regards, we remain,\n           Fraternally yours,\n     James A. Grogan,\n       General President.\n     Terry Lynch,\n       Political director.\n     James P. McCourt,\n       General Secretary-Treasurer.\n                                  ____\n\n         International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & \n           Agricultural Implement Workers of America,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: Next week the Senate is scheduled to take up \n     the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution (FAIR) Act of 2005 \n     (S. 852), sponsored by Senators Specter and Leahy. The UAW \n     strongly supports this legislation. We urge you to support \n     this critically important legislation, and to support cloture \n     both on the motion to proceed and on the bill itself.\n       The UAW supports S. 852 because we are firmly convinced it \n     would be far superior to the current tort system in \n     compensating the victims of asbestos-related diseases. Under \n     the existing tort system, many victims receive little or no \n     compensation because those responsible for the asbestos \n     exposure are bankrupt, immune from liability or can't\n\n[[Page S848]]\n\n     be identified. Even when victims do receive some award, the \n     litigation takes far too long, and the amounts are highly \n     unpredictable. Far too much money is wasted on attorney fees \n     and other litigation costs, or dispersed to individuals who \n     are not impaired.\n       The Specter-Leahy bill would solve these problems by \n     establishing a $140 billion federal trust fund to compensate \n     the victims of asbestos-related diseases through a stream-\n     lined, no-fault administrative system. This system will \n     provide much speedier compensation to victims according to a \n     predictable schedule of payments for specified disease levels \n     that focuses compensation on those who have the most serious \n     impairments. It will also guarantee that victims can receive \n     adequate compensation, regardless of whether those \n     responsible for the asbestos exposure are bankrupt or \n     otherwise immune from liability.\n       The UAW strongly supports the provision in the Specter-\n     Leahy bill that does not permit any subrogation against \n     worker compensation or health care payments received by \n     asbestos victims. We believe this provision is essential to \n     ensure that victims receive adequate compensation, and do not \n     have their awards largely offset by other payments. We \n     strongly urge you to oppose any amendment that would \n     undermine victims' compensation by allowing subrogation.\n       The UAW also urges you to reject any other amendments that \n     would reduce or restrict eligibility for compensation for the \n     victims of asbestos-related diseases. This includes any \n     amendments that would strike medical monitoring or eliminate \n     Level VI awards.\n       The UAW supports the provisions in S. 852 that require \n     broad sections of the business and insurance industries to \n     make contributions to finance the $140 billion federal trust \n     fund. We believe this broad-based, predictable financing \n     mechanism is vastly preferable to the current tort system, \n     which has already driven many companies into bankruptcy, and \n     is threatening the economic health of other companies that \n     used products containing asbestos, including the major auto \n     manufacturers. Continuation of the existing tort system will \n     inevitably lead to more bankruptcies, resulting in more lost \n     jobs and wage and benefit cut backs for workers and retirees. \n     However, to ensure that the financing mechanism in S. 852 \n     remains equitable and workable, the UAW believes it is \n     essential that the Senate reject any amendments that would \n     severely narrow or cap the financing base and jeopardize the \n     guarantee that $140 billion will be made available to \n     compensate asbestos victims.\n       The UAW recognizes that a number of specific concerns have \n     been raised by other labor organizations about various \n     provisions in S. 852. We are continuing to work for \n     improvements in the legislation, and are hopeful that \n     Senators Specter and Leahy will largely address these \n     concerns in a manager's amendment.\n       However, the UAW does not agree with those who have taken \n     exception to the 5 percent cap on attorney fees for monetary \n     daimants. This cap ensures that asbestos victims will be \n     adequately compensated, and not see their awards severely \n     reduced by exorbitant attorney fees. This cap will not impede \n     the ability of claimants to get adequate legal \n     representation. Because S. 852 establishes a non-adversarial, \n     no-fault administrative system, the difficulties and costs \n     involved in bringing asbestos claims will be greatly reduced. \n     Indeed, much of the work can be done by paralegals. We also \n     believe that labor unions and other groups can help provide \n     free or lower cost representation for asbestos victims by \n     hiring staff attorneys and other professionals to process the \n     claims under the no-fault administrative system. Through such \n     mechanisms, asbestos victims can receive competent \n     representation with little or no attorney fees being deducted \n     from their awards.\n       Finally, the UAW recognizes that questions have been raised \n     about the projections for asbestos claims and the solvency of \n     the trust fund. We would note that most stakeholders agreed \n     to $140 billion in financing early last year. Although all of \n     the projections are subject to some element of uncertainty, \n     the UAW believes that the $140 billion in financing is \n     sufficient to enable the trust fund to compensate asbestos \n     victims for a lengthy period of time. It is also important to \n     remember that S. 852 provides for reversion of asbestos \n     claims to the tort system in the event the federal trust fund \n     should ever have insufficient funds to pay all claims. While \n     we hope these reversion provisions will never be triggered, \n     they do provide assurance that victims will always have some \n     recourse for seeking compensation.\n       It is easy for critics to point out shortcomings in S. 852. \n     The UAW submits, however, that it is abundantly clear the \n     asbestos compensation system established by the Specter-Leahy \n     bill would be far preferable to the existing tort system. It \n     would do a much better job of providing prompt, equitable \n     compensation to asbestos victims. And it would finance this \n     compensation through a rationale system that does not lead to \n     bankruptcies that threaten the jobs, wages and benefits of \n     thousands of workers.\n       For all of these reasons, the UAW strongly supports the \n     FAIR Act (S. 852). We urge you to vote for this legislation, \n     and to support efforts to invoke cloture on the motion to \n     proceed and on the bill itself.\n       Thank you for considering our views on this vital issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alan Reuther,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, AFL-\n           CIO, CLC,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: The Senate is now considering the Fairness in \n     Asbestos Injury Resolution (FAIR) Act of 2005 (S. 852), \n     sponsored by Senators Specter and Leahy. The International \n     Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT) strongly supports \n     this legislation and, as it moves forward, we urge you to \n     support cloture on S. 852 on both the motion to proceed and \n     the bill itself.\n       The IUPAT believes that S. 852 offers the best hope of \n     providing fair and equitable compensation on a national basis \n     for those who have suffered, or will suffer, from the \n     devastating effects of asbestos exposure in decades to come. \n     We believe that S. 852 and the establishment of a $140 \n     billion federal trust fund to compensate the victims of \n     asbestos-related diseases through a stream-lined, no-fault \n     administrative system is a vast improvement over the current \n     tort system that all too often is unfair to victims of \n     asbestos exposure. Under the current tort system, many \n     victims receive little or no compensation because those \n     responsible for the asbestos exposure are bankrupt, immune \n     from liability or cannot be identified. If a victim is \n     fortunate enough to secure an award, the litigation can drag \n     on for years, the award amounts are highly unpredictable, and \n     far too much money is wasted on attorney fees, other \n     litigation costs, and individuals who are not impaired.\n       Furthermore, while this important legislation is considered \n     on the Senate floor, we urge you to reject any amendments \n     that would weaken core provisions of the bill. Namely, \n     agreements reached on the issues of insurance subrogation, \n     medical monitoring, CT scans, statute of limitations, medical \n     criteria, awards values, $140 billion in guaranteed private \n     funding, enforcement provisions for contributors, \n     transparency of fund contributors and a reversion to the \n     current tort system should the fund become insolvent. Should \n     any amendments be adopted on the Senate floor that would \n     weaken any of these core provisions, we will be forced to \n     withdraw our support for S. 852. We also look forward to \n     ongoing efforts included in a manager's amendment and during \n     Senate floor debate that would, in our view, positively \n     address outstanding concerns with regard to start-up and \n     sunset provisions as well as individuals suffering from both \n     asbestos and silica related diseases.\n       In dealing with a highly complex and emotional issue, S. \n     852 reflects years of negotiations and compromises that will \n     undoubtedly allow critics to point out various \n     ``shortcomings'' in this bill. The IUPAT recognizes that this \n     bill is not perfect but perhaps it represents the last best \n     chance to provide prompt, equitable compensation to asbestos \n     victims and is undoubtedly a vast improvement over the \n     existing tort system. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that \n     federal legislation is necessary to solve the current \n     asbestos compensation crisis, and we agree. We believe that \n     S. 852 deserves your consideration and ultimate support, and \n     for that reason, the IUPAT urges you to support cloture on \n     both the motion to proceed and the bill itself.\n       Thank you for your time and attention to this critical \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                James A. Williams,\n                                                General President.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, the senior Member of this body, the former President pro \ntempore, former chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He has held \nevery title there is around here. We consider Senator Byrd's longevity \nand stature as phenomenal. He was in Congress when Harry Truman was \nPresident, so he has served with a lot of Presidents. Senator Byrd \nmakes a key distinction between serving with and serving under. He says \nserving with, and I think he is right. And if you are dealing with \nSenator Byrd, of course, he is right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I shall quote Alexander Pope in saying to my \ndistinguished friend, Senator Specter:\n\n       Thou art my guide, philosopher, and friend.\n\n  I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for not to exceed 3 \nminutes as in morning business for the purpose of submitting a \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd pertaining to the submission of S. Res. 370 \nare located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent and \nSenate Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S849]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is about a quarter of 5, so we still \nhave a fair amount of time left on today's calendar. There is no \nSenator in the Chamber, except you and me, Mr. President. So if there \nare any of our colleagues who want to speak on the asbestos bill, now \nwould be a good time to come over and speak.\n  There is a certain tempo about this Chamber. When there are a lot of \nSenators who want time, there is very limited time, fighting for the \nlast extension of time, unanimous consent for 2 more minutes here and a \nlittle more there. Now is the time for anybody who wants to speak to \ncome to the Senate Chamber.\n  I might comment that we all have a lot of other things to do, beyond \nany question. I have been spending a lot of my time meeting with \nSenators in their offices talking about the bill and also working on \nthe issue of electronic surveillance, which is very heavy on the \nJudiciary Committee calendar. I am now about to go to a meeting on \nimmigration, but I will be available if the action on the floor heats \nup.\n  Again, I urge any of my colleagues who want to speak, now is a good \ntime. Again, I urge my colleagues to follow up on the request Senator \nLeahy and I made back on January 25: If you have amendments, let us \nknow so we can manage this bill in an efficient way.\n  In the absence of any Senator on the floor seeking recognition, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending before the Senate is S. 852, which \nis a bill that has been written to address what has become a scourge in \nAmerica: asbestos-related illness and death.\n  We understand that as early as 1934, some of the companies that were \nmaking products out of asbestos came to realize there was a danger, \nthat some of the employees working around this asbestos ended up \ndeveloping lung problems and some of them were fatal.\n  Rather than protect the employees or disclose the danger, some of \nthese companies did nothing, said nothing. In fact, there is ample \nevidence that they covered it up. They didn't want their employees to \nknow the dangerous situation they were in. They didn't want to end up \nwith liability for their employees' illness and death, and they didn't \nwant to lose their profitability. So this secret was kept for a long \ntime, from the 1930s onward.\n  Through World War II, when men and women serving this country were \nbusy building the ships and other vehicles necessary for our troops, \nthey were exposed to asbestos in many different forms.\n  Asbestos became a very common element that was used in construction \nand a lot of different products, from brake linings to home insulation. \nIt was considered to be a valuable resource that was fireproof and \nlight in weight. It was somewhat revolutionary. But during this entire \nperiod of time, the development of asbestos product, the asbestos \nitself, and the fibers that were floating in the air, breathed in by \nworkers and bystanders and innocent people, were creating mini-\ntimebombs in the lungs of the people who were exposed. They didn't know \nit. They didn't sign up for it. They were not warned. They only learned \nmuch later in life that they had some exposure and it ended up killing \nthem.\n  I wish the story of asbestos had started and ended long ago, but it \ncontinues to this day. People still turn up with this disease, \nmesothelioma, the most fatal form of asbestos exposure, similar to lung \ncancer, but much more virulent in terms of its devastation on the human \nbody.\n  The persons diagnosed with mesothelioma have limited time to live. \nSome of them go through harrowing, extraordinary surgical procedures to \nbuy the possibility of a few more months of life. It can strike anybody \nat any time, young and old alike, men and women alike. It can strike \nsomeone in your family, Mr. President. It can strike a friend. \nAsbestosis, which is a form of it, is a disease which limits your \nactivities and limits your lifespan. Mesothelioma is a killer.\n  So hundreds of thousands of Americans have come to learn, because of \nexposure to this product, that they are sick and facing huge medical \nbills and the prospect of illnesses of great duration or death, and \nthey ask who is responsible.\n  Occasionally, they will find an employer that used asbestos. In some \ncases, they will find a product they purchased that ended up creating \nasbestos exposure, and they try to seek compensation in court.\n  What they are doing is very common in America. People who are guilty \nof wrongdoing are held accountable in court. Drunken drivers are held \naccountable in court. People who sell defective products are held \naccountable in court. People who strike other people and cause injury \nare held accountable in court.\n  So over the years these hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of \npeople have asked for their day in court, asked for a judge or jury to \ndecide whether they are entitled to compensation for medical bills, for \nlost wages, for the family they will leave behind if they are going to \ndie.\n  It is not unusual. These are the types of lawsuits filed every day in \nAmerica, and we trust our system. The system says that ultimately a \njudge and a jury will decide what is fair and what is right. A judge \nand a jury of the peers of the person who is in the courtroom will \ndecide if compensation is something that should be given. In many \ncases, it is clear, and large verdicts are given; in some cases, the \nanswers are no.\n  So over the years, as this asbestos exposure has become better known, \nmany of the companies that were deeply involved in making profits with \nasbestos have faced huge lawsuits from numerous people who have been \ninjured. Some of these companies, because of the lawsuits and other \ncircumstances, have gone out of business.\n  Johns Manville was a big name 30 years ago in America. Now it is a \ntrust fund created to pay asbestos victims. Johns Manville made its \nfortune, in some part, by using asbestos. But by using asbestos and \ncreating asbestos products, they endangered and harmed a lot of people. \nCourts across America said: Johns Manville, you are responsible; you \nhave to pay. That has happened over and over.\n  There are many corporations that wonder if they, too, will face many \nlawsuits. Some already have; others have not. The victims keep coming \nbecause so many people were affected by this product. And because of \nthe concern of some businesses as to their exposure and liability, they \nstarted coming to Congress over 20 years ago, saying we have to close \nthe courthouse door, we can't let these people come into the courtrooms \nanymore because they keep winning. They are winning because no one \nwillingly exposed themselves to asbestos. They were innocent victims \nand their lives were changed dramatically.\n  So these businesses came to Congress and said: You have to take these \ncases out of the courtroom; you have to create some other way to deal \nwith it.\n  We have been talking about it for a long time here on Capitol Hill. \nFinally, this week, S. 852 has come to the Senate floor in an attempt \nto create a system that will replace the courtroom in America. This \nbill creates a trust fund that is supposed to pay the victims.\n  Think about these victims for a moment. There are some, when you \nthink about them, you might be surprised to know why they died. One of \nthem we talked about earlier today was a great colleague of mine from \nthe State of Minnesota, Bruce Vento. What a terrific guy. I believe he \nwas formerly mayor of St. Paul, MN. He represented St. Paul in the \nHouse of Representatives. Bruce was a terrific fellow, an outdoorsman, \nphysically fit. I would see him in the House gym every morning. His \nlocker was down from mine.\n  Then came the day when they diagnosed him with mesothelioma, and that \nwas, sadly, a death sentence. At some point in his life, something he \nhad done had exposed him to asbestos. It was a tough situation. His \nfamily tried to face it, get the best of medical care, but it was \nhopeless. As a consequence, Bruce passed away.\n\n  Here is someone certainly the older people in the audience will \nrecognize, actor Steve McQueen. He died in 1980\n\n[[Page S850]]\n\nfrom mesothelioma. Some exposure at some point in his life led to this \ndeadly disease. This man who was so handsome, daring, and courageous in \nall the movies could not fight back when he was struck with \nmesothelioma.\n  Recently, singer Warren Zevon--I recall when he did his last CD. It \nwas a big hit. He made that CD realizing it was the last one he would \never record. At some point in his life, he was exposed to asbestos. He \nhas died.\n  Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, most people remember him, his service to \nAmerica in the U.S. Navy during Vietnam. He is a well-known figure, \nspokesman. He, too, was exposed to asbestos at some point in his life \nand died of mesothelioma.\n  These are some of the big names who died of mesothelioma, but there \nare others.\n  Patricia Corona is a mesothelioma victim. I wish to tell you a little \nbit about her story.\n  Patricia, 72 years old, was diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma in \nthe spring of 2001. Her exposure began when she was a young woman in \nthe course of her employment as a sales manager at various automotive \ndealerships. They used asbestos brake linings, pads, and clutches. She \nwas a sales manager. She frequently walked around the service area. \nUnknowingly, she was exposing herself to deadly asbestos fibers.\n  Mrs. Corona and her husband Carl, shown in this picture, have two \nchildren. After leaving the automotive dealership, Mrs. Corona decided \nto stay at home with her kids. While at home, she led an active life. \nShe remodeled her entire house by adding on, painting, putting up \ndrywall, putting in new floors, among other things, just the kind of \nambitious, energetic, and talented woman you want to have in your own \nhome. Unbeknownst to her, many of the products she used in home \nconstruction contained asbestos. Again she was exposed, unknowingly, to \nthese deadly asbestos fibers.\n  When Carl and Patricia's kids were grown up, Mrs. Corona went back to \nwork as a sales manager, and eventually bought her own custard stand. \nAfter quitting her sales manager job and selling the custard stand, she \nstayed home to take care of her handicapped brother.\n  While taking care of her brother, she did some small remodeling. In \nthe spring of 2001, Mrs. Corona's active life came to a screeching \nhalt. She was stricken with shortness of breath and extreme chest \npains. She was diagnosed with mesothelioma in May 2001. Mrs. Corona's \nlife, along with her husband's, changed dramatically due to the effects \nof the disease.\n  Mrs. Corona is obviously restricted in her activities and realizes \nthat in a short period of time, she will succumb to this disease. \nPatricia Corona of Glen Ellyn, IL, another asbestos victim.\n  This is businessman John Rackow. John is from Lake Zurich, IL, grew \nup in Chicago and moved to the suburbs. His father Ron owned a plastics \nfactory, and Jack helped him run it. He married and raised three kids. \nAlong the way, he worked for a lot of different businesses. He worked \nin the property development business. He was athletic and active, but \nhe recently noticed when he went out running, he would become short of \nbreath. He was an avid golfer. Jack also noticed his golf game wasn't \nwhat it used to be. He went to see a doctor. Some routine tests \nrevealed a mass in his body. When the biopsy was done, the doctor \ndiagnosed him with mesothelioma.\n  Jack didn't believe it. He went to all kinds of specialists. He took \nmedication to manage the pain. He continued to play golf and even \nentered a golf tournament. However, after a few days, he was flat on \nhis back in the hospital. He became weaker by the day, and in less than \n2 weeks from the time he entered the hospital, he passed away at the \nage of 64. Jack Rackow is survived by his children and grandchildren. \nHe is another asbestos victim.\n  The last one I will talk about from Illinois is policeman Donald \nBrozych from Tinley Park. He studied for the priesthood. He eventually \ndecided to become a police officer. While he was in school, he worked \nin construction. He was handy at home and worked on his own car.\n  After he retired, Don and his wife enjoyed traveling and spending \ntime with their friends, but he found himself worn out all the time. \nDuring a physical exam, the doctors found some abnormalities, did some \ntests, and diagnosed him with malignant mesothelioma.\n  After diagnosis, Don has gone through numerous treatments--\nchemotherapy, extensive surgery. He even went into an experimental \nprogram. He lost his hair. As of the time of this writing, he has been \nin treatment for over 2 years. He says each day is a blessing and he \ndoesn't know what to expect in the future. He and his wife Donna pray \nfor a future.\n  When was he exposed? He doesn't know. He looks back at his life and \ntries to figure out was it while he was working on construction, trying \nto earn his way through school? Was it while he was working on his car, \ndoing home repairs? There were so many common experiences he was \ninvolved in, never knowing he was exposed to asbestos.\n  I tell you these stories because people such as those I just \ndescribed have cases pending in courts across America today. They are \npeople whose lives have been shortened and whose lives have been \nchanged dramatically because of exposure to asbestos. They want to know \nif they can find the party responsible for their illness, whether that \nparty will pay to their family the cost of medical bills and do \nsomething to keep their family together when they are gone. It is not \nan unreasonable request, and it is a request which many times leads to \na jury verdict or a judge finding, yes, they are entitled to recover.\n  This bill that we have before us, S. 852, is a bill which will close \nthe courthouse doors to every one of those people. If they don't have a \ncase being argued before a judge in trial, when this bill is signed \ntheir case will be closed. No matter how long they have worked on it, \nno matter how much effort they put into bringing together medical \nbills, bringing together all the evidence of where they worked and how \nthey could have been exposed--despite all that effort, it is over.\n  Where do they turn? They will turn to this trust fund, a trust fund \nthat has been created in this bill. How much money are we going to have \nin this trust fund to take care of all these asbestos victims for the \nnext 50 years? The amount, according to the chairman and the sponsor of \nthe bill, is $140 billion.\n  Repeatedly today and on previous occasions, Chairman Specter has been \nasked: Where did you come up with the number $140 billion? By what \nmethod did you calculate the number of potential victims, the amount of \ncompensation, to come up with this number of $140 billion? Without \nexception, the chairman of the committee and lead sponsor of the bill, \nSenator Specter, has said he cannot explain that calculation. He cannot \ntell us where $140 billion came from. At best, he says, it was a figure \nthat he heard from Senator Frist and Senator Daschle a year or two ago. \nThat doesn't sound like a very valid starting point to establish the \namount of money you need in a trust fund to take care of some of the \nvictims that we have talked about.\n  To close the courthouse door to Donald Borzych and his family, and to \nsay to them you cannot pursue your lawsuit, you must turn to this trust \nfund, the starting point should be that the trust fund has enough money \nto take care of the victims. But, sadly, there is no way of \nestablishing that.\n  In fact, today Senator Kent Conrad, who is a colleague of mine from \nthe State of North Dakota and is the Democratic spokesman on the Senate \nBudget Committee, made a presentation to our caucus lunch. By best \nestimate, $140 billion is grossly inadequate, totally unfair in terms \nof what it will cover in the future. They have turned to a variety of \ndifferent groups and said: What would it really cost? The Congressional \nBudget Office, outside consulting groups--each and every one of them \nsays $140 billion is not enough.\n  Senator Specter was asked yesterday: What happens if this trust fund \nruns out of money? What if claims of people like Donald Borzych, \nPatricia Corona, are still out there, or people just like them, when \nthe fund runs out of money? Senator Specter was very candid. He said we \nwill just have to cut back on the amount we have to pay the victims. \nThink of that for a moment. Facing deadly mesothelioma or asbestosis, \nlosing your day in court for just\n\n[[Page S851]]\n\ncompensation for your injuries, you turn to a trust fund that fails you \nwhen you need it, and you receive a token amount for having given up \nyour life, having given up the quality of your life, having given up \nall that time with your family.\n  Over the last year or two I frequently have met with the families of \nthese mesothelioma asbestos disease cases. Some of them are still \nheartbroken because in many cases that father and that husband was \ntaken from them in a short period of time. In other cases they fought \nvaliantly, with great pain and sacrifice, to try to beat this disease--\nand they failed. Just last week, in a corridor upstairs, a family came \nto see me. A great young little fellow there who looked like he was \nabout 8 years old--he had a white shirt on and a bow tie--he was coming \nto the U.S. Capitol. He talked about losing his grandfather. He said he \nwas glad he lived long enough to at least know him, but he lost him to \nasbestos.\n  I thought to myself at that moment: If you are going to take that \nfamily out of court, if you are going to close the courthouse door to \ntheir effort to recover at least for the medical expenses and the \ninjuries that have been suffered, shouldn't you put them in a system \nthat will work, a system that you can say with some confidence will \ncompensate them?\n  We cannot say this about this bill--$140 billion--and no one can come \nto this floor and explain how that $140 billion is going to be \nadequate. It turns out that as soon as you close the courthouse door, \nif this bill passes, and you open up this trust fund, there will be a \nflood of people rushing to it. We know that. Some of them are on their \nlast leg, literally, trying to get some compensation. So will there be \nenough money in the trust fund to get started? The answer is no, not \nnearly enough.\n  What is the trust fund going to do? It is going to turn around and \nborrow enough money to start to pay them over an extended period of \ntime. And as the trust fund borrows money, it has to pay interest for \nthe money it borrows. The best estimates are that out of $140 billion, \nmore than a third of it is going to be paid in interest because of \nborrowing to start the trust fund in its earliest years. So there will \nnot even be $100 billion to deal with all of these cases.\n  Where will the money come from, $140 billion? That is another good \nstory. I yielded today several times to Senator Specter. We talked \nabout this. It is still not clear what happened, but some outside \ngroup--whether a consulting group or private corporation, I don't \nknow--was called on to figure out how you create $140 billion in a \ntrust fund. How do you turn to businesses and insurance companies and \nhave them pay that much money? What standards do you use? How many \ncompanies are affected? Which companies will be responsible? Which will \nnot be?\n  All the time we were considering this bill in committee, many of us \nwere asking: How did you come up with $140 billion, and who is going to \npay it? We never could get an answer. In May of last year I wrote a \nletter to the chairman and I asked: Can you tell us the answers to \nthose questions? This was 8 months ago. I never received a reply.\n  Over time, the chairman said he would provide the information, then \nannounced that he had to issue a subpoena to get the information to \nexplain his own bill--subpoena. Today he acknowledged it. They \nsubpoenaed the information--not from a Government agency but from some \nprivate business, private corporation that was writing this bill, or at \nleast writing the means by which they would fund the bill. They \nsubpoenaed the information. So, obviously, we believed that in the \ninterest of a real public debate that information should be public. But \nit is not. Somehow or another it has been characterized and classified \nas confidential information so that any person--the family of Donald \nBorzych, for example--who wants to know how this trust fund will ever \nbe funded can't even see this. It is a secret list, a secret list of \nthe companies that are going to fund the trust fund to $140 billion.\n\n  Is this how we write laws in America? Do we go to private companies \nto write the laws? And then, when you ask them to give you the \ninformation as the basis for the law, you have to subpoena it? Demand \nit from them? Is that what the American people expect? I don't think \nso.\n  I think they expect people, public officials and our staff, to put \ntheir best efforts into writing a bill that is not written by special \ninterest groups, is not written by private companies. In this case, \nthis bill clearly was, in many respects.\n  There are big winners in this bill. I wish I could go through the \nbill with some certainty and tell you what is in it, but I cannot. \nStanding here today, facing the prospects of voting on the bill \ntomorrow, I cannot tell you what we will be voting on. A lot of people \nthink Senators do not even try. The fact is, we were given a bill, this \nbill here, S. 852. That is the one that was passed around here. It is \non everybody's desk. But it turns out this is not the bill at all. \nListen to what was printed today in Congress Daily, which is a \npublication on Capitol Hill:\n\n       Senate Judiciary Chairman Specter is drafting a managers' \n     amendment to the asbestos litigation bill with more than 40 \n     new provisions in hopes of garnering enough votes to pass the \n     legislation. Senator Specter said in a news conference, \n     ``There is so much of this bill that is a work in progress.''\n\n  I can tell you, that means that neither this Senator nor, frankly, \nany Senator other than perhaps the chairman, has a clue what we will be \nvoting on tomorrow. While the fate and lives of millions of Americans \nwho have been exposed to asbestos hang in the balance, we are being \nasked to vote for a bill that will be changed so dramatically in just a \nfew hours that no one knows what is in it. No one knows what is in it. \nThis is what gives Congress a bad name--for us to be moving on a bill \nof this importance and this magnitude without knowledge as to what is \nincluded.\n  What is interesting is that the White House usually comments on these \nbills. They kind of send us a statement of administration policy, as to \nwhether they support a bill or oppose it. What I find interesting is we \nreceived an interesting statement from the White House on the \nadministration's approach to it. I might say, before I read it, that \nthey could not possibly know what is in this bill because no one else \nknows. It is going to change overnight. A managers' amendment will \nbring 40 new provisions in the bill. But nevertheless, the \nadministration, the Executive Office of the President, February 8, \n2006, Statement of Administration Policy on S. 852:\n\n       The administration supports Senate passage of S. 852.\n\n  He goes on to say asbestos related litigation has clogged up courts, \ndeprived those with injuries of meaningful remedies, costing tens of \nthousands of jobs, and so forth.\n  Then they come down to the second paragraph in this very brief \nstatement of policy in which they say:\n\n       Although the administration has serious concerns about \n     certain provisions of the bill, the administration looks \n     forward to working with Congress in order to strengthen and \n     improve this important legislation before it is presented to \n     the President for his signature.\n\n  Serious concerns--well, they should have serious concerns because \nthey have not seen the bill. Forty new provisions are going to be added \ntonight that no one in the White House could possibly have read before \nthey gave this reservation of an endorsement.\n  Here we are in a situation with a trust fund in an amount that cannot \nbe explained, coming from companies that are on a secret list that \ncannot be disclosed, as part of a bill that does not exist.\n  If you were out there with a member of your family exposed to \nasbestos, I think you would have justifiable concerns that what the \nSenate is about to do is nothing short of a disaster--a disaster for so \nmany victims across the United States.\n  Several things ought to be said about the problems that we face with \nthis bill. I could talk to you about the difficulties in the bill. One \nof them relates to Libby, MT. Libby, MT, could have been ground zero \nfor asbestos contamination. W.R. Grace & Company was mining asbestos \nand their workers were being exposed to dangers on a daily basis. This \ncompany is now gone, but the lawsuits and the injuries and the deaths \ncontinue from Libby, MT.\n  I can recall when Peter Grace, the head of W.R. Grace, was brought to \nWashington during the Reagan administration to tell us how to run the \nGovernment. Peter Grace was the head of a\n\n[[Page S852]]\n\ncommission to end waste and fraud and abuse in Government.\n  It turns out that Peter Grace's company, W.R. Grace, had been guilty \nof fraud on its workers for decades, concealing the dangers of \nasbestos. Part of this bill says we ought to give these Libby, MT, \nworkers good treatment. I support it. I think it is a good thing to do.\n  But only Libby, MT. It turns out across the United States of America \nthere are smaller examples of exactly the same thing in State after \nState. There are over 25 different sites around America--some in my own \nhome State of Illinois, some in Texas, some in Louisiana, some in New \nYork--that are just like Libby, MT. But when the chairman wrote the \nbill, special consideration was only given to one place in America--one \nplace. Why? Why would you single out one place in America to give \nspecial treatment under the bill? Sadly, that is exactly what happened. \nAnd because it happened, we are going to be facing an amendment, which \nI believe Senator Graham will offer, to make sure that there is fair \ntreatment for many others who are going to be involved.\n  I hope the Senate will support it. As I said, I am not against Libby, \nMT, receiving their fair share. But who were the winners and losers \nwhen it gets right down to it? The list is pretty interesting.\n  I talked earlier about U.S. Gypsum, a company based in Illinois. They \nhave been sued by lots of people exposed to asbestos from their \nproducts. U.S. Gypsum made an announcement last week as follows:\n\n       We believe that we have about $4 billion in damages that we \n     have to pay to victims of asbestos exposure from our \n     products.\n\n  Then they went on to say that they were going to pay it, unless this \nbill passes. If this bill passes, U.S. Gypsum will be required to pay \ninto the trust fund $900 million.\n  Think about that for a moment. One company benefits to the tune of \n$3.1 billion--U.S. Gypsum--because of this bill.\n  When it comes to the question about who wants this bill, you can bet \nthat company wants this bill.\n  Honeywell is another company--estimated future asbestos payments, \n$2.75 billion.\n  How much will they pay into this trust fund? Somewhere in the range \nof $300 million or $400 million, about 14 percent or 15 percent of what \nthey would otherwise pay in court. So now Honeywell wants this bill.\n  Dow Chemical, estimated future asbestos payments up to $2.2 billion. \nWhat is the amount of money they will pay into the asbestos trust fund? \nSomewhere in the range of $300 million. So they are going to do quite \nwell.\n  But there are other companies that will be forced to pay into this \ntrust fund with exactly the opposite results.\n  A.W. Chester, a company that has an estimated future asbestos payment \nin the court system, zero; never been sued, never paid. They will have \nto pay annually $16.5 million into this trust fund; never been sued, \nnever paid a penny.\n  They have said, quite frankly--this company has been around for a \nlong time--they are going out of business.\n  The same thing is true with Hopeman Brothers, no exposure; $16.5 \nmillion a year into the trust fund.\n  National Service Industries, estimated future asbestos payments, $11 \nmillion. They have to pay $16.5 million a year into this trust fund.\n  Is it any wonder that many of us have asked to come up with a list of \ncompanies that are going to be winning and losing with this asbestos \nbill? There are going to be some big, huge winners, and they have been \nworking night and day to get this passed.\n  There was a study released by Public Citizens Congress Watch in May \n2005, entitled, ``Federal Asbestos Legislation: The Winners Are.''\n  It looked at lobbying efforts behind this bill. They have been going \nfor a long time.\n  I mentioned, in an earlier statement, that over 20 years ago people \nwere talking about legislation. There has been a real intensity in that \nlobbying effort over the last several years.\n  This public citizen organization concludes the big winners will be an \nunknown number of Fortune 500 companies and at least 10 asbestos makers \nwho have filed for bankruptcy.\n  It concludes: Some of the Nation's largest and savviest investment \nfirms have positioned themselves to score big if the bill passes.\n  Everybody following this debate--especially Americans fed up with the \nway Washington works against the interests of the mainstream and for \nthe interests of Wall Street--I hope they will go to the Public Citizen \nWeb site, www.Citizen.org, and read it for yourselves. You can read \ntheir report and analysis of the lobbying effort. And you will find the \nmoney which has been spent--estimates by some are as high as $140 \nmillion--in lobbying to get this bill passed.\n  It sounds like a huge sum of money, until you look at one company \nthat could win $3.1 billion if this bill passes. It means a lot to \nthem. You can understand why that company hired 40 lobbyists to come \nand beg us to vote for this bill.\n  But I don't worry so much about the companies. I want them to stay in \nbusiness, if they can. I worry most about the victims. I worry about a \nsystem that would not pay those victims.\n  Is this the best we can do in America? Is this what fairness has come \nto? This bill is called the FAIR Act. Sadly, I think it is unfair. It \nis unfair to the hundreds of thousands of people who, through no fault \nof their own, have been exposed.\n  Luckily, we have a lot of supporters who have come and talked to us \nabout their support for this legislation opposition. They include many \nbusinesses that will be shortchanged, as I mentioned earlier, which \ninclude some insurance companies that feel this is fundamentally \nunfair. They include asbestos victims groups united to oppose this \nlegislation and a score of major labor unions across America \nrepresenting workers who may have been exposed and may need their day \nin court.\n\n  I am afraid that when you add up this lobbying effort that I have in \nmy hand against the $140 million to pass this legislation, this poor \ngroup just didn't have the firepower.\n  That is why this legislation is on the floor today and why it will be \nconsidered very soon.\n  Once again, we are going to say to America, We don't trust the courts \nin America, we don't trust the judge, we don't trust the juries. We \ntrust the special interest groups pushing legislation that takes the \npower away from the individual to have their day in court, to have \ntheir neighbors decide what they are entitled to.\n  Some who want to put their trust in that operation should pause and \nreflect.\n  This is the same gang who came up with the Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit program that has become an unsalvageable fiasco across America; \nagain, that program driven by the pharmaceutical companies, this \nlegislation driven by a handful of corporations that will do extremely \nwell.\n  I am going to close by saying that I can't think of a more important \nbill to be considered since I have been in Congress. I can't think of a \nbill that is going to have more impact on ordinary people.\n  It is unfortunate that special interest groups will dominate this \ndebate. Some people say: Aren't there special interest groups on both \nsides? I will concede that point; business groups on both sides, trial \nlawyers on one side, major corporations on the other side, unions on \none side. This is a clash of the special interest titans.\n  That is what this bill is.\n  The obvious question is: Why are we doing this? If you ask the \nAmerican people to pick any city in America, whether it is in Nevada or \nIllinois, you pick it, go on the street and ask: What is the first bill \nthe Senate should take up this year? My guess is that many of them \nwould say: I hope it is ethics, with that culture of corruption in \nWashington. You had better clean that mess up before you do anything \nelse. Someone else may say: After I sat down with my mother and tried \nto do that prescription drug form, I hope you will change that. Someone \nelse might say: I hope you will do something about the cost of health \ninsurance. That is a real issue facing businesses, families, and \nindividuals.\n  In my part of the world, they would say: Have you seen your heating \nbill at your home lately? It is double, Senator, if you didn't notice. \nWhat are you doing about energy in this country?\n\n[[Page S853]]\n\n  Some workers who come by my office ask: What are you going to do to \nprotect pensions which we have worked a lifetime for?\n  There is a long list of things we could do not driven by special \ninterest groups. No. The first item on the agenda for the Senate is the \nasbestos bill, the clash of the special interest titans.\n  That is where we are going to spend our time.\n  When it is all over, I am afraid those who couldn't afford lobbyists, \ncouldn't afford the people who stand outside the corridors with \nsignals, hand signals, with a wink and a nod on how we are supposed to \nvote, those are the ones who are going to be the losers.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Then we got into the issue of the President's inherent powers \nunder article II. It is difficult to define those powers without \nknowing more about the program and we do not know about the program. It \nwas beyond the scope of our hearing, but it is something that may be \ntaken up by the Intelligence Committee.\n  But I made a suggestion to the administration in a letter, in which I \nwrote to Attorney General Gonzales and put in the Record at our \nJudiciary Committee hearing, that the administration ought to submit \nthis program to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. They have \nthe expertise and they are trustworthy. It is a regrettable fact of \nlife in Washington that there are leaks from the Congress and there are \nleaks from the administration, but the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court has been able to maintain its secrecy. The Attorney \nGeneral said the administration was disinclined to do that.\n  In response to the letter, he wrote, a written response, he said that \nthey would exercise all of their options. I am now in the process of \ndrafting legislation which would call upon the Congress to exercise our \narticle I powers under the Constitution to make it more of a matter for \ncongressional oversight, but respecting the constitutional powers of \nthe President under article I. The Congress has very substantial \nauthority. The President has powers under article II; the Congress has \nvery substantial powers under article I. In section 8, there are a \nseries of provisions which deal with congressional authority on \nmilitary operations. One which hits it right on the head is to make \nrules for the Government and regulations of the land and naval forces. \nThat would comprehend what is being done now on the electronic \nsurveillance program.\n  The thrust of the legislative proposal I am drafting and have talked \nto a number of my colleagues about, with some affirmative responses, is \nto require the administration to take the program to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court.\n  I think that they ought to do it on their own because I think that \nthere are many questions which have been raised by both the Republicans \nand Democrats. We want to be secure and we want the military, the \nadministration and the President to have all the tools that they need \nto fight terrorism, but we also want to maintain our civil liberties. \nIf that unease would be solved by having the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court tell the administration that it is constitutional, \nif they say that it is unconstitutional, then there ought to be a \nmodification of it so what the administration is doing is \nconstitutional.\n  This comes squarely within the often-cited concurring opinion of \nJustice Jackson in the Steel Seizure case about the President's \nauthority being at its utmost when Congress backs him, on middle ground \nwhen Congress has not spoken, and weakest when Congress has acted \noppositely in the field, which I think Congress has done under the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act because the President's \ncongressional authority then is whatever he has minus whatever Congress \nhas that is taken away from him.\n  As Justice Jackson said, what is involved is the equilibrium of the \nconstitutional system. That is a very weighty concept--the equilibrium \nof the constitutional system.\n  The legislation I am preparing will set criteria for what ought to be \ndone to establish what the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \nshould apply in determining whether the administration's program is \nconstitutional. The standard of probable cause ought to be the one \nwhich the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court should apply now--not \nthe criminal standard, but the one for gathering intelligence. Then \nthey ought to weigh and balance the nature of the threat, the scope of \nthe program, how many people are being intercepted, what is being done \nwith the information, what is being done on minimization--which is the \nphrase that the information is not useful in terms of deleting it or \ngetting rid of it--how successful the program has been, if any \nprojected terrorist threats have been thwarted, and all factors \nrelating to the specifics on the program--its reasons, its rationale \nfor existence and precisely what is being undertaken, its success--and \nthat the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ought to look to this, \nessentially, prospectively.\n  The court does not have punitive powers, and I do not believe that it \nis of matter, except to work from this day forward as to what is being \ndone. No one doubts--or at least I do not doubt--the good faith of the \nPresident, the Attorney General, and the administration on what they \nhave done here. But as I said in the hearing, I said to Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales, the administration may be right but, on the other \nhand, they may be wrong.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ought to take a look at \nthe program, make a determination from this day forward whether it is \nconstitutional, and if it is constitutional, then they ought to, under \nthe statute, report back to Congress with their determination as to \nwhether it is constitutional.\n  The court ought to further make a determination as to whether it \nought to be modified in some way which would be consistent with what \nthe administration wants to accomplish but still be constitutional and \nnot an unreasonable invasion of privacy.\n  The President has represented that his program is reevaluated every \n45 days. That is in terms of the evaluation of the continuing threat \nand what ought to be done. I think a 45-day evaluation period would be \nin order here as well.\n  This question is one which is not going to go away. We had, \nyesterday, the comment by a Republican Member of the House of \nRepresentatives in the Intelligence Committee who chairs the \nsubcommittee that oversees the National Security Agency. There are \nquite a number of people on both sides of the aisle who have expressed \nconcerns regarding this program. It is my judgment that having it \nreviewed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court would \naccomplish all of the objectives, would maintain the secrecy of the \nprogram, would allow the President to continue it when there has been \nthe determination by a court--that is how we determine probable cause \non search warrants, on arrest warrants, on the activities, the \ntraditional way of putting the magistrate, the judicial official \nbetween the Government and the individual whose privacy rights are \nbeing involved.\n\n[[Page S854]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/08/senate-section/article/S854-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION IN GULF OF MEXICO\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico, chairman of \nthe Energy Committee, whom I greatly admire and respect and consider a \ngood friend, spoke about the bill he proposes to create opportunities \nfor oil and gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  I rise to point out that last week Senator Nelson and I offered a \nbipartisan bill that also deals with opening some aspects of lease area \n181 to oil and gas exploration. The bill Senator Nelson and I propose \nis a bill that I believe should find favor with many Senators. It \nallows protection to Florida's coast of 150 miles. It is the kind of \nprotection that Florida's economy depends upon and demands. The people \nof Florida fully understand the significance of this. This is what jobs \nin Florida are about, opportunities for people to continue to come to \nour State to enjoy the wonderful open air, the beaches, the great \nenvironment that we have to offer. It also protects the military \nmission line. This is a very important area for military training out \nof Eglin Air Force Base and other adjoining bases that utilize this \narea of the Gulf of Mexico as a primary area for training exercises.\n  More than that, it also gives the State of Florida permanent \nprotection. This buffer of protection around the State, unlike all the \nother proposals, gives the State of Florida permanent protection. Once \nand for all we will define where in the Gulf of Mexico we will drill \nand where we will not drill, where in the Gulf of Mexico the State of \nFlorida will find permanent protection.\n  The chairman's bill opens more area for drilling in lease area 181. \nWe don't like that as well as what the Senator from Florida and I \nproposed, but we understand it does also conflict with what is being \nproposed and today was outlined by the Minerals Management Service of \nthe Department of the Interior. The Department of the Interior today \nproposed the next 5-year leasing area for the Gulf of Mexico in lease \narea 181, and they speak of an area open for drilling that is even less \nthan what the Senator from New Mexico is proposing. But equally flawed, \nthis is protection for 5 years. It is another 5-year moratorium.\n  Five years from now, we will be right back here where we are today \ndiscussing how yet another portion of the Gulf of Mexico might be open \nto oil exploration. The bill Senator Nelson and I propose is the only \none that opens areas in lease area 181 and a substantial portion south \nof lease area 181 to further oil and gas exploration but also provides \nthe State of Florida with permanent protection, permanent protection \nthe State of Florida ought to decide whether they wish to have. And we \nrepresentatives of the State of Florida believe strongly this is \nimportant to us.\n  What is the rationale for this? Why must we continue this quest for \nmore and more drilling in the gulf? We are talking about the price of \ngas. Since we were debating this a couple months ago, the price of gas \nhas dropped dramatically. It is now not almost but almost 50 percent of \nwhat it was a couple of months ago. In addition, for the last 15 years, \nwe have gone to a very inefficient way of producing electricity by \ngenerating electricity with gas. Almost 95 or 92 percent of all new \ngenerating facilities that have been built over the last 10 years or so \nhave been powered by gas, a very inefficient way of doing it. Why? \nBecause it was cheap. Because gas was so cheap, this was the best \nalternative, just as the energy companies moved in the direction of gas \nbecause it was inexpensive. As the price of gas has risen, it will \ndictate that they will move to other fuel sources.\n  I continue to believe that inefficient power, generating decisions \nmade 10 years ago, should not inure to the detriment of the people of \nFlorida, Florida's economy, and environment. It is fine to use the Gulf \nof Mexico for oil exploration in areas where it is sufficiently far \naway from the State of Florida. It is fine to go into lease area 181. \nWe are willing to open up more of 181 to oil and gas exploration. What \nwe are not willing to do is not insist that the State of Florida be \nprovided with some permanent protection.\n  There is more than one bill to discuss. There is more than one way to \ngo here. I believe that we offer a way for more gas and oil exploration \nin the State of Florida while at the same time providing our State with \nthe vital permanent protection that the people of Florida expect and \ndemand.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/08/senate-section/article/S854-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S854-S855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            STAMINA, LEADERSHIP, AND RESPECT FOR THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, all of us who are friends and colleagues of \nthe senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, are delighted \nwith his robust recovery from a difficult illness.\n  Nearly a year ago Senator Specter announced that he had been \ndiagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. He declared that he was going to beat \nit, just as he had beaten a brain tumor, heart surgery and several \nother challenges. We are delighted that his promise has been fulfilled, \nas we knew it would be.\n  Over the last year he underwent a regimen of grueling treatments. \nThroughout dozens of Judiciary Committee hearings and voting sessions \non difficult topics, he and I sat side by side, month after month, as \nhis treatments progressed. He slowly lost his hair, but he never lost \nhis grit, his sense of fairness or his respect for the Senate and its \nspecial role in our system of Government. Nor did he lose his \nlegislative skill, or his humor. Then, and now, he has maintained for \nhimself, and for our committee--a brisk schedule, fueled by an energy \nlevel that would be daunting to many who are half his age.\n  He has all of the vigor of his earlier days, and maybe more. His hair \nis back, and if I may say so, he looks better than ever.\n  He is an inspiration to us all, and his example is a particular \ninspiration to millions of victims and survivors of cancer, and their \nfamilies, across the Nation.\n  I value the partnership that he and I have forged over the years, and \nespecially during the time that he has been our committee's chairman. \nOne product of our partnership is the asbestos trust fund bill that is \nnow before the Senate. Bringing this bill on its long journey to the \nSenate floor has required unending commitment and effort. I have been \nproud to work with him on this project, and I applaud him for all he \nhas done to bring the bill to this point.\n  I commend to the attention of our colleagues an editorial about \nSenator Specter in today's edition of The Hill newspaper.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Hill, Feb. 8, 2006]\n\n                            Looming Specter\n\n       The past year has been tumultuous for Sen. Arlen Specter \n     (R-Pa.), but he has emerged from its trials triumphant.\n       It is not quite 12 months since the lawmaker announced he \n     had been diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, a form of cancer. \n     In his statement disclosing his ailment and the imminent \n     start of chemotherapy, Specter said, ``I have beaten a brain \n     tumor, bypass heart surgery and many tough political \n     opponents, and I'm going to beat this, too.''\n       He has been as good as his word. He lost his hair but \n     continued to shoulder his heavy workload (and to keep in \n     shape playing squash before he got to his desk in the \n     morning). He was never absent, and his hair is back. At 75, \n     Specter is looking spry.\n       At the time of his diagnosis, the senator had only just \n     secured his chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee, after a \n     tough battle against conservative Republicans who feared he \n     would not fight hard for conservative Supreme Court justices \n     should President Bush have the opportunity to nominate them.\n       Those fears have proved unfounded. There are now two new \n     members of the high court, Chief Justice John Roberts and \n     Justice Samuel Alito, whose conservative credentials are not \n     in doubt. Those on the right trust and hope (just as those on \n     the left believe and fear) that the new justices, replacing \n     the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Sandra \n     Day O'Connor, will move the court toward conservative \n     textualism and away from the ``living Constitution'' ideas \n     that have produced liberal change on social issues for the \n     past two generations.\n       It is Specter, a supporter of abortion rights, who has \n     presided over these changes to the bench. And he has done so \n     with aplomb and without any hint either of truckling to those \n     on either his right or his left. He rejected, for example, \n     conservative demands that Alito's confirmation hearings be\n\n[[Page S855]]\n\n     brought forward in December so that the nominee would not be \n     left hanging out as a target for too long. At the same time, \n     he did not allow his own ideological positions to blind him \n     to the nominees' obvious qualifications. Alito's and \n     Roberts's critics were given ample time to air their \n     concerns, yet both were steered swiftly and comparatively \n     easily to confirmation.\n       Bush must surely be well-satisfied with his decision in \n     2004 to back Specter's re-election despite their obvious \n     differences in ideology, temperament and outlook.\n       Specter is not resting on his laurels. His agenda is \n     dominating Senate business. He is presiding over a Judiciary \n     investigation of the National Security Agency's controversial \n     terrorist surveillance program. And his asbestos reform bill, \n     an effort to clean up a mountain of debilitating litigation, \n     is atop the legislative calendar put together by Majority \n     Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.).\n       People who know Specter rarely make the error of \n     underestimating him. They are even less likely to do so \n     following his performance in the past 12 months.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/08/senate-section/article/S855-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S855-S857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NEW MARKETS TAX CREDIT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to my colleagues' \nattention a significant and exciting article that appeared in the \nWednesday, January 25, 2006, edition of The New York Times entitled \n``Luring Business Developers Into Low-Income Areas,'' as written by Ms. \nLisa Chamberlain.\n  I believe my colleagues will be especially interested in this article \nbecause it explains how the new markets tax credit, NMTC, can create \nnew jobs, and economic development, in the destitute rural and urban \nareas. I know that sincere Members of Congress, both Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, recognize the credit's ability to transform \ncommunities and break the poverty cycle. From the beginning, the \ncredit's power to help communities overcome poverty has garnered strong \nbipartisan support for the measure.\n  The new markets tax credit is unique among Federal antipoverty \ninitiatives. Its innovative approach uses the Tax Code to encourage \nlong-term capital investments in downtrodden communities identified by \nthe census as historically plagued by high unemployment, low levels of \nprivate investment, and stifling poverty rates.\n  The credit provides a modest incentive--a 39-percent credit against \nFederal taxes over a 7-year period--to lure new private investments to \nstruggling communities. For this credit, developers agree to invest in \nprojects that benefit the community and undertake measures, like \ncharging lower rents, to encourage these projects' success.\n  Over the next 10 years, private investors will dedicate over $15 \nbillion in new money to poor urban and rural areas in order to \nrevitalize, develop, and ultimately transform these impoverished, low-\nincome communities. The program's rate of return, as measured by \nincreased economic development and lower poverty rates, easily \njustifies its modest costs to the Treasury of $4.5 billion over 10 \nyears.\n  The credit's greatest innovation is its ability to create \npartnerships between the public and private sector that encourage and \ncultivate investments within a diverse range of businesses and \norganizations. These investments propel growth by providing funding for \nsmall business startups, enable the expansion of manufacturing \nfacilities, and the building of retail, mixed use, commercial and \nhousing developments. The investments also provide communities with \nimportant services by creating childcare centers, employment training \nfacilities, charter schools, and community health care centers.\n  I have seen the credit's ability to reenergize and save local \neconomies in my home State of Maine. During the 1990s, Maine's Katahdin \nForest region fell on hard times. One of the areas largest employers, \nthe Great Northern Paper Company, struggled against depressed global \npaper prices and low financial returns associated with owning trees. \nCombined, these factors made it extremely difficult to raise the \ncapital necessary to make the mill improvements needed to keep the \ncompany competitive and retain jobs.\n  Because of a $31.5 million NMTC investment made by Coastal \nEnterprises, a community development corporation based in Wiscasset, \nME, two of Great Northern Paper Company's pulp and paper mills in the \nKatahdin Forest area were able to stay in business and modernize. This \ncrucial investment resulted in the direct employment of 650 people.\n  The credit also made it possible for Coastal Enterprises to partner \nwith The Nature Conservancy in a ground breaking arrangement to promote \nthe twin goals of environmental protection and economic development. \nThe credit enabled the Nature Conservancy to purchase 41,000 acres, of \nGreat Northern Paper Company's 341,000-acre land base, that contain \ncritical lake and stream watershed lands. As part of this deal, Great \nNorthern Paper Company agreed to place a perpetual conservation \neasement on 200,000 of the remaining 300,000 acres they retained. These \nprojects will benefit Maine's environment, and economy, for years to \ncome.\n  These Maine examples represent a few of the innovative and \nrevolutionary ways the new markets tax credit is being used nationwide \nto address local economic troubles. These projects ranges from smaller \nloans to help local business owners become more self-sufficient by \npurchasing their office space to larger ventures like developing a new \naircraft repair facility.\n  Additionally, projects also work to address community deficiencies \nlike the building of a much needed shopping center to transform a \nrundown, major transit stop. Such investments enable companies located \nin low-income communities to add jobs, provide more people with needed \ngoods and services, and increase the strength of their local tax base \nand economies.\n  Competition among applicants for access to the new markets tax credit \nprogram is spurring the private sector to reach beyond the minimum \nrequirements of the law in order to secure a tax credit allotment. \nAccording to the results of a May 2005 survey conducted by the New \nMarkets Tax Credit Coalition, investors are targeting communities to \ndevelop projects with higher poverty and unemployment rates than the \nlaw requires. These private investors are also directing capital into \nlow income areas faster rate than required by law.\n  The credit enables the public and private sectors to work together in \na way that is truly transforming the Nation's most impoverished \ncommunities. Through these partnerships, investors are now deploying \ntheir capital in areas where before they never would have invested \nbecause the great risks kept flexible capital from being conventionally \navailable in these depressed areas.\n  The credit is seen as one of the most hopeful ways to address the \ndevastating effects of Hurricane Katrina and Rita on the Gulf States. \nWe in Congress overwhelmingly recognized and supported the power of the \ncredit by dedicating $1 billion dollars in additional funding to \nprojects along the gulf coast financed by the NMTC. Many broken Gulf \nState communities desperately wait for the rebuilding, and renovation, \nprojects the credit will provide.\n  As a bipartisan effort to continue the credit's great successes, I am \npleased to join my colleague on the Senate Finance Committee, Senator \nRockefeller, in sponsoring S. 1800, the New Markets Tax Credit \nReauthorization Act. A companion bill, H.R. 3987, has been introduced \nin the House of Representatives by Congressman Ron Lewis of Kentucky.\n  Our legislation extends the new markets tax credit through 2012. \nUnder current law, the credit, which was enacted in December 2000 as \npart of the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act, will expire on December \n31, 2007. I ask my colleagues to enthusiastically support this \ninnovative and necessary legislation.\n  In addition to our legislation, the Senate version of the tax \nreconciliation measure, S. 2020, includes a 1-year extension of the new \nmarkets tax credit through 2008. I know that my respected colleagues, \nboth Republicans and Democrats, support the extension of this important \nbipartisan provision because of its impressive results fighting \nentrenched poverty and unemployment. I urge my colleagues to strongly \nsupport keeping this provision in the final version of the tax bill.\n  The new markets tax credit is able to improve the physical \ninfrastructure of low-income communities as well as the lives of its \nresidents by harnessing the combined talents of the public and private \nsectors to create jobs, foster entrepreneurialism, construct \nfacilities, conserve the environment, and even promote greater access \nto health\n\n[[Page S856]]\n\ncare and education. I hope my colleagues will join me assuring that the \nnew markets tax credit program remains strong for the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Ms. Chamberlain's entire article be \nprinted in the Record. I ask unanimous consent that this letter, \nshowing the support of over 240 representatives of community \ndevelopment corporations and financial institutions for S. 1800, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From The New York Times, Jan. 25, 2006]\n\n            Luring Business Developers Into Low-Income Areas\n\n                         (By Lisa Chamberlain)\n\n       When the low-income housing tax credit was created in 1986, \n     it took years for developers, investors and advocates to \n     understand the program and to learn how to make the most use \n     of it. Now it is one of the most important tools for low-\n     income residential real estate, responsible for creating \n     approximately 1.5 million units of affordable housing to \n     date.\n       Advocates of a little-known development tool called new-\n     market tax credits, the only federal tax credit program for \n     commercial projects in low-income areas, believe the same \n     thing is beginning to happen with commercial real estate. \n     Efforts are already under way to reauthorize the program, \n     which expires next year.\n       Enacted in December 2000, the new-market tax credit program \n     is helping to create jobs and revitalize streets and even \n     entire downtowns. Projects large and small that most \n     financial specialists agree would never come to fruition \n     otherwise are taking shape because of tax credits worth \n     $500,000 to $150 million and even more.\n       For instance, the tax credits are currently financing the \n     rebuilding of a butter manufacturing cooperative in New Ulm, \n     MN, that was damaged in a fire. The loss of the cooperative \n     put 130 people out of work, caused economic hardship for 400 \n     family farms and indirectly affected hundreds more jobs in \n     the low-income rural area.\n       Just south of the central business district in Grand \n     Rapids, MI, is a nearly completed arts-related mixed-use \n     redevelopment project in an area largely abandoned since the \n     1950's. Called Martineau Division-Oakes, the 12,000-square-\n     foot commercial space is occupied by the art department of \n     Calvin College and a cafe. There are also 23 spaces for \n     artists to live and work in. Once the project got off the \n     ground, the city committed $2 million to landscaping, \n     repaving, new lighting, signage and sidewalk improvements in \n     the development's neighborhood.\n       ``It's a very flexible and powerful program,'' said Robert \n     Poznanski, president of the New Markets Support Company, one \n     of the main recipients of credits from the Treasury \n     Department, which administers the program.\n       ``It's driven by market forces. The federal government \n     doesn't say, `Use it for this type of business.' It can be \n     used for commercial real estate, a charter school or a \n     community center, as long as the application is competitive \n     and the project is in a low-income area as identified by \n     census tract data.''\n       Tax credits make riskier projects more viable by reducing \n     the debt associated with development costs. Private investors \n     pay less in taxes and the developer passes the savings on to \n     the community by, for example, lowering rent per square foot.\n       The federal program will allocate up to $15 billion in tax \n     credits to community development groups over seven years to \n     make businesses or commercial real estate projects in low-\n     income areas more attractive to private investors. Applicants \n     vie for the credits, and so far the process has been highly \n     competitive. In the first three rounds of allocation, \n     beginning in 2003, demand for the credits has outpaced supply \n     by 10 times, according to figures provided by the Treasury \n     Department. Though the tax credits can be used for business \n     development, the majority are used for commercial real estate \n     because of the way the program is structured.\n       The most recent allocation was completed last fall, \n     bringing the total disbursement to $8 billion to date. \n     Recipients have five years to use the tax credits to attract \n     private investment, or they are withdrawn and can be reissued \n     elsewhere through 2014.\n       Dennis Sturtevant, president of Dwelling Place, a nonprofit \n     community development organization, spearheaded the Martineau \n     Division-Oakes project in Grand Rapids. The project used \n     historic tax credits and other grants, in addition to new-\n     market tax credits, to generate $2.2 million in equity from \n     National City Bank.\n       ``When you're talking about tough neighborhoods and all the \n     costs associated with renovating dilapidated, obsolete \n     buildings with lead and everything else,'' Mr. Sturtevant \n     said, ``you need to combine all these resources to make it \n     work.''\n       Sean P. Welsh, regional president of National City Bank, \n     said: ``It required a lot of creativity. It's complicated, \n     but it's really driving a lot of the urban redevelopment in \n     this and other areas around the country.''\n       One deal that most everyone agrees would have never \n     happened were it not for the tax credits is Plaza Verde in \n     South Minneapolis. Formerly an abandoned building in a low-\n     income Hispanic neighborhood, it is now a 43,000-square-foot \n     business incubator, with locally owned retailing on the \n     ground floor, office space on the second level and a theater \n     company on the top floor.\n       JoAnna Hicks is the director of real estate for the \n     Neighborhood Development Center, the nonprofit organization \n     that spearheaded Plaza Verde. Even after expenses were \n     deducted, including legal fees, new-market tax credits \n     created almost $1 million in equity for a project that cost \n     $4.2 million total.\n       ``Because it's such a complicated financial tool, it's hard \n     for small nonprofits to use,'' Ms. Hicks said. ``But now that \n     we understand it better, we're able to apply it to other \n     projects as well.''\n       Using another allocation of the tax credits, Ms. Hicks's \n     organization has also undertaken the development of a nearly \n     completed public market, called Midtown Global Market, a $17 \n     million project that will be home to more than 60 vendors \n     selling fresh and prepared foods, as well as handmade arts \n     and crafts.\n       As the program has only begun to mature, larger projects \n     are just getting under way. Bridgeport, CT, is undertaking a \n     major redevelopment of its downtown, with approximately 25 \n     percent of the financing coming from new-market tax credits. \n     The total project is estimated to cost up to $150 million.\n       ``If structured properly, it makes a real difference \n     between a scary development and the deal not being done at \n     all,'' said Kevin Gremse, director of the National \n     Development Council, which provides financial advice and \n     services to municipalities.\n       Mr. Gremse used his organization's new-market tax credit \n     allocation to attract a New York City-based private \n     developer, Eric Anderson of Urban Green Builders, to take on \n     the task of reviving downtown Bridgeport, which has suffered \n     years of decline.\n       Advocates are cautiously optimistic that the program will \n     be reauthorized in 2007. Congress recently passed a bill to \n     assist Gulf Coast states with rebuilding efforts after \n     Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, which included $1 billion more \n     for the new-market tax credit program geared toward that \n     region.\n       ``The fact that Congress expanded the program is a good \n     sign,'' said Robert Rapoza, who manages the New Market Tax \n     Credit Coalition, an advocacy organization pushing for the \n     program's reauthorization. ``But we have work to do. This is \n     a new tool and government-sponsored finance is relatively \n     uncommon. We're continuing to put together data to strengthen \n     our case.''\n       Of course, it helps to have banks advocating for the tax \n     credit as well. As one of the more active players in the tax \n     credit industry, Zachary Boyers, a senior vice president of \n     U.S. Bank in St. Louis, closed more than 50 deals involving \n     new-market tax credits in 2005 alone.\n       ``The banking community is behind this,'' Mr. Boyers said. \n     ``We are deeply involved in spreading the word. We are \n     working on ways to quantify its impact, which is not easy to \n     do. But other investors, including banks and large \n     corporations, would confirm that they would never be \n     investing in these projects without it.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    New Markets Tax Credit Coalition\n\n       Dear Senator/Representative: We are writing to you to \n     indicate our support for the New Markets Tax Credit \n     Reauthorization Act of 2005 (S. 1800 and H.R. 3957).

The purpose of the Credit is \n     to increase private sector investment in low income \n     communities by providing a modest federal tax incentive. \n     There is ample evidence that the Credit is working to do just \n     that.\n       Thus far, the Department of the Treasury has finalized \n     allocations of $6 billion in Credits. After only two years, \n     close to $3 billion in investments in low income communities \n     have been made. These investments have resulted in the \n     financing of projects in economically distressed urban and \n     rural communities including:\n       Creation of the first new supermarket and shopping center \n     in a low-income community in 30 years in Cleveland;\n       In Baltimore, economic revitalization and thousands of jobs \n     in an urban community where past efforts foundered;\n       Development of a new facility for daycare and other \n     community services that shows the potential to lead the way \n     for other development in Chicago;\n       Business expansion, job creation and opportunity in rural \n     Oklahoma;\n       Revitalization of the timber industry in northern Maine.\n       The New Markets Tax Credit has attracted a wide range of \n     private sector investors including private financial \n     institutions and insurance companies.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring to my colleagues' \nattention a significant and exciting article that appeared in the \nWednesday, January 25, 2006, edition of The New York Times entitled \n``Luring Business Developers Into Low-Income Areas,'' as written by Ms. \nLisa Chamberlain.\n  I believe my colleagues will be especially interested in this article \nbecause it explains how the new markets tax credit, NMTC, can create \nnew jobs, and economic development, in the destitute rural and urban \nareas. I know that sincere Members of Congress, both Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, recognize the credit's ability to transform \ncommunities and break the poverty cycle. From the beginning, the \ncredit's power to help communities overcome poverty has garnered strong \nbipartisan support for the measure.\n  The new markets tax credit is unique among Federal antipoverty \ninitiatives. Its innovative approach uses the Tax Code to encourage \nlong-term capital investments in downtrodden communities identified by \nthe census as historically plagued by high unemployment, low levels of \nprivate investment, and stifling poverty rates.\n  The credit provides a modest incentive--a 39-percent credit against \nFederal taxes over a 7-year period--to lure new private investments to \nstruggling communities. For this credit, developers agree to invest in \nprojects that benefit the community and undertake measures, like \ncharging lower rents, to encourage these projects' success.\n  Over the next 10 years, private investors will dedicate over $15 \nbillion in new money to poor urban and rural areas in order to \nrevitalize, develop, and ultimately transform these impoverished, low-\nincome communities. The program's rate of return, as measured by \nincreased economic development and lower poverty rates, easily \njustifies its modest costs to the Treasury of $4.5 billion over 10 \nyears.\n  The credit's greatest innovation is its ability to create \npartnerships between the public and private sector that encourage and \ncultivate investments within a diverse range of businesses and \norganizations. These investments propel growth by providing funding for \nsmall business startups, enable the expansion of manufacturing \nfacilities, and the building of retail, mixed use, commercial and \nhousing developments. The investments also provide communities with \nimportant services by creating childcare centers, employment training \nfacilities, charter schools, and community health care centers.\n  I have seen the credit's ability to reenergize and save local \neconomies in my home State of Maine. During the 1990s, Maine's Katahdin \nForest region fell on hard times. One of the areas largest employers, \nthe Great Northern Paper Company, struggled against depressed global \npaper prices and low financial returns associated with owning trees. \nCombined, these factors made it extremely difficult to raise the \ncapital necessary to make the mill improvements needed to keep the \ncompany competitive and retain jobs.\n  Because of a $31.5 million NMTC investment made by Coastal \nEnterprises, a community development corporation based in Wiscasset, \nME, two of Great Northern Paper Company's pulp and paper mills in the \nKatahdin Forest area were able to stay in business and modernize. This \ncrucial investment resulted in the direct employment of 650 people.\n  The credit also made it possible for Coastal Enterprises to partner \nwith The Nature Conservancy in a ground breaking arrangement to promote \nthe twin goals of environmental protection and economic development. \nThe credit enabled the Nature Conservancy to purchase 41,000 acres, of \nGreat Northern Paper Company's 341,000-acre land base, that contain \ncritical lake and stream watershed lands. As part of this deal, Great \nNorthern Paper Company agreed to place a perpetual conservation \neasement on 200,000 of the remaining 300,000 acres they retained. These \nprojects will benefit Maine's environment, and economy, for years to \ncome.\n  These Maine examples represent a few of the innovative and \nrevolutionary ways the new markets tax credit is being used nationwide \nto address local economic troubles. These projects ranges from smaller \nloans to help local business owners become more self-sufficient by \npurchasing their office space to larger ventures like developing a new \naircraft repair facility.\n  Additionally, projects also work to address community deficiencies \nlike the building of a much needed shopping center to transform a \nrundown, major transit stop. Such investments enable companies located \nin low-income communities to add jobs, provide more people with needed \ngoods and services, and increase the strength of their local tax base \nand economies.\n  Competition among applicants for access to the new markets tax credit \nprogram is spurring the private sector to reach beyond the minimum \nrequirements of the law in order to secure a tax credit allotment. \nAccording to the results of a May 2005 survey conducted by the New \nMarkets Tax Credit Coalition, investors are targeting communities to \ndevelop projects with higher poverty and unemployment rates than the \nlaw requires. These private investors are also directing capital into \nlow income areas faster rate than required by law.\n  The credit enables the public and private sectors to work together in \na way that is truly transforming the Nation's most impoverished \ncommunities. Through these partnerships, investors are now deploying \ntheir capital in areas where before they never would have invested \nbecause the great risks kept flexible capital from being conventionally \navailable in these depressed areas.\n  The credit is seen as one of the most hopeful ways to address the \ndevastating effects of Hurricane Katrina and Rita on the Gulf States. \nWe in Congress overwhelmingly recognized and supported the power of the \ncredit by dedicating $1 billion dollars in additional funding to \nprojects along the gulf coast financed by the NMTC. Many broken Gulf \nState communities desperately wait for the rebuilding, and renovation, \nprojects the credit will provide.\n  As a bipartisan effort to continue the credit's great successes, I am \npleased to join my colleague on the Senate Finance Committee, Senator \nRockefeller, in sponsoring S. 1800, the New Markets Tax Credit \nReauthorization Act. A companion bill, H.R. 3987, has been introduced \nin the House of Representatives by Congressman Ron Lewis of Kentucky.\n  Our legislation extends the new markets tax credit through 2012. \nUnder current law, the credit, which was enacted in December 2000 as \npart of the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act, will expire on December \n31, 2007. I ask my colleagues to enthusiastically support this \ninnovative and necessary legislation.\n  In addition to our legislation, the Senate version of the tax \nreconciliation measure, S. 2020, includes a 1-year extension of the new \nmarkets tax credit through 2008. I know that my respected colleagues, \nboth Republicans and Democrats, support the extension of this important \nbipartisan provision because of its impressive results fighting \nentrenched poverty and unemployment. I urge my colleagues to strongly \nsupport keeping this provision in the final version of the tax bill.\n  The new markets tax credit is able to improve the physical \ninfrastructure of low-income communities as well as the lives of its \nresidents by harnessing the combined talents of the public and private \nsectors to create jobs, foster entrepreneurialism, construct \nfacilities, conserve the environment, and even promote greater access \nto health\n\n[[Page S856]]\n\ncare and education. I hope my colleagues will join me assuring that the \nnew markets tax credit program remains strong for the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Ms. Chamberlain's entire article be \nprinted in the Record. I ask unanimous consent that this letter, \nshowing the support of over 240 representatives of community \ndevelopment corporations and financial institutions for S. 1800, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From The New York Times, Jan. 25, 2006]\n\n            Luring Business Developers Into Low-Income Areas\n\n                         (By Lisa Chamberlain)\n\n       When the low-income housing tax credit was created in 1986, \n     it took years for developers, investors and advocates to \n     understand the program and to learn how to make the most use \n     of it. Now it is one of the most important tools for low-\n     income residential real estate, responsible for creating \n     approximately 1.5 million units of affordable housing to \n     date.\n       Advocates of a little-known development tool called new-\n     market tax credits, the only federal tax credit program for \n     commercial projects in low-income areas, believe the same \n     thing is beginning to happen with commercial real estate. \n     Efforts are already under way to reauthorize the program, \n     which expires next year.\n       Enacted in December 2000, the new-market tax credit program \n     is helping to create jobs and revitalize streets and even \n     entire downtowns. Projects large and small that most \n     financial specialists agree would never come to fruition \n     otherwise are taking shape because of tax credits worth \n     $500,000 to $150 million and even more.\n       For instance, the tax credits are currently financing the \n     rebuilding of a butter manufacturing cooperative in New Ulm, \n     MN, that was damaged in a fire. The loss of the cooperative \n     put 130 people out of work, caused economic hardship for 400 \n     family farms and indirectly affected hundreds more jobs in \n     the low-income rural area.\n       Just south of the central business district in Grand \n     Rapids, MI, is a nearly completed arts-related mixed-use \n     redevelopment project in an area largely abandoned since the \n     1950's. Called Martineau Division-Oakes, the 12,000-square-\n     foot commercial space is occupied by the art department of \n     Calvin College and a cafe. There are also 23 spaces for \n     artists to live and work in. Once the project got off the \n     ground, the city committed $2 million to landscaping, \n     repaving, new lighting, signage and sidewalk improvements in \n     the development's neighborhood.\n       ``It's a very flexible and powerful program,'' said Robert \n     Poznanski, president of the New Markets Support Company, one \n     of the main recipients of credits from the Treasury \n     Department, which administers the program.\n       ``It's driven by market forces. The federal government \n     doesn't say, `Use it for this type of business.' It can be \n     used for commercial real estate, a charter school or a \n     community center, as long as the application is competitive \n     and the project is in a low-income area as identified by \n     census tract data.''\n       Tax credits make riskier projects more viable by reducing \n     the debt associated with development costs. Private investors \n     pay less in taxes and the developer passes the savings on to \n     the community by, for example, lowering rent per square foot.\n       The federal program will allocate up to $15 billion in tax \n     credits to community development groups over seven years to \n     make businesses or commercial real estate projects in low-\n     income areas more attractive to private investors. Applicants \n     vie for the credits, and so far the process has been highly \n     competitive. In the first three rounds of allocation, \n     beginning in 2003, demand for the credits has outpaced supply \n     by 10 times, according to figures provided by the Treasury \n     Department.

Mr. President, today I join Senators Domenici, Bingaman, \nTalent and Dorgan in sponsorship of legislation instructing the \nSecretary of the Interior to develop an oil and gas leasing program for \nLease Area 181, located 100 miles off the coast of Florida in the Gulf \nof Mexico.\n  As oil and natural gas prices continuously increase, many Americans, \nespecially Montanans, are feeling the strain of increased prices for \nenergy use in their homes and businesses. Montana ag producers are \nparticularly hard hit because the costs of fuel and fertilizer have \nskyrocketed. While I strongly support the idea of renewable energies, \nit will take years of research and development before there are \npracticable and affordable alternatives to oil and natural gas. \nDevelopment of the American-owned offshore Lease Area 181 would provide \nnearly 5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas as a near term solution for \nour country's growing energy needs. That amount would be enough to heat \n5 million homes for 15 years.\n  In order to strengthen American energy security, it is our obligation \nto use our own domestic resources whenever we can. Offshore drilling \nhas proven to be a safe, reliable, and valuable technology for oil and \ngas production. Lease Area 181 is a phenomenal resource, and time after \ntime in energy committee hearings when we ask expert witnesses for \ntheir opinions on how to best stabilize and lower natural gas prices, \nthe answer is, ``Open Lease Area 181.'' It is not the entire answer to \nour energy challenges, but it is an important step forward. I applaud \nthe leadership of the chairman and ranking member of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee for acting on this important issue. Next, I \nhope we examine the potential for additional onshore resource \ndevelopment. I come from an energy producing state, and I can tell you, \nwithout reservation, that Montana stands ready to serve the energy \nneeds of this country. We have oil, natural gas, more coal than any \nother state, and a great potential for wind energy.\n  I am confident that my fellow Senators will see the value in \nproviding a supply of affordable energy from our domestic resources, \nand hope the Senate acts quickly on this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/08/senate-section/article/S857-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today, I speak about the need for hate \ncrimes legislation.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. Tobey \nSchule, of Kalispell, MT, for his valuable testimony today before the \nSenate Finance Committee.\n  The Senate Finance Committee played a key role in enacting Medicare \ndrug benefits. We must be diligent in overseeing their implementation. \nIn 2003, after years of debate, Congress added prescription drug \ncoverage to Medicare. I was proud to help pass that law. The law was \nnot perfect. But it has the potential to do some good.\n  The Medicare drug bill has the potential to make prescription drugs \navailable to millions who could not otherwise afford them. It has the \npotential to make drugs available that will lessen pain. It has the \npotential to save lives.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has implemented the new law poorly. \nAfter Congress passed the law, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices--CMS--had the duty to ensure that Medicare drug benefits were \nup and running by January 1, 2006. I appreciate CMS's efforts to \nimplement the new law. It is a huge task. CMS worked hard. But CMS's \nefforts have come up short, in two major areas.\n  First, CMS made the new drug benefit needlessly confusing.\n  As part of the new law, Congress passed a temporary drug discount \ncard, available in 2004. The card was supposed to give temporary relief \nfrom high drug costs. Seniors of modest means were eligible for a \n$1,200 Federal subsidy for their drug purchases.\n  But most Medicare beneficiaries did not sign up for the drug card. \nWhy? They were paralyzed by the choices. CMS approved 40 Medicare drug \ncards in my State of Montana alone. Instead of celebrating their \nchoices, most seniors in my State decided not to sign up.\n  Less than a year later, CMS was approving drug plans for the new drug \nbenefit. I urged CMS not to repeat the mistakes that they made with the \ndrug card. I urged CMS to approve only plans meeting the highest \nstandards.\n  But CMS repeated the mistakes of the drug card. CMS approved dozens \nof plans for participation in the new drug program. CMS approved more \nthan 40 drug plans in Montana. I support choice, competition, and the \nfree market. It is great that Americans can choose from hundreds of \ndifferent models when buying a new car. But when people don't know what \nthey are buying, choice can lead to confusion. That is particularly \ntrue of health care.\n  Ask elderly Americans whether they prefer a four-speed automatic or a \nfive-speed manual, and they will probably choose the automatic. Ask \nthem whether they prefer a drug plan with a four-tiered formulary to a \nplan with five, and they will probably look at you with a mixture of \nconfusion and anger.\n  My second concern relates to the warnings that CMS ignored. Last \nyear, I asked the independent Government Accountability Office to \nreport on CMS's plans for seniors eligible for both Medicaid and \nMedicare. I asked: What were CMS's plans for seniors whose drug \ncoverage was moving from Medicaid to Medicare? In December 2005, GAO \nreported that CMS's plans were insufficient to avoid big disruptions in \ncoverage.\n  CMS disagreed. CMS said: ``[We have] worked diligently on the \ntransition from Medicaid to Medicare drug coverage . . . and . . . \nthese individuals will get effective, comprehensive prescription drug \ncoverage . . . on January 1, 2006.''\n  That did not happen. GAO was right. Data systems failed. Pharmacists \nand States were stuck with the bill for co-pays that should never have \nbeen charged. And some vulnerable seniors left the pharmacy without the \nmedicines that they needed.\n  Today the Finance Committee heard from Tobey Schule, an independent \npharmacist from Kalispell, MT. Mr. Schule is one of thousands of \npharmacists who have been burdened with the failed transition from \nMedicaid to Medicare. I will ask that his testimony from today's \nhearing be submitted in the Congressional Record, next to my remarks.\n  Last month, Secretary Leavitt and Doctor McClellan briefed members of \nthis committee on problems implementing the new drug program. They \noutlined seven specific problems. And they outlined plans to fix them. \nI appreciate CMS's attempts to fix the problems. But some problems \nremain unsolved. Dr. McClellan, I look forward to hearing how and when \nCMS plans to fix the problems.\n  In addition to ensuring that the implementation flaws are fixed, \nCongress should also address the problem of confusion. We can do that \nby learning the lessons of Medigap. In 1980, Congress enacted \namendments that I offered to fix marketing abuses and consumer \nconfusion with Medigap. The reforms\n\n[[Page S858]]\n\nrequired Medigap issuers to meet minimum standards and have minimum \nloss ratios.\n  Ten years later, Congress again took up Medigap reform, passing \nlegislation to standardize Medigap policies. Ten different Medigap \noptions would be offered, each with a basic set of benefits. This gave \nconsumers an apples-to-apples comparison of Medigap coverage.\n  We should do the same with the new drug program. We should \nstandardize the drug plans. We should make it easier for people to make \ngood choices about which plan is best for them. I intend to introduce \nlegislation to do just that.\n  I understand that the drug benefit is young. But I want this benefit \nto work. We simply cannot afford another round of confusion. We need \nbroad participation. And that's not going to happen unless we make the \nprogram more accessible and understandable. I supported enactment of \nthe Medicare drug benefit in 2003. I still support it. Health insurance \nneeds to cover prescription drugs. But we need to make it work. And I \nlook forward to hearing from our witnesses on how we can do so.\n  I thank Mr. Schule for taking time from his important work to tell \nthe committee about his experiences with the new Medicare drug benefit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Schule's testimony be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Chairman Grassley, Senator Baucus, members of the \n     Committee, I appreciate the privilege and opportunity to \n     speak about Medicare Part D and how it is affecting my \n     patients and pharmacy.\n       I am the co-owner of a small independent pharmacy in \n     Kalispell, Montana that was established in 1981. There are \n     about 32,000 people in Kalispell and the surrounding areas; \n     we are 200 miles from the state capitol in Helena. Our \n     pharmacy employs two pharmacists, my son and me, and two \n     pharmacy technicians. There are five senior apartment \n     buildings within three blocks of the pharmacy, and we serve \n     primarily geriatric patients. In addition, we provide weekly \n     medication box exchange for three assisted living facilities \n     and the mental health center in our community. About ninety \n     percent of our walk-in patients are elderly.\n       Medicare Part D has become a major factor in my pharmacy. I \n     contracted with every company offering drug plans in Montana, \n     so I could continue to serve my patients. I would like to \n     address my concerns with this new benefit, in the following \n     four areas: confusion among patients and pharmacists, \n     education and outreach, coverage of dual-eligibles, and \n     burden on pharmacists.\n       The implementation of Part D has caused confusion and \n     frustration for my patients. And it has caused confusion and \n     frustration for me. This program doesn't need to be so \n     complicated.\n       The frustration and confusion for my patients began last \n     summer, when they started receiving information from \n     insurance companies offering Medicare Part D coverage. With \n     over 40 plans to choose from in Montana, my patients said \n     they were scared and intimidated by all of the options. Many \n     of my patients were not fortunate enough to have a family \n     member help them through the process of deciding which plan \n     was best for them. I work with the elderly every day, and \n     this has been overwhelming for them. Bewildered by the \n     complexity, some patients are choosing not to enroll.\n       Those patients who could make sense of the Medicare \n     mailings faced new obstacles. They were instructed to check \n     the internet to see if the coverage was appropriate for their \n     individual situation. I question this approach, since the \n     vast majority of my elderly patients do not have computers \n     and cannot use the internet. Access to the information \n     through the 1-800 Medicare number was not much better. The \n     phone systems are automated, and many of my elderly patients \n     are unable to navigate through them. Others had the ability \n     to use the phone system but gave up because of long hold \n     times.\n       Despite this enormous confusion, there were few \n     opportunities for Kalispell patients and pharmacists to get \n     answers. Several meetings were sponsored by the state of \n     Montana, by insurance companies and by senior citizen \n     advocates to help the elderly make their choices and explain \n     Medicare Part D. After attending these sessions, many \n     patients came back to my pharmacy saying they were even more \n     confused. Patients received different answers from different \n     people. They had trouble understanding the literature that \n     they received, and felt a lawyer was necessary to make heads \n     or tails out of it.\n       On top of this complexity, elderly patients feared they \n     would select the wrong plan. At educational events, patients \n     were instructed to focus on the formularies and pick one that \n     had their medications on the list. But patients found only \n     some of their drugs listed on formularies, requiring patients \n     to choose between medications.\n       Education for pharmacists wasn't much better. I heard of \n     only one event sponsored by CMS to educate pharmacists, and \n     that was in Billings, nearly 500 miles from my store. I could \n     not attend this meeting, although I did send a pharmacy \n     technician to a local educational event sponsored by an \n     insurance counselor. This seminar did not help us serve our \n     patients enrolling in Part D. But it did help us understand \n     why our patients were so frustrated.\n       With little information coming from CMS or the insurance \n     plans, I relied on my drug wholesaler to learn how to handle \n     patient in Part D. For instance, in mid-December I called my \n     software vendor to ask how I would determine patients' Part D \n     drug coverage. It was only through this call that I learned \n     about the E-1 transaction, which shows patient plan \n     eligibility. I now use this system many times a day when \n     trying to figure out a patient's coverage, but I had to learn \n     about it on my own.\n       Over the last few weeks, drug plans have been my only \n     source of information describing the administrative \n     procedures that I must follow to provide drugs and submit \n     claims. But this information is often incomplete. I recently \n     received a notice that patients enrolling in Part D in late \n     January wouldn't be in the system on February 1st. So the \n     problems we heard about at the beginning of January are \n     happening again.\n       Many of my patients have both Medicaid and Medicare. These \n     ``dual-eligibles'' were automatically enrolled into the new \n     drug plans as their drug coverage was shifted from Medicaid \n     to Medicare. Unfortunately, these plans did not always meet \n     patients' medical needs. I found many patients' medications \n     were not covered by their plans.\n       Further complicating matters, information systems did not \n     recognize these patients as dually-eligible. They could not \n     afford the high co-pays that the system said they should be \n     charged. I handled each patient on a case-by-case basis, and \n     it required a huge time commitment to sort out problems in \n     drug plan data and information systems. Fortunately, we are a \n     small pharmacy and we know all of our patients. So we were \n     able to give them their medications on the spot. I cannot \n     help but think of how many patients across the country must \n     have gone without their medications. Now we are working \n     through billing issues, trying to determine how we will be \n     reimbursed.\n       I am very concerned for my patients because we are being \n     forced to change their medications to match the formulary for \n     their plan. By changing medication, I expect to see increases \n     in physician visits, labs, and hospitalizations. This will \n     increase costs to the program. Medicare should have a plan to \n     track the costs associated with medication changes.\n       Some of the plans are offering the mail-order pharmacy, and \n     I do not think that mail-order should even be an option for \n     Medicare Part D. If patients are getting some medications \n     from mail-order and others from local pharmacies there is no \n     continuity of care. This lack of coordination between mail-\n     order and bricks-and-mortar pharmacies increases the \n     likelihood of adverse events and noncompliance. If a patient \n     using mail-order pharmacy is hospitalized, it is very \n     difficult for doctors at the hospital to get drug information \n     when prescriptions are not filled locally. If patients need \n     drug information about a medication and are using mail order, \n     they must attempt to use automated phone systems. In \n     contrast, local pharmacists are readily available to answer \n     questions. The ordering process of mail-order is also \n     difficult for the elderly. These patients have trouble \n     remembering to order a medication before they run out, but if \n     they order too soon the script will not be processed.\n       As a pharmacist I want to know how certain medications were \n     picked for the formularies. An example is why is one plan \n     using Zocor and another is using Lipitor. I would like to \n     know why some formularies use a branded drug when a generic \n     is available. This appears costly to the program.\n       As the program began on January 1st, it became apparent \n     that the insurance companies were not prepared for the start. \n     Patients had not received their cards or enrollment letters. \n     When this documentation had been received, the information \n     was often incomplete. Missing data included BIN numbers, \n     group numbers, ID numbers and processor control numbers. When \n     I tried to access through the E-1 system, patients would come \n     back as not enrolled. I was not able to bill the appropriate \n     plan.\n       We have spent a tremendous amount of time on the phones \n     with the different companies getting patient billing \n     information or prior authorization to fill. We have been on \n     hold to talk to a representative for as long as four hours \n     before we were able to get through. In other cases, we were \n     simply disconnected after hours on the phone. This is \n     unacceptable.\n       Drug plans are sending out lists of the pharmacies \n     associated with their plan. While I have contracted with \n     every plan offered in Montana, my pharmacy is not on every \n     company's list. As a result, several of my patients have come \n     in very upset because they think they will have to change \n     pharmacies. I tell my patients that I can fill for them even \n     though I am not on the list. Insurance companies should not \n     send only a partial list of in-network pharmacies. It should \n     be all or nothing. Also, I think that it is totally \n     unacceptable for the drug plans to co-brand patient insurance \n     cards with Wal-Mart, Walgreens, or other chain drug stores. \n     It is\n\n[[Page S859]]\n\n     confusing to the patient, leading them to think that they can \n     only go to those pharmacies.\n       The insurance companies have created problems on the \n     business side of my practice. There is no ``negotiation'' \n     between pharmacists and drug plans on reimbursement rates. If \n     I am going to continue serving my patients, I am forced to \n     accept the low rates offered by insurance companies. Plans \n     are slow to pay claims, and my drug wholesaler requires that \n     I pay for drugs much more quickly than the plans pay me. My \n     pharmacy has over $45,000 in unpaid claims from Medicare Part \n     D.\n       Pharmacist and pharmacy technician salaries are climbing \n     because of the shortage of available personnel. I am not sure \n     how long independent pharmacies will be able to stay in \n     business with the low reimbursement rates.\n       I wish that before this program started on January 1st that \n     Medicare and the insurance companies would have taken the \n     time to truly consider the elderly. If the people setting up \n     the program had thought about the needs of their own elderly \n     parents, I am sure this plan would be different.\n       Chairman Grassley, Senator Baucus and Members of the \n     Committee, thank you again for inviting me to appear before \n     you here today. I will now answer any questions you may have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/08/senate-section/article/S859-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        RECOGNITION OF THE CALIFORNIA TEAMSTERS HISPANIC CAUCUS\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of \nCoretta Scott King, who peacefully left this world on Monday, January \n30, 2006, at the age of 78.\n  Coretta Scott King was born on April 27, 1927, in Marion, AL, during \na time of great social injustice. Despite the many barriers that \nsociety had placed in front of her, she refused to let hate and \nprejudice stand in the way of her dreams. She was valedictorian of her \ngraduating class at Lincoln High School and went on to receive a B.A. \nin music and education from Antioch College in Yellow Springs, OH. She \nalso earned a degree in voice and violin at Boston University's New \nEngland Conservatory of Music. It was during this time that she met \nMartin Luther King, Jr., who was then studying for his doctorate in \nsystematic theology at Boston University. They married on June 18, \n1953, and began their lives together in Montgomery, AL.\n  As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., began his civil rights work, Mrs. \nKing worked closely with him by organizing marches and arranging sit-\nins at segregated restaurants to draw attention to the unfairness of \nJim Crow laws. She also played a central role behind the scenes of many \nof the major civil rights campaigns of the 1950s and 1960s. She was by \nher husband's side when he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 and \nwalked by his side during the infamous march from Selma to Montgomery \nin 1965 that eventually led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act. \nMrs. King also performed in ``Freedom Concerts'' where she would sing \nsongs and read poetry to help raise money for the Southern Christian \nLeadership Conference, the organization that Dr. King led during the \ncivil rights movement.\n  Following her husband's death on April 4, 1968, Mrs. King \ndemonstrated remarkable strength and courage by continuing the struggle \nto bring equality to all Americans. She established the Atlanta-based \nMartin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change as a living \nmemorial to her husband and his dream of social equality. During the \n1980s, Mrs. King participated in a series of sit-in protests to \nhighlight the inequality of South Africa's racial policies.\n  Mrs. King also led the campaign to establish Dr. King's birthday as a \nnational holiday. In 1983, Congress instituted the Martin Luther King, \nJr. Federal Holiday Commission, which she chaired during its duration. \nAnd on January 20, 1986, the Nation celebrated the first Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. Federal holiday.\n  Mrs. King has received honorary doctorates from more than 60 colleges \nand universities, has authored three books and has served on, and \nhelped found, dozens of organizations including the Black Leadership \nForum, the National Black Coalition for Voter Participation, and the \nBlack Leadership Roundtable.\n  I rise today to celebrate the life and accomplishments of Mrs. \nCoretta Scott King. As wife, mother, social activist, musician, and \nauthor, she used her words and actions to spread the message of racial \nequality and justice throughout the world. I hope that her vision, as \nwell as the vision of her late husband, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., \nwill continue to live on in all of us through our work and our \ndeeds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/08/senate-section/article/S859-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S859-S860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       A TRIBUTE TO GEORGE WEEKS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for the past 22 years, George Weeks' \ncolumn for the Detroit News has been required reading for anyone \ninterested in Michigan politics. It has been the gold standard for \nfair, insightful commentary, and I am proud to have known and worked \nwith George over these years. Our mornings--and our public life--won't \nbe the same without him.\n  George Weeks' life and career have been spent in service to the \npeople of Michigan. In a journalism career that took him to Lansing, \nMI; to Washington, DC; and around the world, George Weeks always put \nhis responsibility to his readers first. And although we are honoring \nhim today for his legendary accomplishments as a reporter and \ncolumnist, George also served his State as chief of staff to Governor \nWilliam Milliken and his country in the U.S. Army.\n  In his work as a political columnist, it has seemed at times that \nGeorge knows everything that is happening or has ever happened in \nMichigan. He reports on which candidate wowed the crowd--or otherwise--\nat a recent dinner, what issues are resonating with voters, and who he \nthinks has the right stuff to go all the way--or the other kind of \nstuff. His column is a treasure trove of political information. And not \nonly does he have great information, he is also able to put it into \nperspective. George has a deep knowledge of history. He has written a \nhistory of Michigan through the lens of its governors as well as \nseveral works on Michigan's Native Americans. Although I admire his \ntrove of knowledge, I do wish he would quit reminding me--and his \nreaders--of how many years I have served in the Senate, a metaphor for \nthe aging process.\n  George has earned both the loyalty of his readers and the respect and \nadmiration of those he covers. His approach is impartial, issue-\noriented, and assumes good faith on the part of public figures. He \nstarts from a belief that public officials of both parties are \nmotivated\n\n[[Page S860]]\n\nmostly by good intentions, not petty politics. He takes the view that \npoliticians are like other people--no better and no worse--and that \npublic service is a worthy calling. We in public life are grateful for \nthat, believe me.\n  It is a great loss that George is retiring from the News because we \nneed that attitude now more than ever. In recent years, there has been \na coarsening of political life. These are meaner streets these days, \nwith more personal attacks and sharp edges. With his civility and his \nmoderation, George has been in the vanguard of smoothing out those \nrough edges.\n  In his farewell column, George referred to me as his ``most-\ninterviewed Senator.'' That is a distinction I will wear with honor, \nand I want to thank him for the professional way he has treated our \nconversations. George is a man of his word, whom you can talk to with \nconfidence that he will get the story straight and whom you can talk to \nin confidence from time to time as well. I don't know if George is \ncounting in his tally our informal chats, including annually at the \nCherry Festival in his beloved Traverse City. But I do know that I have \ncome to look forward to those talks, and I still will.\n  Thank you, George Weeks, for your years of service and for your \nmagnificent, ongoing career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/08/senate-section/article/S860-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S860-S861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION\n\n\n            loring community school, minneapolis, minnesota\n\n Mr. DAYTON.

Also, notwithstanding the Linas-Marcoussis \nAgreement signed by the Ivorian political forces on January 24, 2003, \nthe related ceasefire agreement of May 3, 2003, the Accra III Agreement \nof July 30, 2004, the Pretoria Agreement of April 6, 2005, and the \nDeclaration on the Implementation of the Pretoria Agreement of June 29, \n2005, consolidating the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis peace \nand national reconciliation process, Ivorian parties have continued to \nengage in military operations and attacks against peacekeeping forces \nin Cote d'Ivoire leading to fatalities.\n  Pursuant to the IEEPA and the NEA, I have determined that these \nactions and circumstances constitute an unusual and extraordinary \nthreat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States \nand declared a national emergency to deal with that threat and have \nissued an Executive Order to deal with the threat to U.S. national \nsecurity and foreign policy posed by the situation in or in relation to \nCote d'Ivoire.\n  The order blocks the property and interests in property in the United \nStates, or in the possession or control of United States persons, of \nthe persons listed in the Annex to the order, as well as of any person \ndetermined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with \nthe Secretary of State, to constitute a threat to the peace and \nnational reconciliation process in Cote d'Ivoire, such as by blocking \nthe implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis, Accra III, and Pretoria \nAgreements; to be responsible for serious violations of international \nlaw in Cote d'Ivoire; to have directly or indirectly supplied, sold or \ntransferred to Cote d'Ivoire arms or any related materiel or any \nassistance, advice, or training related to military activities; or to \nhave publicly incited violence and hatred contributing to the conflict \nin Cote d'Ivoire.\n\n  The designation criteria will be applied in accordance with \napplicable domestic law, including where appropriate, the First \nAmendment to the United States Constitution.\n  The order also authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, after \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to designate for blocking any \nperson determined to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided \nfinancial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services \nin support of, the activities listed above or any person listed in or \ndesignated pursuant to the order. I further authorized the Secretary of \nthe Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State, to \ndesignate for blocking any person determined to be owned or controlled \nby, or acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or \nindirectly, any person listed in or designated pursuant to the order. \nThe Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of \nState, is also authorized to remove any persons from the Annex to the \norder as circumstances warrant.\n  I delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with \nthe Secretary of State, the authority to take such actions, including \nthe promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers \ngranted to the President by the IEEPA and the United Nations \nParticipation Act, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the \norder. All executive agencies are directed to take all appropriate \nmeasures within their authority to carry out the provisions of the \norder.\n  The order, a copy of which is enclosed, became effective at 12:01 \na.m. eastern standard time on February 8, 2006.\n                                                      George W.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nalong with Senators Collins, Dorgan, Snowe, Bingaman, Chafee, Clinton, \nSchumer, Murray and Boxer to ensure that when a senior signs up for a \nMedicare prescription drug plan, the drugs covered by their plan cannot \nbe removed or changed throughout that year.\n  Under the legislation, if you sign up for a plan in January, the \ndrugs covered by your plan will continue to be covered the rest of that \nyear.\n  If you become eligible for Medicare during the year, for instance you \nturn 65 in May, and you sign up for a plan, the drugs covered by your \nplan when you enroll in it will continue to be covered the rest of that \nyear.\n  At the end of the year, if a plan wants to change its coverage, it \ncan do that. The bill does nothing to prevent plans from changing their \ndrug coverage for the coming year. However, that can only happen at the \nend of the year, at the time all Medicare beneficiaries have the option \nto switch plans.\n  Seniors deserve the peace of mind to know that the drug plan they \nenroll in will cover the drugs it says it will all year.\n  Under current law, a prescription drug plan can change its formulary \nas many times as it wants throughout the year so long as it gives \nnotice to its enrollees.\n  However, seniors have no recourse other than going through a lengthy \nappeals process if their drug plan suddenly drops their medicines. At \nthe end of that appeals process, there is still no guarantee that \nseniors will get their drugs.\n\n[[Page S866]]\n\n  Under current law, they have to wait until the next open enrollment \nperiod which may be as much as nine months away. That is unacceptable.\n  Seniors can't and shouldn't have to wait all year to obtain \nlifesaving and life sustaining drugs they thought would be covered by \ntheir drug plan.\n  The bill allows a prescription drug plan to add drugs to its \nformulary--for instance in cases where a new drug is approved by the \nFDA or a generic alternative to a brand name drug becomes available.\n  The bill also allows a prescription drug plan to remove a drug from \nits formulary if the FDA issues a clinical warning about the drug, if \nthe FDA pulls a drug from the market like in the case of Vioxx, or if \nthe drug has been determined to be ineffective.\n  But, in those instances, the prescription drug plan must notify the \nHHS Secretary, affected enrollees, physicians, and pharmacies of the \nchange.\n  Seniors in California have an overwhelming array of prescription drug \nplan options. There are at least 110 drug plan options for \nCalifornians.\n  It can take days, if not weeks to determine which plan is best based \non your drug needs and health status.\n  Unless this bill is approved, seniors have no guarantee that their \ndrugs will be covered throughout the year.\n  I think that is wrong. This legislation will change that.\n  Some might argue why this bill is necessary now. We are one month \ninto the new Medicare drug benefit and what we have witnessed \nthroughout the Nation is widespread confusion. Seniors are being turned \naway at the pharmacy counters and they are being incorrectly asked to \npay hundreds of dollars for their drugs.\n  States are absorbing the costs to provide drugs for a Federal \nprogram. So far, California has spent more than $18 million of its own \nmoney. I support efforts to reimburse States fully for the drug costs \nthey've absorbed as a result of implementation errors by this \nAdministration and I support transitional relief for the so-called \n``dual eligible'' Medicare beneficiaries whose transition from Medicaid \nto Medicare has been disastrous.\n  The Administration contends that this legislation isn't necessary \nbecause plans can't change their formularies without notifying the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and enrollees first \nand that CMS won't allow plans to make changes to their formularies \nthat hurt seniors.\n  This ``just trust us'' argument being used by the Administration is \nanything but reassuring, especially given all the major program \nimplementation problems it has caused due to poor planning and \ninadequate foresight.\n  I believe seniors deserve more and they deserve the protections \nguaranteed under this legislation.\n  We must act now to protect all Medicare beneficiaries from the type \nof ``bait and switch'' tactics like signing up for a plan thinking you \nwere getting certain drugs only to find out down the road that those \ndrugs were no longer covered.\n  The bill is about parity for seniors. If seniors are prohibited from \nchanging drug plans except during the annual open enrollment period, \nthen they deserve to know that the plan they are locked in to is also \nlocked in to covering the drugs it said it would.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Feinstein, \nCollins and a number of my other colleagues to introduce the Medicare \nDrug Formulary Protection Act of 2006. This legislation will improve \nthe new Medicare prescription drug benefit by preventing prescription \ndrug plans from unexpectedly dropping coverage of prescription drugs \nthat were covered when seniors enrolled in the plan.\n  Although seniors enrolled in the new Medicare drug program are only \nable to change their health plans once a year, nothing prevents \ninsurers from dropping drugs from their plans on a whim. Under current \nlaw, prescription drug plans can change which drugs they cover as long \nas they provide 60 days notice to their enrollees.\n  It is difficult enough for seniors to navigate the confusion and \ncomplexity the Administration has built into the Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit. They ought to be able to do so secure in the knowledge \nthat once they have picked a plan, the plan will not change on them \nmidstream. Seniors need the protection and certainty this legislation \nextends to them.\n  I had some hopes for this new Medicare plan, but it has become a \ncomplete and utter mess. In North Dakota, we have 41 different plans \nbeing offered by 17 different companies, and we have the highest \npercentage of senior citizens in the nation with no prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  In North Dakota, 68 percent of seniors still do not have prescription \ndrug coverage. With the sign-up period nearly one-third over, only \n9,000 seniors in North Dakota have voluntarily signed up for the \nprogram. More than 70,000 seniors still lack coverage.\n  Other States in the northern Great Plains region are not far behind. \nFully 67 percent of South Dakota seniors have no prescription drug \ncoverage and in Montana 65 percent lack coverage. Wyoming also ranks \nhigh, with 61 percent of its seniors without prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  I have asked Secretary Leavitt to dispatch a survey team to North \nDakota and neighboring States to determine why enrollment rates in the \nnew Medicare prescription drug program are among the lowest in the \nnation in our region of the country.\n  In the meantime, we need to enact the Medicare Drug Formulary \nProtection Act and other commonsense reforms like the Medicare Informed \nChoice Act and the Medicare State Recovery Act.\n  The Medicare Informed Choice Act would extend the enrollment deadline \nuntil December 31, 2006. We need to enact this legislation right away. \nSeniors need more time to evaluate their options. Extending the \nenrollment deadline will also give Congress time to address some of the \nproblems that have kept more seniors from enrolling in the benefit.\n  The Medicare State Recovery Act will ensure States are reimbursed for \nthe cost of prescriptions for low-income seniors and people with \ndisabilities who were improperly denied coverage under Medicare.\n  I want this new benefit to work. That is why I urge my colleagues to \nsupport these efforts to improve the benefit and make it less confusing \nfor seniors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 2256. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to ensure the \navailability to all Americans of high-quality, advanced \ntelecommunications and broadband services, technologies, and networks \nat just, reasonable, and affordable rates, and to establish a permanent \nmechanism to guarantee specific, sufficient, and predictable support \nfor the preservation and advancement of universal service, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this is a special day to those of us who \nserve on the Commerce Committee and have served on the Commerce \nCommittee ever since we have been in the Senate because today is the \n10th anniversary of the Telecom Act of 1996. I want to talk about a \nbill I am introducing today as the Internet and Universal Service Act \nof 1996, or the NetUSA, if you will.\n  When I first came here and went to work, I was very much interested \nin telecommunications. The big reason is in my State of Montana we have \nonly 900,000 people but we have 148,000 square miles. I remind my \ncolleagues, if you drew a straight line from Yaak, MT, to Alzada, MT, \nit is farther than it is from Chicago to Washington, DC.\n  So we went to work in telecommunications for the simple reason we had \nto do something about distances, and we did. But it took almost 6 or 7 \nyears before we came up with a bill that overhauled the old Telco Act \nof 1935. What we were trying to do is deal with the 1990s technology \nwith a 1930 law and we found it almost impossible to do, so the whole \nact had to be rewritten.\n  Since the Telecom Act, the only thing that is certain is change. With \nchange, several trends have emerged, including the development of new \ntechnologies, industry consolidation and convergence, and product \nbundling.\n  The pace of technological change has been astounding. We have a \nplethora of new technologies including WiFi and WiMAX, and all new \nwords in telecommunications--wireless Internet access, voice over \nInternet protocol, which we refer to now as VOIP, the\n\n[[Page S867]]\n\ntelephone service using the Internet and broadband over powerline--\nBPL--for Internet access via electrical lines.\n\n  While the Telecom Act promised industry and technology convergence, \nonly recently is it materializing--with telephone, cable, and wireless \ncompanies invading one another's turf. Cable companies are offering \ntelevision service over the Internet, telephone companies are offering \nvideo services over their facilities. New technologies have brought \nconsumers a variety of choices for local, long distance, video, \nwireless, and Internet services, and many companies are offering \nbundled services.\n  The radical transformation of the industry has led some to call for a \ncomplete rewrite to the Telecom Act. Central issues in the debate today \nare the reform of the Universal Service Fund--the USF, reform of \nintercarrier compensation, franchising issues for video providers, and \nnet neutrality are some among a whole host of other challenges.\n  As Congress begins working to rewrite the telecom laws, my central \nfocus will be encouraging broadband deployment in every corner of the \nU.S. and preserving and improving universal service. Broadband \ndeployment is more vital now than ever before, and it is a key to our \nfuture. In the 21st century, how do we compete against workers who work \nin economies of scale and their salaries are a little bit less than \nours? We ensure that U.S. workers can obtain broadband services at \naffordable prices no matter where they live in this great country.\n  The GAO recently agreed, recommending the Government make more \nbroadband infrastructure investments to improve the U.S. workforce's \nhuman capital and skill level. I think the President talked much about \nthis in his State of the Union.\n  Technology provides a greater chance to live where you want and hold \na good job. If a community does not have broadband, it is at a huge \ncompetitive disadvantage. It is just that simple.\n  Even though the technologies were developed in the United States, we \nstill lag behind other countries in the deployment of broadband. We \nneed to provide incentives for companies to continue to expand their \nbroadband facilities and to ensure all Americans have access to the \nInternet, regardless of where they live--particularly since, although \nInternet penetration has grown in rural communities, a gap still exists \nbetween them and the suburban and urban communities.\n  One way I will provide such incentive is to continue my support of \nuniversal service, although it may take a little bit different \ndirection in the distribution. The nearly 100-year commitment Congress \nand this Nation have had to USF has been indispensable in providing the \nsame opportunities for rural America to participate in the Nation's \neducation and health care systems that exist for Americans in urban \nareas, and for every American to participate fully in the Internet \neconomy.\n  Just as rural electrification in the 1930s led to the surge in \neconomic growth and raised the living standards across rural America, \nuniversal service plays the same role in the Internet era. We didn't \nget electricity on my farm until early in the 1950s. I can remember \nwhen you used to go to town and that electricity seemed like a pretty \nspecial thing. Had not the Government created the REC, or the rural \nelectrics, I contend that out on the farm we would still be watching \ntelevision by candlelight.\n\n  Without universal service support, phone bills in rural areas across \nthe country, such as Montana, would increase dramatically. Universal \nservice also helps to ensure that schools and libraries receive access \nto the Internet at rates they can afford. Because of universal service, \nthe Internet now reaches almost all school-age children, no matter \nwhere they live. Universal service helped link rural health facilities \nto urban medical centers, promoting telemedicine. My State of Montana \nis on the cutting edge of that. Many people in remote communities would \nnot have access to health care just using the Internet. The all-\nimportant issue in Montana is where these counties do not even have a \ndoctor. I have 13 counties that have no physician.\n  For those who say universal service no longer makes sense, or that it \nshould be repealed or scaled back, I encourage them to visit my State \nand see the fund in action. As one official from a carrier serving a \nremote corner of Alaska recently commented, universal service is ``more \nthan a line item on a bill. . . . [It] provides a link to the outside \nworld.''\n  That is not to say that changes do not need to be made in universal \nservice. They do need to be made. It is a different world. Technologies \nare different and we must respond. As the length of time that new \ntechnologies emerge shortens, we must be able to deal with them. As \nconsumers switch to new technologies such as wireless service, e-mail, \nvoice over IP, universal service is slowly taking in less money every \nyear. Therein lies the problem.\n  At the same time, the amount of money we disburse is increasing. This \nsituation is obviously not sustainable, nor is it acceptable to \nCongress.\n  Additionally, we need to ensure the universal service is distributed \nwhere it is needed. The Senator from Alabama understands universal \nservice and the impact it has on rural Alabama. In revising universal \nservice to adapt to the changing technology landscape, it is essential \nto maintain the commitment levels to universal service programs to \nfoster the continued availability of telecom and advanced services in \nrural communities, and to strengthen and improve the overall fund.\n  My proposed legislation will speed up deployment of broadband in \nrural areas and preserve and improve universal service.\n  Some things my bill seeks to do are to ensure that companies that \nreceive universal service funds will invest in deployed broadband \nservices; to ensure that universal service support contributions are \nassessed in a fair and competitively neutral manner; ensuring the \nintegrity of the Schools and Libraries Program to deter waste, fraud, \nand abuse by strengthening the FCC's management and oversight, \nincluding imposing sanctions on applicants or vendors who repeatedly \nand knowingly violate the rules. That is what my bill does, in part. \nLastly, improving the effectiveness of rural health care programs. It \nis unbelievable what we can do for rural health care when we can move \nmassive amounts of information.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to craft creative \nsolutions to these issues that are so vital to our Nation's future. It \nis the 10th anniversary. It took us almost 50 years--in fact, a little \nover 50 years, to change the act in 1996. This time, we had to act a \nlittle bit quicker because emerging technologies wait for no man. They \nare there, they are being used, and we must deal with them as they \nemerge.\n  I thank the Senator from Alabama for allowing me this little time and \nI look forward to working with my colleagues on the passage of the \nuniversal bill in this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. \n        Kerry):\n  S. 2257. A bill to provide for an enhanced refundable credit for \nfamilies who resided in the Hurricane Katrina disaster area on August \n28, 2005; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Hurricane \nKatrina Working Family Tax Relief Act of 2006. I am proud to introduce \nthis bill, along with Senators Landrieu, Durbin, and Kerry, to keep a \npromise the President made to rebuild the Gulf Coast in the wake of \nHurricane Katrina. Last week the Senate approved a $70 billion bill \nladen with tax cuts for the wealthy and well-connected. This bill, \nwhich costs less than 1 percent as much, uses a proven tool in our tax \ncode--the child tax credit--to extend aid to low-income working \nfamilies affected by Hurricane Katrina.\n  Currently, the child credit allows families with qualifying children \nto receive a credit of $1,000 per child against their Federal income \ntax. Unfortunately, families that earn less than $11,000 get no benefit \nfrom the refundable child credit. That means that a child is left out \nof the credit even if her parent works full time at minimum wage, which \nhas not increased since 1997. And the child doesn't get the full \nbenefit of the $1,000 credit until her parent earns close to $18,000, \nor even more if the child has siblings. And if her parents' income does \nnot keep up with inflation, for any reason, the\n\n[[Page S868]]\n\nvalue of the credit drops or even disappears.\n  We all know of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina. It will \nbe a long time before families on the Gulf Coast can rebuild their \nlives. Many of them have seen their homes destroyed, their jobs \neliminated, their families separated, and their lives irrevocably \nchanged. Unfortunately, the Federal response so far has been inadequate \nto get these families effectively back on their feet. We are now \nlearning of thousands of evacuees getting kicked out of their hotel \nrooms because FEMA has stopped paying the bills.\n  We can do better for these families. Life was hard for many of them \neven before Katrina hit. Prior to the hurricane, there were over 2 \nmillion people living below poverty in the affected States. In some of \nthe affected counties and parishes, more than 1 in 4 children lived \nbelow the poverty level.\n  In Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, for example, more than \n900,000 children under 17-years-old were so poor that they got no child \ntax credit or only a partial credit. These States had among the highest \nrates in the Nation of children too poor to get the full credit.\n  This bill will provide necessary assistance to many of these \nfamilies. The bill eliminates the income threshold that excluded all \nchildren in families with less than $11,000 of income. With this bill, \nthe children of low-income working parents affected by Hurricane \nKatrina will no longer be denied the child credit.\n  It's simple: if you work, your kids get a benefit. This bill provides \na partial credit starting with the first dollar of a parent's income \nfor families who lived in the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina. You \nwork, your kids get a benefit. If you don't work, no benefit.\n  That's a commonsense way to support families with children, \nespecially families that have experienced the huge cost--psychological \nand financial--of a natural disaster.\n  This bill is also narrowly tailored and fiscally responsible. It \nprovides short-term support targeted at families affected by the \nhurricane, and its costs can easily be absorbed within the $97 billion \nalready committed to hurricane relief.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, which will enable hundreds \nof thousands of this country's most disadvantaged children to see an \nincrease in their credit. Katrina offered a reminder of poverty in our \nown country. Let's not forget so quickly. We owe it to the American \npeople to do something to provide a chance for our neediest children to \nrebuild their lives with dignity, hope, and opportunity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA:\n  S. 2259. A bill to establish an Office of Public Integrity in the \nCongress and a Congressional Ethics Enforcement Commission; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today, I am introducing new legislation to \nbuild on the excellent work my colleagues began with the Honest \nLeadership and Open Government Act.\n  That bill would close the revolving door between Capitol Hill and \nlobbying jobs. It would end all lobbyist-funded gifts, meals, and \ntravel, and it would shine a bright light of monitoring and public \ndisclosure on lobbyists' operations, secret conference committee \nnegotiations and last-minute special-interest provisions.\n  These are important steps forward that should be approved by this \nCongress and signed into law. The first bill I am introducing now \nbuilds on these steps by focusing on enforcement. We can pass all the \nnew ethics rules in the world, but if we don't establish a body that \ncan monitor and enforce those rules, it'll be easy to break them.\n  My legislation will establish a nonpartisan, independent \nCongressional Ethics Enforcement Commission that would investigate \nethics violations and report their findings to the public.\n  The idea of an independent Commission to conduct initial \ninvestigations is not new. It is modeled on successful efforts in a \nnumber of States including Kentucky, Florida, and Tennessee. Similar \ncommissions in those States have a track record of working well and \nmaking the ethics enforcement process much more effective.\n  My commission would be staffed with former judges and former members \nof Congress, and it would allow any citizen to report a possible ethics \nviolation by lawmakers, staff, or lobbyists. It would have the \nauthority to conduct investigations, issue subpoenas, and provide \npublic reports to the Senate Ethics Committee or Department of Justice \nso that any wrongdoing can be punished accordingly.\n  To prevent this Commission from being manipulated for partisan \npolitical purposes, the bill establishes stiff sanctions for the filing \nof frivolous complaints, and prohibits the filing of complaints three \nmonths before an election.\n  Although, the ultimate power to reprimand members would remain with \nthe Ethics Committees in Congress and the Department of Justice, the \nnew Congressional Ethics Enforcement Commission would make these bodies \nmore effective by removing political pressure from the initial fact-\nfinding phase of ethics investigations. In addition, the Commission's \nindependent capacity to issue public findings would encourage the \nEthics Committees to act.\n  I am proud that this legislation has support across the political \nspectrum, earning the endorsement of both Common Cause and Norm \nOrnstein of the American Enterprise Institute. Ornstein said this about \nmy enforcement bill: ``This approach to ethics enforcement is just the \nkind of balanced and reasonable alternative we need. . . . It deserves \nstrong bipartisan support.''\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to join me in creating this \nCommission to restore credibility to the body on the enforcement of \nethics.\n  I am also introducing legislation to build on the CLEAN UP Act (S. \n2179) that I introduced last month.\n  The CLEAN UP Act was written to provide for greater transparency in \nthe legislative process and in conference committees in particular. It \nhas won the support of eight of my colleagues, and I hope the \nTransparency and Integrity in Earmarks Act that I am introducing today \nwill gain their support, as well as the rest of my colleagues.\n  The Transparency and Integrity in Earmarks Act would require that \ninformation about all earmarks, including the name of the lawmaker \nrequesting it and a justification of why they want it, be disclosed 72 \nhours before they are considered by the full Senate.\n  The bill would also place some common-sense limits on earmarks. \nMembers would be prohibited from advocating for an earmark if they have \na financial interest in the project or its recipient. Earmarks also \ncould not be used to secure promises from lawmakers in exchange for a \nvote on a bill. Finally, earmark recipients would have to disclose the \namount that they spent on lobbyists in order to get their project \npassed. These earmark reforms won't solve every abuse, but the idea is \nthis: if you're proud enough about an earmark to issue a press release \nabout it, then you should be able to defend it to the public.\n  Several of these ideas are contained in a bill introduced by Rep. \nDavid Obey. I am grateful for his leadership on this issue in the \nHouse.\n  I know this is not the only proposal on earmarks before the Senate. \nBut I believe this combines the best ideas without creating procedural \nroadblocks to legitimate projects in our communities.

They are: Tom Anderson, Alva Bennett, Jim \nBennett, Jerry Groves, George Hamner, Jr., Terry Helms, Jesse Jones, \nDavid Lewis, Martin Toler, Jr., Fred Ware, Jackie Weaver, and Marshall \nWinans who perished in the Sago Mine in Upshur County, WV.\n  They are Don Bragg and Ellery Hatfield who perished in the Aracoma \nAlma Mine in Logan County, WV.\n\n[[Page S871]]\n\n  They are Paul Moss and Edmund Vance who perished in separate mines in \nBoone County, WV.\n  While the names of these coal miners have become known to many of us, \nwe must not forget that there are many more coal miners whose tragic \ndeaths are not chronicled in the national media. They die quietly in \ntheir homes of black lung disease. They die anonymously in mine \naccidents across the Nation. Their families mourn, their families \ngrieve their loss without national attention.\n  I pay tribute to all of those who have fallen in our Nation's mines \nand to their families who must bear their loss. A grateful Nation owes \nits eternal thanks.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \nremarks of my distinguished senior senator, Mr. Byrd, and rise to ask \nmy colleagues to take up and adopt our resolution honoring miners in \nWest Virginia and throughout this country who work hard in dangerous \nsituations to provide energy this Nation needs.\n  The attention of the world was focused on small towns in my State of \nWest Virginia in the first two months of 2006. When 12 miners were \nfound to have died in the Sago Mine in Upshur County in early January, \nthe hopes and prayers of a global television audience were dashed along \nwith those living the tragedy in the Sago Baptist Church.\n  Americans and our friends around the world tuned in again when miners \nbecame trapped by a belt fire in the Alma Mine in Logan County later in \nJanuary. I was sitting with the families of the trapped miners when \nthey heard the news we were all dreading. It was a profoundly sad and \nmoving moment, one I will never forget, and an experience which I \ncannot do justice to here.\n  When tragedy struck again at two mines in Boone County it was almost \nmore than any of us could bear. After these accidents, the Governor of \nmy State of West Virginia, Joe Manchin, who has been a stalwart \nthroughout these trying times, called for a temporary stand-down in \nWest Virginia mines to reinforce and reinvigorate mine safety \nprocedures. I was pleased to see that the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration, MSHA, came into West Virginia in numbers to assist \nState officials, and later instituted a 1-hour safety refresher for all \nU.S. mines under its authority. In Pennsylvania, Governor Rendell \nemulated Governor Manchin in calling for renewed safety training for \nmines throughout the Commonwealth.\n  Mining, as we know, is an inherently dangerous profession, but it is \na vital component in our Nation's economy. Without coal from \nAppalachia, the Illinois Basin, the Powder River Basin, and various \nother regions throughout the U.S., our economy shuts down. Coal \nprovides more than half our electricity, and coal conversion \ntechnologies will soon allow America's most abundant mineral resource \nto provide transportation fuels and chemical feedstocks as well. If the \nUnited States of America is ever going to lessen its dependence on \nforeign sources of energy, you can be sure that the miners will lead \nthe way. These are men and women who do a job most Americans understand \nlittle about, and until tragedy periodically reminds the Nation, most \nAmericans probably do not even think about. Coal production is \nincreasing across the country and around the world. Coal is on the \nrise, and safety has to be, too.\n  Mine safety has been very much in the thoughts of every West \nVirginian these first two months of 2006. In 2005, West Virginia lost \nminers also, as did Alabama, Ohio, Wyoming, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky. \nMr. President, 2006 has already seen mine fatalities in Kentucky and \nUtah. As these tragedies show, and as MSHA's nationwide action and \nGovernor Rendell's actions in Pennsylvania suggest, mine safety is a \nnational issue and improving it must be a national priority.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 370) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 370\n\n       Whereas coal generates more than half of domestic \n     electricity, providing millions of Americans with energy for \n     their homes and businesses;\n       Whereas West Virginia is the Nation's second largest coal \n     producing State;\n       Whereas an average of 7,600 pounds of coal per person per \n     year is used in the United States;\n       Whereas the United States has an estimated 275,000,000,000 \n     tons of recoverable coal reserves representing about 95 \n     percent of all fossil fuel reserves in the nation;\n       Whereas coal continues to be the economic engine for many \n     communities;\n       Whereas coal miners are among the most productive of all \n     American workers, producing 7 tons of coal per miner per day, \n     which results in coal consistently being the most cost-\n     effective choice for generating electricity in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas during the last century over 100,000 coal miners \n     have been killed in mining accidents in the Nation's coal \n     mines;\n       Whereas the Nation is greatly indebted to coal miners for \n     the difficult and dangerous work they perform to provide the \n     fuel needed to operate the Nation's industries and to provide \n     energy to homes and businesses;\n       Whereas 13 West Virginia miners were trapped 260 feet below \n     the surface in the Sago mine for over 40 hours following an \n     explosion on January 2, 2006;\n       Whereas Federal, State, and local rescue crews worked \n     relentlessly in an attempt to save the miners;\n       Whereas many residents of Upshur County, West Virginia, and \n     the surrounding areas came together at the Sago Baptist \n     Church to support the miners' families;\n       Whereas 12 miners, Thomas Anderson, Alva Martin Bennett, \n     Jim Bennett, Jerry Groves, George Hamner Jr., Terry Helms, \n     David Lewis, Martin Toler, Fred Ware Jr., Jack Weaver, Jesse \n     Jones, and Marshall Winans, lost their lives on January 3, \n     2006;\n       Whereas only one miner, Randal McCloy, was safely rescued;\n       Whereas 2 West Virginia miners were trapped by a fire in \n     the Aracoma Alma Mine on January 19, 2006;\n       Whereas Don Israel Bragg and Ellery ``Elvis'' Hatfield lost \n     their lives in the Aracoma Alma Mine;\n       Whereas 2 West Virginia miners lost their lives in separate \n     incidents in Boone County on February 1, 2006; and\n       Whereas Edmund Vance perished in the Long Branch No. 18 \n     Mine and Paul Moss perished at the Elk Run Black Castle mine:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes Thomas Anderson, Alva Martin Bennett, Jim \n     Bennett, Jerry Groves, George Hamner Jr., Terry Helms, David \n     Lewis, Martin Toler, Fred Ware Jr., Jack Weaver, Jesse Jones, \n     and Marshall Winans for their sacrifice in the Sago, West \n     Virginia, coal mine;\n       (2) recognizes Don Israel Bragg and Ellery ``Elvis'' \n     Hatfield for their sacrifice in the Aracoma Alma, West \n     Virginia coal mine;\n       (3) extends the deepest condolences of the Nation to the \n     families of these men;\n       (4) recognizes Edmund Vance and Paul Moss for their \n     sacrifice in the Boone County, West Virginia coal mines;\n       (5) recognizes Randal McCloy for his stamina and courage \n     that enabled him to survive in severe conditions for over 40 \n     hours;\n       (6) recognizes the rescue crews for their outstanding \n     effort resulting in the safe rescue of Randal McCloy; and\n       (7) recognizes the many volunteers who provided support for \n     the miners' families during the rescue operations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/08/senate-section/article/S871-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
