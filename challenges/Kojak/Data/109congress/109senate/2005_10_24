Mr. President, today we will immediately resume \nconsideration of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, following \nstatements by myself and the Democratic leader. Amendments may be \noffered during today's session, and we hope Senators will come to the \nfloor and offer their amendments. If Senators are unable to come to the \nfloor, we ask that they notify the two managers or their respective \ncloakrooms of their intention to offer amendments and the specific \nsubject matter. I know the distinguished chairman will have more to say \non this. He has made it clear that at the appropriate time, he will go \nto third reading in order to complete this bill. His statement in \nsaying that and my statement in restating that is that we will finish \nthis bill this week. We absolutely must have people come to the floor \ntoday as soon as possible, instead of doing what has become almost a \ncustom here, wait a few days before making the managers aware of their \namendments.\n  It means that we will be voting, of course, through this week. We \nwill have votes later tonight which I will speak to. As I have said \nbefore, working with the Democratic leader, it is very important that \nwe work Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. We have asked \nall of our colleagues, between now and Thanksgiving, to give us every \nMonday and every Friday instead, as has become the custom, of working \nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday on the floor and not Monday and Friday. We \nwill have to ask everybody's cooperation and participation. The \nchairman will have more to say about that momentarily. We will have one \nvote, probably two votes, possibly three votes, but we will have one or \nmore votes today beginning at 5:30. We hope we can have a vote on the \nLabor-HHS bill, if an amendment is offered and debated this afternoon. \nIn addition, we have three district judges on the Executive Calendar, \nand those may require rollcall votes. Therefore, Senators can expect to \nbegin voting at 5:30 today.\n\n  I remind Senators, we will have a very busy week with this particular \nbill. Senators are asked to report on time when we call a vote. Again, \nthe tendency has been to go beyond 15 minutes and, indeed, beyond 20 \nminutes. Because we have so much to do in such a limited amount of time \nover the next 4 weeks, we will have to tighten that up and ask people \nto be more responsive than in the past.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have kept quiet the last 8 or 9 months on \nthis issue, but I am glad to hear somebody raising the issue of how \nlong these votes take. It is so discourteous, so impolite of Senators \nto have us wait around here for 35, 40 minutes on a vote. It is not \nright. People have other\n\n[[Page S11750]]\n\nthings to do than wait for somebody who is finishing a phone call or \nsome appointment. The only way to do this is to cut off the vote, have \npeople miss votes. If I am late, cut off the vote. Senators come in \nhere ``hang tooth,'' sad that they missed a vote, after we keep the \nvote going for 35 or 40 minutes. I served in the House of \nRepresentatives. We had 15 minutes to vote in the House. It is over \nwith. There are 435 Members over there. They all manage to get over and \nvote on time. I know we have a rollcall, but it is simply unfair to \nthis institution to waste hours every week. My Democratic Senators, if \nthey are late and there is equal pain around here and you cut off your \nRepublicans, I will cut off my Democrats, and I will handle them. I \nwant everyone within the sound of my voice, all the staffs, to hear \nthat it is my understanding, based upon the urging of Senator Specter, \nthat we are going to cut these votes off. I hope that is the case. It \nis a pet peeve I have around here. Where else in the world would you be \nso discourteous as to have people standing around waiting for you to do \nsomething that none of us care about? I don't know what they are doing \nover there. We hear the excuses, the plane has just landed, they are on \ntheir way. They have had too many tardy slips. Let's not accept that \nanymore. I think if we did it once, the second time it would be a lot \neasier. And the third time it would never happen. I hope the \ndistinguished Republican leader will force our Senators to recognize \nthat they have the obligation of voting on time. It is the main reason \nwe are here. If they miss a vote, they miss a vote.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, you have heard it now from the two leaders \nand the chairman and the ranking member. Let's plow ahead, again being \nrespectful of the body itself and the use of time, and keep the bill \nmoving forward and America moving forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/24/senate-section/article/S11750-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DARFUR\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the United States will very soon vote on a \nresolution urging the international community and the Government of \nSudan to end genocide in Darfur. Since March of 2003, more than 181,000 \npeople have died in the Darfur region, Darfur and the country west of \nSudan--Darfur is in the western part of Sudan and the country west of \nthat, Chad, and the neighboring towns in that region. One hundred \neighty-one thousand people have died of violence and disease. They are \ndying of malnutrition. More than 2 million people have been displaced \nfrom their homes, many times without their families, and remain \nscattered in these refugee camps in the Darfur region and in Chad.\n  I have had the opportunity to travel to Sudan many times and to the \nDarfur region, last year to Chad. Along the border, there are a whole \nnumber of refugee camps, each with anywhere from 6,000 to as many as \n12,000 people. When you go into these refugee camps and you sit down on \na little mat with all these little makeshift tents with 8,000 people \nwho have had to leave their homes, you hear the stories of murder, the \nstories of rape from young women. You hear those stories of violence, \nmany with descriptions of the Government of Sudan's jeeps driving \nthrough these villages as they are pushed forward. I have heard the \nstories myself. I have talked to enough people on the ground to know \nthat this is, indeed, genocide and that it is time for us, the \ninternational community, to do something about it.\n  I have said basically that same thing on the floor of the Senate for \nthe last year; many of us have. It is embarrassing to have to come back \nto the floor to say it once again.\n  The Government of Sudan has failed to take credible steps in terms of \nending this genocide. There has been a lot of talk, but we don't see \nany action. It was clear, as I was there, as it is now, that the death \ntoll is going to increase. It is going to increase unless we have \nstronger action, unified action, but not just by the Government of \nSudan, because they are not going to act, but the entire international \ncommunity against Khartoum, where the Government of Sudan is centered. \nPresident Bush and former Secretary of State Colin Powell and the \nSenate have all declared that the Darfur crisis is, in fact, genocide. \nIt was the Senate that officially condemned it as genocide. Once again, \nwe see no real response by the international community.\n  This past Friday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \nwarned that the situation in the Darfur region of the Sudan is getting \nworse. Where is the international community's response?\n  Innocent civilians continue to be targeted by the Sudanese Government \nin Khartoum and its allied Janjaweed militias. The Janjaweed have even \ncaused the United Nations to temporarily suspend some of its relief \nactivities in many areas of Darfur. In the words of the High \nCommissioner, the situation is ``extremely nasty, with ugly events.'' \nLast month, 400 Janjaweed Arab militia on camels and horseback attacked \na refugee camp killing 35 people, wounding 10 others. More than 80 \nhomes were burned to the ground. On October 8, an African Union convoy \nwas ambushed in the southern part of Darfur. Four Nigerian soldiers and \ntwo civilian contractors were killed. The very next day, a group of \nrebels abducted 38 African Union soldiers in the border town of Tine, \nthreatening the African Union to stay out of the territory.\n  Today there are fresh reports of heavy gunfire over the weekend in \nhalf a dozen towns in the region. The African Union forces deployed to \nthe Darfur region have done a professional job and deserve praise for \ntheir determination. But they are up against ruthless opponents who \nattack and maim and kill their opponents. Nearly 200,000 civilians are \ndead, 2 million more displaced and suffering. The violence must stop. \nThose who are responsible for genocide for these war crimes against \nhumanity and these criminal acts must be brought to justice.\n  I urge the United States to renew efforts to implement additional \nsanctions on the Government of Sudan through the United Nations \nSecurity Council. I also support an expansion of the size and mandate \nof the African Union mission in Darfur, and I encourage my colleagues \nto continue to support its efforts.\n  Time is running out. We cannot wait and see. The international \ncommunity must live up to its declared responsibility to protect \ninnocent citizens targeted for genocide. The credibility of the \ninternational community is at stake. Even more important than that are \nthe hundreds of thousands of innocent people whose lives now hang in \nthe balance.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/24/senate-section/article/S11750-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I think most Americans have been to Florida. \nIt is such a pleasant place, and beautiful, with wonderful beaches and \ntremendous weather. But nature has been very unkind to Florida in the \npast few years. There have been numerous storms, devastating storms. \nFlorida is now being buffeted by Wilma. Winds are over 125 miles an \nhour with torrential rains, flooding many parts of Florida. Over 20,000 \npeople have sought safety in shelters. Many have chosen to ride out the \nstorm, and that is unfortunate. According to reports, less than 10 \npercent of the residents of the Florida Keys have evacuated, and it \nappears this may turn out to be the most damaging hurricane to hit this \nregion in more than a decade. This afternoon, Wilma's victims are \ncertainly in our thoughts. The storm is still there.\n  In recent weeks, we have seen how destructive nature can be. The \npeople of Florida know we stand ready to help if, in fact, that is \nnecessary.\n  Victims of Hurricane Wilma join the growing list of the Americans who \nneed our help. While Wilma is upon us--we had Rita before that--we \ncannot forget the people who have suffered such devastating losses from \nthe storm that hit the gulf, Hurricane Katrina. But it is obvious that \nthe majority has forgotten about them.\n  We have had bills agreed upon by the Finance Committee and others--\nbipartisan bills--that we cannot move to the Senate floor. We cannot \nmove them. Now I am told a bill that started out at\n\n[[Page S11751]]\n\n$8 billion to help the people who are in such need of medical care and \nattention, the Medicaid bill, has now shrunk to less than $2 billion. \nIt will be, of course, a Band-Aid. It will give the majority something \nto say: we are trying to help. The fact is, they are not trying to \nhelp.\n  Weeks have gone by, and now Wilma is upon us, and Wilma will likely \ncreate the need for more help for people in Florida, which will push \nKatrina's victims, in the minds of the majority, further off the radar \nscreen.\n  The American people, even before Wilma, were already looking to the \nSenate for help with rising energy prices, and preparedness for future \ndisasters, such as the avian flu. We must add Wilma's victims to this \nlist.\n  It is my hope that the majority in the Senate will join Democrats in \nfocusing on these priorities. These priorities are about doing \nsomething about these staggering energy costs--heating fuel, filling \nthe gas tank--or doing something about being prepared for what we have \nbeen told is going to be a pandemic, the avian flu. We have seen it \nleave the Far East and travel to Europe. And what are we going to do \nabout the Katrina victims?\n  With few weeks remaining in this work period before Thanksgiving, we \nneed to come together and make sure the agenda of the Senate reflects \nthe agenda of the American people. Unfortunately, it does not at the \npresent time.\n  This week, the Senate Budget Committee will mark up the bills they \nget from the various committees and move forward with budget \nreconciliation. This is legislation that cuts health care for the \nneediest of the needy, the Medicaid recipients. It will cut housing. It \nwill cut programs for farmers. It could put at risk the pensions of \nmillions of working Americans. But the majority's mantra is: Rich \npeople of America, we are coming to your rescue; we are going to cut \nyour taxes some more.\n  I am appealing to my colleagues in the majority: Don't do this. \nPostpone this effort. We have very real needs to address in this \ncountry. I repeat, rising energy prices, hurricane victims, and \npreparedness for the avian flu. These issues should be the focus of \nevery Senator, not cutting programs to help those most in need and \nproviding tax breaks for special interests.\n  Democrats voted against this immoral Republican budget once before \nKatrina hit. Now, after all we have been through, I think it is even \nmore of an embarrassment to this institution that we are moving forward \nto cut the poor even more and cut taxes for special interests even \nmore.\n  After a summer of rising energy prices and multiple hurricanes, \nhundreds of thousands of families are struggling to meet basic needs. \nThe cuts in the Republican budget will only make these problems worse. \nOf course, even if Republicans move forward with their plans, Democrats \nwill continue to insist the Senate address the priorities of the \nAmerican people.\n  As we did last week, we will continue to try to bring forward \nlegislation that will help working families. On energy, we will fight \nto make sure the Senate takes a real look at price gouging and takes \nsteps to help millions of families fill their tanks and heat their \nhomes. On avian flu, we will continue to push the Senate to consider \nour comprehensive preparedness legislation so our country has the tools \nand resources it needs to confront this pandemic. If we do not do \nsomething, we are told 48 percent of the people who get this flu are \ngoing to die. And with Katrina, we are going to do everything we can to \nmake sure hundreds of thousands of victims get the health care, housing \nand economic opportunities they need.\n  This weekend brought a new round of stories about how gulf coast \ncommunities are struggling. The problems of Katrina have not gotten \nbetter. For many families they have gotten worse.\n  With Katrina, we also have to ensure we get answers to how this \nhappened so we can do everything possible to prevent it from happening \nagain. The Senate has an obligation to act.\n  I say to my friends who now, as we see from the morning papers, are \nconcerned about how many Iraqis are killed and soon--it may have \nalready happened--just a matter of hours from now, 2,000 Americans will \nhave been killed in Iraq. No one was looking for offsets and have not \nbeen looking for offsets on the billions of dollars being spent in \nIraq.\n\n  Unfortunately, the Republicans blocked our attempts to help the \nAmerican people last week. We could have made real progress. Instead, \nthe Senate wasted much of its time. America can do better. We do not \nhave time to lose. Every day that goes by, the problems faced by \nKatrina's victims grow worse. Every day that goes by, families are \nsqueezed tighter by the energy crunch. Every day that goes by, we lose \nprecious time in preparing for the avian flu pandemic.\n  We can do better. America can do better.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from \nIllinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the President for recognizing me.\n  I would like to follow on the remarks made by the Democratic leader \nof the Senate. The American people we represent expect us on the floor \nof the Senate to truly represent them and their real concerns--the \nneeds of their families, the needs of their communities, the needs of \nbusinesses and farmers. We are elected to speak for them and to come \ntogether in common purpose on a bipartisan basis and deal with the real \nissues Americans face.\n  I would certainly acknowledge that the pending appropriations bill \nfor Labor, Health and Human Services, which includes education as well, \nis one of the most important appropriations bills that addresses those \nneeds. In years gone by, there was a Congressman from Kentucky named \nBill Natcher who was the chairman of the subcommittee that handles this \nbill. He always called this bill on the House floor the ``people's \nappropriations bill.'' I think it was aptly named because it meant so \nmuch.\n  So as we visit this bill this week, it is time well spent, time to \nreflect on what we can do to help education in America, time to reflect \non what we can do in the area of health care for America, medical \nresearch for America. It is time to look at some of the most basic \nprograms we count on.\n  Sadly, this bill is the exception, it is not the rule.\n  Too many times we come to the floor of the Senate not to serve the \nneeds of the people of this great Nation, but to serve the needs of \nspecial interest groups. They dominate this process because it has \nbecome such an expensive process. Unless you are independently wealthy \nand can finance your own campaigns from the millions of dollars you \nmade before you came to the Senate, most Senators, mere mortals, spend \ntheir time raising money. From whom? Well, from their voters somewhat \nbut, by and large, from special interest groups. So it is no surprise \nthat the agenda of the Senate reflects those special interest groups.\n  Just a week ago, the new bankruptcy law went into effect. Professor \nWarren of Harvard Law School this morning in the New York Times talks \nabout what it is going to mean. This was a 9-year effort by the \nfinancial institutions and credit card companies of America to make it \nmore difficult for families to file for bankruptcy. Nine years they put \ninto it, and they finally scored their big victory this year. They got \nthis new bankruptcy bill passed.\n  What it means is fewer people who walk into bankruptcy court will be \nable to walk out with a clean slate. Many people walking in, crushed by \ndebt, will find themselves walking out still carrying most of that \ndebt.\n  Who are these people? Who are these folks who have been accused of \nabusing the bankruptcy system? Take a look at them: Over half of them \nare people who were overwhelmed by one thing--medical bills. There was \nan article in the New York Times this Sunday on the front page--my \ncolleagues might have read it--of a family with health insurance and a \nsick baby who ended up losing their home, despite the fact they had \nhealth insurance, because of the serious medical problems that little \nbaby faced.\n  This new bankruptcy law pushed on us by financial institutions and \ncredit card companies will make it more difficult for families like \nthat to ever erase the slate and start over. The special interests won \nagain.\n  Then we had this debate on the floor of the Senate about the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. Can you\n\n[[Page S11752]]\n\nthink of anything more important, certainly to the families of 150,000 \nAmerican soldiers serving in Iraq today? Is there anything more \nimportant than the Department of Defense authorization bill, a bill \nwhich addresses the needs of our soldiers, the needs of the Pentagon, \nthe needs of our veterans? Could there be a higher priority for us to \ndeal with on the floor of the Senate?\n  Do you know what happened to that bill? The Republican leadership \npulled that bill off the floor and said: We don't have time to consider \nit. And what did they replace it with? They replaced it with a bill \npushed by the gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, a bill which \nsays that gun manufacturers cannot be held liable in court for their \nwrongdoing. That is right, we have created this class in America, a \nlimited class of people who are not responsible for their wrongdoing. \nIt doesn't apply to you, not as an individual. If you are guilty of \nwrongdoing you can be held accountable. It does not apply to 99.9 \npercent of the businesses in America. Guilty of wrongdoing? You are \nheld accountable.\n  But the gun industry, this big special interest group, so powerful \nthat Republican leadership pulled the Department of Defense bill off \nthe floor and has never returned to it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize for interrupting.\n  In the New York Times today on the front page there is a column that \nsays: ``GOP Testing Ways to Blunt Leak Charges.'' Is the Senator aware \nthat the senior Senator from Texas said she hoped ``that if there is \ngoing to be an indictment that says something happened''--referring to \nthe Rove-Libby scandal in the White House--``that it is an indictment \non a crime and not some perjury technicality. . . .'' Will my friend \ncomment on this statement?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I did read the article on the plane coming \nout here. I think everyone knows, without saying this is a critical \nweek, that something could happen this week. There are investigations \nunder way of the Republican leadership, the House and the Senate, and \nnow there is a question as to whether there will be indictments handed \ndown for others in the executive department.\n  It is clear from the statement by some Senators, including the one \nquoted, that they are trying to prepare America for the shock that even \nhigher level indictments could be handed down.\n  I say to the Senator from Nevada, and I think he would agree with me, \nthe vast majority of the men and women serving in the House and Senate \ntoday are the most honest, hard-working people America could ever hope \nfor. They come to work every day trying to serve the public good and \nyet in every institution, whether it is Government, business, families, \neven churches, there is wrongdoing. People do the wrong thing.\n  I hope what we hear being said by some Members of the Senate \nminimizing the possibility of indictments at the highest level of our \nGovernment does not reflect the true feeling of this body. I honestly \nbelieve there has been a rampant culture of corruption and cronyism \nthat can take over our lives if we are not careful in public life. I \nhope we are mindful of the public's need to know that we are committed \nto continuing honest, ethical conduct in public service. Otherwise, we \nlose the confidence. Nothing else we do means much.\n  To minimize the possibility of someone being indicted for perjury \noverlooks the obvious. What is at stake, what is at issue in this \ninvestigation involving Valerie Plame, is the fact that this woman was \na career employee of the Central Intelligence Agency in a covert \nstatus, which meant people did not know what she was doing. That gave \nher entre and opportunity others did not have. So protecting her \nidentity was an important part of her service to this Nation.\n  There are many like her who risk their lives every day for America to \nmake it safer to uncover potential acts of terrorism before they occur. \nSo when her husband, a former ambassador, put an article in the \nnewspaper critical of the Bush administration for overstating the \nreasons we were going to invade Iraq, someone--according to columnist \nRobert Novak, two people in the White House--came forward to out her \nidentity. They did that for the most vain national political reasons, \nto punish her and her husband for speaking out against the \nadministration.\n  That is a crime, to out the identity of a CIA agent. Who created this \ncrime? It was a crime created by President Bush's father, former head \nof the CIA, who was so enraged that someone had written a book \ndisclosing the identity of a CIA agent which he believed resulted in \ntheir death that he called on Congress to pass a law to say if anybody \ndisclosed that identity, they should be held responsible for it. That \nis what is at the heart of this.\n  This is not a political game. It involves the lives and good fortunes \nof many men and women who serve this country selflessly. So to minimize \nthis Valerie Plame investigation and to say it is over some \ntechnicality--for goodness sakes, the security of America and the \nsecurity of the men and women in our intelligence agency, that is not a \ntechnicality. That is part of the defense of this country. I certainly \nhope what we have seen in the paper this morning, reflected in \nyesterday's talk shows, is not part of some strategy to try to minimize \nwhat is an extremely serious investigation.\n  I also say this before I yield the floor--I see the Senator from \nPennsylvania is here as chairman of the committee. The three points \nmade by the Senator from Nevada are critical points. Five weeks from \nnow, how can we go home and say Thanksgiving has come, we are ready for \nthe holidays, we are headed off, and not do something about energy in \nAmerica? How can we face the people we represent who cannot afford to \npay their heating bills, people who cannot afford the cost of gas in my \npart of the world, in the Midwest, or the cost of heating oil in the \nNortheast? Can we say we have done the best we can do? I do not think \nso.\n  When it comes to energy, the bill we passed was a sop to the special \ninterests. It was $9 billion in subsidies to oil companies which are \nexperiencing the highest profits they have seen in decades. Some parts \nof the bill were good, and I voted for it because it included ethanol \nand biodiesel and a few other things, but by and large this bill did \nnot force us into an energy policy. What we need to do is very obvious.\n  First, we need to protect consumers in America from these price \nspikes. They are defenseless when the cost of gasoline reaches the \npoint they cannot afford to go to work or run their small businesses or \nbring the harvest in from the farm.\n  Secondly, we need to punish profiteers. The four major oil companies \nin America in the first 6 months of this year had over $40 billion in \nprofits.\n  When you stuck that nozzle in the tank of your car and watched those \nnumbers racing by on the pump, you were sending it directly to the \nboardrooms of these oil companies, $40 billion in profits that they \ntook right out of that experience.\n  One of the Senators from the other side last week asked, what is \nwrong with profits? Well, I guess nothing is wrong with profits unless \nyou have to pay for them out of your hard-earned money every single \nday, and unless you cannot heat your home in the dead of winter because \nthe cost of heating oil has gone up to make sure those profits keep \ncoming to the boardrooms.\n  Some of us believe it is time to say, end of the road to these major \noil companies that are profiteering, and to punish the profiteers with \na windfall profits tax which tells them there is no incentive in \nraising the price for more profiteering. Some say that is harsh, it \ngoes too far. I do not think so. Imposing that tax and bringing the \nmoney back to consumers directly in rebates or to help pay for LIHEAP \nso low-income families can heat their homes, in my mind, is simple \njustice.\n  Finally, we need an energy policy that looks ahead to making America \nless energy dependent. There was one critical issue on the floor when \nit came to the Energy bill. It was an amendment offered by Senator \nMaria Cantwell of Washington, cosponsored by many of us, and here is \nwhat it said: Much like President Kennedy's goal of reaching the Moon, \nwe will set as a national goal reducing our dependence on foreign oil \nin America by 40 percent over the next 20 years. Is there a person\n\n[[Page S11753]]\n\nfollowing this debate who does not think that is a good idea, a \npositive thing, that we would take the impact of the OPEC cartel and \noil sheiks out of the American economy, minimize their impact?\n  We called that amendment up for a vote. One would think it would have \nbeen a unanimous vote, but it turned out to be a partisan vote. Not a \nsingle Republican Senator would support it. To reduce the dependence on \nforeign oil? That makes no sense.\n  We need to push for creativity when it comes to energy. We need to \nfind renewable, sustainable sources of energy. What is the \nadministration's answer to the energy crisis? Drill in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge. An argument can be made there is not enough \noil there to sustain us for any period of time. Over 20 years, the oil \ncoming out of there is worth 6 months of America's energy supply. Over \n20 years, it would produce 6 months' worth.\n  What happened last week in the Energy Committee? Up came a vote which \nsaid, incidentally, if there is going to be drilling in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge, the oil better come down to America to help \nreduce our prices. That amendment was defeated. It was defeated on a \nlargely partisan rollcall. There were many who said, no, the oil \ncompanies cannot be told what to do with the oil they take out of a \nwildlife refuge that has been protected for 50 years.\n  One wonders about the reach and impact of special interest groups. \nPresident Eisenhower's Arctic Wildlife Refuge, which we have valued and \nprotected for 50 years, is going to be invaded and desecrated to drill \nfor oil for America's energy, but this Congress would not say that oil \nwould come back for heat and to fuel the cars of Americans. Where will \nit go? Probably to China.\n  Think about that for a second. One of our largest competitors in the \nworld, energy hungry themselves, may end up with the very oil we are \ntaking out of this wildlife refuge we have debated for years.\n  The point made about Hurricane Katrina is a good one. How can we \nleave without creating an independent, nonpartisan commission to figure \nout what went wrong? For 24/7, we saw those ghastly images of our \nfellow Americans struggling so that their children could survive this \nflood. We watched corpses bobbing in the flooded waters, seeing people \ndesperate for shelter, water, and food. Much like 9/11, we think we \nought to look into that to make sure we never repeat those mistakes \nagain. There is resistance from the White House and from the majority.\n  Basically, the avian influenza is another call to arms. If this avian \ninfluenza, which has been described as inevitable by Dr. Gerberding of \nthe Centers for Disease Control, strikes America, the people of this \ncountry have a right to turn to every single elected official and ask, \nwhat did you do, knowing this was coming? What did you do to stockpile \nthe antiviral agents that might save the lives of the children in my \nfamily? What did you do to start the vaccine production that might save \nthe lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans? What did you do back \nin October of the year 2005 when you had that chance?\n  So the question is whether we will go home having addressed any of \nthose issues: energy, Katrina or avian influenza. This bill before us \nis critically important, but after this bill is finished I hope we will \nmove to those three items. I think they are of great national \nsignificance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the \npending business?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/24/senate-section/article/S11753-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11753-S11762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2006\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 3010, which the clerk will now \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3010) making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2006, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I made an opening statement on Friday \nmorning and I intend to yield in a moment or two to my distinguished \ncolleague, the ranking member, Senator Harkin. I urge all Senators to \ncome forward with their amendments. So far staff has contacted every \nSenator's office to find out if there are amendments which the Senator \nintends to file. We have been made aware of approximately 15 amendments \nidentified so far where there is an intention to file. We have had a \nfair number of other comments from staffers of other Senators who do \nnot know what their Members intend to do.\n  We have a very complicated bill, in excess of $145 billion, three of \nthe most important Departments of the Federal Government: Education, \nHealth and Human Services, and Labor. We are in the closing days of \nthis session. After the passage of this bill, we are going to have to \ngo to conference and resolve many difficult matters. So it is important \nthat this bill be completed as early as possible.\n  We also have many Members who are involved in this bill who are \nengaged in the preparation of the confirmation hearings on Ms. Harriet \nMiers for the Supreme Court of the United States. That is weighing very \nheavily on my mind, but this is an important bill which comes first. \nSenator Harkin and I are determined, and Senator Frist, the leader, as \nwell as Senator Reid, the Democratic leader, will back us up. Senator \nReid took the initiative to remind Senators about a statement which I \ninitiated last week about going to the 15-minute plus 5, 20 minutes \ntotal, vote tally so we do not consume a large amount of time, which \nhas become the practice of the Senate.\n  Speaking as the manager, and I know Senator Harkin concurs with \nthis--I would ask the Senator if that is correct?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We are going to move to enforce the time limits. The \nmanagers intend to press to file a cloture petition tomorrow which will \nrequire that all amendments be filed by Wednesday at noon and that we \ntake up only germane amendments.\n  We think these rules are the ones which should govern the \nconsideration of this bill. If anybody has nongermane amendments, the \nfloor is open this afternoon, and until cloture is invoked, the germane \namendments will be open for consideration tomorrow.\n  I again urge our colleagues to come forward at this time with any \namendments which they desire to offer.\n  The distinguished Senator from Iowa was not present to hear my lavish \npraise about him on Friday afternoon. He is giving me the waving-on \nsignal. The choice is either to praise him again or relegate him to \nread the Congressional Record, so I choose to renew the praise.\n  He has been a steadfast colleague as we have moved the work of this \nimportant subcommittee without partisanship. The gavel has changed \nhands from time to time between Senator Harkin and me. I know that \nwhile he has said some good things about my chairmanship, he prefers to \nbe chairman. I do not know why, but he has maintained that position. In \nthe public interest, when the chairmanship is changed, we use the \nexpression ``a seamless exchange of the gavel.''\n  Now I do not hand him the gavel, but I hand him the floor seamlessly.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished, seamless, and \nsteadfast Senator from Iowa is recognized. Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I \nthank my friend, the distinguished chairman of this vital and important \nsubcommittee on appropriations. Senator Specter and I have worked \ntogether--now that I think back, it has been 17 years that we have \nworked together, either as chairman or ranking member on this \nsubcommittee. The chairman is absolutely right. No matter who has the \ngavel, we work together. I couldn't ask for a better working \nrelationship with anyone than I have with my friend and my chairman, \nSenator Specter of Pennsylvania. It is Senator Specter who has led the \ncharge in the past to do the things that enable our country to move\n\n[[Page S11754]]\n\nahead educationally and to be better prepared healthwise. It was \nSenator Specter who led the charge in the 1990s to get us up on the \nplateau, to double the funding for NIH. People said it could not be \ndone.\n\n  We had fallen so low in terms of the number of peer- reviewed \nprojects that were being funded that people were just giving up. We \nwere not getting a pipeline of researchers. Maybe they had 1 chance in \n10, maybe 1 chance in 20 of ever getting their research project funded, \nand this was after it went through the peer review and was deemed \nworthy of funding.\n  We had fallen to a terrible state, so Senator Specter and I worked \ntogether with our staffs to get a funding schedule that would double \nthe funding for NIH. If I am not mistaken, I believe it was started \nunder a Democratic President and finished under a Republican President. \nIt was a bipartisan approach, but we got the job done. More and more \npeople are looking at NIH now as again the premier institution it once \nwas in our country and really the premier medical research institution \nanywhere in the world. It was Senator Specter who led that charge.\n  Many years ago, you will remember, there was a movie called \n``Outbreak.'' It had Dustin Hoffman in it. It was about 15 years ago, \nsomething like that. I happened to be chairman of the subcommittee at \nthat time. I went down to Atlanta to visit the Centers for Disease \nControl. That was its name then. We changed the name to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, which is its rightful name now, in 1991 \nor 1992. I went down there to see these fancy things that were in the \nmovie with Dustin Hoffman, these fancy laboratories and high-tech \nstuff. I wanted to see this. I went down to see this, and I found out \nthat the movie producers had, indeed, visited the Centers for Disease \nControl to make this movie, but the facilities were so ramshackle, so \nrundown, so poor, they decided to build their own Hollywood set because \nno one would believe this really was the high-class, high-intensity, \nsuper-secure environment in which to investigate these kinds of \ninfectious diseases. Indeed they were. They were working, actually, in \nbuildings that had been constructed pre-World War II. In some cases, \nlaboratories had been reconstructed from rest rooms that were, in those \ndays, for colored men, colored women, White men, White women. They had \ndone away with all that, and now they made them into laboratories.\n  Senator Specter and I both looked at that and said: We have to do \nsomething about this. And we did. We have now embarked on a multiyear \nprogram. We started several years ago, building facilities at the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. They are now the best in \nthe world. Not all of it is done, but many of the buildings have been \nbuilt. As I said, we now have the kind of facilities that a great \nnation such as ours requires and deserves.\n  That is just my way of paying my respects to Senator Specter for his \ngreat leadership on this subcommittee in terms of health and of \neducation in our country.\n  Having said that, I am pleased we have the bill on the floor. Last \nyear, we never even got to the floor. As of last week, it looked as if \nwe would not get to this one, so this is the last appropriations bill \nthis year, and it deserves the full consideration of the Senate.\n  Second to Defense, this is the largest appropriations subcommittee. \nHealth, Education, Labor it provides over $600 billion in programs. I \nmentioned the National Institutes of Health; Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention; libraries--a lot of other things. It is the \nbill that paves the way for medical breakthroughs, provides job \ntraining to dislocated workers, vocational education, and helps our \nmost disadvantaged students through title I, Individuals with \nDisabilities Education, Pell grants. It was once said of our committee \nthat the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee is the committee that \ndefends America; the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee defines America. I believe that is true. It \ndefines who we are, what kind of people we are, and how we perceive the \nfuture of our country. So it is true, the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee defends America. I think this subcommittee has the \nlegislation and the money that defines America.\n  I again thank Senator Specter, and I especially wish to thank his \nstaff. It goes without saying, our staffs have worked together very \nclosely across the aisle for all these years. I could not ask for \nbetter relationships and openness, transparency, congeniality, working \ntogether.\n  So we have the bill before us. Am I ecstatic over this bill? Not \nquite. I am not. But I will say this: Senator Specter and his staff and \nI and our staff have done the best with what I consider a bad hand that \nwas dealt us. A lot of times when the budget comes through here, we \nhave a debate on the budget, people vote on the budget, and it goes \nthrough as if it doesn't have much effect. The budget goes through, ho-\nhum, and that is the end of it. But we have to operate with that budget \nand within that budget, and that is why we have the bill we have. Once \nthe budget was adopted, our subcommittee had no hope of restoring all \nthe cuts in the President's budget, much less giving increases to \nvitally important health and education programs.\n  We did the best we could. Again, I compliment Senator Specter, but \njust take a look at the National Institutes of Health. Again thanks to \nthe leadership of Senator Specter, we go up about $1 billion. The \nPresident's budget only had it up $100 million. In community health \ncenters, we are basically funded at the level of last year, but the \ndemand is greater. The Community Services Block Grant Program got $636 \nmillion, the same as last year. That is less by $14 million than what \nwe had in the year 2000. So we have more poor people--more people \ndemanding services everywhere from Head Start to LIHEAP to childcare \nservices--yet we have basically level funded, at least in our bill, the \nCommunity Services Block Grant Program.\n  Some Senators may remember that when the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee bill was on the floor, I offered an amendment to increase \nthe community services block grants to this year's level because the \ncontinuing resolution we are operating under right now cut the \ncommunity services block grants back to the level at which they were in \n1986: about $340 million or $350 million.\n\n  This is October 24. We are now 24 days into this quarter at which the \nfunding for our community action agencies is down to less than half of \nwhat was in last year's bill. So here we are, trying to get at least \nlast year's level, even though that is inadequate. It is less than what \nwe had in the year 2000, and we know poverty has increased. There is \nmore demand for Head Start services, LIHEAP, and others. But again, at \nleast in our bill, we keep it level funded. The continuing resolution \nknocked it back, it said, to the levels of 1986.\n  I mentioned LIHEAP. We have $2.2 billion in our bill. We should have \nmore. The budget resolution wouldn't allow it, so we did the best we \ncould. And with oil prices up--I checked in Iowa when I was there last \nweek, and heating prices are double what they were last year. Natural \ngas prices are at least a minimum of 50 percent more than they were \nlast year. Yet the amount of money we have for LIHEAP is the same as \nwhat it was last year--the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, \nthe same level as last year. I understand there will be an amendment \noffered to increase this. I assume it is going to take 60 votes, so I \ndon't know how much hope we have of passing it. I hope it does pass \nbecause the demand is there. The need is there.\n  Pell grants are $4,050, maximum. That is the same as last year. There \nis no increase whatsoever, yet we know tuition costs have gone up. Pell \ngrant purchasing power now is about 40 percent of what it was just 15 \nyears ago when we were working together on this--40 percent less \npurchasing power in a Pell grant, and Pell grants go to the lowest \nincome families in America for their kids to go to college.\n  We have the Perkins Program for Vocational Education. At a time when \nwe need to be training and retraining workers in vocations such as \nelectronics and computers and software and when they need retraining \nfor the new kinds of jobs of the future, we have a program called the \nPerkins Program for Vocational Education. We funded it a little bit \nless than last year's level, and we know the need is there for more \nvocational education.\n\n[[Page S11755]]\n\n  Title I funding goes to help local school districts that have a high \nproportion of very low-income kids. Last year, it was $12.7 billion. \nThis year, it is $12.8 billion. When you take into account inflation, \nit is basically a little bit less than what we had last year in terms \nof purchasing power. We estimate that 75 percent of the school \ndistricts that get title I funding in America will actually get less \nnext year than they got last year. Yet we know from the data there are \nmore poor people out there, there are more low-income families and \nschools that teach these low-income kids, yet we are not funding the \ntitle I program in the way it has been funded in the past. So again we \nare caught up in a budget problem, a budget situation where in this \nbudget this Senate voted for we have new tax breaks of about $70 \nbillion more in tax breaks. There is $35 billion more in cuts and $35 \nbillion more in deficit spending under this budget. So $70 billion in \ntax breaks, most of which go to the most affluent Americans, yet we \nhave no money for title I or Pell grants or Perkins loans.\n  We have no more money for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram, again for low-income people and the elderly. The funding for \ncommunity health centers that are picking up the gap between those who \nhave health insurance and those who do not is up $105 million, but out \nof $1.8 billion, that is basically level funding, maybe even a little \nless when you take inflation into account.\n  The budget we passed this year is a budget that measures our Nation \njust the opposite of what Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936.\n  President Roosevelt said the progress of America should be measured \nnot in whether we can add more to the abundance of those who already \nhave plenty but, rather, whether we can even meet the needs of those \nwho have too little. This budget seems to be saying to us the measure \nof progress in America is how much more we can give to those who \nalready have a lot and take from those who already have very little. \nThat is the way we measure progress in America today under this budget. \nSo that is why we have an appropriations bill that basically doesn't \nmeet the needs for education in Pell grants, Perkins loans, or title I. \nIt doesn't meet the needs we have for heating this winter, for \ncommunity health centers, for community services block grants. I could \ngo on and on.\n  So as I said, Senator Specter and I and our staffs did the best job \nwe could, but our hands were tied by the budget. If there are \namendments to waive the Budget Act and increase some of these, with no \ndisrespect to my colleague and my chairman, I will find myself on the \nside of those who want to waive the Budget Act and increase funding for \nlow-income heating and energy assistance, to waive the Budget Act for \nPell grants, to waive the Budget Act to put more money in for title I \nfunding. I will be on that side because, I am sorry, I do not agree \nwith this budget. I do not agree with the budget that gives $70 billion \nto the wealthy and gives less to our poorest people. We can't afford \ntitle I funding for schools. We can't afford to put money into low-\nincome heating and energy assistance for the poor and elderly. We don't \nhave the money for it. We do have the money for it.\n  It is just right now that money is going out in more and more tax \nbreaks for the wealthy. We have two tax cuts that are going into effect \nnext year. They were passed in the 2001 tax bill. They start next year. \nThey are not in effect now, but they start next year, called PEP and \nPease, P-E-P and P-E-A-S-E, named after Don Pease of Ohio, former \nCongressman. And those two, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, those two tax cuts alone will cost the Treasury $35 billion in \nthe next 5 years, and in 10 years, $146 billion--lost revenue.\n  Well, who gets the money? Do low-income, hard-working, struggling \nfamilies get PEP and Pease because they are going to get the tax break \nso they can pay the mortgage on the house, pay tuition for their kids \nto go to school? Over 50 percent--again, CBO, don't take my word for \nit--of the benefits of this tax cut that starts this next year, this \nPEP and Pease, over 50 percent goes to people making over $1 million a \nyear; 97 percent of all of these tax cuts in PEP and Pease go to people \nmaking more than $100,000 a year. But over 50 percent--I think it is 54 \npercent--goes to people making over $1 million a year.\n  Now, we are going to do that, but we can't increase the Pell grants. \nWe can't increase the Perkins loans for vocational education. We can't \nincrease title I for the poorest school districts. So that is why I say \nif there are amendments offered to waive the Budget Act, I will find \nmyself on that side, with no disrespect to my chairman. We did the best \nwe could under the budget, but I repeat, I don't agree with this \nbudget. I don't agree with this budget at all. Therefore, if we have to \nwaive the Budget Act to fund these programs, that is the side I am \ngoing to be on.\n  Having said that, there are many things Senator Specter took the lead \non that I want to thank him for: restoring funding for the elimination \nof child labor, system change grants at CMS that help States move \npeople from institutions back to their communities, preventive health \nblock grants, even community services block grants--even though we are \nlevel funding in this bill, the President's budget had zero, zeroed it \nout. He zeroed the preventive health block grants, system change grants \nto move people from institutions to living in their communities, to \nabide by the Supreme Court's ruling on that. The President zeroed it \nout. At least Senator Specter put that back in.\n  So given the bad hand we were dealt, Senator Specter did a great job. \nI thank him for his fairness, his cooperation, for his work on this \nbill.\n  I concur in his request earlier that people come over with \namendments. I understand there will be a cloture motion filed tomorrow. \nThat is something I can support to finish this bill this week and \nhopefully get it to conference. I just wish that we did not have the \nbudget under which we are operating.\n  I again ask Senators who have amendments to come over and offer those \namendments. We are open for business. We would like to finish this bill \nby Thursday night. I am sure most Senators would. There is no way to do \nthat unless people come over and offer amendments.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceed to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Senator Harkin just called my attention \nto the fact that a quorum call has been underway for a protracted \nperiod of time. Senator Harkin and I are very much opposed to quorum \ncalls during our watch.\n  I ask Senator Harkin if it is too early to call for a third reading \nor final passage.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if the distinguished chairman will yield \nto allow me to respond to that, I say to my friend from Pennsylvania \nthat I think it may be a bit early. I think there are Senators still \ncoming back from their travels in their home States. We want to give \nthem time to get back here.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Would 4:15 be an appropriate time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Someone told me there was a vote on a couple of judges at \n5:30. I think after that we have to take a look and see how many \namendments there are, if I am not mistaken.\n  I thought the chairman was going to offer a cloture motion tomorrow. \nIf we have third reading, the chairman can't file a cloture motion.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If we have third reading, we will not need a cloture \nmotion.\n  I am persuaded by the eloquence of the Senator's argument.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There may be a point in time when I would agree with the \nchairman on this. It is Monday, and I know people are working \ndiligently in their States, and they are headed back. There may be a \ncouple of amendments that Members want to offer. I think perhaps 4:15 \nmight be a little early for third reading.\n  But if the chairman will yield further, I believe the chairman is \nright. It is Monday. We are in business. Senator Frist, the majority \nleader, said that\n\n[[Page S11756]]\n\nwe are going to be doing business today. If Members have amendments, \nthey should come over and offer them. I agree with the chairman. It is \nridiculous to sit here in quorum calls when we have an important bill \nlike this and Members have amendments.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his \nlenient response. I thought it worth noting that a quorum call had been \non for a while. Even the generosity of Senator Harkin has its limits on \nhow much of a quorum call he will sustain.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2197\n\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2197.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: to reduce administrative costs in the Centers for Medicaid \n                         and Medicare Services)\n\n       On page 154, line 10, strike ``$3,203,418,000'' and insert \n     ``$3,188,418,000'' in lieu thereof.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is an amendment which reduces the \nFederal administrative costs for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices by $15 million. It is a very small reduction which will still \nleave in that account some $640 million, an increase of $57,570,000 \nover last year.\n  The reason for this amendment, which is more in the nature of a \ntechnical amendment, is it brings this bill in conformity with the \nbudget resolution. We anticipate savings of $15 million from a certain \nitem in the budget. We have found that the savings noted by Finance for \nfiscal year 2006 amounts to only $90 million. We are $15 million short. \nWith the astute reading of the staff, this was noted, and we would be \nsubject to a point of order if we were out of kilter. So we are \noffering this amendment.\n  I believe this would be the basis for at least one of the 5:30 votes \nthis afternoon. The majority leader talked about other judicial \nnominees being on the calendar. That is up to him as to whether he will \nput those on the agenda for votes.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that is the only amendment which this \nmanager has to offer at this time. It is 3:22. We have 2 hours 8 \nminutes before the 5:30 vote.\n  There are frequent occurrences on the floor of this Senate where 8 \nminutes is valuable, and sometimes 2 minutes. Somebody asked unanimous \nconsent on Thursday night for an additional minute, but it was objected \nto. Objection was withdrawn with 5 minutes to argue about whether we \nwould have a minute. We have a lot of time. We could get some important \nwork done if Senators who are now returning from their home States will \ncome to the floor and offer amendments.\n  In the absence of any Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent that at 5:30 today, the Senate proceed to executive session and \nimmediately proceed to consecutive votes on the confirmation of \nCalendar No. 385, Brian Sandoval to be United States District Judge for \nNevada, to be followed immediately by a vote on Calendar No. 387, Harry \nMattice, Jr., to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Tennessee; provided further that there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided for debate prior to each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Again, in the absence of any Senator seeking recognition, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  As I told the chairman, if any Members come and want to proceed with \namendments, I will be glad to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Deficit\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, there is a subjject that is extremely \nimportant. It is important to all. Frankly, having been at home this \nweekend, as most Members have, I heard more about it probably than any \nother issue. That is spending, of course; the amount of spending we are \ntaking on, and the Federal Government challenges to do something about \nthe increase in the deficit we are bringing upon ourselves. The \nchallenges make it very difficult.\n  As Fred Thompson said once: It is like going to heaven; everyone \nwants to go, but nobody wants to make the changes necessary to get \nthere. That is the way it is with the budget. It is an obligation to do \nmore to control spending and to control the size of the Federal \nGovernment. We have that obligation.\n  We have had some difficult times in the last couple of years which \nhave brought about some necessary spending. We had September 11, the \nwar on terrorism, the gulf now, and other emergencies, all of which \nrequire spending. I understand that.\n  However, we have to treat this as a family or business would when an \nextraordinary thing happens: We take care of it, but, nevertheless, the \ncosts for the family and business continue. Then we must find a way at \nsome point to offset the costs. That is where we are now.\n  Things have not all been bad over the past year. We have decreased \nthe deficit by $100 billion. We never hear much discussion in the media \nabout that. The fact is, we have made some progress. We have done some \nother good things. We passed an energy bill. We passed a highway bill. \nThrough the tax reductions over the years, we have increased the \nactivity in the economy, increased jobs and pay. There are good things.\n  The fact is, we still have special costs and funding we have to take \ncare of. As I mentioned, as in business, we have costs here, as well. \nWe are going to have a reconciliation bill, hopefully, next week. We \nwill look at the budget we are in now to ensure--and this is our last \nappropriations bill today in the Senate--we live within the budget in \nthose appropriations. I support the idea that we will seek to reduce it \nan additional amount, whether it is the $35 billion in the bill the \nSenate has talked about or whether it is the $50 billion talked about \nin the House. That is what we necessarily need to be doing and should \nbe doing.\n  Now, those are short-term issues, short-term changes for this year or \nthe next 3 or 4 years. We should give more attention to the long-term \nsituation. In most things we do here, particularly in spending, \nparticularly regarding the deficit, we ought to think of the long term. \nWe ought to have 20/20 vision and ask, Where do we want to be in 15 or \n20 years? What do we want to hand off to the next generation as a \nvision of where we want to be and where we would like to be, where we \nthink we should be with our families, with our communities, with our \nNation, and make the decisions daily, as we have to make them, \npredicated on accomplishing those visions we have decided we want.\n  The Washington Times said since the 1950s, around 18 to 20 percent of \nthe gross national product has been the deficit. Deficits are not \nunusual. It is debt for most everything--businesses and families and so \non. If we continue to go this route over the next 50 years, we will be \ntalking more about 30 or 40 percent deficit as a percentage of gross\n\n[[Page S11757]]\n\nnational product. Deficits and spending go up because gross national \nproduct goes up, so as a percentage they go up as well.\n  However, I don't think we want to find ourselves moving toward larger \nand larger government with more and more activities without paying for \nthem and have this deficit continue. In order to do that, we will have \nto look at some reforms. We will have to look at changes that need to \noccur, looking broader than just the reconciliation bill, which is very \nimportant. We need to look beyond that. We need to look at where we are \ngoing in the future and make some real changes.\n  One change will be in the size and scope of the Federal Government \nand the activities we are involved with in the Federal Government. We \nhave created a culture where if there is anything needed anywhere, from \nthe community on to the Federal Government, we get the Federal \nGovernment to pay for it, and we will start a new program. That has \nbecome a culture and a custom. Once that program is built in, it \nbecomes political. As programs are started, they get a constituency and \nthey continue. Those are areas we need to look at.\n  We will have to look at Social Security, for example. That is where \nmost of the money is spent. When we spend $2.5 trillion in a year, only \nabout $800 million is discretionary spending. The rest is Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid. We need to look at this. Everyone is \ncommitted to a well-funded, secure Social Security Program over the \nyears. There are differences of views as to how to get there. We need \nto look out to the future so the young people here can look forward to \nSocial Security in another 50 or 60 years.\n  Clearly, we want health care available, but we have to do it in \ndifferent ways. We need changes. I come from a rural State. The way \nhealth care is delivered in rural Wyoming is different from in \nWashington, DC. We need to get in a position where people have access \nto care. Maybe we ought to be doing some things where we do not need \nhealth care as much. We need long-term changes to get that taken care \nof. We need to restrain growth in the Federal Government.\n  I have always advocated policies for reducing the size of government. \nIt is apparent that the government is too big and too broad in its \nscope. Our phones practically ring off the hook with people wanting \nmore money for this, more money for that. I understand that. However, \nwe have to decide what is appropriate for the Federal Government to \npay. Many of the programs should be invested in but at the local or \nState level.\n  It seems over time we have created programs for most everyone. There \nare approximately 1,200 funded Federal programs. We need to look at \nthese for the long term. We have to look at each program and see, in \nfact, if it is still as needed as when it was put into place, to see if \nit is as efficient, evaluate it on its merit to decide if the taxpayers \nare getting their money's worth, then take a broad look, a long-term \nfuture look at eliminating programs, reducing the size of government, \nmaintaining programs that are essential, and making them more efficient \nlong term.\n  I have a bill called Government Reorganization and Program \nPerformance Improvement Act that creates mechanisms to do that. We have \nan opportunity most any time to create a new program and to fund it. We \nhave a process for that. We do not have a process for evaluating a \nprogram that started 10 years ago. Is that reason still there? Have we \naccomplished the goal? Should it be changed?\n\n  We talk about that, I suppose, from time to time, but we do not have \na process for doing that. That is partly what we would do.\n  The bill would create a sunset commission and an individual results \ncommission. The sunset commission would hold the Federal Government \naccountable for performance with Presidential proposals. The commission \ncould propose to the President whether to retain the program--after it \nhas been there for 10 years; taking a look at it--or to restructure the \nprogram, or to end the program.\n  This would be acted on by assessments, a seven-member, bipartisan \ncommission, appointed by the President, so we would have a process--a \nprocess, which we do not have now--to evaluate programs to see if they \nare, as I said, accomplishing the things they were set up to accomplish \nor to see if they should be done differently.\n  The other half of it is an opportunity to evaluate performance, \nagain, having a commission set up to take a look at programs to see if \nthey are operating as efficiently as they might be operating. I think \nit is fair to say sometimes in the bureaucracy we get things built into \nprograms where they are resistant to change. It is a little different \ngenerally than the private sector where the private sector has to \nchange from time to time because of profits or because of a lack of \nprofits, or whatever; where Government programs tend to go on forever \npretty much as they are. And I understand that.\n  So it seems to me there needs to be a way to do some of those kinds \nof evaluations and make sure that, No. 1, the size of Government can be \ncontrolled, and No. 2, we would maintain it as efficiently as can be \ndone, trying to do away with wastefulness and unnecessary and \nduplicative activities that take place--whether it is within the \nFederal Government or within State governments or local governments.\n  We are looking at a way to ensure good government. Everybody wants \ngovernment. Everybody wants services. But we also want good government; \nwe want efficient government; we want effective government. And we want \nit to be done as economically and in the least costly way it can be \ndone and still get that accomplished.\n  That is not an easy project. I understand that. But it seems to me--\nas we look at excessive spending; as we look at trying to do something \nabout the budget that is pretty short term, looking at these next \ncouple of years--we ought to be looking at where we are going to be in \nmaking some decisions that will help us keep within the budget we would \nlike to have over a longer period of time. Doing that, we would have to \nmake more difficult decisions, perhaps, but they would be more long-\nterm decisions. Now is a good time to do that. What better time would \nthere be to take a look at that than now, when we are as concerned as \nwe are about spending--which we ought to be?\n  I think this is a good government initiative which we ought to look \nat. It certainly urges us to bring these bills up and to take a look at \nthem so that, in addition to next year's reductions in spending, we \ntake a look at the overall problem we face by increasing spending \nbecause we have found, I think, that is an easy thing to do. I think \nunder these current circumstances, it is a thing that happens pretty \nmuch constantly, unless we are doing something about that.\n  I hope, No. 1, we recognize the importance of controlling spending, \nwe recognize the importance of controlling the size and the role of the \nFederal Government. I think there should be--there should be--some \ndefinitions. We ought to have in our own minds some criteria as to what \nis the role of the Federal Government, what is the role of the other \ngovernments, what is the role of the private sector, so we do not \ncontinue to be in this sort of circumstance where everything that needs \nto be done becomes a role of the Federal Government. And then we wonder \nwhy taxes go up; we wonder why spending goes up. It is pretty easy to \nexplain that if you take a look at the size of the Government.\n  I guess what I am saying is, I hope we can take on the \nresponsibility, as we go about our daily chores, to have some vision \nfor the future, to evaluate with respect to where we are, but also \ntrying to get a notion of where we want to be--how we see it for our \nfamilies; how we see it for jobs; how we see it for education; how we \nsee it for freedom of choice. That is part of the criteria for this \ncountry.\n  We get in a political situation, which we are kind of in now. All we \ndo is criticize this and that. The real reason for elections is to talk \nabout the issues and to decide where we need to be, to talk about the \nkinds of issues and decisions that need to be made to get us where we \nwant to be. I think we have gotten so involved with the media picking \nup on every little controversial issue, and talking about that, that \npeople have forgotten what elections are about. Elections are about \ndirection. Decisions here are about direction. Decisions here are about \nwhere we are\n\n[[Page S11758]]\n\ngoing to be, and where we need to be, and where we want to be over \ntime--for our families, for our communities, for our Nation.\n  We have a great opportunity to do that. I urge we give some \nconsideration to it in every chance we have. And particularly now, as \nconcerned as we are about spending--and properly so--we should be sure \nwe take a look at where we want to be, how we can get there, and what \nchanges have to be made that are more than just for next year, so we \ncan move forward in that direction.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to speak. I yield the \nfloor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BURR). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                   Reconstruction in the Gulf States\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Landrieu from \nLouisiana, will be on the floor shortly. We want to talk about \nsomething that has occurred in the last week. A week ago today, I \nchaired a hearing of the Policy Committee. The hearing was on the \nsubject of the reconstruction in the Gulf States in the wake of \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita. We have held many previous hearings on \nreconstruction in Iraq. As you know, this Congress has literally spent \ntens of billions of dollars on reconstruction projects in Iraq, and the \nwaste, fraud, and abuse there is mind-boggling. There is massive money \ngoing out the door to contractors, in many cases with large no-bid \ncontracts, and the taxpayers are getting bilked. I will not go into the \nlengthy stories about it now.\n  We decided to hold a hearing with respect to contracting in the gulf \nbecause this Congress has already approved $60 billion for \nreconstruction, and we have heard tales and stories that are similar to \nthose we hear with respect to reconstruction in Iraq.\n  At last Monday's hearing, we heard from a local New Orleans company. \nThe owner of the company and his job foreman originally were hired to \nprovide 75 qualified electricians to work on a project they had begun \nat the Belle Chase Naval Air Station in Louisiana. The project they \nwere hired for was with Kellogg, Brown & Root, a subsidiary of \nHalliburton. This company was hired to provide 75 qualified \nelectricians.\n  Very soon after they started, these qualified Louisiana electricians, \nmany of whom were victimized by the hurricanes and who very much \nappreciated these jobs, were replaced by others. They were replaced by \nworkers who were not of the same training in electrical skills. In many \ncases, Bob Knight, the general manager of the New Orleans company that \nsuffered this fate, described the replacement workers as follows:\n\n       Almost all of their workers were from out of State, and \n     most didn't speak English. Few seemed to me to be qualified \n     electricians. According to the Halliburton subcontractor, \n     they were being paid [a fraction of the] prevailing hourly \n     wage, with no benefits. At that time they were living in \n     small tents on the base.\n\n  Here is a photograph of the circumstances of how they were living. \nThis is, of course, a little rough shed with 2 by 4s to frame up some \nbeds. I am guessing most of these are undocumented workers brought in \nto take the jobs that had belonged to the folks in Louisiana who \ndesperately need these jobs. But because the President said there is no \nrequirement to pay what Davis-Bacon wages, no requirement to pay the \nprevailing wage in this region, the result is unscrupulous contractors \nwho bring in workers who will work for dirt cheap wages with no \nbenefits and many hours and put them up in circumstances such as this.\n  And, oh, by the way, some of them were told they could go to work on \na crew such as this and get a fraction of what they would have to pay \nothers who are skilled, and they can get free meals at the Red Cross. \nUnbelievable, isn't it? Here is what is happening to jobs that are \nsupposed to belong to the folks in Louisiana and presumably also \nMississippi. People who got hit hard by the hurricane, who lost \neverything, in many cases, expected perhaps to get an opportunity to \nget back on their feet with a good job that pays all right as skilled \nelectricians. They put together 75 of them and are told by the \ncontractor: This job is going to last; it is going to be an opportunity \nfor you. And just like that, somebody else is brought in because the \nPresident said they do not have to pay prevailing wages.\n  Guess what. Here is the circumstance, here are the people with the \njobs. Most do not speak English. Most were brought, many of them \nundocumented.\n\n  Last Thursday or Friday, following the hearing that I held, there was \na raid at this military installation by what is normally called the \nINS. It is now I guess the ICE, as it has been subsumed into this \nbehemoth organization called Homeland Security.\n  At any rate, the immigration folks raided, and we are told by people \non the ground that they found somewhere around 150 undocumented \nworkers. The immigration folks now say they found 10 that they know of, \nbut they play a little game with us because the more questions we ask, \nthe less information we get from them.\n  It is pretty clear to me, based on eyewitness accounts on the ground, \nthat they went in after the hearing we did and found undocumented \nworkers on that military installation who had taken the jobs, we \nbelieve, from the folks in Louisiana who had been victimized by these \nhurricanes, the jobs they were working at.\n  Here is the Washington Post. This was last week after the hearing:\n\n       Among the electricians who lost their jobs was Sam Smith, \n     whose house in the Ninth Ward was destroyed after Katrina \n     slammed into the Louisiana coast. Smith, 55, returned to the \n     city because of the promise of $22-an-hour wages, and \n     guaranteed work for at least a year at the naval base.\n\n  By the way, he was a skilled electrician with all the certifications.\n\n       He was quickly disappointed, however, and lost his job \n     within three weeks. ``You would think that the federal \n     government should be making sure that people who are trying \n     to restart their lives and are trying to put their city back \n     together again are out there working,'' Smith said. ``But \n     that's not the case.''\n\n  The New York Times:\n\n       The acrid smell inside trailer No. 2 is tough to take for \n     any length of time. The linoleum floor is filthy and bare, \n     aside from a few soiled blankets hammed in the corners. \n     Dishes caked with leftover food are piled high in the sink, \n     attracting flies. Two portable fans are the only things \n     stirring the air. But six men are living here. They sleep on \n     that floor. They swat away those flies and dodge the roaches \n     at night. They traveled all the way from Guatemala.\n       They are promised good pay, three meals a day and place to \n     stay, and some contractors make good on this. But the \n     Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance, an advocacy group, \n     says many do not.\n\n  So it is, without the prospect of paying prevailing wages, the jobs \nare going to these kinds of folks.\n\n       They get $8 an hour and labor 11 hours a day, six days a \n     week. Subcontractors pulled them together for Belfor USA, an \n     American subsidiary of a multibillion-dollar international \n     company specializing in restoration after disasters. Before \n     New Orleans, they had separately held construction, farm or \n     factory jobs from Texas to North Carolina, they said.\n\n  The point is, there are other stories about workers, workers from \nelsewhere willing to take substandard wages to help the reconstruction \nof Louisiana and Mississippi.\n  We passed $60 billion out of this Chamber in reconstruction money \nand, guess what. What we now understand is reconstruction is going to \nothers, not the folks from Louisiana, not the people who have a skilled \ncertification as an electrician who lost their homes and who need the \njob. No, this is about companies that decide to bring in these folks \nand put them in these conditions--squalid conditions--and pay them a \nfraction of what should be paid for those jobs.\n  By the way, the foreman on the job who testified Monday--and my \ncolleague from Louisiana was at that hearing--the foreman said these \nfolks were not qualified. They were just not qualified. By the way, \nthey were putting up 900 tents in metal frames in which our troops will \nlive. And we have electricians not qualified wiring those tents for \nelectricity? What on earth is going on?\n  It is the same old thing. They are paying a fraction of what they \nshould pay and getting rid of the Louisiana\n\n[[Page S11759]]\n\nworkers so they can bring in these workers from Guatemala and \nelsewhere. You saw the stories: Undocumented workers, INS or ICE, they \ncall it, the immigration folks, make a raid on the base.\n  My colleague from Louisiana will expand on that further, I am sure. \nThey make a raid on the base, and we are told by people who were there \nthat they found many--we heard 150 people. Now they will say there are \nonly 10. At this point, they do not know, they cannot know, they will \nnot tell us. It is the same old tap dance by a big Federal bureaucracy \nthat does not want to get caught.\n  They ought to do their job, come clean, and tell us what they found \non that base. I think I know what they found. I think what they found \nwere contractors bringing in undocumented workers, paying them pennies \non the dollar, taking jobs away from the folks in Louisiana. That is \nwhat I think they found.\n  I wonder if there is any Member of the Senate, just one, who wants to \nstand up and say: Yes, that is what we meant, we meant to shove $60 \nbillion out the door of this Chamber and hope that some contractor \nwould bring in some undocumented workers--and fire some Louisiana \nfolks--to do the work in Louisiana. If there is one Senator willing to \nstand up and say that, they are not thinking very much. There is not \none person in this Chamber who will agree that is what they meant, not \nin their worst moment.\n  I take no pleasure in pointing this out. In my judgment, this is a \ncorruption of the process. We know what needs to be done. We know how \nto do it. There is a right way and a wrong way to do things, and what \nis happening is we are seeing the wrong way implemented in the \nreconstruction down in the gulf coast.\n  My colleague from the State of Louisiana participated in those \nhearings. I know she has been in touch with the contractors and knows \nwhat is happening with respect to that Naval air station as well, but I \nthank her for the work she has done. I can only imagine if it were my \nState or some other State of a Senator in this Chamber facing this, we \nwould demand that those for whom those jobs were intended would have \nthose jobs, not that they be fired so we could bring in undocumented \nworkers and pay them pennies on the dollar. That is unbelievable \nincompetence, and we need to see it stopped right now.\n  So let me thank my colleague from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course. I would be happy to yield.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask the Senator if he has received the latest numbers \nfrom the Department of Labor about the number of Americans who have \nactually lost their jobs because of Katrina and Rita. We know it was \nupwards of 450,000 people who have lost their jobs because of the \nhurricane. Does the Senator know that his remarks are even more \ncompelling based on the numbers of people who must be looking for work, \nhave some skills to offer, and yet under the system the Senator has \ndescribed they are finding it difficult to work in their own city or \nparish with their own Federal Government contracts? Did the Senator \nknow that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was not aware of the number. I know this is \ndevastating, the most significant natural disaster with the greatest \nconsequence in terms of human misery, loss of jobs, loss of homes. It \nis unbelievable.\n  I realize that a lot of undocumented workers are just decent people \nwho are trying to make a living. I don't mean to disparage them. My \nintention is to say, however, there are rules, and there is a right way \nand a wrong way to do things. We did not spend $60 billion out of this \nChamber to give jobs to undocumented workers. We spent that amount of \nmoney to help the folks from Louisiana get back on their feet with good \njobs for reconstruction, and the same for the folks from Mississippi.\n  I intend to work with the Senator from Louisiana and others to put a \nstop to what is going on, to redirect that money. We want \nreconstruction to move and move quickly, but we want those jobs to go \nto the victims, those folks who have suffered through all of this as \nwell. We want those workers to be paid good wages. Davis-Bacon ought to \nbe restored. The President ought to stand up today and say: I made a \nmistake by repealing Davis-Bacon. This Government has a responsibility \nto pay prevailing wages so we have good wages that pay well and decent \njobs for those folks.\n  I again thank the Senator from Louisiana. I know she wants to make \nsome comments about this as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his great \nadvocacy on behalf of American workers, the fair trade issues, and all \nof the things we have been debating in this Chamber now for the last \ncouple of years on this subject.\n  People might ask, Why is the Senator from North Dakota speaking so \nenthusiastically or fervently on behalf of the citizens of Louisiana? \nHe does not represent the State.\n  As a Senator, we all represent all of the people of the Nation, and \nthe Senator from North Dakota is this Chamber's leading expert on \ncontracts and contract abuse, not only at home but abroad in Iraq. He \nhas been to this floor more times than I can count and has my great \nrespect and the respect of many in this body for his work in trying to \nferret out the great abuse in contracts, whether overseas or at home, \nso that American tax dollars can be spent well and wisely. He is never \nceasing in his advocacy, and I thank him for continuing by calling a \nhearing not on contractor abuse in Iraq, on which he has conducted \nmany, but contractor abuse and the abuse of Louisiana workers relative \nto the Katrina/Rita fiasco. So I wish to thank him and add just a few \nwords to what he said and to the information he has laid out and the \ntestimony that has been given because I did attend, along with Senator \nHarry Reid, Senator Carl Levin, and a few other Senators, a hearing \nearlier last week on this subject that shed some unbelievable light on \nthis situation and hopefully something we can correct.\n  I begin by saying that the people of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, \nand Texas, as I have said so many times on the floor, have really been \nthrough an unbelievable devastation of a natural disaster that has no \nparallel, has no peer. It was not just the two hurricanes that hit \nwithin 10 days of each other--the east side of the State first, the \nwest side of the State second, parts of Texas in Rita's path as well--\nbut the subsequent breaking of not 1 levee, not 2, but 17 levee breaks \nin the metropolitan area, an urban center, a highly dense center, a \nlarge American city, a vibrant and vital region of the Nation, as I \nhave said many times, the Nation's only energy coast.\n  When those levees broke after the hurricane winds died down, it left \na region 10 to 12 feet underwater; tens of thousands of homes, large \nand small, rich and poor, businesses underwater, businesses that have \nbeen making profits for 70, 100 years. We are an old city in an old \nplace. We are proud of the longstanding businesses we have.\n  When the hurricanes left, the levees broke, and finally, when the \nflood waters went down, we looked up, and we have 400,000 people who \nhave lost their jobs. These are people who are hard-working Americans, \ntaxpaying citizens. Many of them have never asked for any direct help \nfrom the Federal Government other than what everyone gets from their \nGovernment: good police, good fire protection, hopefully their streets \npaved, the potholes are kept to a minimum, schools for their children \nto go to, basic Government services that are required. Most of these \npeople have not asked for any particular Government help, and yet they \nfind themselves out of work, in a position to start building their city \nonly to find that the Federal system of awarding contracts, because of \ncertain rules, certain actions this administration has taken, and a \nlack of oversight, has allowed companies to come in from out of State \nand hire workers who are undocumented while literally pushing aside \nLouisiana citizens who have the skills to rebuild and the desperate \nneed, the obvious need, for the job itself.\n  In the case Senator Byron Dorgan has brought to our attention, as the \nhearing went on last week, about 75 electricians from the area that was \naffected--many of those electricians had\n\n[[Page S11760]]\n\nlost their homes. Their homes had been flooded. Some of them had run \nbusinesses on the side that they had lost. Their families had been \nplaced into some safe place somewhere in the region. These men, most of \nthe men--some of them could have been female electricians--came back at \nthe request of a former employer who said, Would you all come back and \nhelp us build the barracks, the Navy base, the Belle Chasse base, in \ntheir own backyards?\n  These are residents who could look across the highway, who have \nworked at Belle Chasse before, who put up the electrical work at Belle \nChasse, who were hired by a contractor and brought to work. After a few \ndays, another contractor comes into the base, as the story is told, and \nbasically hands these Louisiana workers a pink slip and says, If you do \nnot mind, could you all please leave the base, and then ushers in 10, \n20, 30, 40, 100--who knows what the investigation will show--workers \nnot from Louisiana--and some of the workers are not even eligible to \nwork in the United States of America--to work on an American military \nbase.\n  Last week, I had the distinct honor of sitting in my Senate office \nand having two or three electricians, men who are obviously used to a \nhard day's work--their hands looked pretty tough--with shoulders \nstooping and almost on the verge of tears looking at me as their \nSenator saying: Senator, explain this to me. My parish has just been \nruined by a hurricane. I have lost my house. I have worked my whole \nlife as an electrician, and on a military base in the United States of \nAmerica I am asked to leave so that an undocumented worker can take my \njob? I do not have an answer for them, but we need to find one because \nnobody in America will believe this is happening. It should not be \nhappening.\n  I will tell you why it happens--because when nobody is watching the \nstore and there is money being thrown out of this Chamber, $62 billion, \npeople grab for it. The people of Louisiana have been accused of \nlooting. I think maybe the camera needs to focus somewhere else. All we \nhave done as a delegation is asked for help for our ports, our \nhospitals. This is a city that has lost 75 percent of its revenue. The \nparish of Plaquemine and the parish of St. Bernard are virtually \nnonexistent. Every structure--and 100,000 people--has basically been \ndestroyed, and it is uninhabitable. We still have our refineries shut \ndown, our pipelines exposed, and all we get is excuse after excuse.\n  Our own workers show up and ask for a decent wage. Their wage was $22 \nan hour. If any Senator on this floor thinks that paying a man or a \nwoman $22 an hour, with some minimum benefits, to work 12 hours a day \nbecause the contract said if they want to work, they have to show up \nand work 12 hours a day, 7 days a week until further notice--so do not \ntell me these people did not want to work. They had to work without a \nday off, week after week, for $22 an hour. We are told that it is too \nmuch, we cannot afford to hire them, they can go on back and twiddle \ntheir thumbs while we have the undocumented workers rebuild this \nmilitary base. It should not be happening now. It should not be \nhappening in the future.\n  Today, I sent a letter to the Secretary of Homeland Security and the \nhead of INS and asked them to please enforce the laws that are on the \nbooks, please enforce the laws so that the 478,000 people who are \nunemployed throughout the gulf coast, from Mississippi, Alabama, \nLouisiana, and Texas, can have the first chance at a good job.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 18, 2005.\n     Hon. Michael Chertoff,\n     Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I have personally received compelling \n     evidence that U.S. immigration laws are being flagrantly \n     disregarded in the contracting and subcontracting for \n     Hurricane Katrina relief. The use of undocumented, illegal \n     workers in the construction industry is a lamentable reality. \n     However, if press accounts are true, the issue is quickly \n     becoming chronic along the Gulf Coast.\n       Under ordinary circumstances, the use of such workers would \n     require investigation, but perhaps no more so than other \n     violations of immigration law. Regrettably, these are not \n     ordinary circumstances. The use of undocumented workers in \n     federal contracts for hurricane relief and reconstruction \n     comes at the direct expense of hurricane victims. While my \n     state experiences unemployment rates not seen since the Great \n     Depression, it is unconscionable that illegal workers would \n     be brought into Louisiana aggravating our employment crisis \n     and depressing earnings for our workers.\n       While there is a specific instance at the Belle Chasse \n     Naval Air Station that I believe warrants particular \n     scrutiny, a variety of press accounts lead me to believe the \n     problem is widespread. I am equally confident that immediate \n     and rigorous prosecution of these illegal activities would \n     quickly stem this tide.\n       I respectfully request that you direct Assistant Secretary \n     Clark of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to \n     dispatch a team of additional immigration enforcement and \n     investigations officers to the Gulf Coast region. \n     Furthermore, I request that the Department institute a zero \n     tolerance policy for the use of illegal workers in government \n     contracts for reconstruction. Finally, I ask that this be \n     done expeditiously, as time is of the essence.\n       Mr. Secretary, I appreciate your attention to this matter. \n     I look forward to your response and your plan to uphold U.S. \n     immigration law at this vital juncture.\n       With warmest regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Mary L. Landrieu,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I know people are going to debate about Davis-Bacon, \nbut I just want to tell the American people this point: When the \nPresident issued the order and basically said, right after Katrina, \nwaive all the labor laws that allow people to be paid a fair wage, he \nsaid he was doing that to save money. How does one save money on a no-\nbid contract? If a contract is not being put out for bid, how does one \nsave any money? All that happens is wages of the people who need them \nthe most at a time when they have lost everything are driven down. They \nare not asking for charity. They are not asking for a handout. They \nstood up to get a job to work 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, and still \nwere basically under the administrative rules of waiving Davis-Bacon, \nlack of oversight and lack of focus, and have basically been asked to \nleave the military base.\n  So I hope that in the few weeks ahead, we can get these electricians \nback on the job, back to their homes, back to their neighborhoods to \nrebuild, and build some support in this Chamber and around America for \npaying people a decent wage. I do not think $22 is too much. I do not \nexpect people to rebuild Louisiana at a minimum wage or $8 or $9 an \nhour without benefits.\n  People have to make a living. That amounts to about $45,000 a year. \nIs that too much to pay someone working 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, \ndoing hard and sometimes dangerous work? I don't think so. But \nevidently somebody in Washington thinks that is too much because, \ninstead of holding wages steady--not asking for union wages, but asking \nfor an average wage, between union and nonunion, which seems fair to \nme--we are undercutting our workers. The Government should not mandate \na union wage to be paid, but neither should we undercut our workers. So \nthe prevailing wage is what we have come up with, to say don't pay \nunion, don't pay nonunion, pay something in the middle, the average \nwage: $18, $20, $22 an hour for skilled labor. That is not too much to \nask. But evidently it is.\n  Even if people can get these jobs back, under the policies of this \nadministration, they will be told: You can work, so be happy and smile \nthat we are going to pay you $9 an hour, on which you cannot even feed \nyour family, invest in your pension, or send your children to school. \nYou should smile and be happy you have a job.\n  People in Louisiana want more respect than that. They deserve more \nrespect than that. The people along the gulf coast are, as I have said \nmany times, honest, hardworking, and self-reliant. We do not come here \nasking for charity, but we do come here asking for help out of our \nNational Treasury to which we have contributed so much over 300 years \nof hard work and toil to build the Nation's only energy coast. We are \nproud to do it, proud to take the risks associated with that hard \nwork--building a port system, the greatest in the North American \nContinent, and building commerce that allows every State and every \nparish and every county in America to flourish. Without this port \nsystem, without this energy coast, our Nation would not be what it is \ntoday.\n\n[[Page S11761]]\n\n  Despite all the ridicule we received, despite all of the snide \nremarks we have heard about public corruption and that we can't do \nanything for ourselves and we are disorganized, we are going to still \nhold our heads up, proud, tell our story, and demand to be treated with \nrespect and dignity as every American would want to be treated--Black \nand White, Asian and Hispanic, young and old, rich and poor.\n  In conclusion, I thank Senator Dorgan for his focus on this. I will \ncontinue to come to the floor and to be at hearings with him, to help \nhim, to hopefully build the kind of system and oversight that will \nallow us to give out contracts more efficiently, to make sure the work \nis going to gulf coast contractors, reputable contractors. There are \nmany good contractors who treat their workers beautifully. There are \nmany businesses, despite the fact they have no money coming in the \ndoor, that have kept their workers on the payroll, trying to hold heart \nand soul together and hold our community together while the Federal \nGovernment twiddles its thumbs and comes up with excuses about why it \ncannot help.\n  Let me be quick to compliment the many good contractors and many good \nbusinesses, small and large. But when we see this kind of irresponsible \ncontracting, it makes a tough situation even so much worse. So I hope \nthis letter will be responded to, that actions can be taken by other \ncommittees that have oversight so we can make sure we are spending the \nAmerican taxpayer dollar well, that we are giving the preference, as \nrequired in the current law, to those affected by the storms and the \nunfortunate disaster itself, and then paying people a decent wage when \nwe ask them to do work for their community and for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as chairman of the Budget Committee, I \nregularly comment on appropriations bills that are brought to this \nSenate for consideration and present the financial comparisons and \nbudgetary data.\n  The pending Labor, HHS, Education Appropriations bill provides $141.7 \nbillion in discretionary budget authority and $141.4 billion in \ndiscretionary outlays for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education, and related agencies for fiscal year 2006.\n  Also included in the bill is $405.3 billion in mandatory budget \nauthority and $405.2 billion in mandatory outlays for FY 2006. With \noutlays from prior-years, amounts declared as an emergency--$300 \nmillion for LIHEAP and $19 million for Refugee Assistance--and other \ncompleted actions, the Senate bill totals $547.3 billion in budget \nauthority and $546.6 billion in outlays for FY 2006.\n  These amounts would technically represent a decrease of 0.8 percent \nin discretionary budget authority and a decrease of 0.2 percent in \ndiscretionary outlays from the 2005 enacted levels. However, when \ntaking into account the SSI pay date shift into FY 2007 and emergency \nappropriations, the bill provides $2.5 billion or a 1.7 percent \nincrease in discretionary funding over the FY 2005 enacted level.\n  As originally reported, the level of budget authority was precisely \nat the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation while the outlays amount was \n$1.1 billion below the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. However, \nbecause the bill assumes erectile dysfunction drug savings--$105 \nmillion--that were recently enacted into law by HR 3971 for Katrina \nrelated unemployment insurance costs--and the QI and TMA extensions--\nthis bill is now $15 million over the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation \nand is subject to a 302(f) point of order.\n  The committee-reported bill also delays $3.36 billion in SSI payments \nto elderly and disabled individuals--an amount equivalent to one \nmonth's worth of FY 2006 SSI obligations--from fiscal year 2006 into \nfiscal year 2007. The original purpose of this shift was to allow for \n$3.4 billion in additional non-defense discretionary spending in FY \n2006 that otherwise would put the bill over its 302(b) allocation, \nthereby exceeding the discretionary spending limit agreed to with the \nHouse in this year's budget resolution.\n  Not only could this action result in a hardship for the elderly and \ndisabled on fixed incomes by delaying their ability to make their \nmonthly rent payments, this accounting gimmick constitutes an advance \nappropriation that is unauthorized as well as exceeds the total level \nof allowed advance appropriations for fiscal year 2007 as set out under \nsection 401(b) of the fiscal year 2006 budget resolution. As a result, \na point of order lies against this bill for making an unauthorized \nadvanced appropriation; if raised, the point of order may be waived \nonly by an affirmative vote of 60 Members of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n H.R. 3010, 2006 LABOR, HHS AND EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS BILL--SPENDING\n                    COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                     [Fiscal Year 2006, $ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     General\n                                     Purpose     Mandatory      Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n    Budget authority.............      141,668      405,311      546,979\n    Outlays......................      141,365      405,171      546,536\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority.............      141,653      405,311      546,964\n    Outlays......................      142,472      405,171      547,643\n2005 Enacted:\n    Budget authority.............      142,843      354,444      497,287\n    Outlays......................      141,596      354,189      495,785\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority.............      141,450      402,591      544,041\n    Outlays......................      143,015      404,083      547,098\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority.............      142,513      402,591      545,104\n    Outlays......................      143,708      404,083      547,791\nSenate-Reported Bill Compared to:\n    Senate 302(b) allocation:\n        Budget authority.........           15            0           15\n        Outlays..................       -1,107            0       -1,107\n    2005 Enacted:\n        Budget authority.........       -1,175       50,867       49,692\n        Outlays..................         -231       50,982       50,751\n    President's request:\n        Budget authority.........          218        2,720        2,938\n        Outlays..................       -1,650        1,088         -562\n    House-passed bill:\n        Budget authority.........         -845        2,720        1,875\n        Outlays..................       -2,343        1,088       -1,255\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding. Totals adjusted for\n  consistency with scorekeeping conventions.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today we are considering the \nappropriations bill reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee to \nfund the Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services, \nthe Department of Education, and related agencies for the next fiscal \nyear, 2006. I am especially grateful to the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, \nwho has guided this legislation through a process of hearings to \nexamine the administration's request, the bill passed by the other body \nfunding these Departments, and requests of Members of the Senate for \nprograms to be funded in this legislation. He and the ranking member of \nthe committee, Senator Harkin, have worked very hard and diligently to \nbring the Senate a bill that is both responsible but sensitive to the \nneeds of the people who are served by the programs funded in this bill.\n  An example of the important appropriations provisions is those \nrelating to low-income heating assistance. Over $2 billion of funding \nis provided in this bill to help those who are going to have \ndifficulties meeting the payments for their heating bills during this \nwinter.\n  There is an account in the Department of Education to provide \nassistance to low-income people who are seeking to improve themselves \nthrough higher education. Over $14 billion is included in this \nlegislation for education for the disadvantaged account.\n  There is also money in here for medical research at the Department of \nHealth and Human Services and also for the activities at the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  Included in the bill is $29.41 billion for NIH. This is above the \nlevel requested by the President, but in my judgment and in the \njudgment of the other members of this committee, it is needed. It is an \nimportant investment to help find new ways of dealing with diseases, to \nprevent illnesses, to do those things that will make America a \nhealthier and, from an economic standpoint, more effective country.\n  There are many other provisions in this bill we could mention, but \nthe Senators have already heard the bill described by the distinguished \nchairman of the subcommittee. There will\n\n[[Page S11762]]\n\nbe opportunity for discussion of individual amendments, if there are \nany, and I am sure there will be some for the Senate's consideration. \nBut this is the final appropriations bill that will be considered in \nthe regular appropriations process by the Senate this year. It is \nimportant that we notice the House has passed all of its appropriations \nbills and they did so early in the year. A lot of credit ought to be \ngiven to the distinguished gentleman from California, Mr. Lewis, who is \nchairman of the House Appropriations Committee, in getting that work \ndone and getting it done early in the year so the bills could come over \nto the Senate and give us an opportunity to review them and carefully \nconsider the legislation.\n  I also want to point out that our committee works on a bipartisan \nbasis. That is possible because of the cooperation of the distinguished \nranking member of the committee, the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. \nByrd. He is a former chairman of this committee, with a tremendous \namount of knowledge of the legislation, and he has contributed in \nhelping ensure the cooperation of all members of the committee, \nDemocrats working with the Republicans, to report these bills to the \nSenate. It is a bipartisan effort and I think that is important for us \nas we complete our consideration of these bills this year.\n  We have had three bills passed with conference reports approved and \nthey have been signed by the President. There are seven bills that have \nbeen passed by the Senate that are in conference with the House. The \nimportance of this effort is to ensure that we can pass these bills on \nan individual basis and not have to resort to adding them all together, \nputting them all in one legislative vehicle as an omnibus \nappropriations bill, as we have seen happen in the past.\n  One other point that needs to be made is that, were it not for the \ncooperation of the leadership, we would not have been able to have the \nbills considered on an individual basis. That has been very important \nto the success of this enterprise and this effort. So the distinguished \nmajority leader, in cooperation with the minority leader, has ensured \nthat the Appropriations Committee has had time in the Senate to \nconsider these bills on an individual basis, and that has been very \nimportant. It is our hope we will be able to complete action on all the \nbills and get them to the President so there will not be any delay in \nthe planned adjournment of the Senate at Thanksgiving, as has been \nannounced by the distinguished leader. We are hopeful we will be able \nto have time to reach agreement in conference with our House colleagues \nand get all of these remaining bills to the President for his signature \nbefore we adjourn at Thanksgiving.\n  Thank you all for the efforts you have made to cooperate with our \ncommittee to consider these bills in an orderly process. I think it is \ngoing to result in a better product, a more thoughtful approach to the \nappropriations process, and the people of this country will benefit \nfrom this record of achievement by the members of the committees and \nall of the Members of both bodies.\n  There are 72 Senators who are not members of the Appropriations \nCommittee. Any one of them has the power to offer any amendment on any \nbill at any time during the consideration of these individual bills. If \nwe had to group them all as an omnibus bill, it would take away from \nthe opportunity each Senator has to participate in this process. So I \nthank all 72 Senators who have taken an active role in helping assure \nthe success of this operation this year.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Nomination of Harry Sandlin Mattice, Jr.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few moments we will begin two rollcall \nvotes. The second of those votes will be on the nomination of Harry S. \n``Sandy'' Mattice, Jr.\n  I hesitated a little bit because it is Harry S. Mattice, but nobody \ncalls him that. It is Sandy to those of us who are his good friends and \nadmirers.\n  The nomination is to serve on the United States District Court for \nthe Eastern District of Tennessee.\n  I have known Sandy for many years and am proud to give him my \nabsolute highest recommendation to serve on the Federal bench.\n  He is a native of Chattanooga, TN. He has nearly 17 years of \nexperience as a practicing attorney, focusing primarily on business \ninvestigations, including securities and tax and white-collar crimes.\n  He currently serves as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of \nTennessee, and in that role he manages Federal prosecutions for \nTennessee's largest judicial district which encompasses 41 counties and \n2.5 million Tennesseans.\n  Sandy will be an outstanding Federal judge. He is smart, he has a \nrock-solid work ethic, he respects his colleagues, and in turn has \nearned their respect and widespread admiration.\n  Throughout his entire career, Sandy has proved his merit as a skilled \nattorney and a talented prosecutor.\n  The American Bar Association gave him its highest possible rating, \n``unanimously well-qualified,'' to serve as a Federal judge.\n  In addition to his many professional qualifications, Sandy is an \nhonest person of the highest integrity. He is devoted to his family and \nis active in his local community.\n  I have absolutely no doubt that Sandy will serve with honor on the \nFederal bench.\n  As we prepare to vote, I urge my colleagues to support the nomination \nof this truly outstanding and distinguished Tennessean.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I join the majority leader. The \nPresident has made a wise decision.\n  I respectfully say, in choosing Sandy Mattice, by scholarship, by \nexperience, by integrity, by background he should be an excellent \njudge.\n  I should say, also, that he follows an excellent judge, Al Edgar. We \nare contemporaries. We grew up at the same time, same age, in towns \nclose to one another.\n  Sandy Mattice has big shoes to fill, but he will fill them well; he \nis well-qualified. I salute the President for his outstanding \nappointment and I join the majority leader in expressing my pride in \nthe nomination and look forward to his confirmation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/24/senate-section/article/S11762-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11762-S11763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF BRIAN EDWARD SANDOVAL TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                       FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEVADA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 5:30 \nhaving arrived, the Senate will proceed to executive session to \nconsider Executive Calendar No. 385, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Brian Edward Sandoval, \nof Nevada, to be United States District Judge for the District of \nNevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be a period of 2 minutes of \ndebate equally divided prior to the vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are voting on a lifetime appointment of \nBrian Sandoval to be a U.S. District Judge for the District of Nevada.\n  Brian Sandoval is presently the attorney general of the State of \nNevada. This is an elected position. I have known Brian Sandoval for \nmany years. He served previously in the Nevada State Legislature as an \nassemblyman. He served as Chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission. \nBrian Sandoval was recommended by this Senator to be a Federal judge. \nAt the time I made that recommendation, I knew he was a Republican. \nWhen the Democrats had control of the Senate and we had a Democratic \nPresident, I asked Brian Sandoval at that time if he would be agreeable \nto my sending his name to the President. He said he was not ready at \nthat time.\n  My friend, the junior Senator from the State of Nevada, when he \nlearned there was going to be a Republican President, said that he \nwould allow me to recommend every fourth district court judge. This is \nsomething he did not have to do. He did it to be nice, and I appreciate \nthat. That is how I came\n\n[[Page S11763]]\n\nto have the opportunity to send the name of Brian Sandoval to the \nPresident.\n  There is a lot of controversy over judges, but I think Brian Sandoval \nis the kind of person who should become a judge. He has not generated \ncontroversy. That is because he is a person who, in all of his \nactivities, has been very bipartisan and fair. As a judge, he will be \nnonpartisan. He comes from a good family. Frankly, the reason he \ndecided to leave elected office to be a judge is because he felt \nspending the time it takes to campaign and raise money took away from \nhis family, his wife Kathleen and his children James, Madeline and \nMarisa. I am paraphrasing what he told me. But he said: I didn't want \nto be in Alcoa when my children are involved in extracurricular \nactivities. I should be there.\n  These are choices we all have to make. I am confident Brian Sandoval \nmade the best choice for him, his family, the State of Nevada, and the \ncountry. He will be a fine judge. I am honored to have the opportunity \nto recommend him. The Senate will vote for him overwhelmingly, and he \nwill not disappoint us in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, over the past several weeks, Congress has \ntaken great efforts to address the disruption that Hurricane Katrina, \nfollowed by Hurricane Rita, have inflicted on the good people of our \ngulf coast region. While Congress is acutely aware of the need for \nfunding for food, clothing, shelter and medical care for the evacuees \nand residents of this region, we are only now becoming aware of some of \nthe longer term needs of these devastated communities.\n  All of the States impacted by these hurricanes, including not just \nthose directly hit by the storms but also the numerous States which \nhave come to the aid of evacuees will be holding Federal elections in \njust a few short months. The displacement of nearly 1.5 million people \nraises a somewhat unique continuity of government issue for our \ndemocracy: how to ensure that the citizens of these States are able to \nparticipate in the upcoming Federal elections next year, as well as in \nnumerous State and local elections between now and then. It is simply \nnot acceptable that a loss of one's home may mean a loss of one's \naccess to the ballot box. And yet, many of these States are facing \nunknown hurdles in ensuring that their displaced residents can vote in \nthe next Federal election.\n  The Rules Committee, under the very capable leadership of the \nChairman, Senator Lott, has already begun meeting with the election \nofficials of these affected States to determine what they will need to \nensure that all eligible citizens will be able to participate in the \n2006 Federal elections, regardless of the condition of their community \nor the location of their evacuated citizens. Under the auspices of the \nU.S. Election Assistance Commission, efforts are underway to identify \nFederal resources and assistance that is already available to the \nStates to replace voting systems, polling places, and to assist in \nfacilitating absentee voting.\n  However, at this point, many of these impacted States simply do not \nknow the extent of the damage to election records or how to reach out \nto displaced citizens to ensure that they have access to absentee \nballots or alternative polling facilities. While we are hopeful that \nthe majority of the needs will be met through existing resources, I \nremain concerned that these States, and those who have stepped up to \nthe plate to receive evacuees, will face additional expenses in \nensuring the right to vote for the citizens of the gulf coast region.\n  The Election Assistance Commission, EAC, is charged with serving as a \nnational clearinghouse and resource of information and procedures with \nrespect to the administration of Federal elections and with \ndistributing over $3 billion in Federal funds to the States to \nimplement the requirements of the Help America Vote Act of 2002, HAVA, \nof which I was honored to be the primary Senate author. I applaud the \nefforts of the EAC to spearhead the efforts to identify and respond to \nthe needs of these States in administering our Federal elections next \nyear. However, I remain concerned that without additional resources, \nthese States will face significant hurdles to ensuring that all \neligible citizens have an equal opportunity to vote and have their vote \ncounted.\n  While Congress has appropriated over $3 billion to date to implement \nthe requirements of the Help America Vote Act, Congress has underfunded \nthe authorization by over $800 million. At least one of the impacted \nStates has already notified staff that they are short in funding to \nimplement the HAVA requirements and face additional unmet need due to \nthe impact of Hurricane Katrina.\n  While I am hopeful that sufficient other Federal resources will be \nidentified and made available to these States for conducting the \nFederal elections next year, it will not be acceptable if citizens of \nthe Gulf Coast States are disenfranchised because their States and \nlocalities simply do not have the resources to replace destroyed voting \nsystems, provide alternative polling places, print absentee ballots or \nreconstruct lost voting registration records.\n  As the ranking member of the Senate Rules Committee which has \noversight jurisdiction over Federal elections, I intend to ensure that \nthese States, and these citizens, are able to fully participate in the \nFederal election next year. Our distinguished Chairman, Senator Lott, \nwhose State was in the path of both hurricanes, is keenly aware of this \nsituation and I commend him for his leadership and attention to this \nissue. I know he shares my concern that as we learn the full extent of \nthis problem, the Committee will act to ensure these communities and \ncitizens can exercise their fundamental right to vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. First of all, I want to thank my good friend the senior \nSenator from Connecticut and ranking member of the Rules Committee, \nwhich I chair, for participating in this important discussion about the \nelection-related challenges that the Gulf Coast States face in the \naftermath of Hurricane Katrina. While the full extent of the damage to \nthe election infrastructure cannot yet be precisely quantified, we know \nit was wide-ranging. For example, in my home county, Jackson County, \nMS, it appears that hundreds of voting booths and large amounts of \nvoting equipment were destroyed as was the building that houses the \ncounty election commission. In neighboring Harrison County, we \nunderstand that all the polling places located near the coast were \nleveled. And in Hancock County, MS, all of the voting machines were \ndestroyed and nearly every polling place was either completely \nflattened or otherwise rendered uninhabitable.\n  We have heard similar reports from the state of Louisiana. According \nto state election officials, early estimates are that the State lost \nover 500 polling places and over 2,000 voting machines, with some \nparishes reporting that all of their voting equipment was destroyed. \nThus, it is clear that a major commitment of resources will be needed \nto rebuild polling places and replace voting machines that were damaged \nor destroyed by Hurricane Katrina.\n  But restoring damaged election infrastructure in the areas impacted \nby Hurricane Katrina is not the only election-related challenge to be \nsurmounted. Hundreds of thousands of citizens in Louisiana and \nMississippi had to be relocated as a result of Hurricane Katrina, in \nmany instances to other States. Large numbers of these evacuees will \nnot be able to return to their home communities in the immediate \nfuture. For these citizens, casting absentee ballots will be the \nprimary, if not only, method by which they will able to be fully able \nto participate in upcoming elections that will affect the rebuilding \nefforts in their communities. Consequently, the demand for absentee \nballots in the impacted areas will increase by many orders of magnitude \nduring the coming months. We are already learning that additional \nworkers may need to be hired to handle\n\n[[Page S11765]]\n\nthe increased number of absentee ballot requests that are anticipated. \nSo, as we can plainly see, election officials in jurisdictions impacted \nby Hurricane Katrina will face numerous logistical challenges as they \nprepare to conduct upcoming elections.\n  We understand that FEMA, under its Public Assistance Program, is \nobligated to cover the expenses for replacing damaged voting equipment \nand restoring destroyed polling places in jurisdictions that have been \ndesignated Federal disaster areas. And for jurisdictions with upcoming \nelections but whose permanent polling places are currently \nuninhabitable, FEMA has a responsibility to pay the costs for setting \nup temporary polling places such as tents or trailers. The funding \nprovided by FEMA, if it is disbursed in a timely manner, should go a \nlong way towards restoring the election infrastructure in areas ravaged \nby Hurricane Katrina. It remains to be seen, however, whether such \nmonies will be sufficient to bolster all aspects of the voting systems \nthat were affected by the recent catastrophe.\n  As Chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over the \nadministration of Federal elections in our country, I along with the \nranking member, Senator Dodd, will continue to vigilantly monitor the \nsituation in the states impacted by Hurricane Katrina to ensure they \nare receiving the resources they need to fully restore their election \ninfrastructure to pre-Katrina levels. As more information becomes \navailable, we will assess whether additional funds may need to be \nappropriated to assist the impacted jurisdictions in reconstituting \ntheir election systems. We will also make sure FEMA follows through on \nits commitments and responsibilities.\n  In conclusion, the right to vote in the impacted regions of the Gulf \nCoast must not become a further casualty of Hurricane Katrina. We must \nwork to ensure that it does not. Essential election infrastructure will \nneed to be restored. And those who had to be evacuated as a result of \nHurricane Katrina and who continue to be displaced from their homes \nmust be afforded the full opportunity to participate in the democratic \nprocess in their home communities.\n  I again want to thank my friend Senator Dodd for his leadership on \nthe issue of election reform and look forward to continuing to work \nwith him on this important matter.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank our Chairman, and my good friend, and commend him \nfor his leadership on this issue. I look forward to working with him to \nensure that, no matter the devastation of this natural disaster, all \neligible citizens will be able to continue to participate in this \ndemocracy through the ballot box.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/24/senate-section/article/S11765-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        BREAST CANCER AWARENESS\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this month we observe National Breast \nCancer Awareness Month, and reflect on a disease that has touched \ncountless American lives. There are more than 3 million women living \nwith breast cancer in the United States and tens of thousands of women \ndie from breast cancer each year. Breast cancer is now the second \nleading cause of cancer deaths in American women. While important \nadvances have been made, the causes of this disease and the means to \nprevent it are still unknown.\n  Scientific evidence about what aspects of the environment play a role \nin the initiation and development of breast cancer also remains scarce. \nAlthough it is generally believed that there is a correlation between \nenvironmental factors and the prevalence of breast cancer, the extent \nof the environment's role is not well understood. Given the clear need \nto explore the potential relationship between the environment and \nbreast cancer, I have introduced S. 757, the Breast Cancer and \nEnvironmental Research Act. This bill would authorize $30 million per \nyear for 5 years for the National Institute of Environmental Health \nSciences, NIEHS, to award grants to study the relationship between \nenvironmental factors and breast cancer. Under a competitive, peer-\nreviewed grant making process, the Director of NIEHS would award grants \nfor the development and operation of up to eight centers for the \npurpose of conducting multidisciplinary research. The bill would seek \nto foster community collaboration between the research centers, \npatients, and the patient advocacy organizations.\n  The targeted research proposed in S. 757 holds the promise for a \nbetter understanding of the causes of breast cancer, breakthroughs in \nprevention and treatment, and ultimately a cure. For this reason, I \nurge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring S. 757 so that we may \nwork together toward Senate passage this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/24/senate-section/article/S11765-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                            Steven A. Valdez\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I honor the life of a young Arkansan \nwho, in the name of freedom, paid the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of \nthe Nation he loved. Steven A. Valdez was a brave soldier who died a \nhero in a foreign land, but he was also a caring young man who deeply \nloved his family and friends and they were never far from his mind.\n  Those who knew Lance Corporal Valdez from his childhood in McRea, a \nsmall north-central Arkansas town, remember him as competitive, \nenergetic and fun loving. He graduated from Beebe High School in 2004 \nand, soon after, followed the footsteps of his older brother Glenn \nSkaggs, and his grandfather Billy Skaggs, into the United States Marine \nCorps.\n  In November of 2004, LCpl Valdez reported to the Marine Corps Base at \nKaneohe Bay, Hawaii. Serving with the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine \nRegiment, he was deployed to Afghanistan in June as a machine gun \noperator with Weapons Platoon Company E. Within the year, his family \nreceived a letter from the Marines, which cited Valdez's promotion to \nLance Corporal and praised him for going above and beyond what was \nasked or expected of him. While serving in Afghanistan, LCpl Valdez was \nstationed at Camp Blessing. The camp is located in eastern Afghanistan, \nin the foothills of the Hindu Kush mountains near the Pakistani border, \nand serves as a forward operating base for intelligence and military \noperations aimed to train Afghan security forces and track down al-\nQaeda terrorists. He served with a platoon of Marines guarding the \ncamp.\n  While serving in Afghanistan, LCpl Valdez and his grandfather, Billy, \nhad an agreement; Billy would send care packages with his grandson's \nfavorite snacks and items from home, but he would also include phone \ncards with the expectation that the young marine would call his \ngrandfather once a week. For LCpl Valdez, it was a much needed respite \nfrom the stresses of war that allowed him to feel a little closer to \nhome; for Billy, it was reassuring to hear his grandson's voice and to \nknow that he was safe and healthy.\n  On September 26, insurgents attacked Camp Blessing with mortar, \nrocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire. LCpl Valdez was struck \nby shrapnel from a mortar while running to his machine gun post. The \nbrave 20-year-old died shortly after.\n  In remembering their loved one, LCpl Valdez's proud grandfather \nspeaks of him as a ``true hero.'' When his brother, Sergeant Glenn \nSkaggs, returns to Iraq, he will be concerned about his own well-being, \nbut only in the sense that he doesn't want to put his family through \nanother grieving process. Despite these concerns, in a manner typical \nof this courageous and selfless family, he proudly states ``My brother \nwas over there for something he believed in, and I want to help finish \nit.''\n  Although Steven Valdez may no longer be with us, his legacy and his \nspirit will forever live on in our hearts. On behalf of a grateful \nNation, my thoughts and prayers go out his family, friends, and all who \nknew and loved him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/24/senate-section/article/S11765-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11765-S11766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need \nfor hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduce hate crimes legislation that would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the \nfloor to highlight a separate hate\n\n[[Page S11766]]\n\ncrime that has occurred in our country.\n  On August 8, 2005, in Montrose, CO, two men were charged in the \nmurder of Kevin Hale in what police are saying may be classified as a \nhate crime. Todd Fisk and Adam Hernandez got into a physical \naltercation with Hale. During the altercation, Fiske grabbed Hale by \nthe neck and strangled him to death. According to police, Hale had \nreceived a number of physical threats from Fiske due to his sexual \norientation.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/24/senate-section/article/S11766-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              UNITED STATES-ISRAEL ENERGY COOPERATION ACT\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1862, \nthe United States-Israel Energy Cooperation Act of 2005, which I \nintroduced on October 7, 2005. This bill is designed to promote \nbinational collaboration in research, development, and \ncommercialization of alternative and renewable energy technologies.\n  Israel is a strong ally of the United States and our two nations have \na long history of mutual interest and successful collaboration in \nscientific research and technology development. Examples include the \nnumerous successes of the programs under the U.S.-Israel Binational \nScience Foundation, BSF, and the U.S.-Israel Binational Industrial \nResearch and Development Foundation, BIRD.\n  We also share an enduring interest in the development and \ncommercialization of alternative energy technologies that offer the \npromise of enhancing the energy security of both of our countries as \nwell as that of other nations. Israel and the United States have strong \ncapabilities in renewable and alternative technologies based on \nextensive research and development efforts. In 1996, the United States \nand Israel entered into an agreement fostering energy cooperation as a \nmeans of sharing the benefits of our capabilities.\n  Today, we are facing increasing concerns about adequate supplies and \nincreasing prices for both petroleum products and natural gas. In this \ncontext, it is especially important that we redouble our efforts to \ncooperate in the development of alternative energy systems. This bill \nestablishes a grant program within the Department of Energy to support \ncollaborative research, development, and commercialization projects in \nalternative renewable energy.\n  The program will provide grants for joint venture projects between \nU.S. and Israeli institutions meeting the program qualifications \nestablished by the Secretary of Energy. The bill authorizes funding of \n$20 million for each of the fiscal years 2006 through 2012. \nTechnologies include: solar, biomass, energy efficiency, wind, and \nother types as determined by the Secretary. Proposals may be submitted \neither to the Secretary or to either of the binational research \nfoundations, BSF and BIRD. This provision enables utilization of the \nestablished practices of those existing foundations for implementation \nof at least half of the funds granted for collaborative projects. To \nassure sound management of this grants program, this bill calls on the \nSecretary of Energy to establish an Advisory Board, including \nrepresentatives of both the United States and Israel.\n  I thank the American Jewish Congress, the American Israeli Public \nAffairs Committee, and others for all their efforts and input on this \nbill.\n  In light of increasing concerns about the security of affordable \nenergy supplies, I urge consideration of this bill as a means of \ncapitalizing on considerable capabilities of the United States and \nIsrael to move toward broader use of these clean and indigenous energy \nresources. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this \nimportant bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/24/senate-section/article/S11766-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEASURES REFERRED\n\n  The following bill was read the first and the second times by \nunanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n       H.R. 3893.

A bill to improve the provision of telehealth services under \nthe Medicare Program, to provide grants for the development of \ntelehealth networks, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the introduction \nof my bill, the Medicare Telehealth Enhancement Act of 2005.\n  Now, not all of us live in the big city--like New York City or \nChicago--but that should not mean that all of us cannot receive the \nsame quality health care. Since I have been in office, I have spent a \nlot of time making sure that folks who live out in the hinterland--like \nthe small towns of Scobey or Jordan or Wolf Point across Montana--still \nget quality health care, like everyone else. I do not want distance to \nbe a barrier to care.\n  One of the ways we have bridged these divides is through telehealth--\nactually using technology to draw people together and deliver care. \nNow, across the great State of Montana, we have doctors consulting with \npatients who may be 200 or 300 miles away. That means those folks who \nlive in the middle of nowhere do not have to drive 400 miles roundtrip, \njust to get a medical opinion on symptoms they may have or minor \nchanges which may need to be made to their diabetes equipment, or \nfeedback from an x-ray at a local clinic, from a specialist. That is a \nbig deal, especially when roads are icy and the temperature is below \nzero.\n  I have sponsored the Medicare Telehealth Enhancement Act of 2005, \nwhich is a bill to improve the provisions of telehealth services under \nthe Medicare Program and provide grants for the development of \ntelehealth networks.\n  Specifically, my bill will: facilitate the provision of telehealth \nservices across State lines, Licensure, as it affects providers who \nconsult diagnose across State lines, remains a significant barrier to \naccessing such services, and call for Medicare reimbursement for remote \nmedical and health services for all remaining institutions eligible to \nparticipate in Medicare but not currently eligible to be reimbursed for \ntelemedicine/telehealth services.\n  Include an expansion of Medicare-covered originating telehealth \nsites, prioritizing eligibility for nursing homes, dialysis centers, \nand community-based mental health centers.\n  Revise ``originating site'' language to ensure telehealth service \nproviders are reimbursement-eligible when patients are located at sites \nwith telehealth capabilities, regardless of originating site \ndesignation.\n  Expand Medicare reimbursement for telehealth services to all \ngeographical areas, recognizing eligibility for telehealth sites among \nurban populations as well as rural and underserved populations.\n  Allow for ``eligible practitioners'' furnishing telehealth services \nto include physical and occupational therapists, speech-language \npathologists, and other certified providers, as well as those the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services approves.\n  Amend Medicare coverage to all remaining medical services currently \ncovered under the CPT procedure codes but not eligible to be reimbursed \nwhen provided via telemedicine/telehealth, and medical services that \nare provided using store-and-forward technology.\n  Authorize a grant program through the Office for the Advancement of \nTelehealth of HRSA for the development of telehealth networks and \ndefines nonprofit and for-profit alliances as grant-eligible provided \nthe grant recipient is a nonprofit.\n  Reauthorize the Telehealth Network and Telehealth Resource Centers \ngrant programs through 2012.\n  Shortages of health care workers across the spectrum are nothing new.\n\n[[Page S11770]]\n\nWe have all witnessed this disturbing trend of shortages in nursing, \nradiology, mental health professions, and many other health \nprofessionals for quite some time. While the ultimate solution to this \nproblem lies in a variety of actions, telehealth has proven a solution \nto this mounting crisis. I have long supported efforts in technology to \nimprove the efficiency and quality of health care, and make it easier \nfor folks in rural areas to get the health services they need. \nTelehealth is one answer to the access and affordability problems \nfacing health care today, and I hope my bill will increase the ease \nwith which folks obtain their critical health services.\n  Telehealth applications have a record of cutting costs, increasing \nchoice and reducing medical errors in facilities and communities across \nthe country. Telehealth also provides services to elderly who may not \notherwise be able to get to a health care facility for care. This is \ngrowing increasingly important in rural America--especially in my State \nof Montana. Montana's demographics have been changing over the past few \nyears, and our health care providers continue to see more and more \npatients over the age of 65. We now have more elderly people per capita \nthan most States in the union, and by 2025, Montana is predicted to \nrank third in the Nation in the number of people over the age of 65.\n  We must charge forward to modernize and improve healthcare through \nthe application of information technology. Healthcare expenditures in \n2003 totaled $1.7 trillion--a number that is growing faster than the \noverall economy. Increased adoption of health information technology \nhas the potential to save this country billions of dollars and \nthousands of lives. I want to do what I can to bring more money to the \nState of Montana for telehealth services and expand the availability of \nthese services to more patients in more areas than ever before. I will \ncontinue my efforts, both through bringing money to Montana to make \nthis happen and by passing meaningful, common-sense legislation to get \nrid of the over-burdensome red-tape that often gets in the way of good \ncare.\n  I think it is essential to bring quality health care to all comers of \nMontana and other rural States. It is high time we bring back the \ndynamic days of these frontier areas by creating and maintaining \nvibrant and thriving communities, which have so much to offer their \nresidents, including one of the most important basic needs--health \ncare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/24/senate-section/article/S11770-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2194.

ADVANCE DIRECTIVES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Every year 2,500,000 people die in the United States. \n     Eighty percent of those people die in institutions such as \n     hospitals, nursing homes, and other facilities. Chronic \n     illnesses, such as cancer and heart disease, account for 2 \n     out of every 3 deaths.\n       (2) In January 2004, a study published in the Journal of \n     the American Medical Association concluded that many people \n     dying in institutions have unmet medical, psychological, and \n     spiritual needs. Moreover, family members of decedents who \n     received care at home with hospice services were more likely \n     to report a favorable dying experience.\n       (3) In 1997, the Supreme Court of the United States, in its \n     decisions in Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, \n     reaffirmed the constitutional right of competent adults to \n     refuse unwanted medical treatment. In those cases, the Court \n     stressed the use of advance directives as a means of \n     safeguarding that right should those adults become incapable \n     of deciding for themselves.\n       (4) A study published in 2002 estimated that the overall \n     prevalence of advance directives is between 15 and 20 percent \n     of the general population, despite the passage of the Patient \n     Self-Determination Act in 1990, which requires that health \n     care providers tell patients about advance directives.\n       (5) Competent adults should complete advance care plans \n     stipulating their health care decisions in the event that \n     they become unable to speak for themselves. Through the \n     execution of advance directives, including living wills and \n     durable powers of attorney for health care according to the \n     laws of the State in which they reside, individuals can \n     protect their right to express their wishes and have them \n     respected.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to improve \n     access to information about individuals' health care options \n     and legal rights for care near the end of life, to promote \n     advance care planning and decisionmaking so that individuals' \n     wishes are known should they become unable to speak for \n     themselves, to engage health care providers in disseminating \n     information about and assisting in the preparation of advance \n     directives, which include living wills and durable powers of \n     attorney for health care, and for other purposes.\n       (c) Medicare Coverage of End-of-Life Planning and \n     Consultations as Part of Initial Preventive Physical \n     Examination.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 1861(ww) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(ww)) is amended--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``paragraph (2),'' and \n     inserting ``paragraph (2) and the end-of-life care services \n     described in paragraph (3),''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(3) The end-of-life care services described in this \n     paragraph include a discussion between the provider and the \n     individual of end-of-life care for the purpose of informing \n     the individual receiving such an examination regarding--\n       ``(A) situations where an advance directive might be \n     beneficial;\n\n[[Page S11772]]\n\n       ``(B) medical options available to such individual with \n     respect to end-of-life care;\n       ``(C) coverage of hospice care under this title; and\n       ``(D) such other issues relevant to end-of-life care as the \n     provider determines are appropriate.''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendments made by paragraph (1) \n     shall apply to initial preventive physical examinations \n     provided on or after the date that is 60 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Improvement of Policies Related to the Use and \n     Portability of Advance Directives.--\n       (1) Medicare.--Section 1866(f) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395cc(f)) is amended--\n       (A) in paragraph (1)--\n       (i) in subparagraph (B), by inserting ``and if presented by \n     the individual (or on behalf of the individual), to include \n     the content of such advance directive in a prominent part of \n     such record'' before the semicolon at the end;\n       (ii) in subparagraph (D), by striking ``and'' after the \n     semicolon at the end;\n       (iii) in subparagraph (E), by striking the period at the \n     end and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (iv) by inserting after subparagraph (E) the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(F) to provide each individual with the opportunity to \n     discuss issues relating to the information provided to that \n     individual pursuant to subparagraph (A) with an appropriately \n     trained professional.'';\n       (B) in paragraph (3), by striking ``a written'' and \n     inserting ``an''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(5)(A) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (1), \n     a provider of services, Medicare Advantage organization, or \n     prepaid or eligible organization (as the case may be) shall \n     give effect to an advance directive executed outside the \n     State in which such directive is presented, even one that \n     does not appear to meet the formalities of execution, form, \n     or language required by the State in which it is presented to \n     the same extent as such provider or organization would give \n     effect to an advance directive that meets such requirements, \n     except that a provider or organization may decline to honor \n     such a directive if the provider or organization can \n     reasonably demonstrate that it is not an authentic expression \n     of the individual's wishes concerning his or her health care. \n     Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to authorize the \n     administration of medical treatment otherwise prohibited by \n     the laws of the State in which the directive is presented.\n       ``(B) The provisions of this paragraph shall preempt any \n     State law to the extent such law is inconsistent with such \n     provisions.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of H.R. 1409, which was received from \nthe House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1409) to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 to provide assistance for orphans and other vulnerable \n     children in developing countries, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to comment on H.R. 1409, a companion \nbill to S. 350, the Assistance for Orphans and Other Vulnerable \nChildren in Developing Countries Act of 2005, which I introduced \nearlier this year. Prior to its passage, I want to address a concern \nthat the administration has raised about the bill.\n  I want to clarify that this legislation is in no way intended to \nundercut the existing authority of the Global AIDS Coordinator over all \nU.S. Government resources and programs relating to international HIV/\nAIDS. The Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator has made tremendous \nprogress in bringing together U.S. Government resources in addressing \norphans and vulnerable children as part of the President's Emergency \nPlan for AIDS Relief. In accordance with section 102 of Public Law 108-\n25, the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act \nof 2003, the Global AIDS Coordinator has primary responsibility for \nprogramming and directing funds for all international HIV/AIDS \nactivities carried out by the U.S. Government.\n  This legislation is not intended to create new or separate \nauthorities in programming or funding under the emergency plan \nregarding orphans and vulnerable children and HIV/AIDS programs, but \nrather provides for an advisory position to ensure that the best \napproaches to addressing the needs of this population are employed in \nour foreign HIV/AIDS programs. I would expect that the position created \nby this new legislation would work within the processes developed by \nthe Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator to ensure that planning and \nimplementation of any orphans and vulnerable children programs relating \nto international HIV/AIDS are consistent with the goals of the \nemergency plan. In fact, it is possible that this position may indeed \nbe within the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, at the discretion \nof the Secretary of State, because of the close relationship of HIV/\nAIDS and its effect on orphans and vulnerable children.\n  The AIDS orphan crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has implications for \npolitical stability, development, and human welfare that extend far \nbeyond the region, affecting governments and people worldwide. Every 14 \nseconds another child is orphaned by AIDS. Turning the tide on this \ncrisis will require a coordinated, comprehensive, and swift response. I \nam hopeful that Senators will join me in backing this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the bill be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and any \nstatements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1409) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/24/senate-section/article/S11774-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CONVEYANCE OF LAND FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PUYALLUP INDIAN TRIBE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
