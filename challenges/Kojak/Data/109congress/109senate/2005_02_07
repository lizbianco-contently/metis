I encourage Members to make their opening \nstatements today so that we may begin the amendment process early \ntomorrow.\n  I thank the Democratic leader for his cooperation as we begin the \nclass action legislation. We have a short list of possible amendments \nfrom the other side. I hope we can lock in an exclusive list at the \nearliest time to facilitate management of the bill. I don't want to \nencourage amendments, but I would forewarn all Senators, if they intend \nto offer an amendment to the class action bill they should notify their \nrespective chairmen just as soon as possible and notify the cloakrooms \nas well.\n  In addition to beginning the debate on the class action bill today, \nwe will also consider a resolution relating to the recent elections in \nIraq. That resolution has been circulated, and we expect to have a \nrollcall vote on the resolution at 5:30 this afternoon. We hope to have \nthat agreement locked in shortly, and we will alert Members accordingly \nwhen consent is granted for that vote.\n  I also would announce that the Homeland and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee is expected to report the nomination of Michael Chertoff to \nbe Secretary of Homeland Security. Clearly we will want to schedule \nthat important nomination for floor action as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor. I will have a few minutes on leader time shortly \nbut would be happy to turn to the Democratic leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/07/senate-section/article/S995-8", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, when President Bush was elected, he said \nthat he wanted to be a uniter and not a divider. We took him at his \nword. The last 4 years have not worked out well. There has not been \nmuch unity in Washington, but a lot of divisive matters come before us \nand the tone has not been good.\n  The day after this last election when the President was reelected he \ncalled\n\n[[Page S996]]\n\nme when I was in Las Vegas and we had a very pleasant meeting on the \ntelephone. He said he wanted to get along. He wanted to set a better \ntone in Washington.\n  This past Wednesday, the State of the Union Message was given. The \nPresident said the same thing there--he wanted to get along, to \ncooperate.\n  Today, the newspaper of Capitol Hill, ``Rollcall,'' has a front page \nstory: ``RNC Turns Up Heat on Reid.'' It is a big story. It says among \nother things that they are sending out a 13-page research document, the \nRNC, the Republican National Committee, ``a 13-page research document \ntoday to roughly 1 million people . . . detailing Reid's . . .''--what \nthey don't like about me, saying what they want to do is just like they \ndid to Daschle.\n  I don't think the President of the United States can say one thing \nand then do something else and get away with it. Is this how he wants \nto be a uniter, not divider? He cannot distance himself from the \nRepublican National Committee. The Republican National Committee is his \ncommittee. He picks the chairman. He picks everybody there. He raises \nthe money for it. It is the President's organization. He can't say one \nthing to the American people and to the Democratic leader of the Senate \nand then send out scurrilous letters saying that I am a bad guy, in \ngreat detail. I mean, is President George Bush a man of his word? Is \nwhat he is telling the American people just a charade?\n  Last Wednesday, just a few days ago, as I have mentioned, he said \nthat he was going to reach out to the Democrats. This is a strange way \nto reach out.\n  Mr. President, I call upon you to repudiate this document, to tell \nthe Republican National Committee don't mail it. Tell them not to send \nit. We haven't dealt with one piece of legislation here on the Senate \nfloor, yet they are sending out, to a million people, what they think \nis to have Reid roughed up a little bit.\n  What politics is all about, what government is all about, is honesty, \nintegrity--not phoniness. Why didn't he stand and tell the American \npeople last Wednesday that one of the first items of business we were \ngoing to do in Washington is send out a hit piece on the Democratic \nleader? If he is honest with the American people, why doesn't he just \ncall it the way it is? It is going to be politics as usual, directed \nfrom 16th and Pennsylvania Avenue. Honesty, integrity and truth--if \nthose are the watch words of this President, he will repudiate what his \nRepublican National Committee is doing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the introduction of S. 300 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole).

Madam President, I rise to commemorate the life and \naccomplishments of Stan Kimmitt, former Secretary of the Senate \nMajority and Secretary of the Senate, retired Army colonel and loving \nhusband and father. On December 7, 2004, the Senate and the Washington \ncommunity lost a devoted friend, one whose work honored the institution \nof the Senate and the value of bi-partisanship.\n  Throughout his careers in the military, political and corporate \nworlds, Stan Kimmit dedicated his life to public service and democratic \nideals. He first served our Nation in WW II and Korea, then as Majority \nLeader Mike Mansfield's senior staff member for 11 years and later for \n5 years as Secretary of the Senate and finally as a consultant.\n  Stan was born on April 5, 1918 in Lewistown, MT. His father was a \nwheat farmer until drought destroyed the family's crop in the early \n1920s. The family moved to Great Falls, MT, where Stan spent the \nremainder of his childhood. He enrolled at the University of Montana \nwhere he took an Asian history class taught by a man who would be very \ninfluential in his life, a man named Mike Mansfield.\n  In June of 1941, Stan was drafted out of college and began what would \nbecome a 24-year Army career. He was sent to Europe where he was a \ncombat commander and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. He crossed the \nbridge at Remagen and was part of the first U.S. division to occupy \nBerlin. Stan entered the Korean War as a first lieutenant, where he \nserved as an artillery officer at Pork Chop Hill. After completing his \nbachelor's degree at Utah State University, he went back to the Army to \nserve in Europe. The Army later assigned him to serve as secretary of \nthe Army office of legislative liaison to the Senate, his first of \nthree terms in this post. During his assignment to the Senate, he \nrenewed his connection to the Senate Majority Leader from Montana, \nSenator Mike Mansfield.\n  By the time Stan retired from the Army in 1966 as a colonel, he was \ndecorated with the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star \nfor Valor with Three Oak Leaf Clusters and was inducted into the Field \nArtillery Officer Candidate School Hall of Fame.\n  He approached his career in the Senate in the same manner with which \nhe approached his commitment to the Army, with integrity, with \nfairness, and with an enormous deal of respect for the institution. \nStan was always troubled by the partisanship in Washington because he \nthought of the institution as a family. He honored the principles of \nthe party, but always knew that it was part of a bigger picture. He was \ngrateful for the opportunity to have served Senator Mansfield but, \nabove all, Stan was grateful to have served in the United States \nSenate.\n  Even after many years in Washington, true to his roots, Stan always \nconsidered himself ``a gopher-shooting Montana boy at heart.'' I had \nthe privilege of knowing Stan through his sons Robert, Jay and Mark, \nthey were contemporaries of mine at West Point.\n  They established extraordinary careers in their own capacity. Bob \nKimmitt was former Ambassador to Germany under President Bush. Jay \nKimmitt served this institution as a member of the Appropriations \nstaff. Mark Kimmitt is today a general officer to the U.S. Army.\n  Stan had a large family. He leaves behind his wife Eunice, his 5 \nchildren, his 12 grandchildren, and 1 great-grandchild. I extend my \ndeepest condolences to his friends and his family. Stan Kimmitt served \nthis Nation with distinction; the Senate shall miss such a devoted \nfriend and such a humble servant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/07/senate-section/article/S996-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S996-S997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CLASS ACTION FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, in about 40 minutes or so we will be \nformally bringing to the floor S. 5, the Class Action Fairness Act. \nThere will be opening statements over the course of the afternoon. We \nwill not be submitting amendments specifically on the bill today or \nvoting on the bill this afternoon, but I would like to take a few \nminutes and introduce my strong support on this important bill, a bill \nwe have worked on for several years now in a bipartisan way. It is \nimportant, I believe, to put the debate in context.\n  This particular bill gives us the first opportunity to take a major \nstep forward on this floor to halt lawsuit abuses that occur across the \ncountry. Every 2 seconds a lawsuit is filed in America--every 2 \nseconds. In 2002, that added up to 16.3 million lawsuits filed in State \ncourts.\n  In the past decade, litigation has skyrocketed, creating the most \nexpensive litigation system in the world. In 2003, the tort system cost \nan incredible $246 billion. In other words, that is approximately $845 \nfor every man, woman, and child.\n  At the current rate of increase, it is estimated that the per capita \ncost of the tort system will go up to $1,000 per person by 2006. That \nis $4,000 for a family of four. Nationally, the tort system costs more \nthan the entire economic output of my own State of Tennessee.\n  The result of this runaway litigation? Clogged courts, wasted \ntaxpayers' dollars, restrained competitiveness, and unjust settlements \nthat award huge attorney fees at the expense of injured victims who \noften get a coupon or nothing at all.\n\n[[Page S997]]\n\n  Businesses spend millions of dollars each year defending themselves \nagainst lawsuits, many of them frivolous.\n  Home Depot is now one of America's largest and most successful \ncompanies, but Bernie Marcus, who cofounded Home Depot back in 1978, \nsays his business could never have gotten off the ground in the current \nlegal climate. That is thousands of jobs that would have never been \ncreated, millions of products never sold, and prices that would never \nhave been introduced for the benefit of consumers.\n  Contrary to popular perception, small businesses, which are the \nengine of economic growth in our country, are the ones which are \nhardest hit by the lawsuit industry--not the large corporations. Small \nbusinesses take in 25 percent of America's business revenue but they \nbear 68 percent of the business tort costs.\n  Let me repeat: Small businesses take in 25 percent of America's \nbusiness revenue but they bear 68 percent of the tort costs.\n  They spend a staggering $88 billion a year on legal fees--$88 billion \nthat could be used to hire more workers, create more jobs, expand their \nbusinesses, or develop new products and services.\n  Many small businesses can't afford the legal burden, so they close up \nshop and jobs are lost--and the economy overall suffers.\n  Clearly, it is time for reform. We simply cannot afford the status \nquo. The cost of doing business in America keeps going up while respect \nfor our legal system goes down.\n  That is why today, as a first step, we are tackling class action. We \nshould consider focusing on other areas of lawsuit abuse, including \nmedical liability, asbestos, and bankruptcy--and in due time we will do \njust that. But we are beginning with class action to help those injured \nby negligence who often receive little or nothing while their attorneys \npocket millions.\n  Class action serves an important purpose in our justice system. We \nall know that. Class action lawsuits allow plaintiffs whose injuries \nare not big enough to justify the legal expense individually to combine \ntheir claims into one suit against a common defendant. This is an \nimportant and valuable tool to keep unscrupulous companies honest and \nto compensate legitimate victims.\n  But the system has gotten off track. Opportunistic attorneys are \ndistorting the process to generate excessive attorney fees at the \nexpense of the injured plaintiffs. Take, for example, a case in my home \nState involving faulty plastic pipes.\n  Throughout the 1970s and the 1980s, 6 million to 10 million new homes \nand apartments were fitted with the plastic piping. PB pipes, as they \nare known, were generally considered cheaper and more durable than \neither copper or galvanized steel systems. They were especially popular \nin the Sun Belt where we were experiencing a huge housing boom. Before \nlong, however, the pipes and the fittings began to fail, causing leaks \nand property damage.\n  A class action suit was filed on behalf of the homeowners who were \nstuck with these defective pipes. After extensive litigation, the \nlawyers reached a deal. The homeowners were eligible to receive less \nthan 10 percent of the total settlement fund--less than 10 percent. \nMeanwhile, the plaintiffs' attorneys negotiated for themselves a $45 \nmillion payday--the equivalent of $2,000 per hour. This is just one of \nmany examples of consumers getting a fraction of the total settlement, \nwhile the lawyers got millions.\n  In fact, the Class Action Fairness Act enumerates a consumer class \naction bill of rights which will put an end to these unfair \ncompensation packages. Under the Class Action Fairness Act, lawyers' \nfees for coupon settlements must be based either on the value of the \ncoupons that are actually redeemed or the hours actually billed in \nprosecuting the class action. The consumer provisions will also require \nsettlement deals to be written in plain English so plaintiffs know what \nis being negotiated and can make informed decisions about how to \nproceed.\n\n  Second, the bill before the Senate will help end the phenomenon of \nforum shopping. Aggressive trial lawyers have found there are a few \ncounties that are what is known as lawsuit friendly. These elected \nState court judges are quick to certify a class action and juries are \nknown to grant extravagant damage awards.\n  The same defendant can face copycat cases in different States, each \ngranting a different result. These counties may have little or no \ngeographic relationship to the plaintiffs or the defendant, but the \ntrial lawyers know that simply the threat of suing in these counties \ncan lead to large cash settlements. One study estimates that virtually \nevery sector of the U.S. economy is on trial in only three State \ncourts.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act moves those large nationwide cases that \ngenuinely impact the interstate commerce to the Federal courts where \nthey belong. These are commonsense reforms that will bring fairness \nback to the system.\n  For these reasons, the Class Action Fairness Act enjoys strong \nbipartisan support. It was reported out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee with a bipartisan majority. I am confident if we continue \nworking together to pass a clean bill without amendment, it will pass \nthe House of Representatives quickly and be ready for the President's \nsignature. Class action is an important tool of justice, but it is a \ntool that has been badly abused. Class Action Fairness Act will bring \nrationality to the system which will benefit the truly injured, keep \nAmerica competitive, and restore the public respect for the law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, Senator Frist came to the Senate to make \nsome opening remarks about the class action bill that will be before \nthe Senate. There will be a very good debate on this bill. I will make \na couple of points.\n  The Senator said every 2 seconds a lawsuit is filed. I have no reason \nto doubt his number, but I wonder if he has looked at who is filing the \nlawsuits. The last time I looked, it was mostly one business suing \nanother business. So before we come to the Senate and say we have to do \nsomething about the class action lawsuits, saying every 2 seconds a \nlawsuit is filed gives the wrong impression. We are going to get the \nexact numbers, but I make that point.\n\n  What we will find among colleagues, regardless of party, we all want \nto make sure these lawsuits are fair and that they are heard in a fair \nway. It appears when a class action lawsuit winds up in a Federal \ncourt, the judge, on many occasions, if not most occasions, refuses to \nhear it because the plaintiffs come from so many different States. I \nwill give an example of what these lawsuits are about.\n  When we talk about lawyers, we talk about fees, we talk about costs \nthe lawyers have, or the time they have. We are overlooking the main \npoint, which is: what are these class action lawsuits about? I will \ntalk about a couple of these lawsuits because we need to put a human \nface on what they are.\n  Rob Sanders of Maryland explained how his daughter was killed, as \nwere other children, by a deployed airbag in a Chrysler minivan. For \nyears, consumers have pursued class action cases against Chrysler to \nforce the company to replace existing airbags in such vehicles with \nothers that deploy less rapidly and do not pose a safety risk to\n\n[[Page S998]]\n\nthe car's occupant. As someone who is small in stature, I can say the \nautomobile companies make these airbags to protect people who are much \nlarger and much heavier, and much taller than appropriate for children. \nWe have seen children killed by these airbags.\n  We all want airbags that work, regardless of our weight, our height, \nor stature. A class action was blocked in a Louisiana Federal court \nbecause the judge threw up his hands. But in Oklahoma--as we all know, \nthat is a conservative State--the State court is proceeding to look at \nthis even though the company has been working for years to block it. We \nare talking about life and death. We are talking about real victims.\n  Let's talk about the ability to make a living. Georgie Hartwig of \nWashington State is a former Wal-Mart employee who was cheated out of \novertime pay. This is a common practice, unfortunately, at many of the \ncompany stores. Her class action case is being heard in State court. \nThree Federal courts have refused to hear such Wal-Mart cases, whereas \nfive State courts have allowed them.\n  I am hopeful as we move this bill forward, we will ensure that at \nleast some court will hear these important cases. They involve real \npeople. I am sure Georgie Hartwig of Washington State and her \ncolleagues at Wal-Mart have to raise a family and pay the rent. If we \nhave a system that simply shuts the courthouse door, be it a State \ncourthouse or a Federal courthouse, we are not fulfilling our job to \nmake sure people get justice, they get it expeditiously, and it is done \nfairly.\n  Shelly Toliver is a firefighter from Connecticut. These are the \npeople we are talking about here--Americans. Shelly Toliver, a \nfirefighter from Connecticut, described how she brought a State class \naction suit against Credit Acceptance Corporation of Michigan for \ncheating her and other consumers out of their vehicles in violation of \nConnecticut law, destroying their credit ratings in the process. We all \nknow what it is to get a bad credit rating by mistake. It is terrible. \nUltimately, the class members had their purported debt to the company \nwiped out and their bad ratings cleared because they were able to get \ntheir case heard.\n\n  It goes on and on. I hope as we get through this bill we will be \nhonest with the American people regarding whose rights are at stake. We \nare supposed to be here for the rights of the men and women of this \ncountry, the families of this country. The corporations, which are \nrather faceless, I support when they do the right thing, but when they \ndo not do the right thing, when they wrong a firefighter, if an \nautomobile company does not do what they should to protect children, \nthere ought to be justice. That is all we are saying.\n  Are there abuses? Yes. Should we resolve them? Yes. I am very happy \nto do that. It is true, we have abuses everywhere. We should fix those \nabuses.\n  We have to be careful we are being sincere. There is one colleague \nwho has been very strong on capping pain and suffering, but when it \nhappened in his own family, he went for the gold. So let's be careful. \nThe American people are watching. If we say we ought to cap pain and \nsuffering for our constituents--forget about it, one size fits all. \nThis is not class action, but these are other kinds of cases this \nRepublican Senate is coming after: one size fits all. Let's cap it it \nis killing us; it is killing the country.\n  I go to the supermarket every week. No one comes up to me and says, \nplease, please, do something about the filing of lawsuits when their \nchild died in a hospital. What they will say to me is, make sure there \nis fairness for victims.\n  Let's get together and do the things that have to be done so that the \npeople who get the benefit are our constituents. Do not close the \ncourthouse door to firefighters, moms and dads, who are working for \njustice in their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/07/senate-section/article/S998-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S998-S999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AN INCOMPLETE BUDGET\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. The President has sent down his budget. We are going \nthrough it now to see what it means for our State. But this is quite a \nbudget. This is a budget that does not include the costs of the war in \nIraq. This is a budget that does not include the costs of the war in \nAfghanistan. This is a budget that does not show the true costs of \nmaking the tax cuts permanent. This is a budget that does not show the \ncosts of what I call anti-Social Security, going into personal \naccounts, which is an enormous multitrillion dollar cost.\n  So you have a document which is, on its face, incomplete. That is the \nbest way I can put it: incomplete. Other people might use another word \nfor it, but I will be charitable and say it is incomplete. Why can't \nthe President show the true costs? Because he could not hold up his \nhead if he put the true costs in there. We would be looking at deficits \nthat are ruinous. The truth is, the deficits are ruinous.\n  When President Bush took over, he had a surplus as far as the eye \ncould see. He turned it into a deficit in 15 minutes. He said the tax \ncuts would be so great that we would have economic growth and we would \nsuddenly have a balanced budget. It did not happen.\n  Let me tell you what else is not in this budget. Where is the money \nfrom the Iraqi oil that was supposed to be coming our way? On March 27, \n2003, not that long ago, this is what Paul Wolfowitz, the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense said, in congressional testimony, sworn to tell \nthe truth:\n\n       The oil revenues of Iraq could bring between $50 and $100 \n     billion over the course of the next two or three years. . . . \n     We're dealing with a country that can really finance its own \n     reconstruction, and relatively soon.\n\n  Let me repeat that. A Bush administration spokesperson, very high up \nin the Defense Department, said:\n\n       The oil revenues of Iraq could bring between $50 and $100 \n     billion over the course of the next two or three years. . . . \n     We're dealing with a country that can really finance its own \n     reconstruction, and relatively soon.\n\n  Well, here it is, folks, it is 3 years later, and not a penny of \nrevenue is coming into our budget to help us, and the whole cost of the \nIraq war is outside the budget--a disaster.\n  Here is another claim, by White House spokesman Ari Fleischer:\n\n       Iraq, unlike Afghanistan, is a rather wealthy country. Iraq \n     has tremendous resources that belong to the Iraqi people. And \n     so there are a variety of means that Iraq has to be able to \n     shoulder much of the burden for their own reconstruction.\n\n  Where is the revenue in our budget? Not a dime, not one slim dime. \nThey are not even talking about making these costs into loans against \nfuture oil revenues. And in the meantime, what are the American people \ntold by this President and his budget? What are the veterans told? Oh, \nwe are cutting back on veterans health care. Can you imagine? We are \nalmost at 11,000 wounded, and this President's budget says, You are \ngoing to have to pay more for your pharmaceuticals, $250 to join, and \nyou have to pay more. Let me tell you, a lot of us are going to stop \nthat. Let me tell you, a lot of us are not going to let that happen.\n  The people coming home from Iraq, half of them are very seriously \nwounded--thousands and thousands. Some estimates are that a third of \nthem need mental health care. And this budget cuts veterans health. \nWrong. That is not going to happen. It is unacceptable. I think it is \nunacceptable to the American people.\n  I ask my constituents if they believe we ought to be doing more for \nveterans or less for the veterans or the same as we did last year. I \nknow--and I have not taken a scientific poll--they would say: Senator, \nyou give them what they need.\n\n  The President says to the Iraqi people: As long as it takes. Whatever \nit is. Whatever it costs. I want to say to the veterans: Whatever it \ntakes, however long it takes for you to get on your feet, we will be \nthere.\n  We have the President eliminating a program where the Federal \nGovernment gives States funding to incarcerate illegal immigrants who \nhave committed crimes--cut, gone, finito, finished--eliminating $300 \nmillion. We call it SCAAP. How can a President, at this time in our \nhistory, where we are guarding our borders, where we are concerned \nabout who is coming in, lay all of that on the border States? This is \nwrong. It is unacceptable.\n  How about this: The Bush budget slices law enforcement grants to \nStates from $2.8 billion to $1.5 billion, while the President claims he \nis increasing homeland defense.\n  I have a message for the President, in a nice, respectful way: It is \nour local law enforcement people who are protecting our citizens in \nevery capacity. They are the bottom line of homeland defense.\n\n[[Page S999]]\n\n  There is a special and important program to assist police departments \nto improve technology and their ability to communicate with other \nagencies through COPS technology grants. Do you know what happens if \nthere is an emergency in one area? What we have found out is, our \npolice departments, our fire departments, our first responders do not \nhave the equipment they need. They do not have the communications \nequipment. They cannot talk to each other.\n  The Senate, in a bipartisan way, passed authorizing legislation to \nsay we need to help connect these departments with one another. Because \nsuppose something happens on a railroad track, and one sheriff sees it, \nand there is a disaster, and he needs to get on the line immediately to \nall the other agencies in the area; they cannot do it right now. They \nneed to move toward the ability to do this. It seems shocking that we \nhave not done that already in America, but that is the truth. What does \nthe President do? He cuts that program. He eliminates it.\n  Now, the President also creates a new program. He wants to extend the \nNo Child Left Behind to high school. Well, how about fully funding his \nfirst No Child Left Behind? I wrote the part with Senator Ensign that \ndeals with afterschool programs. It has been frozen for 3 years. There \nare millions of kids who want to get into afterschool programs.\n  We know it works. Law enforcement loves the program. The teachers \nlove the program because the kids get to do their homework. They stay \nout of trouble. The FBI loves the program. The FBI has told us the vast \nmajority of juvenile crime occurs right after school until the parents \ncome home. We did not need the FBI to tell us that. We kind of figured \nthat out. But this is key.\n  So here we are with a new program to extend No Child Left Behind to \nhigh school kids when we have not fully funded the afterschool program \nand many of the other programs that were promised to our people in the \nfirst No Child Left Behind. That is $1.4 billion, folks. This is not \nsmall change. This is $1.4 billion for this new program. There are no \nrevenues in there from Iraqi oil.\n  This is also the first administration not to back a polluter-pay fee. \nWhen polluters cause these superfunds, where we have toxics all over \nthe ground seeping into the water, it costs a lot of money to clean it \nup. This is the first administration, Republican or Democratic, not to \nsupport this polluter-pay fee. That would bring billions in over 5 \nyears.\n\n  There are ways for us to pay for things the American people need. I \nam looking forward to getting into more of the fine print of this \nparticular budget. I used to be on the Budget Committee. I can tell \nyou, I loved being on the Budget Committee because it was a way to look \nat the big picture. When I went on the Commerce Committee, I had to \ngive up the Budget Committee. It was a sad decision for me. But I look \nforward to hearing from Kent Conrad and I look forward to hearing from \nthe Republican chairman, who was Pete Domenici, and I am not sure if it \nhas changed or not. Because I want to hear their take on this budget.\n  But we see new initiatives in this budget that obviously are not paid \nfor when we are shorting probably 150 programs, according to the \nPresident. We see nothing in here about getting any revenues from the \nIraqi oil that were promised to us: $50 to $100 billion over the course \nof the next 2 or 3 years we were told by this administration in 2003. I \nbelieve in holding people accountable when they say things. I think it \nis important. That is what they said, and we do not see any evidence of \nany of this in this budget.\n  So we have the budget to deal with. We have the class action lawsuit \nlegislation, which I hope we can do in a way to protect the important \nlawsuits that need to be heard and need to be resolved. Because if they \nare heard and they are resolved, our people will be safer, our people \nwill be stronger, our people will feel they have been given justice.\n  We have the Social Security, what I call, repeal. Not a penny has \nbeen put into this budget to reflect any of that.\n  I understand my time is up. There is no one on the floor so I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu).

Under the previous order, the hour of 3 p.m. \nhaving arrived, the Senate will proceed to the consideration of S. 5, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 5) to amend the procedures that apply to \n     consideration of interstate class actions to assure fairer \n     outcomes for class members and defendants, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I was about to note that the hour of 3 \no'clock has arrived. According to the previous order, the Senate is to \ntake up the legislation on class action. This is legislation which has \nbeen crafted over a considerable period of time. It had some difficulty \nin achieving 60 votes for so-called cloture to cut off debate so that \nthe Senate would take up the issue. It had been negotiated among a \nnumber of Senators in the past to get the requisite 60 votes, and it is \nrepresented that if the bill is passed in its current form in the \nSenate, it will be agreeable to the House of Representatives. When I \nchoose my words carefully--that has been represented; you never know \nuntil it gets to the other body and see what they do--but that has been \nthe expectation.\n  When the issue was negotiated, there were a number of Senators who \nwere satisfied with the structure of the bill. But all 100 Senators had \nnot assented, agreed to it, including this Senator. We customarily are \nnot all involved in negotiations as to the bill so that there is \nobviously latitude, when the matter comes before the Senate, for \nindividual Senators to exercise their right to either offer amendments \nor to join in amendments which are offered.\n  I support class action reform. I do so essentially to prevent judge \nshopping to States and even counties where courts and judges have a \nprejudicial predisposition on cases. Regrettably, the history has been \nthat there are some States in the United States and even some counties \nwhere there is forum shopping, which means that lawyers will look to \nthat particular State, that particular county to get an advantage.\n  Diversity jurisdiction was established in the United States so that \nif there was litigation between citizens of different States, there was \na certain amount in controversy, a jurisdictional amount--that amount \nhas risen over the years; when I started the practice of law it was \n$3,000, now it is $75,000--the diversity jurisdiction of the Federal \ncourts was established to see to it that if a litigant from California, \nillustratively, came to Pennsylvania and might be in the State court, \nthat there would be perhaps some predisposition on the part of State \ncourt judges to look more favorably upon the local litigant. And the \nFederal courts were viewed as being more impartial. And that thread \nremains to this day.\n\n  The legislation will leave in State courts, if the matter is \npredominantly a State court issue, where there are some two-thirds of \nthe class in that State. If there is one-third or less, then the matter \nwould go to the Federal court. And if it is between one-third and two-\nthirds, then it will be up to the discretion of the Federal judge on a \nseries of standards which have been worked out through the leadership \nof Senator Feinstein of California.\n  The bill came before the Judiciary Committee last Thursday. And it \nwas my request of the Judiciary Committee members at that time that \namendments not be offered because if you have controversial amendments \noffered in committee, they are customarily taken up again on the Senate \nfloor. And the majority leader, Senator Frist, had asked me in my \ncapacity as\n\n[[Page S1000]]\n\nchairman of the committee to get the bill out last Thursday so that it \ncould come to the floor today.\n  As is well-known publicly, the class action legislation is a priority \nof the President's. It has been the intention of the majority leader to \nput the matter on the agenda at an early time--obviously, February 7 is \nan early date--and reserve sufficient time so that Senators have a full \nopportunity to offer amendments, and we can move through to completion \nof the bill.\n  There is an amendment which has been discussed involving a proposal \nby the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, which would make certain \nthat substantive rights which are now present in State courts would be \nretained after the enactment of this legislation. State courts use \nState law, and that is substantive law, in certifying class actions. \nAnd while I have stated my support for moving cases to the Federal \ncourt for the reasons I have already said, I have made a claim in the \npast and repeated it in the Judiciary Committee meeting last Thursday \nthat in moving the cases to the Federal courts, I do not want to see \nchanges in the substance of the rights of consumers or other class \naction litigants; that the objective which I think we ought to obtain \nis that the same substantive rights would remain; that this bill should \nnot be a vehicle for modification of substantive rights, but this bill \nshould provide the reform which will take the cases out of State \ncourts, where there has been a record of prejudice to defendants, and \ntake them to the Federal courts where, in the historical tradition of \ndiversity litigation, to take them to the Federal courts where there is \na better opportunity for an objective determination.\n  When this bill was in committee in the past, I had a concern about \ncertain of the provisions as to mass actions. The advocates of reform \nlegislation were concerned that mass actions might be tried in the \nState courts altogether and provide a procedural context where there \ncould not be a fair or appropriate adjudication. That is a highly \ncomplex subject, and it may be the matter of some concern as we move \nforward on this bill.\n  It is my hope that we will not have so-called extraneous amendments, \nthat we will focus on issues of class action related to this subject \nmatter so that we can have a full debate on the subject. Senators may \nhave an opportunity to offer their amendments and the determination of \nthe Senate can be made as to what ought to be done on this very \nimportant litigation matter.\n  I seek recognition today to open debate on the Class Action Fairness \nAct of 2005. This bill embodies a carefully balanced legislative \nsolution that responds to abuses of the class action litigation device \nin our State courts.\n  A key provision in the bill amends the Federal diversity jurisdiction \nstatute to allow Federal courts to hear large multi-party, multi-State \nclass action disputes. Existing law prevents national lawsuits from \nseeing the inside of a Federal courtroom by virtue of a glitch in the \nway that courts have interpreted the Federal diversity jurisdiction \nstatute--a statute that the Congress passed back in 1789.\n  Let me illustrate this fundamental problem by looking at two \nhypothetical cases. In the first case, you have a resident of, say, my \nState of Pennsylvania, slip and fall while filling up her car at a New \nJersey gas station. The plaintiff sprains her ankle, misses work, and \nhas medical bills. And her damages total $76,000. Under the existing \ndiversity jurisdiction statute, if a plaintiff and a defendant hail \nfrom two different States, and if the amount in controversy exceeds \n$75,000, as in this example, then the case can be brought in Federal \ndistrict court.\n  Diversity jurisdiction for Federal court exists because the Framers \nof our Constitution wanted to encourage interstate commerce, and they \nwanted cases affecting interstate commerce to be adjudicated in our \nFederal courts. They knew that State judges can sometimes play \nfavorites, and that if out of State defendants were unable to access \nthe neutral forum of a Federal court, that could have a chilling effect \non interstate commerce.\n  But to understand how diversity jurisdiction has been misused, let's \nlook at a second case in the class action context. Let's assume there \nare 1,000 plaintiffs who form a class. Let's also say they claim $100 \nmillion in damages against 300 different plumbing operations from \naround the country alleging that the defendants overcharged for \nplumbing services. And let's assume further that while these plaintiffs \nare spread across all 50 States, at least one of the 1 plaintiffs and \none of the defendants reside in the same State. Although there is \nlittle doubt that this hypothetical lawsuit affects interstate \ncommerce, especially given the number of parties spread throughout the \ncountry, this case would stay in State court.\n  In 1806, the Supreme Court in Strawbridge v. Curtis interpreted the \ndiversity jurisdiction statute to require what is known today as \n``complete diversity''. In other words, for diversity jurisdiction to \nexist, all of the named plaintiffs must be citizens of different States \nfrom all of the defendants. While the complete diversity rule makes \nsense in the context of a relatively smaller lawsuit, it has been used \nto defeat Federal jurisdiction for large interstate class actions \nlawsuits.\n  Throughout the years, the Judiciary Committee has received compelling \nevidence showing that certain plaintiffs' lawyers avoid Federal \njurisdiction by simply naming a defendant in a complaint--such as a \nlocal pharmacy--to match the citizenship of a local plaintiff. This is \ndone despite the fact that the real defendant and vast majority of \nplaintiffs hail from different States.\n  It is this awkward result that the bill seeks to fix. Section 4 of S. \n5 amends the current diversity statute to allow larger interstate class \nactions to be heard in Federal court by granting original jurisdiction \nin those class actions where any member of a proposed class is a \ncitizen of a different state from any defendant. To be eligible for \nFederal jurisdiction, the class action must cover at least 100 \nplaintiffs and involve an aggregate amount in controversy of at least \n$5 million.\n  While this provision represents the general rule, the bill contains \ncertain exceptions that balance a state's interest in adjudicating \nlocal disputes. First, if two-thirds or more of the class members are \nfrom the primary defendant's home State, the lawsuit will remain in \nState court. Conversely, class actions filed in the home State of the \nprimary defendant are subject to Federal jurisdiction if less than one-\nthird of the proposed class members are citizens of that State. For \ncases brought in a defendant's home State in which between one-third \nand two-thirds of the class members are citizens of the forum State, a \nFederal district court judge is given discretion to exercise \njurisdiction based on consideration of enumerated factors. This three-\ntiered test is known as the Home State Exception and represents a \nprovision championed by Senator Feinstein during committee markup on \nthe bill in the 108th Congress.\n\n  Second, the bill contains the Local Controversy Exception--a \nprovision that enables State courts to adjudicate truly local disputes \ninvolving principal injuries concentrated within the forum State. To \nfall within this exception, a class action must meet the following four \ncriteria: 1, the class must be primarily local, meaning that two-thirds \nof the class members reside in the forum State; 2, the lawsuit must be \nbrought against at least one real in-state defendant whose alleged \nconduct is central to the class claims and from whom the class seeks \nsignificant relief; 3, the principal injuries caused by the defendants \nconduct must have occurred within the forum state; and 4, no other \nsimilar class actions have been filed against any of the defendants in \nthe preceding 3 years. This exception is intended to ensure that State \ncourts can continue adjudicating truly local controversies involving \ndefendants that are out-of-State corporations.\n  I believe that modifying the current diversity jurisdiction statute \nis a sensible solution towards minimizing the class action abuses that \nwe have witnessed throughout the years. Since the 105th Congress, this \nbody has received evidence showing an extraordinary concentration of \nlarge interstate class action lawsuits in a handful of our State \ncourts--certain county courts to be precise.\n  The evidence further shows that these courts operate in a manner that \ndeprives the rights of truly injured individual plaintiffs and \ndefendants. In\n\n[[Page S1001]]\n\nmany cases, courts approve settlements that primarily benefit the class \ncounsel, rather than the injured class members. Indeed, it has become \nall too common for certain State courts to approve proposed settlements \nwhere class members receive little or nothing of value, such as a \nmeaningless coupon, while their attorneys receive substantial fees. In \naddition, multiple class action lawsuits asserting the same claims on \nbehalf of the same plaintiffs are routinely filed in different State \ncourts, thus creating judicial inefficiencies and encouraging collusive \nsettlement behavior.\n  Unfortunately, the injuries caused by these abuses are not confined \nto the parties who are named in the class action complaint. Rather, \nthey extend to everyday consumers who unwittingly get dragged into \nthese lawsuits as unnamed class members simply because they purchased a \ncell phone, bought a box of cereal, drove a car fitted with a certain \nbrand of tires, or rented a video. What we are really talking about \nhere is a system that impacts the vast majority of people who live in \nthis country.\n  The time has now come for its full consideration of class action \nreform by the Senate. The bill maintains strong bipartisan support in \nthis Chamber and has brought many members from both sides of the aisle \ntogether. Indeed, just last week, the Judiciary Committee reported this \nbill favorably to the floor on a strong bipartisan vote of 13-5. In \nthis regard, I would like to applaud my colleagues Senators Grassley, \nHatch, Carper, and Kohl for their tireless efforts in building \nconsensus throughout this body.\n  S. 5 balances State and Federal interests in adjudicating disputes. \nThis said, we must not lose sight of the fact that we be mindful of the \nsubstantive rights of individual plaintiffs caught in this balancing \nact--rights that guarantee a citizen access to jury trials for injuries \nsustained at the hands of wrongdoers. In the coming days, I anticipate \namendments and thoughtful arguments from my colleagues relating to this \nissue. As such, I look forward to the debate and the Senate's full \nconsideration of this important legislation.\n\n\n                          Philadelphia Eagles\n\n  Mr. President, I note the presence of my distinguished colleague, the \nranking member, the first Democrat ever elected in the State of \nVermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Only.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Before yielding, let me make one other comment; that is \nmy congratulations to the New England Patriots. As a long-standing \nPhiladelphia Eagle fan, going back to the days of Franklin Field, as \nthose in Philadelphia would understand, where the Eagles played in the \nconfines of the ballpark of the University of Pennsylvania and the \nfeatures were Jimmy Brown running for the Cleveland Browns, tackled \nmost of the time by Chuck Bednarik of the Philadelphia Eagles, in the \ngreat championship game of 1960, which the Eagles won 17 to 13. The \nglory days were recounted again in the New York Times. You have to go \nback to 1960 to find glory days for Philadelphia football. But it is \nrecounted how Chuck Bednarik tackled Jim Taylor, the great running back \nof the Green Bay Packers, and sat on him until time had expired, and \nthe Eagles also won 17 to 13.\n  Franklin Field seated a few over 60,000. It is now reputed that about \n900,000 people were there; 900,000 people claim to have been there to \nhave seen that game. I was there and am prepared to say so in open \ncourt and even take an affidavit on it.\n  It was a thrilling game yesterday. I was in Jacksonville. It was \nreported by one of the local firms that there were some 60,000 Eagle \nfans in Jacksonville who did not have tickets. And when you moved \nthrough the city, the green was everywhere, with ``5'' for Donovan \nMcNabb and 81 for Terrell Owens. Owens had a spectacular game, \nrecovering from an ankle injury in a very short period of time, \ncatching nine passes, six in the second half, taking one high over his \nshoulder and doing a 270-degree pirouette, a 30-yard gain. But to the \ncredit of Coach Bill Belichick and Quarterback Tom Brady, New England \nis an outstanding team.\n  We take great pride in what the Philadelphia Eagles have done and \nwhat Donovan McNabb has done. He had a high number of completions \nyesterday, but too many of them went to the Patriots, with some three \ninterceptions--too many picked off.\n  They coined the phrase in Brooklyn decades ago: Wait til next year. \nWait til next year. But for this year, my congratulations to the New \nEngland Patriots. My congratulations also to a fighting group of \nPhiladelphia Eagles. Wait until next year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been in the Senate for 31 years. \nThis is one of the most enjoyable colloquies I have ever had.\n  I hope that the Philadelphia Eagles and actually all of their fans \nrecognize what a great fan they have in the distinguished senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania. We all know him as one of the most \nknowledgeable and best lawyers ever to serve in the Senate in either \nparty. But we saw another side of him today. Anybody who can recount \neffortlessly--I say for those reading the Record, it was without a \nsingle note--the history of the Eagles and give a play by play \nrecounting, this recounting was a tour de force of the first order. For \nEagles fans, I want you to know his legal expertise is every bit as \ngood.\n  I grew up with a different sport--baseball--in Vermont, where my home \nis only a couple hours' drive from Fenway Park. The distinguished \nPresiding Officer knows what that is like because he is even closer. We \nall will wait for next year and the Red Sox.\n  As a child growing up, my father, who had some interest in politics, \nused to say there will be a day when Vermont will actually elect a \nDemocrat to the U.S. Senate. Everybody told him this would never happen \nin his lifetime. I am delighted that it did.\n  I was thinking about my father today. It was 21 years ago today that \nhe left this Earth. He got to see this one and only Democrat, and he \ngot to be there twice on election night and twice to see me sworn into \nthis body, which even after six times is still one of those moments one \nwill never forget.\n  We waited in Vermont from 1918--my father was 18 years old when the \nRed Sox won the championship--until this past year. There was some \ncelebration. I might mention that I thought maybe there was some \ninspiration from Paul McCartney, who performed in the halftime show. I \nwas very disgusted with the halftime show last year--at something \nnobody even noticed until the next day, when people talked about it on \nWeb sites. The photographs of Miss Jackson became the most visited Web \nsite in America, which gives you some idea of what our priorities are. \nWhat I found disgusting at that halftime show was Kid Rock ripping a \nhole in the American flag and wearing it as some kind of a poncho and \nthen throwing it on the ground at the end of his song. I found that to \nbe very offensive.\n  I would hope that some of the keepers of morality in this country, \nwho have had a wonderful time sending out fundraising letters based on \nsomething nobody really saw until the next day and spending just as \nmuch time trying to sell patriotism to everybody, would say how \ndisgusted they are at the actions of a rock singer who would so \ndesecrate the American flag--to the roaring cheers of too many people \nin the audience. I thought that was outrageous. Perhaps we needed \nsomebody from the United Kingdom to come over here and give us a \nrousing halftime show, which it was. Actually, the game got better \nafter that. Maybe that is in the eyes of the beholder, too. But I \nappreciate what the Senator from Pennsylvania said.\n  I also note that in my 31 years here, it is the first time I heard \nthe unanimous consent request Senator Specter made. Perhaps it was made \nbefore. I have to think that when future historians go back into the \nRecord and find that Senators actually did that, they would probably \napplaud that we know what the Record is.\n  I recall my days in law school having a summer job and researching \nthe Congressional Record for the then-Federal Power Commission, which \nlater became the Department of Energy, and trying to figure out what \nwas actually said and what was not said, what order it was said in, and \nwhy some Senators appeared to have said the same thing twice. When I \ncame to the Senate, I must admit some of the Senators--no longer with \nus, God rest their souls--would tend to say the same thing\n\n[[Page S1002]]\n\ntwice, but that was not intentional on their part, or at least they \nwere unaware of it. But I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania for \nmaking a unanimous consent request that actually will make sense for \nthose who read the Record.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator will yield, Senator Leahy and I are very \nconcerned about the Record, having been former district attorneys. We \nare very concerned about the Record. We know that every word we say is \ngoing to be in black and white and be there for a long time, so we like \nit to be accurate.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague for his kind comments. It is not \ninappropriate to note that on Monday afternoons, when we are not going \nto be taking up amendments but having opening statements, this is a \nlittle time on the Senate floor for banter and colloquy. Perhaps those \nwho see C-SPAN might pause a moment or two longer to hear about Paul \nMcCartney or the Patriots or about the Eagles. I was waiting in an \nelevator to go to my seat yesterday at around 5 o'clock, and an \nenormous group came and preempted about 100 fans, including this fan, \nwho were waiting to go up so that Paul McCartney and a small group \ncould be escorted in. He looked good for an oldtime Beatle.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I might say, I worked with Sir Paul and his wife on the \nissue of landmines and landmine removal. I must admit that he has aged \nbetter than some of us who were Beatle fans when he first started. He \nhas his own hair, among other things.\n  The Senator is correct to say that sometimes on Monday afternoon, we \ndigress. I give fair warning to the Senator from New Hampshire, now \npresiding, that one of these digressions in about 3 or 4 weeks when the \nmaple syrup crop comes in, I will be extolling the virtues of Vermont \nmaple syrup being the finest in the world. I will also compliment those \nfrom our neighboring States who do a pretty good job with their maple \nsyrup.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Today, we are considering the first of several bills that \nI am afraid are advanced not with an interest of what is best for the \nAmerican consumer but advanced by corporate special interests to \ndramatically limit the public's access to their courts. I am going to \noppose this so-called Class Action Fairness Act for a very simple \nreason: it is not fair.\n  This legislation would make it harder for citizens to protect \nthemselves against violations of State civil rights or consumer, \nhealth, or environmental protection laws--things we take seriously in \nmy own State and most others do in theirs. It will make it harder \nbecause these cases will be forced out of the local State courts. Aside \nfrom being convenient, State courts have experience with the legal and \nfactual issues involved in these important cases. This legislation \nsweeps these cases into Federal courts, erects new barriers to \nlawsuits, and places new burdens on the plaintiffs.\n  Let me give you an example. In the case of legal rights it would take \nfrom the citizens of my own State, this legislation would deprive \nVermonters the right to band together to seek relief in their State \ncourts--even if the harm occurred in Vermont and the principal \ndefendant has a substantial presence in Vermont. That is a highhanded \noverride of the rights of the American people. You have to ask who it \nwould benefit. Obviously, it benefits the wealthy and powerful special \ninterests.\n  This legislation also overrides the laws and legislatures in our \nState governments. I find it interesting that many colleagues who have \nspoken over and over again on how we have to stand up for the rights of \nour States are so willing, when some of their corporate backers come up \nwith legislation like this, to simply slam the door on their own \nStates. Indeed, the National Conference of State Legislatures wrote to \nus last week to note that this bill ``undermines our system of \nfederalism, disrespects our State court system, and clearly preempts \ncarefully crafted State judicial processes which have been in place for \ndecades regarding the treatment of class action lawsuits.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            National Conference of\n\n\n                                           State Legislatures,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 2005.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures (NCSL), I am urging you to oppose passage of S. \n     5, the ``Class Action Fairness Act of 2005.'' This \n     legislation will federalize class actions involving only \n     state law claims. S. 5 undermines our system of federalism, \n     disrespects our state court system, and clearly preempts \n     carefully crafted state judicial processes which have been in \n     place for decades regarding the treatment of class action \n     lawsuits. The overall tenor of S. 5 sends a disturbing \n     message to the American people that state court systems are \n     somehow inferior or untrustworthy.\n       S. 5 amends the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to grant \n     federal district courts original diversity jurisdiction over \n     any class action lawsuit where the amount in controversy \n     exceeds $5,000,000 or where any plaintiff is a citizen of a \n     different state than any defendant, or in other words, any \n     class action lawsuit. The effect of S. 5 on state \n     legislatures is that state laws in the areas of consumer \n     protection and antitrust which were passed to protect the \n     citizens of a particular state against fraudulent or illegal \n     activities will almost never be heard in state courts. \n     Ironically, state courts, whose sole purpose is to interpret \n     state laws, will be bypassed and the federal judiciary will \n     be asked to render judgment in these cases. The impact of S. \n     5 is that state processes will be preempted by federal ones \n     which aren't necessarily better.\n       NCSL opposes the passage of federal legislation, such as S. \n     5 which preempts established state authority. State courts \n     have traditionally and correctly been the repository for most \n     class action lawsuits because state laws, not federal ones, \n     are at issue. Congress should proceed cautiously before \n     permitting the federal government to interfere with the \n     authority of states to set their own laws and procedures in \n     their own courts.\n       NCSL urges Congress to remember that state policy choices \n     should not be overridden without a showing of compelling \n     national need. We should await evidence demonstrating that \n     states have broadly overreached or are unable to address the \n     problems themselves. There must be evidence of harm to \n     interests of national scope that require a federal response, \n     and even with such evidence, federal preemption should be \n     limited to remedying specific problems with tailored \n     solutions, something that S. 5 does not do.\n       I urge you to oppose this legislation. Please contact Susan \n     Parnas Frederick at the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures at 202-624-3566 or susan.frederick@ncsl.org for \n     further information.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                      Senator Michael Balboni,\n\n                                New York State Senate, Chair, NCSL\n                               Law and Criminal Justice Committee.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Here the National Conference of State Legislatures is \nsaying to us: Why are you being so heavy-handed that you feel the 100 \nMembers of the Senate can just wipe out the legislatures of all 50 \nStates on matters of their States' laws?\n  Fourteen State Attorneys General wrote to our Senate leaders today to \nexpress their collective view that ``despite improvements over similar \nlegislation considered in prior years, [they] believe S. 5 still unduly \nlimits the right of individuals to seek redress for corporate \nwrongdoing in their State courts.''\n  Again, they are saying: What gives you such wisdom in the U.S. Senate \nthat you can completely throw out 50 States and say, We know far better \nthan they could ever know in their years and decades of experience? The \nletter urges passage of amendments to be offered by Senators Bingaman, \nPryor, and Kennedy. This letter is signed by the Attorneys General from \nNew York, Oklahoma, California, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, \nMaryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, and \nWest Virginia. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         State of New York, Office of the Attorney General, the \n           Capitol,\n                                     Albany, NY, February 7, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader and Mr. Minority Leader: On behalf \n     of the Attorneys General of California, Illinois, Iowa, \n     Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New \n     Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Vermont and \n     West Virginia, we are writing in opposition to S. 5, the so-\n     called ``Class Action Fairness Act,'' which will be debated \n     today and is scheduled to be voted on this week. Despite \n     improvements over similar legislation considered in\n\n[[Page S1003]]\n\n     prior years, we believe S. 5 still unduly limits the right of \n     individuals to seek redress for corporate wrongdoing in their \n     state courts. We therefore strongly recommend that this \n     legislation not be enacted in its present form.\n       As you know, under S. 5, almost all class actions brought \n     by private individuals in state court based on state law \n     claims would be removed to federal court, and, as explained \n     below, many of these cases may not be able to continue as \n     class actions. We are concerned with such a limitation on the \n     availability of the class action device because, particularly \n     in these times of tightening state budgets, class actions \n     provide an important ``private attorney general'' supplement \n     to the efforts of state Attorneys General to prosecute \n     violations of state consumer protection, civil rights, labor, \n     public health and environmental laws.\n       We recognize that some class action lawsuits in both state \n     and federal courts have resulted in only minimal benefits to \n     class members, despite the award of substantial attorneys' \n     fees. While we support targeted efforts to prevent such \n     abuses and preserve the integrity of the class action \n     mechanism, we believe S. 5 goes too far. By fundamentally \n     altering the basic principles of federalism, S. 5, if enacted \n     in its present form, would result in far greater harm than \n     good. It therefore is not surprising that organizations such \n     as AARP, AFL-CIO, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers \n     Union, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, NAACP and \n     Public Citizen all oppose this legislation in its present \n     form.\n     1. Class actions should not be ``federalized''\n       S. 5 would vastly expand federal diversity jurisdiction, \n     and thereby would result in most class actions being filed in \n     or removed to federal court. This transfer of jurisdiction in \n     cases raising questions of state law will inappropriately \n     usurp the primary role of state courts in developing their \n     own state tort and contract laws, and will impair their \n     ability to establish consistent interpretations of those \n     laws. There is no compelling need or empirical support for \n     such a sweeping change in our long-established system for \n     adjudicating state law issues. In fact, by transferring most \n     state court class actions to an already overburdened federal \n     court system, this bill will delay (if not deny) justice to \n     substantial numbers of injured citizens. Moreover, S. 5 is \n     fundamentally flawed because under this legislation, most \n     class actions brought against a defendant who is not a \n     ``citizen'' of the state will be removed to federal court, no \n     matter how substantial a presence the defendant has in the \n     state or how much harm the defendant has caused in the state.\n     2. Clarification is needed that S. 5 does not apply to state \n         Attorney General actions\n       State Attorneys General frequently investigate and bring \n     actions against defendants who have caused harm to our \n     citizens, usually pursuant to the Attorney General's parens \n     patriae authority under our respective state consumer \n     protection and antitrust statutes. In some instances, such \n     actions have been brought with the Attorney General acting as \n     the class representative for the consumers of the state. We \n     are concerned that certain provisions of S. 5 might be \n     misinterpreted to impede the ability of the Attorneys General \n     to bring such actions, thereby interfering with one means of \n     protecting our citizens from unlawful activity and its \n     resulting harm. That Attorney General enforcement actions \n     should proceed unimpeded is important to all our \n     constituents, but most significantly to our senior citizens \n     living on fixed incomes and the working poor. S. 5 therefore \n     should be amended to clarify that it does not apply to \n     actions brought by any State Attorney General on behalf of \n     his or her respective state or its citizens. We understand \n     that Senator Pryor will be offering an amendment on this \n     issue, and we urge that it be adopted.\n     3. Many multi-State class actions cannot be brought in \n         federal court\n       Another significant problem with S. 5 is that many federal \n     courts have refused to certify multi-state class actions \n     because the court would be required to apply the laws of \n     different jurisdictions to different plaintiffs--even if the \n     laws of those jurisdictions are very similar. Thus, cases \n     commenced as state class actions and then removed to federal \n     court may not be able to be continued as class actions in \n     federal court.\n       In theory, injured plaintiffs in each state could bring a \n     separate class action lawsuit in federal court, but that \n     defeats one of the main purposes of class actions, which is \n     to conserve judicial resources. Moreover, while the \n     population of some states may be large enough to warrant a \n     separate class action involving only residents of those \n     states, it is very unlikely that similar lawsuits will be \n     brought on behalf of the residents of many smaller states. \n     This problem should be addressed by allowing federal courts \n     to certify nationwide class actions to the full extent of \n     their constitutional power--either by applying one state's \n     law with sufficient ties to the underlying claims in the \n     case, or by ensuring that a federal judge does not deny \n     certification on the sole ground that the laws of more \n     than one state would apply to the action. We understand \n     that Senator Jeff Bingaman will be proposing an amendment \n     to address this problem, and that amendment should be \n     adopted.\n     4. Civil rights and labor cases should be exempted\n       Proponents of S. 5 point to allegedly ``collusive'' \n     consumer class action settlements in which plaintiffs' \n     attorneys received substantial fee awards, while the class \n     members merely received ``coupons'' towards the purchase of \n     other goods sold by defendants. Accordingly, this ``reform'' \n     should apply only to consumer class actions. Class action \n     treatment provides a particularly important mechanism for \n     adjudicating the claims of low-wage workers and victims of \n     discrimination, and there is no apparent need to place \n     limitations on these types of actions. Senator Kennedy \n     reportedly will offer an amendment on this issue, which also \n     should be adopted.\n     5. The notification provisions are misguided\n       S. 5 requires that federal and state regulators, and in \n     many cases state Attorneys General, be notified of proposed \n     class action settlements, and be provided with copies of the \n     complaint, class notice, proposed settlement and other \n     materials. Apparently this provision is intended to protect \n     against ``collusive'' settlements between defendants and \n     plaintiffs' counsel, but those materials would be unlikely to \n     reveal evidence of collusion, and thus would provide little \n     or no basis for objecting to the settlement. Without clear \n     authority in the legislation to more closely examine \n     defendants on issues bearing on the fairness of the proposed \n     settlement (particularly out-of-state defendants over whom \n     subpoena authority may in some circumstances be limited), the \n     notification provision lacks meaning. Class members could be \n     misled into believing that their interests are being \n     protected by their government representatives, simply because \n     the notice was sent to the Attorney General of the United \n     States, State Attorneys General and other federal and state \n     regulators.\n       Equal access to the American system of justice is a \n     foundation of our democracy.\n     S. 5 would effect a sweeping reordering of our nation's \n     system of justice that will disenfranchise individual \n     citizens from obtaining redress for harm, and thereby impede \n     efforts against egregious corporate wrongdoing. Although we \n     fully support the goal of preventing abusive class action \n     settlements, and would be willing to provide assistance in \n     your effort to implement necessary reforms, we are likewise \n     committed to maintaining our federal system of justice and \n     safeguarding the interests of the public. For these \n     reasons, we oppose S. 5 in its present form.\n           Sincerely,\n         Eliot Spitzer, Attorney General of the State of New York; \n           W.A. Drew Edmondson, Attorney General of the State of \n           Oklahoma; Bill Lockyer, Attorney General of the State \n           of California; Lisa Madigan, Attorney General of the \n           State of Illinois; Tom Miller, Attorney General of the \n           State of Iowa. Gregory D. Stumbo, Attorney General of \n           the State of Kentucky; G. Steven Rowe, Attorney General \n           of the State of Maine.\n         J. Joseph Curran, Jr., Attorney General of the State of \n           Maryland; Tom Reilly, Attorney General of the State of \n           Massachusetts; Mike Hatch, Attorney General of the \n           State of Minnesota; Patricia A. Madrid, Attorney \n           General of the State of New Mexico; Hardy Myers, \n           Attorney General of the State of Oregon; William H. \n           Sorrell, Attorney General of the State of Vermont; \n           Darrell McGraw, Attorney General of the State of West \n           Virginia.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I know class action issues have been raised by Senators \nKohl, Feinstein, Schumer, Dodd, Carper, Landrieu, and others. While I \nmay disagree with them on some parts of this, I do so respectfully \nbecause I know how hard they have worked.\n  In the last Congress, they were able to negotiate some procedural \nimprovements. They reined in some of the worst aspects of previous \nclass action bills. One improvement was to restrict the use of \nworthless coupon settlements. I strongly support this improvement, \nwhich is a targeted provision that goes after a real class action \nabuse, not one that is just made up by special interests.\n  Unfortunately, there are other aspects that fail to achieve their \nintended goals. For example, two narrow exceptions have been negotiated \nto allow a few local controversies to remain in State court. But the \nexceptions to removal to Federal court touch on only a thin sliver of \nthe class action cases this bill would affect--only when plaintiffs and \nprimary defendants are from the same State--and even then it will do \nmore harm than good with the complicated formula that will cause costly \nand time-consuming litigation. So this just increases the cost and \nincreases the litigation.\n  Another provision seeks to reduce the delay plaintiffs can experience \nwhen a case is removed to Federal court by setting a time limit for \nappeals of remand orders. But no measure\n\n[[Page S1004]]\n\nis included in the bill to set a timeline for the district court to \nrule on the actual remand motion. What this means in layman's terms is \na party can pluck one of these class actions out of State court and put \nit in Federal court, and if the Federal court rules against you on a \nremand, you have a right to appeal. But what do you do if they never \nrule? The case could sit there year after year and with no resolution. \nLitigants could die. People who have been harmed could die. People \ncould move away, and nothing happens.\n  Senator Feingold is going to offer an amendment to set a reasonable \ntime limit for the district court to rule on remand orders. It does \nnothing to change the bill. It says you cannot pocket veto a case by \nsticking it away in a federal court docket somewhere. You have to rule \none way or the other. We should all embrace that commonsense \nimprovement.\n  I am also concerned that this bill will deny justice to consumers and \nothers in class actions that involve multiple State laws. The recent \ntrend in Federal courts is not to certify class actions if multiple \nState laws are involved. This bill, therefore, could force nationwide \nclass actions to Federal court. Once they are removed to Federal court, \nyou have a Catch-22. They have to be dismissed because they involve too \nmany State laws.\n  If this legislation is really about transferring class actions to \nFederal court instead of being a pro-business vehicle for simply \ndismissing legitimate class actions, then the supporters of this \nlegislation should want to solve this real Catch-22 problem. Senator \nBingaman has an amendment to do just that. He is a former attorney \ngeneral. He understands this. I look forward to debating this issue on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Of course, the legislation covers more than just class actions. \nIndividual personal injury actions, consolidated by State courts for \nefficiency purposes, are not class actions. Despite the fact that a \nsimilar provision was unanimously struck from the bill during the \nmarkup of class actions legislation in the Judiciary Committee last \nCongress, despite the fact that every single Republican, every single \nDemocrat voted to strike this provision, now mass torts are again \nincluded in the bill. Again, that makes no sense. Federalizing these \nindividual cases will delay and possibly deny justice for victims \nsuffering real physical injuries. It will be a boon to the makers of \nVioxx, but certainly will not help those who took Vioxx.\n  Mass tort cases are not class actions. They have not been analyzed \nunder rule 23's standards or State law equivalents to rule 23. They are \nan important means by which groups of injured people have long been \nable to pursue remedies against those who have harmed them.\n  Mass tort cases address injuries to citizens' health from dangerous \nmedical products, injuries to their property and their health from \nenvironmental disasters, and injuries to their rights and liberties \nfrom widespread mistreatment in the workplace. There are entirely \ndifferent procedural vehicles to reach justice in class actions. They \nshould not be lumped in with class actions. Senator Durbin has an \namendment that would leave mass tort actions in State courts where they \nbelong.\n  I am old enough to remember the civil rights battles of the 1950s and \n1960s and the impact of class actions in vindicating basic rights \nthrough our courts. The landmark Supreme Court decision in Brown v. \nBoard of Education was the culmination of appeals from four class \naction cases--three from Federal court decisions in Kansas, South \nCarolina, and Virginia, and one from a decision by the State supreme \ncourt of Delaware.\n  Only the supreme court of Delaware--the State court, not the Federal \ncourt--got the case right by deciding for the African-American \nplaintiffs. The State court justices understood they were constrained \nby the existing Supreme Court law but, nonetheless, held that the \nsegregated schools of Delaware violated the 14th amendment. Before any \nFederal court did so, a State court rejected separate and unequal \nschools.\n  Today we take that for granted, but it was not because those cases \nwent into Federal court that the civil rights of African Americans were \ndetermined; it was because they were in State court. Indeed, many civil \nrights advocates, including the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights \nUnder Law, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the Mexican \nAmerican Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the National Asian \nPacific Legal Consortium, have written to Senators in opposition to \nthis legislation and in support of Senator Kennedy's amendment to \nexempt civil rights and wage and hour cases from the bill. I am proud \nto cosponsor his amendment, and I look forward to the debate on it.\n  The legislation has also been criticized by nearly all the State \nAttorneys General in this country. I understand that at least 43 of the \n50 State Attorneys General have expressed concern that S. 5 could limit \ntheir powers to investigate and bring actions in their State courts \nagainst defendants who cause harm to their citizens because in certain \ninstances they file suit as the class representative for the consumers \nof their State.\n  I expect Senator Pryor, a distinguished former State attorney general \nhimself, to bring this issue to the floor with a clarifying amendment.\n  Some special interest groups are distorting the state of class action \nlitigation by relying on a few anecdotes in an ends-oriented attempt to \nimpede plaintiffs from bringing class action cases. We should take \nsteps to correct actual problems as they occur. Simply transferring \nmost suits into Federal court will not correct the real problems faced \nby plaintiffs and defendants.\n  In fact, this Congress and past Congresses have federalized so many \ncriminal cases that used to be in State courts and dumped them into the \nFederal courts that it is increasingly difficult to even get a civil \ncase heard in Federal court. So many things are handled by local \nprosecutors, such as Senator Specter and myself when we were \nprosecutors, by local law enforcement, but because they are interesting \nmatters, we have succumbed to the temptation to federalize case after \ncase that State authorities have always handled very well. These \ncriminal cases are now in the Federal courts, and the Federal courts \nare overloaded with them. Now we are going to transfer a whole lot more \ncases into Federal courts.\n  Defrauded investors, deceived consumers, victims of defective \nproducts and environmental torts, and thousands of other ordinary \npeople have been able to rely on class action lawsuits in our State \ncourt system, and there they have sought and received justice. We all \nknow that without consolidating procedures such as class actions, it \nmight be impossible for victims to obtain effective legal \nrepresentation.\n  Companies tend to pay their defense lawyers by the hour. They are \nwell paid. Plaintiffs' lawyers in class actions tend to work without \npay for the possibility of obtaining a portion of the proceeds, if they \nare successful. It may well prove uneconomical for counsel to take on \ncases against governmental or corporate defendants if they must do so \non an individual basis. It may be that individual claims are simply too \nsmall to be pursued.\n  Sometimes that is what the cheaters count on; it is how they get away \nwith their schemes. Cheating thousands of people just a little is still \ncheating, or millions of people just a little creates millions of \ndollars for one person with nothing to stop them from doing it. Class \nactions allow the little guys to band together to afford a competent \nlawyer to redress wrongdoing.\n  Whether those regular citizens are getting together to force \nmanufacturers to recall or correct dangerous products, or to clean up \nafter devastating environmental harms that endanger their children or \ntheir neighborhoods, or to vindicate the basic civil rights to which \nthey are entitled, they are using class actions. Why make it more \ndifficult or costly for them to right those wrongs?\n  As the New York Times noted in an editorial last week opposing this \nbill, the real objective of this legislation is ``to dilute the impact \nof strong State laws protecting consumers and the environment and to \nmake it harder for Americans to win redress in court when harmed by bad \ncorporate behavior.''\n  We have very strong environmental laws in Vermont, and we are very\n\n[[Page S1005]]\n\nproud of them. Now we see this Congress about to say to the Vermont \nLegislature: We can apply much lesser standards; we will just take it \naway from any enforcement you already have.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times editorial be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 2, 2005]\n\n                         Class-Action Lawsuits\n\n       Tort reform is in the eye of the beholder. In the name of \n     reforming the nation's civil justice system, and with scant \n     public debate, President Bush and Congressional Republicans \n     are racing to reward wealthy business supporters by changing \n     the rules for class-action lawsuits. Their real objective is \n     to dilute the impact of strong state laws protecting \n     consumers and the environment and to make it harder for \n     Americans to win redress in court when they are harmed by bad \n     corporate behavior.\n       The proposed legislation, the so-called Class Action \n     Fairness Act, will be taken up by the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee on Thursday, with a vote by the full chamber \n     expected as early as next week. Under the bill's sweeping \n     provisions, nearly all major class-action lawsuits would be \n     moved from state courts to already stretched federal courts. \n     New procedural hurdles and backlogs would be destined to \n     delay or deny justice in many cases, and to discourage \n     plaintiffs and plaintiffs' lawyers from pursuing legitimate \n     claims in the first place.\n       The proposed lunge to federal courts is so extreme that \n     cases would be removed to federal courts even when a vast \n     majority of the plaintiffs were from one state, the claimed \n     injuries occurred in the state and involved possible \n     violations of state law, and the principal defendant had a \n     headquarters elsewhere but did substantial business in the \n     state.\n       In a revealing but disappointing move last year, the \n     measure's proponents rejected a balanced compromise that \n     would have broadened federal jurisdiction while preserving \n     the role of state courts in cases that are more local than \n     national in flavor. Despite some useful provisions aimed at \n     genuine abuses, the bill would reduce the accountability of \n     corporations that violate laws protecting employees, \n     consumers and the environment.\n       The measure died in the Senate at the close of the last \n     session. But with President Bush now actively campaigning for \n     its passage, the juggernaut may be unstoppable, particularly \n     since some key Democrats, like Senators Charles Schumer of \n     New York and Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, switched sides \n     last year to back the bill in exchange for some modest \n     revisions. The new Judiciary Committee chairman, Senator \n     Arlen Specter, should at least be willing to entertain a \n     handful of improving amendments. The most crucial would fix \n     the bill's Catch-22: plaintiffs filing class-action suits \n     could be refused a hearing in state court if they came from \n     several different states, and then bounced out of federal \n     court because their complaint called for applying the laws of \n     multiple states.\n       The ability of ordinary citizens with similar injuries to \n     band together to take on powerful corporate interests by \n     utilizing the mechanism of class-action lawsuits is one of \n     the shining aspects of the nation's civil justice system. \n     That reality tends to be overlooked amid all the overwrought \n     spinning by the president and others who are trying to drum \n     up concern about a litigation ``crisis'' and to pressure \n     Congress to usurp proper state authority and weaken important \n     protections for ordinary Americans.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. This so-called Class Action Fairness Act falls short of \nthe expectation set forth by its title. It will leave many injured \nparties who have valid claims with no avenue for relief, and that is \nanything but fair to ordinary Americans who look to us to represent \nthem in the Senate.\n  I seem to have a touch of laryngitis which is an occupational hazard \nfor Senators. I will not speak further, but I will come back to this \nissue in the future. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. Res. 38\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5 p.m. \ntoday the Senate proceed to the consideration of a resolution regarding \nthe Iraqi elections, which is at the desk; provided further, that there \nbe 30 minutes for debate equally divided between the leaders or their \ndesignees, and that there be no amendments to the resolution or \npreamble. I further ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 p.m., the Senate \nproceed to a vote on the adoption of the resolution, and that following \nthat vote, the preamble be agreed to, without intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the comments of the distinguished Senator from Utah I be \nrecognized to speak briefly on the asbestos reform issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I shall be off the floor for a few moments while Senator \nHatch speaks, but I will return shortly after he completes his remarks.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be included \nas a cosponsor of S. Res. 38.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate my two colleagues and their \nremarks on this very important bill. I rise to express my strong \nsupport for S. 5, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2004. This \nbipartisan bill represents a carefully crafted legislative solution in \nresponse to the rampant abuses of the class action litigation device \ncurrently in our State courts.\n  The American public will benefit from a system that fairly \ncompensates these injured people by those who are injured by unsafe or \ndefective products. No one disputes this. We all want a system of \ncompensation, but we must make sure the system is fair, reasonable, and \nequitable.\n  As well, this legislation helps protect against unfair recoveries \nbecause, in the end, the public pays when defendant companies are \nforced to pay excessive claims and sometimes must increase prices, \ndecrease employment, or even become bankrupt or go out of business. We \nought to all understand that we all pay for that, and that is why it is \nimportant we get the laws right and that we correct injustices and \ndistortions of the law.\n  Before I begin discussing the legislation, I commend the \ndistinguished majority leader, Dr. Frist, for bringing this bill up so \nearly in the Congress. I also commend President Bush for recognizing \nthe importance of this issue in his State of the Union Address. \nSenators Grassley, Kohl, and Carper also deserve recognition for all \nthe time and effort they have devoted to this particular bill over the \nlast several Congresses, and without their tireless work, we would not \nhave the bipartisan compromise bill that we have in S. 5.\n  Finally, I must recognize Chairman Specter for placing this bill on \nthe Judiciary Committee agenda and reporting this legislation last \nweek.\n  Over the past decade, it has become painfully obvious that class \naction abuses have reached troublesome proportions in our civil justice \nsystem.\n  It has become equally clear that the true victims of this epidemic \nhave been everyday consumers who represent the silent majority of \nunnamed class members. It has become too common an occurrence for \nplaintiff class members not to be adequately informed of their rights \nor of the terms and practical implications of a proposed class action \nsettlement.\n  Making matters worse, judges too often approve settlements that \nprimarily benefit class counsel, the personal injury lawyers, rather \nthan the class members--in other words, the victims.\n  Efforts to reform our class action system are nothing new to the \nSenate. The Senate Judiciary Committee conducted hearings in the 105th, \n106th, and 107th Congresses, reporting a similar bill from the \ncommittee in the 106th on a bipartisan basis. Since then, we continue \nto receive substantive evidence demonstrating the drastically \nincreasing injustice caused by class action abuses.\n  After working extensively with numerous legislative proposals \nthroughout the various Congresses, we are now on the verge of taking \nfinal action on a balanced bill that I would like to spend a little bit \nof time explaining further.\n  When I say a balanced bill, I refer specifically to the operation of \nthe bill's grant of Federal jurisdiction over interstate class actions. \nThis key provision is located in section 4 of the bill and corrects a \nflaw in the current application of the Federal diversity jurisdiction \nstatute that now prevents most interstate class actions from being \nadjudicated in Federal courts.\n  Specifically, section 4 of the bill grants the Federal district \ncourts original jurisdiction to hear interstate class actions if, one, \nany member of the proposed class is a citizen of a different\n\n[[Page S1006]]\n\nState from any defendant; two, the amount in controversy exceeds $5 \nmillion; and, three, the class action lawsuit involves a class of 100 \nor more members.\n  Although I believe the three conditions I have noted are more than \nsufficient to achieve the right balance between Federal and State \ninterests, S. 5 goes a step further by incorporating two additional \nprovisions to accommodate the States' interests in adjudicating local \ndisputes.\n  First, pursuant to an amendment offered by Senator Feinstein during a \nmarkup last Congress, Federal jurisdiction would not extend to any case \nin which two-thirds or more of the proposed class members and the \nprimary defendants are residents of the State where the action was \nfiled.\n  This exception keeps in the State courts those class actions that are \nprosecuted by a locally dominated plaintiffs' class with grievances \nagainst local defendants. In other words, a locally dominated lawyer-\njudge set of relationships that seems to be continually resulting in \nunjust treatment in the courts.\n  Similarly, the Feinstein amendment also provides that Federal courts \nmay, based on a number of carefully proscribed factors, decline to \nexercise jurisdiction in middle tier cases in which two-thirds of the \nproposed class members and the primary defendants are residents of the \nsame State.\n  To be sure, as part of the recent compromise reached last November \nwith Senators Schumer, Dodd, and Landrieu, we further modified the \nFeinstein amendment by adding an additional factor for the Federal \ncourts to consider for the middle tier of cases specifically whether \nthere is a substantial nexus between the claims and the court selected \nby the plaintiffs.\n\n  I will refer to the Feinstein chart. That chart makes it very clear, \nin my eyes, that tier I, two-thirds or more of the proposed class \nmembers, are in-State versus in-State primary defendants. That would \nstay in State court.\n  Tier II, between one-third and two-thirds of the proposed class \nmembers are in-State versus in-State primary defendants, and one can go \nto either State or Federal court, subject to the judge's discretion.\n  Tier III, where there is one-third or fewer of the proposed class \nmembers in-State versus in-State primary defendants, those cases go to \nFederal court.\n  Although I believe the three conditions I noted are more than \nsufficient to achieve the right balance between Federal and State \ninterests, section 5 goes a step further by incorporating these \nadditional principles to accommodate States' interests in adjudicating \nlocal disputes.\n  The second point I was making is that States' interests in \nadjudicating local disputes on behalf of their citizens are further \npreserved through a newly created exception to Federal jurisdiction for \ntruly local controversies. This provision, which we negotiated on a \nbipartisan basis last November with the three new Democratic sponsors \nof this bill, keeps in the State courts those class action lawsuits \nthat satisfy the following four criteria which I will discuss in \ngreater detail so there is no confusion on this issue.\n  Criterion 1, the proposed class must be primarily local, where more \nthan two-thirds of the class members are citizens of the State where \nthe suit was filed. This formulation resembles the two-thirds test in \nthe Feinstein amendment I just discussed and essentially requires a \nlarge majority of the injured claimants reside within the State.\n  Criterion 2, the class action must be brought against at least one \nreal defendant. The local defendant cannot be peripheral. Rather, the \nlawsuit must be brought against at least one defendant with a \nsignificant basis of liability and from whom significant relief is \nsought. This provision essentially precludes personal injury lawyers \nfrom evading Federal jurisdiction by simply naming a local defendant \nsuch as Hilda Bankston, who was unmercifully dragged into scores of \nclass action lawsuits simply because her small family-operated pharmacy \nsold the diet drug phen-phen. That was the only reason she was brought \nin, but the real reason was because she was a pigeon sitting in the \nState and they used her as a device to bring all of these suits by many \npeople who had nothing to do with the State, nothing to do with her.\n  Criterion 3, the principal injuries must have occurred locally. In \nother words, the total extent of the injuries complained of must be \nconcentrated within the forum State. By way of an example, a nationwide \ndrug lawsuit involving injuries spread throughout the country would \ncertainly not qualify for this criteria. On the other hand, this \ncriteria would be satisfied by a class action lawsuit involving a \nfactory explosion affecting a confined geographic area.\n  Criterion 4, no other similar class actions can have been filed \nduring the preceding 3 years. This criterion is intended to ensure that \nthe exception does not apply to those class actions that are likely to \nbe filed in multiple States based on the same or similar factual \nallegations against any of the same defendants.\n\n  When applying all four criteria, the local controversy exception will \nenable State courts to hear local class actions alleging principal \ninjuries confined to the forum State and where the lawsuit involved \nlitigants who predominately reside within that State. I refer to the \nlocal controversy provision chart.\n  As my colleagues can see, that chart for these tier III people keeps \ntruly local claims in State court. With regard to plaintiffs, if two-\nthirds or more of the proposed class members are in the State and with \nregard to the defendants at least one in-State defendant from whom \nsignificant relief is sought--not the Hilda Bankston who was ruined by \nthese false suits--and alleged conduct forms a significant basis of \nclaims, and the nature of the claim's principal injuries were incurred \nin the State as a result of the alleged significant conduct, then those \ncases can be heard in State court.\n  I was interested in the comments of the distinguished Senator from \nVermont about justice and injustice. The injustices are all on the side \nof those who do not want this bill because they are protecting personal \ninjury lawyers rather than the individual claimants.\n  The individual claimants will have a right to go to court. It just \nmay be that they have to go to Federal court rather than State court.\n  Given the addition of Senator Feinstein's three-tiered jurisdictional \ntest and agreed-upon local controversy exception, I find it puzzling \nthat some have represented this bill will somehow move all class \nactions into Federal court. We just heard some comments like that. \nNothing could be further from the truth.\n  I urge these colleagues to read section 4 of the bill. If they cannot \nfind comfort in this language, I urge them to look at studies showing \nthat the bill will do nothing of the sort. If they are still skeptical, \nI urge them to talk to the cosponsors of the bill, including our \nDemocratic partners, for a completely candid assessment on whether the \nlegislation will move all class actions into Federal court. It simply \nwill not.\n  These actions will be able to be brought, but there will not be the \nsame ability to forum shop into favorable jurisdictions that act \noutside the law and allow unjust verdicts such as we have today.\n  I think the answer is perfectly clear. This bill moves to Federal \ncourt larger interstate class actions while keeping in State court \nlocal matters that are more suited for the States. Although I have \nfocused on two provisions in S. 5, I think it is important to note that \nthis bill contains many other changes we included so that we could \nbuild a bipartisan consensus.\n  After we fell one vote shy of invoking cloture the year before last, \nthree Democratic Senators who voted against proceeding on the bill \npresented us with a detailed list of issues they wanted resolved before \nthey could support class action reform legislation. After extensive \ndiscussions in November of 2003, we responded to each and every concern \nraised by these Senators and made the appropriate changes that are now \nembodied in S. 5.\n  As my colleagues will see, the points we have made show each \nDemocratic concern that was raised and how we addressed those concerns.\n\n  S. 5 is a modest bill that will help to put an end to class action \nabuses occurring in some of our State courts. Contrary to the arguments \nfrom the bill's opponents, S. 5 does not sweep\n\n[[Page S1007]]\n\ninto Federal court every conceivable class action. The bill more than \nadequately accommodates the States' interests in adjudicating local \ndisputes.\n  I might add that the argument we are going to deprive consumers from \ntheir day in court is pure bunk. The fact is, under certain \ncircumstances, they will have a right to be in State court or have a \nright, through the judge, to be in State or Federal court, and under \ncertain circumstances that are much more fair to all litigants \nconcerned, they will have to go to Federal court.\n  There is nothing wrong with going to Federal court. In fact, when I \npracticed law we loved to have cases that went to Federal court because \npeople thought they were more important cases. Frankly, in most cases \nthey were. When these cases are important, they will be tried in \nFederal court as well.\n  One thing we are concerned about, we think we have a better chance of \nhaving real justice in these cases in Federal court than to have the \nHilda Bankstons of this world put out of business under what are false \npretenses and manipulation of the Federal judicial system.\n  This legislation has been crafted and drafted through close \nbipartisan cooperation with several Members on the other side of the \naisle, and as a result now commands a simple majority of support of \nthis body. Despite this support, we are still faced with the \nobstructive tactics from a small minority that will do anything to \nappease the powerful and well-funded personal injury trial bar. I find \nthis unfortunate and hope these colleagues can look beyond these \nspecial interests and do what is right for the country's ailing civil \njustice system.\n  I have always belonged to the trial bar and I think most trial \nlawyers are people of dedication and decency who want to do what is \nright, but we have seen in recent years a real subversion of the law by \nsome trial lawyers who are interested only in money. In many respects, \nthey are not worried about clients but worried about their own \ncompensation system. The fact is, we need to do what is right for our \ncountry's ailing civil justice system.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act addresses an abuse of the class action \nsystem that has grown substantially in the past few years. I am \nreferring to the gaming of the judicial system by unscrupulous lawyers \nto evade Federal diversity jurisdiction. In some cases, the filing and \nsettling of class action lawsuits has become a virtual wheel of fortune \nwith every spin of the wheel potentially worth millions of dollars. \nHowever, class members do not benefit from these spins of the wheel. \nRather, it is the class counsels who receive millions of dollars in \nattorneys' fees who are the real winners of this gaming situation and \nof the game.\n  It is the sad but true fact that the most class members can expect to \nreceive, which is an ironic twist, is a coupon good for the future \npurchase of the very product that was the basis of their claim to begin \nwith.\n  Again, under the current tort system, it is the class action lawyers \nwho are the real beneficiaries. They are the ones who walk away from a \nclass action with millions in their pockets while the class members \nwalk away with little or nothing at all but these coupons. Before I \nturn to some specific examples of class action lawyers gaming the \nsystem to the detriment of their clients, let me explain just how this \ngame works.\n  It starts with a few class action attorneys sitting around a table, \nthinking of an idea for a class action lawsuit. While this idea may \ncome from any numbers of sources, it is usually formulated and \nsolidified after an examination of the deepest pockets in the corporate \nworld. Naturally, they want to make money.\n  Once an idea for a class action is formed, it is time to find a lead \nor named plaintiff. The named plaintiff will inevitably be someone who \nis a citizen of the same State as the defendant. Why? This keeps the \ncase in State court.\n  Why is this essential to winning the game? Because if the suit is in \nState court, the class counsels can file multiple class actions, \nalleging similar claims against similar defendants in multiple \ndistricts. They do this in search of a judge willing to quickly certify \nthe class.\n  And because the State courts do not have a method of consolidating \nidentical claims like we have in the Federal system, all of those \nclaims remain pending in the various State courts around the country. \nThe filing of multiple class actions in multiple districts gives the \nclass counsel tremendous leverage to play hard ball with the defendant \ncompanies. By bringing class action upon class action against a \ncompany, the company is left with no other option but to settle. The \nalternative is to be bled dry by legal fees and face the uncertainty \nthat one of the many courts will destroy the company by delivering a \njackpot award against it.\n  While I suppose the class counsel would like to think of it as a game \nof hardball, to companies it must feel a lot like execution; and it \nmust feel a lot like what it really is: extortion.\n  The real kicker is this: in some cases, many believe the only \ninterests served by these settlements are those of the class counsel. \nAgain, they will walk away with hundreds of thousands and sometimes \nmillions of dollars. And what do the class members recover? Perhaps a \nworthless coupon.\n  There you have it, a successful gaming of the State tort system by \nthe class action lawyers.\n  This is an intolerable practice and one that the Class A Action \nFairness Act will curb.\n  I used to be a plaintiff's attorney. I was a defense lawyer as well. \nI am in no way indicting the actions of all plaintiff attorneys or \nclass action attorneys. In many cases, plaintiff attorneys play a vital \nrole in protecting the legitimate interests of injured consumers.\n  For example, I supported the efforts of the Castano group of \nplaintiff attorneys in the class action case against cigarette \ncompanies.\n  Despite the fine efforts of many, many plaintiffs' lawyers, the \nactions of a powerful minority of plaintiffs' attorneys have created \nthe situation we need to remedy with this situation.\n  To demonstrate how class action lawyers have manipulated the tort \nsystem to their benefit, let us take a spin at the wheel and see what \nwe come up with.\n  Spin the wheel again and we come to the 2003 Cook County, Illinois \ncourt-approved settlement of Degradi v. KB Holdings, Inc.\n  This class action alleged that KB Toys, one of the largest toy \nretailers in the country, manipulated toy prices to lead customers to \nbelieve that they were paying discounted prices. Specifically, the suit \nalleged that certain products contained an inflated reference price \nthat was marked through in red with a lower selling price next to it.\n  To settle the suit, the company agreed to hold what amounted to a \nweek long sale with a thirty percent discount on selected products. \nHowever, the company was not obligated under the terms of the \nsettlement to advertise the discount. As a result, many of the class \nmembers eligible to receive the discount were not aware of it until \nlong after the sale was over.\n  How did the game turn out for the class counsel? They won a whopping \n$1 million in attorneys' fees. And according to an independent analyst, \nKB Toys actually stood to benefit from the settlement because they were \nable to drive traffic into the store on the days of the discount.\n  All told, this was not a bad spin at the wheel for all parties \nconcerned. That is, all parties except for the class members--in other \nwords the people who were allegedly injured.\n  If you spin the wheel again you land on the in re Microsoft \nLitigation Settlement.\n  The wheel has landed on in re Microsoft Litigation Settlement.\n  Microsoft has been involved in multiple antitrust class action \nalleging that the computer giant used its control of certain programs \nto price gouge its customers. Ten of the class actions have been \nsettled, including the suit brought in Johnson County, KS.\n  Under the terms of the settlement, class members who purchased \nMicrosoft hardware will receive a $5 or $10 voucher toward the future \npurchase of particular computer hardware or software products.\n  If these settlement terms some like something less than a big victory \nfor the consumers, wait until you hear about the onerous process they \nhave to\n\n[[Page S1008]]\n\nendure in order to redeem the vouchers.\n  First, to even receive a voucher, a class member must first download \na form from a website established for the purpose of handling the \nsettlements, fill it out and mail it in. Then, to redeem the voucher \nitself, the class member must mail in the voucher with a photocopy of \nthe original receipt and UPC code.\n  So the class members got some hard to redeem $5 and $10 coupons. Who \nthen came out the big winners in the game? You guessed it, once again \nit was the class counsel. In these cases, they have received a mind-\nboggling sum in attorney's fees to the tune of hundreds of millions of \ndollars.\n  With a spin of the wheel, we come to Ramsey v. Nestle Waters North \nAmerica.\n  This class action is better known as the Poland Springs Water class \naction. Let me refer to this Poland Spring Chart--this blue section \nwhich has $1.35 million on it.\n  The Ramsey suit alleged that Poland Spring water does not come from a \nspring deep in the woods of Maine as was advertised. Under the terms of \nthe settlement approved by the Kane County, IL State court, the named \nplaintiff received $12,000 while the class members received discounts \nor free Poland Spring water of the next 5 years. The company, which \ndenied any wrongdoing, agreed to enhance its quality control and make \napproximately $2.75 million in contributions to charities.\n  So in this round of the game, the class members got some free water. \nWhat about the class counsel? They were sitting pretty at the end of \nthe game with $1.35 million in attorney's fees.\n  As Roger Parloff put it in the Forbes magazine article entitled \n``Springtime for Poland,'' the settlement was ``pretty standard: next \nto undetectable benefits for us--some discount coupons and whatnot and \n$1.35 million cash for the plaintiffs' attorneys.''\n  That is right. Class action settlements have become so abusive that \nit is now standard and accepted practice for class counsel to receive \nmillions of dollars for getting class members a bottle of water.\n  Now we come to the Register.com settlement, approved by the New York \nCounty, New York State Supreme Court, and affirmed by the New York \nSuperior Court in 2003.\n  Register.com is the second largest domain registration company for \nthe Internet. Those wishing to register a domain name through the \ncompany may do so for a $35 fee. But if the main name is registered, \nthe company holds the Internet address and redirects the link to a \n``Coming Soon'' page featuring promotional advertisements for \nRegister.com and other companies until the domain nameholder develops a \nWeb site of its own.\n  Michael Zurakov, serving as lead plaintiff for the class action, \nclaimed that upon developing his own Web site, Register.com delayed in \nswitching over the purchased domain name to him and continued to \nredirect the link to the promotional ``Coming Soon'' page for several \nmonths to sell advertisements. When the class counsel moved to certify \nthe class, it was estimated that the class was comprised of \napproximately 3 million members.\n  Under the terms of the court-approved settlement, class members \nreceived $5 coupons to use. Each one got a $5 coupon to use with \nRegister.com, assuming that the class member registered with the \ncompany again. Meanwhile, the lawyers received $642,500 in attorney \nfees--lawyer fees.\n  To quote an article appearing in Domains Magazine, ``The munificence \nof this reward may reflect that fact that the claim, while perhaps not \nutterly without a shred of merit, was not exactly the most compelling \never heard.''\n  However weak the suit, the class counsel had a good day at the game, \ntaking home winnings of $642,500, especially compared to the $5 coupons \neach class member, so-called, got. That was the right to redeem, if \nthey went to Register.com, and registered a name.\n  Cases such as this only further encourage the filing of frivolous \nclaims by opportunistic class action counsel who are solely motivated \nby quick settlements that benefit only them.\n  Let me go to the Ameritech settlement for $16 million. This is a \nsettlement approved by the notorious Madison County, IL, State court, \none of the most abusive settlements I have ever seen.\n  You need to know about Madison County. Madison County is where a lot \nof these class actions go so they can make demand letters and get \nsettlements as defense cases. Madison County has judges who seem to be \nin the pockets of the trial lawyers in Madison County who become \ncocounsel in these cases, and, of course, have an instant entree to the \ncourts, and almost a guaranteed, outrageous award every time they go \ninto court. Most of the time they don't go to court. You will find in \nthe end very few actual cases are filed. But the demand letters are \nmade. And these companies are so frightened over Madison County, \nbecause they know they are going to get killed if they go to court, \nthat they almost automatically settle as a result of the demand \nletters. They settle for what it would cost them to defend these types \nof cases rather than go through the jackpot justice problem of getting \nslammed in a jurisdiction where apparently justice is not a measured \nfactor.\n  Here we have the Ameritech settlement approved by the Madison County, \nIL, State court. This is one of the most abusive settlements I have \never seen.\n  Two suits were filed in Madison County, IL, by the same firm on \nbehalf of customers in Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin, alleging that \nAmeritech wrongly charged customers for a wire maintenance program \nwithout informing them that the service was optional.\n  The settlement didn't provide customers with refunds for wrongful \ncharges. Instead, it gave each class member a $5 pay phone card that \ncould only be used at pay phones owned by SBC, the parent company of \nAmeritech, to make local and limited long distance calls within the \nState. Many of the class members complained that the cards were \nworthless to them because there were no SBC pay phones in the area. \nOther class members complained that the cards were worthless to them \neither because they did not use pay phones or because the cards \ncontained so many restrictions that they were essentially unusable.\n  This was not exactly a sweetheart deal for these consumers. But how \ndid the class action counsel come out in this round of the game?\n  They had a good spin of the wheel by any measure, winning $16 million \nin lawyer fees, while the class of people, alleged consumers who were \nsupposedly abused, really got nothing.\n  We can no longer sit idly by and allow abusive settlements to \ncontinue. What will S. 5 do to help curb the gaming of our tort system?\n  First, the bill gives the Federal courts diversity jurisdiction over \nlarge, national class actions with at least 100 class members seeking \nan amount-in-controversy of $5 million.\n  They can still bring their suit, but it will be in Federal court \nwhere it is much more likely that justice will occur, fairness will \noccur, and decent treatment will occur.\n  As a result of the provision, large and national class actions may \neither be originally filed or removed to Federal court, a forum that is \nbetter equipped to handle these kinds of cases--and to do so fairly. \nThey are not going to be deprived of their rights. They are just going \nto have to make their cases, and they are not going to be able to go to \nMadison County where they will have an automatic win absolutely \nguaranteed in the eyes of most companies which will be outrageous in \nnature as a general rule--or an automatic settlement for defense \ncosts--which is as close to distortion as you can get because the \ncompanies can't afford to go to court in that particular jurisdiction \nwith the judges the way they are, the attorneys the way they are, and \nall in cahoots the way they are.\n  Second, S. 5 contains provisions for the review and approval of \nproposed coupon settlements before a Federal court. It doesn't mean you \ncan't have coupon settlements, but you are sure going to have to get \nthe judge's approval. So these phoney coupons are going to be much \nfewer and much more far in between.\n  The bill provides that a Federal judge cannot approve a proposed \ncoupon settlement until conducting a hearing with a written finding \nthat the terms of the settlement are fair, reasonable, and equitable to \nthe class members.\n\n[[Page S1009]]\n\n  You would think that would be something every court in the land would \nwant to do, but, unfortunately, we have had far too many of these class \nactions where that hasn't been the case, or where counsel are the ones \nwho are basically mistreated in the end.\n\n  Our courts will no longer be used as a rubberstamp for proposed \nsettlements. This provision ensures that the true beneficiaries of a \nsettlement are the class members and not the lawyers who drew up the \nsettlement.\n  It doesn't cost any more money to go to Federal court than it does \nState court. It isn't a tremendous inconvenience; it is just that you \ncan expect the Federal judges not to be judges who are sustained by \nfinancial support by the local lawyers.\n  Third, this legislation requires that attorneys' fee awards be based \non the actual recovery of the class members in coupon settlements. In \nother words, contingency fees must be based on the value of coupons \nactually redeemed by class members. This will give the attorneys an \nincentive to ensure the class members actually get something in the \nsettlement they can use.\n  If you are going to get bottles of water, then the attorneys can get \nfees based upon how many bottles of water are gotten. I don't think \nmany lawsuits would be brought on that basis anymore. Or, if you are \ngoing to get a coupon, they can get fees based upon how many coupons \nare redeemed. Or, in the case of the SBC coupons, they can get fees \nonly to the extent that those coupons are viable and can be utilized, \nand how many of them are actually requested.\n  Practically speaking, class counsel will no longer look for a quick \nand hefty attorney fee settlement for themselves in which the class \nmembers recover relatively worthless coupons.\n  The time has come for us to put an end to this unfair system. I have \nheard many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle decry the state \nof the current tort system. I ask my colleagues to recognize this bill \nas the opportunity that it is, an opportunity to end the abuses of the \ncurrent tort system, or at least to make a start to ending the abuses \nof the current tort system and restoring confidence in our justice \nsystem.\n\n  Real good lawyers, the honest lawyers, if they bring class action \nlawsuits, will bring suits of viability, suits that mean something, \nsuits that are deserving of the awards that are given, not suits just \nfor the benefit of the lawyers involved. We have spent literally years \nnow negotiating the provisions of this delicate compromise bill. The \ntime has come to pass it.\n  I might add, this bill has evolved over a number of Congresses. We \nhave negotiated with virtually everybody who has wanted to negotiate on \nthis bill. We have made change after change after change. It is not a \nmajor change in our law, but it certainly will bring greater justice in \nour law and greater fairness and greater treatment in our law.\n  The fact is, we need this bill to remain intact. The House has \nindicated they will take this bill, if we pass it in its current form, \nand it will become law. There will be some attempts with amendments \nthat may have merit that I may even like, but this bill is a result of \na huge series of compromises that have taken years to achieve. We know \nif any amendment is added to this bill, it is very unlikely the House \nwill take it. We are faced with the proposition of the need to vote \ndown all amendments on this bill.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer has a number of amendments he \nwould like to add to this bill, as a distinguished former supreme court \njustice from the State of Texas, that would improve this bill. But he \nknows if we are going to pass this bill, we cannot take any amendments, \nincluding his. If we are going to take other amendments, we will have \nto take his. The fact is, we urge all amendments be voted down so we \ncan pass this bill and, hopefully, get it to the House and get it \npassed so justice can occur.\n  Any Member who stands in the Senate and says consumers are going to \nbe hurt by this bill, that we are not allowing suits to be brought, has \nnot read the bill or is deliberately distorting what is going on. The \nfact is, suits can be brought, legitimate suits can be brought, there \nwill be awards that will be made in legitimate cases, as they should \nbe, and we all will be better off as a country if we get the tort \nsystem so that it does justice, rather than jackpot justice for a few, \nand in a number of instances I have been citing, for lawyers only. \nUnfortunately, we have people gaming this system to such a degree that \nthis bill needs to pass. We need to straighten out the mess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I congratulate my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Hatch, for the outstanding work he has done on so \nmuch legislation during his tenure as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, including the class action bill, as he has spoken of in some \ndetail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/07/senate-section/article/S1009-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1009-S1043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ASBESTOS REFORM\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to talk about \nasbestos reform, which is legislation that Senator Hatch had \nshepherded, along with Senator Leahy and Senator Frist, with \nsubstantial contributions by Senator Daschle, as well.\n  Today, I am going to submit for the record a bill which is a \ndiscussion draft. I had intended to submit this legislation late last \nweek, but I was asked by the majority leader to defer for a week so \nthat further consideration could be given today by the majority leader \nand by members of the Judiciary Committee, including the Presiding \nOfficer.\n  We have reached a critical stage in the analysis and presentation of \nthis legislation. It has had a long history. In July of 2003, more than \n19 months ago, the Judiciary Committee passed out a bill, which all \nagreed had a great many problems, but it was passed out of committee \nlargely along party lines. I voted for it, in order to move the bill \nalong.\n  As it is generally known, I then enlisted the aid of a senior Federal \njudge, Judge Edward R. Becker, who recently was the chief judge of the \nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit, to undertake discussions, \ncalled mediation, and for 2 days in August of 2003, Judge Becker and I \nsat in his chambers with the so-called stakeholders representatives of \nthe manufacturers, representatives of labor, AFL-CIO, representatives \nof the insurance industry, and representatives of the trial lawyers. \nThat has been followed by some 39 separate meetings which have been \nconvened in my conference room.\n  In addition to numerous discussions Judge Becker has held with \ninterested parties and which I have held with interested parties, we \nhave come to a point in our work where we have found agreement among \nthe parties on many items. We have found the stakeholders very close \ntogether on other items.\n  As might be expected, it has been necessary to make judgments, which \nis the responsibility of this Senator and which I have done in \ncollaboration with many other Senators, about what this bill \nrepresents, which in my considered judgment is an equitable bill.\n  In early January, I circulated a discussion draft which had certain \nblanks until we had a hearing, which was held on January 11. I have \nalso had an eye to trying to get the bill completed so that the \nmajority leader could take it up at an early date. If that is not done, \nand the bill languishes into the season where we take up the \nappropriations bills, it simply will not be taken up. The asbestos \nissue is a crisis in the United States today. There is general \nagreement on that, with some 74 companies having gone into bankruptcy, \nand with thousands of asbestos victims suffering from mesothelioma, \nwhich is a deadly disease, and other deadly diseases and not collecting \nbecause their employers have gone bankrupt.\n  We have found other very difficult issues on so-called ``mixed \ndust.'' We held a hearing last week, and I think we have worked through \nthe scientific evidence on that proposal so that we are now in a \nposition to know when someone comes forward with a claim, whether it is \nfrom asbestos, which has already been covered under the trust fund, or \nwhether it is from silica, which would be a separate cause of action.\n  The essential provisions of this legislation create a trust fund. In \norder to collect from the trust fund, victims--people exposed to \nasbestos--must establish certain levels of disability.\n\n[[Page S1010]]\n\nThere is a graduated scale as to compensation. The offset to the right \nof victims to give up their right to jury trial is the assurance that \nif this fund proves to be insufficient, people can go back to the jury \ntrial system. There had been a great deal of discussion as to what was \nan adequate amount for the trust fund.\n  The manufacturers and insurers made an offer of $140 billion. There \nwere discussions last fall between Senator Frist and Senator Daschle \nwhere there was agreement to that proposal as to the total amount, \nalthough there had not been and has not been any agreement by the AFL-\nCIO or by labor. After a lot of consideration, it is my judgment that \nis an equitable figure. It is impossible to say what the total claims \nwill be, what the total sum will be that is required because we do not \nknow how many claims there will be. But if that figure should prove \ninsufficient, then victims--claimants--have a right to go back to the \njury trial system.\n  There had been some disagreement as to how much money should be in at \nthe start, with manufacturers and insurers wanting $40 billion in the \nfirst 5 years, and labor wanting $60 billion. After considerable \ninquiry, I was satisfied that the fund would have the ability to borrow \nat least $20 billion extra, so that the $60 billion total looked to by \nlabor would be realized. Again, not to the satisfaction of all the \nparties, that is what the bill provides.\n  The manufacturers and the insurers were looking for a 7\\1/2\\ year \nperiod where they would be assured there would be no other claims made. \nAfter extensive consideration, it was my judgment that there were \ncertainly reasonable assurances that the fund would last for at least \n7\\1/2\\ years, but that if the fund was to fall short, that ought to be \na burden not met by the claimants, but they ought to have their right \nto reversion to a jury trial.\n  There was a consideration as to what would happen on startup, with \nthe manufacturers and insurers wanting a very lengthy period of time. \nThe bill strikes a compromise, with 270 days to start up the bill on \nexigent claims--that is, very serious claims involving mesothelioma--\nand 18 months on other claims. Labor and the trial lawyers felt there \nought to be access to the courts continuously until the fund was \nstarted. The reality is, there are many delays, and a 270-day delay, \nwhile nobody likes any delays, is not an excessive delay under our \nlitigation system in the United States. So that compromise and that \nadjustment was made.\n  As to the pending cases, labor and the trial lawyers wanted an \nexclusion on mesothelioma in cases which had been filed. This bill \nprovides that the requests of manufacturers and insurers had a very \nsolid basis, that if they were going to put up a very substantial trust \nfund, that all of the cases ought to go into the trust fund, and that \nis the structure of the bill unless the case is to a jury or unless \nthere has been a settlement with a particular individual.\n  We have worked through the problems of the Federal Employees \nLiability Act, where we are very near a solution. I talked to Judge \nBecker earlier today, and he has talked to the parties there, and they \nare very close to resolving that issue. But in any event, there has \nbeen an agreement that if there is not a way to reconcile all of those \nissues, then there will be an arbitration clause in the bill which will \nsolve that issue.\n  There had been a consideration as to the issue on medical screening, \nwith the manufacturers and the insurers objecting to medical screening. \nAfter considerable consideration, it was decided that medical screening \nought to be provided in the bill, although it ought to be provided in a \nvery tightened-up process so it would not bring into the litigation \nsystem people who did not have bona fide claims, that it would not \nincrease the litigation inappropriately. Where you have substantial \nmotivation for the trial lawyers to go out and find clients and bring \nclaims, that is one thing. But if that is absent because of the \nreduction in attorneys' fees, then it seemed to me that these are \npeople who do not ordinarily get physical examinations on an annual \nbasis, as Senators might, and that it was fair to have medical \nscreening, but it has been done on a tightened basis, and it was \nconsidered that was a fair approach here.\n  When it came to what is called level seven, where we have smokers \ninvolved with reduced compensation, it was generally agreed we were not \nlooking to have a smokers bill, so that if the claims exceeded 115 \npercent of the estimate by the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, \nthose cases would go back to the judicial system where the defendants \nare said to win most of those cases.\n  We have come to agreement on many contentious issues. The \nadministrative provisions have been agreed to with the Department of \nLabor. We have agreed to a provision that if you have a 40-year-old \nmesothelioma victim with dependent children, the administrator shall \nhave authority to give him more and to give somebody, illustratively, \nin their eighties with no dependents less, as long as the fund remains \nneutral.\n  We have come to agreement on judicial review. We have come to \nagreement on what courts will handle the cases if there was a \nreversion. There had been a request by the manufacturers and insurers \nto have all the cases go to Federal courts. Labor and the trial lawyers \nwanted the cases to go wherever the plaintiff chose to bring them. We \nhave come to agreement that they would go to the Federal courts with \nthe exception of the State courts where the individual lived as to \nvenue or where the matter occurred.\n  We have on a consensus basis agreed to tighten up the penalties on \nviolation of environment, safety requirements, and health requirements. \nLabor wanted a provision as to transparency, and after a lot of \nanalysis, we have worked that through.\n  In the course of these extensive negotiations, there have been, I \nwould estimate, some 150 to 250 legislative changes on modification. So \nwe have come to a point where we now have this bill to be submitted for \ndiscussion purposes again. I had wanted to introduce this bill on a \nnumber of occasions. As I said, for the record, 2 or 3 weeks ago, \nSenator Leahy wanted additional time to study it. I have worked closely \nwith Senator Feinstein and met with her and with her staff. As \nenumerated in the course of my written statements, some 27 Senators \nhave participated in this process. It is very, very complicated. I do \nnot think the Congress has ever tackled a more complicated legislative \nissue. In fact, I think the Congress has never tackled a legislative \nissue as complicated as this, certainly not during the 24 years-plus \ntenure of which I have had.\n  As it has been commented about publicly, this issue brings together \nfour of the most powerful if not the most powerful groups in \nWashington: the manufacturers; labor, with the AFL-CIO; the trial \nlawyers; and the insurance companies. Each has pressed very hard for \nadvantage, which you would expect them to make their press.\n  As I say, this bill, numbering some 291 pages, contains many \nagreements. On those issues where we could not structure and forge \nagreements, the judgments have been made. I take the responsibility for \nthe judgments which have been made here.\n  I submit that it is an equitable bill. I am not in concrete on any of \nthese provisions. I am willing to discuss them. I am willing to talk \nabout them further. But the basic approach of a trust fund is central \nto a resolution of this very difficult issue if we are to resolve it. \nIf you press on one part of a balloon, the air goes to another part of \nthe balloon, and while insurers and manufacturers may not like \nscreening, labor does not like the limitation on the fund, and every \ntime you turn, there is an issue where someone wants something more.\n  I believe that this bill, the structure of this bill, although not \nnecessarily the particulars, is the last best chance.\n  I have taken over the responsibility as chair of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and we have an agenda which is gigantic. In order to work in \nour first hearing on January 11, we had to work it around the hearings \non White House Counsel Gonzales. And last week we spent all of the week \non that issue. Last week the committee took up the issue of class \naction which is now on the floor. This Thursday we have hearings on \nbankruptcy because the majority leader wants to move forward. We have \nin the offing judicial nominations, and we have the prospect of a\n\n[[Page S1011]]\n\nSupreme Court nominee. So the Judiciary Committee calendar is \nabsolutely jammed.\n  If this cannot provide the framework for a resolution of this issue, \nconsidering the 20 months of very laborious effort put in by Judge \nBecker and by some 27 Senators and 39 separate conferences, I do not \nknow what would be fruitful for the Judiciary Committee for the Senate \nto do next.\n  I have sought recognition to introduce a discussion draft of the \nFairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005, FAIR Act, the \nsuccessor to S. 1125 and S. 2290, the FAIR Acts of 2003 and 2004. My \ncolleagues Senator Frist, Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy deserve \nenormous credit for the drafting of these acts and for the development \nof this legislation. There is a will in the Senate to enact legislation \nthat should put an end to the ongoing rash of bankruptcies, growing \nmonthly; diverting resources from those who are truly sick; endangering \njobs and pensions; and creating the worst litigation crisis in the \nhistory of the American judicial system. The FAIR Act is still alive. \nThe Senate plainly wants a more rational asbestos claims system, and I \nbelieve that this legislation offers a realistic prospect of \naccomplishing that result.\n  This legislation provides substantial assurances of acceptable \ncompensation to asbestos victims and substantial assurances to \nmanufacturers and insurers to resolve, with finality, asbestos claims. \nFor more than two decades, a solution to the asbestos crisis has eluded \nCongress and the courts. Seventy-four companies have gone bankrupt, \nthousands of individuals who have been exposed to asbestos have deadly \ndiseases--mesothelioma and other such ailments--and are not being \ncompensated. According to the RAND Institute for Civil Justice, ``about \ntwo-thirds of the claims are now filed by the unimpaired, while in the \npast they were filed only by the manifestly ill.'' According to RAND, \nthe number of claims continues to rise, with over 600,000 claims filed \nalready and 300,000 pending. The number of asbestos defendants also has \nrisen sharply, from about 300 in the 1980s, to more than 8,400 today \nand most are users of the product, not its manufacturers. These \ncompanies span 85 percent of the U.S. economy and nearly every U.S. \nindustry, and include automakers, shipbuilders, textile mills, \nretailers, insurers, shipbuilders, electric utilities and virtually any \ncompany involved in manufacturing or construction in the last thirty \nyears.\n  Asbestos leaves many victims in its wake. First and foremost, the \nsick and their families have suffered. But the flawed asbestos \nlitigation system not only hurts the sick and their chance at receiving \nfair compensation, but also claims other victims. These include \nemployees, retirees and shareholders of affected companies whose jobs, \nsavings and retirement plans are also jeopardized by the tide of \nasbestos cases. With asbestos litigation affecting so many companies, \nthis also impacts the overall economy, including jobs, pensions, stock \nprices, tax revenues and insurance costs. According to a 2002 study by \nNobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, asbestos bankruptcies have cost nearly \n60,000 workers their jobs and $200 million in lost wages. Employees' \nretirement funds have shrunken by 25 percent.\n  In July 2003, the Judiciary Committee knowingly voted out S. 1125, a \nbill with many problems, largely along party lines, in an effort to \nmove the legislation. S. 1125 created the basic structure of the \nlegislation, and made a huge stride in working out the medical \ncriteria. However, the bill floundered on other issues. In August, at \nmy request, Judge Edward R. Becker, a Federal judge for 33 years, \nconvened in his chambers in Philadelphia for 2 days the so-called \nstakeholders--manufacturers, labor, AFL-CIO, insurers and trial \nlawyers--to determine if some common ground could be found. Until the \npreceding May, Judge Becker had been the chief judge of the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals and wrote the opinion in the asbestos class \naction suit which was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  From September 2003 through January 2005, there have been 37 \nstakeholder meetings in my conference room, with Judge Becker as a pro-\nbono mediator, usually attended by 25 to 40 representatives and \nsometimes over 75 present. Judge Becker and I have sought an equitable \nbill which took into account, to the maximum extent possible, the \nconcerns of the stakeholders and to get their input on drafting of the \nbill. After analysis and deliberation, we found we could accommodate \nmany of the competing interests.\n  This process commenced with the blessing of Chairman Hatch and \nRanking Member Leahy of the Judiciary Committee. This extended process \nallowed the stakeholders an extraordinary ``hearing'' process and \nreally amounted to the longest ``mark-up'' in Senate history although \nnot in the customary framework. We have had the cooperation of many \nSenators. Senators Hatch and Leahy have had representatives at all the \nmeetings. The majority leader, Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy have \naddressed this ``working group'' at our meetings. Senator Hatch and \nSenator Leahy's representatives have been active participants at every \nmeeting, as well as the members of the staffs of Senators Feinstein, \nCarper, Cornyn, DeWine, Ben Nelson, Baucus, Biden, Chambliss, Craig, \nDodd, Durbin, Feingold, Graham, Grassley, Kennedy, Kohl, Kyl, Landrieu, \nLevin, Lincoln, Murray, Pryor, Schumer, Sessions, Snowe, Stabenow, and \nVoinovich.\n  The concept of a trust fund is an outstanding idea. Senator Hatch \ndeserves great credit for moving the legislation in the direction of a \ntrust fund with a schedule of payments analogous to worker's \ncompensation so the cases would not have to go through the litigation \nprocess. Under this proposal, the Federal Government would establish a \nnational trust fund privately financed by asbestos defendant companies \nand insurers. No taxpayer money would be involved. Asbestos victims \nwould simply submit their claims to the fund. Claimants would be fairly \ncompensated if they meet medical criteria for certain illnesses and \nshow past asbestos exposure. The Trust Fund would guarantee \ncompensation for impaired victims.\n\n  Through the series of meetings with Judge Becker, we have wrestled \nwith and have been able to solve a number of very complex issues. The \nsize of the trust fund was always a principal issue of dispute, \nstarting at $108 billion. The manufacturers/insurers raised their offer \nto $140 billion. Last October, Majority Leader Frist and then-\nDemocratic Leader Daschle agreed to $140 billion. When Senator Frist \nand Senator Daschle, in an adversarial context, agreed to the adequacy \nof the $140 billion figure, it is difficult to exceed it even though \nthe AFL-CIO did not contemporaneously agree.\n  It is not possible to say definitely what figure would be adequate \nbecause it depends on the uncertainty of how many claims will be filed. \nThere is support for the adequacy of the $140 billion figure from \nreputable projections. But they are, admittedly, only projections.\n  The real safety valve, if the fund is unable to pay claims, is for \nthe injured to have the ability to go back to court if the system is \nnot operational and able to pay exigent health claims within 9 months \nafter enactment, and all other valid claims within 18 months of \nenactment.\n  The claimants object to any hiatus between access to the courts and \nan operating system; but the reality is that court delays are \ncustomarily longer than the delay structured in this system. The \ndefendants and insurers object saying it is too short a time frame, but \nthey have the power to expedite the process by promptly paying their \nassessments. I am confident that there will be no problem in \nadministering the system and processing the claims. Conversations have \nbeen held with the leaders of the Manville Trust and the RAND Institute \nstudy and they persuade me that the volume of claims can be efficiently \nadministered by the fund administrator using a technique developed by \nthe Manville Trust and other similar claims facilities that have \nprocessed asbestos claims for many years. The Manville Trust has \nprocessed as many as 150,000 claims per year. The number of exigent \nclaims anticipated in the first 9 months of the fund is vastly smaller \nand even the total number of claims anticipated in the first 18 months \nis significantly less that which the Manville Trust has handled in a \ncomparable period. Additionally, the bill provides the administrator \nwith the option to contract out\n\n[[Page S1012]]\n\nthe exigent claims to a claims facility for expedited processing under \nthe standards of the fund on a voluntary basis. The short time frame \nwill prod the system to become operative at an early date. The bill \nsends the claims back to the fund as soon as it is certified \noperational with a credit for any payment of the scheduled amount.\n  Similarly, the defendants seek a commitment that the legislation will \nbar return to the courts for at least 7\\1/2\\ years. It is hard to see \nhow the substantial fund would be expended in a lesser period. Here \nagain, the legislation gives the defendant substantial assurances that \nthe system will last at least 7\\1/2\\ years. If it collapses, the \nclaimants should not bear the burden, but should reclaim their \nconstitutional right to a jury trial.\n  The claimants sought $60 billion in startup contributions within 5 \nyears and the defendants countered with a maximum of $40 billion. The \nfund's borrowing power should enable it to borrow at least the balance \nof $20 billion because of the defendants continuing substantial \nfinancial commitments. Here again, the bill meets the standard of \nsubstantial assurances, albeit not perfect certainty, that $60 billion \nwill be in hand within the first 5 years.\n  A key issue for the claimant has been that of workers' compensation \nsubrogation. This issue is important because the value of an award to \nthe claimant depends on whether the claimant may have to pay a \nsubstantial amount of it to others. While the precise picture is \ndifferent from State to State, in general, workers' compensation laws \ngive employers, and their insurance carriers, subrogation rights \nagainst third-party tortfeasors and a lien on the injured employee's \nrecovery from a third-part tortfeasor. This is a big deal because \nworkers' compensation covers the employee's medical costs.\n  I closely examined and considered including a proposal that would \nhave called for a so-called workers' compensation ``holiday.'' Such a \nproposal would have provided for a ``holiday'' from worker's \ncompensation payments during the period of receipt of payments from \ntrust fund except to the extent that the compensation would exceed \nthem, with a waiver of past and future subrogation. However, as each \nState has different workers' compensation laws and I concluded that \nsuch a proposal may go beyond the practice in a number of States \nleaving some claimants with a significantly reduced award.\n  Furthermore, while not undisputed like some other matters on this \nlegislation, there is some significant basis in the assertion by \nclaimants that the award values in the bill were designed with the \nconcept in mind that there would be no liens or rights of subrogation \nagainst the claimants based on workers' compensation awards and health \ninsurance payments.\n  Therefore, in the final analysis, I have determined that to be fair \nto victims, claimants should be allowed to retain and receive the full \nvalue of both their fund awards and workers' compensation payments. It \nis important that the bill must extinguish any liens or rights \nof subrogation that other parties might otherwise assert against the \nclaimants based on workers' compensation awards and health insurance \npayments.\n\n  Another key issue for the claimants has been the legislation's \ntreatment of asbestos disease claims under the Federal Employers' \nLiability Act, FELA, the workers' compensation system for rail workers. \nEarlier versions of the bill would have preempted FELA claims for \nasbestos-related diseases, limiting victim's recovery to compensation \nunder a national asbestos trust fund. Rail labor asserts that such an \napproach is unfair to rail workers, since for all other workers, the \nbill maintains workers' compensation rights. Alternative approaches to \ndealing with the FELA issue have been proposed, including providing for \na supplemental payment, in addition to awards under the bill, to \nprovide compensation to rail workers for work-related asbestos \ndiseases. The AFL-CIO's affiliates who represent workers in the rail \nindustry have been engaged in discussions with industry on this issue, \nand will continue to work to see if a fair resolution can be reached. I \nhave included in the bill language that would call for binding \narbitration between the parties if they do not arrive at a solution 30 \ndays post enactment.\n  In these marathon discussions, plus the January hearing, I understand \nthe deep concerns expressed by the stakeholder representatives on more \nconcessions for their clients. On the state of the 20 year record, this \nchoice is not between this bill and one which would give their clients \nmore concessions. The choice is between this bill and the continuation \nof the present chaotic system which leaves uncompensated thousands of \nvictims suffering from deadly diseases and litigation driving more \ncompanies into bankruptcy.\n  We considered at length the manufacturers/insurers objections to \nmedical screening, but concluded such a provision was necessary as an \noffset to the reduced role of claimant's attorney. With the previous \npotential of a substantial contingent fee, claimants' attorneys \nidentified those damaged by exposure to asbestos. Absent that \nmotivation, it is reasonable to have routine examinations for people \nwho would not be expected to go for such checkups on their own; so as a \nmatter of basic fairness, such screening is provided. By establishing a \nprogram with rigorous standards, as we have done in this bill, \nunmeritorious claims can be avoided with the fair determination of \nthose entitled to compensation under the statutory standard.\n  The legislation has closely examined the issues of so-called \n``leakage'' in the fund and has provided all asbestos claims pending on \nthe date of enactment, except for non-consolidated cases actually on \ntrial, and except cases subject to a verdict or final order or final \njudgment, will be brought into the asbestos trust fund. Furthermore, \nonly written settlement agreements, executed prior to date of \nenactment, between a defendant and a specifically identifiable \nplaintiff will be preserved outside of the fund; the settlement \nagreement must contain an express obligation by the settling defendant \nto make a future monetary payment to the individual plaintiff, but \ngives the plaintiff 60 days to fulfill all conditions of the settlement \nagreement.\n  I have also included in the legislation language which is designed to \nensure prompt judicial review of a variety of regulatory actions and to \nensure that any constitutional uncertainties with regard to the \nlegislation are resolved as quickly as possible. Specifically, it \nprovides that any action challenging the constitutionality of any \nprovision of the act must be brought in the United States District \nCourt for the District of Columbia. The bill also authorizes direct \nappeal to the Supreme Court on an expedited basis. An action under this \nsection is to be filed within 60 days after the date of enactment or 60 \ndays after the final action of the administrator or the commission \ngiving rise to the action, whichever is later. The district court and \nSupreme Court are required to expedite to the greatest possible extent \nthe disposition of the action and appeal.\n  Claimants also expressed the need for assurances that the \nmanufacturers payment into the fund. Therefore, the legislation I am \nintroducing also requires enhanced ``transparency'' of the payments by \nthe defendants and insurers into the fund. The proposal provides that \n20 days after the end of such 60-day period, the administrator shall \npublish in the Federal Register a list of such submissions, including \nthe name of such persons or ultimate parents and the likely tier to \nwhich such persons or affiliated groups may be assigned. After \npublication of such list, any person may submit to the administrator \ninformation on the identity of any other person that may have \nobligations under the fund. In addition, there are enhanced notice and \ndisclosure requirements included in the draft. It also provides that \nwithin 60 days after the date of enactment, any person who, acting in \ngood faith, has knowledge that such person or such person's affiliated \ngroup would result in placement in the top tiers, shall submit to the \nadministrator, 1, either the name of such person or such person's \nultimate parent; and, 2, the likely tier to which such person or \naffiliated group may be assigned under this act.\n  As I have mentioned previously, this legislation deals with a number \nof very complex issues, one of them being that of ``mixed-dust.'' I \nheld a hearing in the Judiciary Committee in this issue on Feb. 2, \n2005. The manufacturers fear that many asbestos claims will be \n``repackaged'' as silica claims in the tort\n\n[[Page S1013]]\n\nsystem. Evidence deduced at the hearing reflects that this has been \nhappening in a large number of jurisdictions. If a claim is due to \nasbestos exposure at all, the program should be the exclusive means of \ncompensation. The stakeholders agree that this is an asbestos bill, \ndesigned to dispose of all asbestos claims but that workers with \ngenuine silica exposure disease ought to be able to pursue their claims \nin the tort system. The problem is that with those claims where the \npoint of demarcation is unclear. Silica/asbestos defendants are worried \nthat they will find themselves in court with the burden of proving that \nthe plaintiff's injury is due to asbestos rather than silica. This \nlegislation makes clear that pure silica claims are not preempted, but \nclaims involving asbestos disease are preempted. A claimant must \nestablish by a preponderance of evidence that their functional \nimpairment was caused by exposure to silica, and asbestos exposure was \nnot a significant contributing factor. Although this does impose the \nburden on the claimant, this is no different than the burden the \nplaintiff or any party advancing a position has in producing medical \nevidence in any case that the physician will state that a disease was \ncaused by some condition or exposure or that it was not caused by some \ncondition or exposure.\n\n  Another very complicated issue I have addressed in my legislation, at \nthe request of the claimants, is that of providing for award \nadjustments for exceptional mesothelioma cases based on age and the \nnumber of dependents of the claimant. For example, a mesothelioma \nvictim who is 40 years old with two kids will be able to get an upwards \nadjustment in his award amount as compared to a 80-year-old \nmesothelioma victim with no dependents. The impact of such adjustments \nto the fund will remain revenue-neutral.\n  What I have introduced is a complicated bill, but one that is both \nintegrated and comprehensive and reflective of a remarkable will to \nenact legislation. If this bill is rejected, I do not see the agenda of \nthis Senate Judiciary Committee revisiting the issue because of other \nbusiness and the futility in doing so. I cannot conceive of more \nstrenuous effort being directed to this subject that has been done in \nthe past 2 years. This is the last best chance.\n  I remain confident that we can forge and enact a bill that is fair to \nthe claimants and to business and that will put an end once and for all \nto this nightmare chapter in American legal, economic and social \nhistory. If we can summon the legislative will in a bipartisan spirit, \nit can be done.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a 291-page discussion \ndraft.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S.   \n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Millions of Americans have been exposed to forms of \n     asbestos that can have devastating health effects.\n       (2) Various injuries can be caused by exposure to some \n     forms of asbestos, including pleural disease and some forms \n     of cancer.\n       (3) The injuries caused by asbestos can have latency \n     periods of up to 40 years, and even limited exposure to some \n     forms of asbestos may result in injury in some cases.\n       (4) Asbestos litigation has had a significant detrimental \n     effect on the country's economy, driving companies into \n     bankruptcy, diverting resources from those who are truly \n     sick, and endangering jobs and pensions.\n       (5) The scope of the asbestos litigation crisis cuts across \n     every State and virtually every industry.\n       (6) The United States Supreme Court has recognized that \n     Congress must act to create a more rational asbestos claims \n     system. In 1991, a Judicial Conference Ad Hoc Committee on \n     Asbestos Litigation, appointed by Chief Justice William \n     Rehnquist, found that the ``ultimate solution should be \n     legislation recognizing the national proportions of the \n     problem . . . and creating a national asbestos dispute \n     resolution scheme . . .''. The Court found in 1997 in Amchem \n     Products Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 595 (1997), that \n     ``[t]he argument is sensibly made that a nationwide \n     administrative claims processing regime would provide the \n     most secure, fair, and efficient means of compensating \n     victims of asbestos exposure.'' In 1999, the Court in Ortiz \n     v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 819, 821 (1999), found that the \n     ``elephantine mass of asbestos cases . . . defies customary \n     judicial administration and calls for national legislation.'' \n     That finding was again recognized in 2003 by the Court in \n     Norfolk & Western Railway Co. v. Ayers, 123 S. Ct. 1210 \n     (2003).\n       (7) This crisis, and its significant effect on the health \n     and welfare of the people of the United States, on interstate \n     and foreign commerce, and on the bankruptcy system, compels \n     Congress to exercise its power to regulate interstate \n     commerce and create this legislative solution in the form of \n     a national asbestos injury claims resolution program to \n     supersede all existing methods to compensate those injured by \n     asbestos, except as specified in this Act.\n       (8) This crisis has also imposed a deleterious burden upon \n     the United States bankruptcy courts, which have assumed a \n     heavy burden of administering complicated and protracted \n     bankruptcies with limited personnel.\n       (9) This crisis has devastated many communities across the \n     country, but hardest hit has been Libby, Montana, where \n     tremolite asbestos, 1 of the most deadly forms of asbestos, \n     was contained in the vermiculite ore mined from the area and \n     despite ongoing cleanup by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, many still suffer from the deadly dust.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to--\n\n[[Page S1014]]\n\n       (1) create a privately funded, publicly administered fund \n     to provide the necessary resources for a fair and efficient \n     system to resolve asbestos injury claims that will provide \n     compensation for legitimate present and future claimants of \n     asbestos exposure as provided in this Act;\n       (2) provide compensation to those present and future \n     victims based on the severity of their injuries, while \n     establishing a system flexible enough to accommodate \n     individuals whose conditions worsens;\n       (3) relieve the Federal and State courts of the burden of \n     the asbestos litigation; and\n       (4) increase economic stability by resolving the asbestos \n     litigation crisis that has bankrupted companies with asbestos \n     liability, diverted resources from the truly sick, and \n     endangered jobs and pensions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

If the Administrator subsequently certifies to \n     Congress that the Fund has become operational and the \n     procedures are in place to review and pay asbestos claims at \n     a reasonable rate, any claim in a civil action in Federal or \n     State court that is not actually on trial before a jury which \n     has been impaneled and presentation of evidence has \n     commenced, but before its deliberation, or before a judge and \n     is at the presentation of evidence, shall be deemed a \n     reinstated claim against the Fund and the civil action before \n     the Federal or State court shall be null and void.\n       (3) Pursual of asbestos claims in federal or state court.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, if, not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator cannot certify to \n     Congress that the Fund is operational and paying all valid \n     claims at a reasonable rate, any person with an asbestos \n     claim stayed under paragraph (1), or with an asbestos claim \n     arising after the date of enactment of this Act, may pursue \n     that claim in the Federal district court or State court \n     located within--\n       (i) the State of residence of the claimant; or\n       (ii) the State in which the asbestos exposure arose.\n       (B) Defendants not found.--If any defendant cannot be found \n     in the State described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph \n     (A), the claim may be pursued in the Federal district court \n     or State court located within any State in which the \n     defendant may be found.\n       (C) Determination of most appropriate forum.--If a person \n     alleges that the asbestos exposure occurred in more than 1 \n     county (or Federal district), the trial court shall determine \n     which State and county (or Federal district) is the most \n     appropriate forum for the claim. If the court determines that \n     another forum would be the most appropriate forum for a \n     claim, the court shall dismiss the claim. Any otherwise \n     applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled beginning \n     on the date the claim was filed and ending on the date the \n     claim is dismissed under this subparagraph.\n       (D) State venue requirements.--Nothing in this paragraph \n     shall preempt or supersede any State's law relating to venue \n     requirements within that State which are more restrictive.\n       (E) Credit of claim and effect of operational fund.--If an \n     asbestos claim is pursued in Federal or State court in \n     accordance with this paragraph, any recovery by the claimant \n     shall be a collateral source compensation for purposes of \n     section 134. If the Administrator subsequently certifies to \n     Congress that the Fund has become operational and the \n     procedures are in place to review and pay asbestos claims at \n     a reasonable rate, any claim in a civil action in Federal or \n     State court that is not actually on trial before a jury which \n     has been impaneled and presentation of evidence has \n     commenced, but before its deliberation, or before a judge and \n     is at the presentation of evidence, shall be deemed a \n     reinstated claim against the Fund and the civil action before \n     the Federal or State court shall be null and void.\n       (4) Sunset.--This subsection shall have no effect after the \n     date the Administrator certifies to Congress that the Fund is \n     operational and paying claims at a reasonable rate, except \n     that any case that has been filed or revived pursuant to this \n     subsection in a Federal or State court may, at the option of \n     the claimant, remain in that court.\n\n     SEC. 107.

GENERAL RULE CONCERNING NO-FAULT COMPENSATION.\n\n       An asbestos claimant shall not be required to demonstrate \n     that the asbestos-related injury for which the claim is being \n     made resulted from the negligence or other fault of any other \n     person.\n\n     SEC. 113. FILING OF CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) Who May Submit.--\n       (1) In general.--Any individual who has suffered from a \n     disease or condition that is believed to meet the \n     requirements established under subtitle C (or the personal \n     representative of the individual, if the individual is \n     deceased or incompetent) may file a claim with the Office for \n     an award with respect to such injury.\n       (2) Definition.--In this Act, the term ``personal \n     representative'' shall have the same meaning as that term is \n     defined in section 104.4 of title 28 of the Code of Federal \n     Regulations, as in effect on December 31, 2004.\n       (3) Limitation.--A claim may not be filed by any person \n     seeking contribution or indemnity.\n       (b) Statute of Limitations.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as otherwise provided in this \n     subsection, if an individual fails to file a claim with the \n     Office under this section within 4 years after the date on \n     which the individual first--\n       (A) received a medical diagnosis of an eligible disease or \n     condition as provided for under this subtitle and subtitle C; \n     or\n       (B) discovered facts that would have led a reasonable \n     person to obtain a medical diagnosis with respect to an \n     eligible disease or condition,\n     any claim relating to that injury, and any other asbestos \n     claim related to that injury, shall be extinguished, and any \n     recovery thereon shall be prohibited.\n       (2) Exception.--The statute of limitations in paragraph (1) \n     does not apply to the progression of non-malignant diseases \n     once the initial claim has been filed.\n       (3) Effect on pending claims.--\n       (A) In general.--If, on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     an asbestos claimant has any timely filed asbestos claim that \n     is pending--\n       (i) in a Federal or State court and for which a verdict or \n     final order or final judgment has not been entered by a court \n     before such date; or\n       (ii) with a trust established under title 11, United States \n     Code,\n     such claimant shall file a claim under this section within 4 \n     years after such date of enactment, or any claim relating to \n     that injury, and any other asbestos claim related to that \n     injury shall be extinguished, and recovery there shall be \n     prohibited.\n       (B) Special rule.--For purposes of this paragraph, a claim \n     shall not be treated as pending with a trust established \n     under title 11, United States Code, solely because a claimant \n     whose claim was previously compensated by the trust has or \n     alleges--\n       (i) a non-contingent right to the payment of future \n     installments of a fixed award; or\n       (ii) a contingent right to recover some additional amount \n     from the trust on the occurrence of a future event, such as \n     the reevaluation of the trust's funding adequacy or projected \n     claims experience.\n       (4) Effect of multiple injuries.--\n       (A) In general.--An asbestos claimant who receives an award \n     under this title for an eligible disease or condition, and \n     who subsequently develops another such injury, shall be \n     eligible for additional awards under this title (subject to \n     appropriate setoffs for such prior recovery of any award \n     under this title and from any other collateral source) and \n     the statute of limitations under paragraph (1) shall not \n     begin to run with respect to such subsequent injury until \n     such claimant obtains a medical diagnosis of such other \n     injury or discovers facts that would have led a reasonable \n     person to obtain such a diagnosis.\n       (B) Setoffs.--Except as provided in subparagraph (C), any \n     amounts paid or to be paid for a prior award under this Act \n     shall be deducted as a setoff against amounts payable for the \n     second injury claim.\n       (C) Exception.--Any amounts paid or to be paid for a prior \n     claim for a non-malignant disease (Levels I through V) filed \n     against the Fund shall not be deducted as a setoff against \n     amounts payable for the second injury claim for a malignant \n     disease (Levels VI through X), unless the malignancy was \n     diagnosed, or the asbestos claimant had discovered facts that \n     would have led a reasonable person to obtain such a \n     diagnosis, before the date on which the non-malignancy claim \n     was compensated.\n       (c) Required Information.--A claim filed under subsection \n     (a) shall be in such form, and contain such information in \n     such detail, as the Administrator shall by regulation \n     prescribe.

If such \n     information is not received within 1 year after the date of \n     such notification, the claim shall be dismissed.\n\n     SEC. 114. ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS AND CLAIM AWARDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Review of claims.--The Administrator shall, in \n     accordance with this section, determine whether each claim \n     filed under this Act satisfies the requirements for \n     eligibility for an award under this Act and, if so, the value \n     of the award. In making such determinations, the \n     Administrator shall consider the claim presented by the \n     claimant, the factual and medical evidence submitted by the \n     claimant in support of the claim, the medical determinations \n     of any Physicians Panel to which a claim is referred under \n     section 121, and the results of such investigation as the \n     Administrator may deem necessary to determine whether the \n     claim satisfies the criteria for eligibility established by \n     this Act.\n       (2) Additional evidence.--The Administrator may request the \n     submission of medical evidence in addition to the minimum \n     requirements of section 113(c) if necessary or appropriate to \n     make a determination of eligibility for an award, in which \n     case the cost of obtaining such additional information or \n     testing shall be borne by the Office.\n       (b) Proposed Decisions.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     filing of a claim, the Administrator shall provide to the \n     claimant (and the claimant's representative) a proposed \n     decision accepting or rejecting the claim in whole or in part \n     and specifying the amount of the proposed award, if any. The \n     proposed decision shall be in writing, shall contain findings \n     of fact and conclusions of law, and shall contain an \n     explanation of the procedure for obtaining review of the \n     proposed decision.\n       (c) Review of Proposed Decisions.--\n       (1) Right to hearing.--\n       (A) In general.--Any claimant not satisfied with a proposed \n     decision of the Administrator under subsection (b) shall be \n     entitled, on written request made within 90 days after the \n     date of the issuance of the decision, to a hearing on the \n     claim of that claimant before a representative of the \n     Administrator. At the hearing, the claimant shall be entitled \n     to present oral evidence and written testimony in further \n     support of that claim.\n       (B) Conduct of hearing.--When practicable, the hearing will \n     be set at a time and place convenient for the claimant. In \n     conducting the hearing, the representative of the \n     Administrator shall not be bound by common law or statutory \n     rules of evidence, by technical or formal rules of procedure, \n     or by section 554 of title 5, United States Code, except as \n     provided by this Act, but shall conduct the hearing in such \n     manner as to best ascertain the rights of the claimant. For \n     this purpose, the representative shall receive such relevant \n     evidence as the claimant adduces and such other evidence as \n     the representative determines necessary or useful in \n     evaluating the claim.\n       (C) Request for subpoenas.--\n       (i) In general.--A claimant may request a subpoena but the \n     decision to grant or deny such a request is within the \n     discretion of the representative of the Administrator. The \n     representative may issue subpoenas for the attendance and \n     testimony of witnesses, and for the production of books, \n     records, correspondence, papers, or other relevant documents. \n     Subpoenas are issued for documents only if such documents are \n     relevant and cannot be obtained by other means, and for \n     witnesses only where oral testimony is the best way to \n     ascertain the facts.\n       (ii) Request.--A claimant may request a subpoena only as \n     part of the hearing process. To request a subpoena, the \n     requester shall--\n\n       (I) submit the request in writing and send it to the \n     representative as early as possible, but no later than 30 \n     days after the date of the original hearing request; and\n       (II) explain why the testimony or evidence is directly \n     relevant to the issues at hand, and a subpoena is the best \n     method or opportunity to obtain such evidence because there \n     are no other means by which the documents or testimony could \n     have been obtained.\n\n       (iii) Fees and mileage.--Any person required by such \n     subpoena to attend as a witness shall be allowed and paid the \n     same fees and mileage as are paid witnesses in the district \n     courts of the United States. Such fees and mileage shall be \n     paid from the Fund.\n       (2) Review of written record.--In lieu of a hearing under \n     paragraph (1), any claimant not satisfied with a proposed \n     decision of the Administrator shall have the option, on \n     written request made within 90 days after the date of the \n     issuance of the decision, of obtaining a review of the \n     written record by a representative of the Administrator. If \n     such review is requested, the claimant shall be afforded an \n     opportunity to submit any written evidence or argument which \n     he or she believes relevant.\n       (d) Final Decisions.--\n       (1) In general.--If the period of time for requesting \n     review of the proposed decision expires and no request has \n     been filed, or if the claimant waives any objections to the \n     proposed decision, the Administrator shall issue a final \n     decision. If such decision materially differs from the \n     proposed decision, the claimant shall be entitled to review \n     of the decision under subsection (c).\n       (2) Time and content.--If the claimant requests review of \n     all or part of the proposed decision the Administrator shall \n     issue a final decision on the claim not later than 180 days \n     after the request for review is received, if the claimant \n     requests a hearing, or not later than 90 days after the \n     request for review is received, if the claimant requests \n     review of the written record. Such decision shall be in \n     writing and contain findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n       (e) Representation.--A claimant may authorize an attorney \n     or other individual to represent him or her in any proceeding \n     under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 115.

Such physician or facility shall have a \n     right to appeal such determination under procedures issued by \n     the Administrator.\n       (b) Review of Certified B-Readers.--\n       (1) In general.--At a minimum, the Administrator shall \n     prescribe procedures to randomly assign claims for evaluation \n     by an independent certified B-reader of x-rays submitted in \n     support of a claim, the cost of which shall be borne by the \n     Office.\n       (2) Disagreement.--If an independent certified B-reader \n     assigned under paragraph (1) disagrees with the quality \n     grading or ILO level assigned to an x-ray submitted in \n     support of a claim, the Administrator shall require a review \n     of such x-rays by a second independent certified B-reader.\n       (3) Effect on claim.--If neither certified B-reader under \n     paragraph (2) agrees with the quality grading and the ILO \n     grade level assigned to an x-ray as part of the claim, the \n     Administrator shall take into account the findings of the 2 \n     independent B readers in making the determination on such \n     claim.\n       (4) Certified b-readers.--The Administrator shall maintain \n     a list of a minimum of 50 certified B-readers eligible to \n     participate in the independent reviews, chosen from all \n     certified B-readers. When an x-ray is sent for independent \n     review, the Administrator shall choose the certified B-reader \n     at random from that list.\n       (c) Smoking Assessment.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Records and documents.--To aid in the assessment of the \n     accuracy of claimant representations as to their smoking \n     status for purposes of determining eligibility and amount of \n     award under Malignant Level VI, Malignant Level VII, \n     Malignant Level VIII,\n\n[[Page S1019]]\n\n     Malignant Level IX, and exceptional medical claims, the \n     Administrator shall have the authority to obtain relevant \n     records and documents, including--\n       (i) records of past medical treatment and evaluation;\n       (ii) affidavits of appropriate individuals;\n       (iii) applications for insurance and supporting materials; \n     and\n       (iv) employer records of medical examinations.\n       (B) Consent.--The claimant shall provide consent for the \n     Administrator to obtain such records and documents where \n     required.\n       (2) Review.--The frequency of review of records and \n     documents submitted under paragraph (1)(A) shall be at the \n     discretion of the Administrator, but shall address at least 5 \n     percent of the claimants asserting status as nonsmokers or \n     ex-smokers.\n       (3) Consent.--The Administrator may require the performance \n     of blood tests or any other appropriate medical test where \n     claimants assert they are nonsmokers or ex-smokers for \n     purposes of an award under Malignant Level VI, Malignant \n     Level VII, Malignant Level VIII, Malignant Level IX, or as an \n     exceptional medical claim, the cost of which shall be borne \n     by the Office.\n       (4) Penalty for false statements.--Any false information \n     submitted under this subsection shall be subject to criminal \n     prosecution or civil penalties as provided under section 1348 \n     of title 18, United States Code (as added by this Act) and \n     section 101(c)(2).\n\n                      Subtitle C--Medical Criteria\n\n     SEC. 121.

ASSESSMENT ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Each defendant participant or affiliated \n     group shall pay to the Fund in the amounts provided under \n     this subtitle as appropriate for its tier and subtier each \n     year until the earlier to occur of the following:\n       (1) The participant or affiliated group has satisfied its \n     obligations under this subtitle during the 30 annual payment \n     cycles of the operation of the Fund.\n       (2) The amount received by the Fund from defendant \n     participants, excluding any amounts rebated to defendant \n     participants under subsection (d), equals the maximum \n     aggregate payment obligation of section 202(a)(2).\n       (b) Small Business Exemption.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this subtitle, a person or affiliated group that \n     is a small business concern (as defined under section 3 of \n     the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632)), on December 31, \n     2002, is exempt from any payment requirement under this \n     subtitle and shall not be included in the subtier allocations \n     under section 203.\n       (c) Procedures.--The Administrator shall prescribe \n     procedures on how amounts payable under this subtitle are to \n     be paid, including, to the extent the Administrator \n     determines appropriate, procedures relating to payment in \n     installments.\n       (d) Adjustments.--\n       (1) In general.--Under expedited procedures established by \n     the Administrator, a defendant participant may seek \n     adjustment of the amount of its payment obligation based on \n     severe financial hardship or demonstrated inequity. The \n     Administrator may determine whether to grant an adjustment \n     and the size of any such adjustment, in accordance with this \n     subsection. A defendant participant has a right to obtain a \n     rehearing of the Administrator's determination under this \n     subsection under the procedures prescribed in subsection \n     (i)(10). The Administrator may adjust a defendant \n     participant's payment obligations under this subsection, \n     either by forgiving the relevant portion of the otherwise \n     applicable payment obligation or by providing relevant \n     rebates from the defendant hardship and inequity adjustment \n     account created under subsection (j) after payment of the \n     otherwise applicable payment obligation, at the discretion of \n     the Administrator.\n       (2) Financial hardship adjustments.--\n       (A) In general.--A defendant participant may apply for an \n     adjustment based on financial hardship at any time during the \n     period in which a payment obligation to the Fund remains \n     outstanding and may qualify for such adjustment by \n     demonstrating that the amount of its payment obligation under \n     the statutory allocation would constitute a severe financial \n     hardship.\n       (B) Term.--Subject to the annual availability of funds in \n     the defendant hardship and inequity adjustment account \n     established under subsection (j), a financial hardship \n     adjustment under this subsection shall have a term of 3 \n     years.\n       (C) Renewal.--After an initial hardship adjustment is \n     granted under this paragraph, a defendant participant may \n     renew its hardship adjustment by demonstrating that it \n     remains justified.\n       (D) Reinstatement.--Following the expiration of the \n     hardship adjustment period provided for under this section \n     and during the funding period prescribed under subsection \n     (a), the Administrator shall annually determine whether there \n     has been a material change in the financial condition of the \n     defendant participant such that the Administrator may, \n     consistent with the policies and legislative intent \n     underlying this Act, reinstate under terms and conditions \n     established by the Administrator any part or all of the \n     defendant participant's payment obligation under the \n     statutory allocation that was not paid during the hardship \n     adjustment term.\n       (3) Inequity adjustments.--\n       (A) In general.--A defendant participant--\n       (i) may qualify for an adjustment based on inequity by \n     demonstrating that the amount\n\n[[Page S1026]]\n\n     of its payment obligation under the statutory allocation is \n     exceptionally inequitable--\n\n       (I) when measured against the amount of the likely cost to \n     the defendant participant net of insurance of its future \n     liability in the tort system in the absence of the Fund;\n       (II) when compared to the median payment rate for all \n     defendant participants in the same tier; or\n       (III) when measured against the percentage of the prior \n     asbestos expenditures of the defendant that were incurred \n     with respect to claims that neither resulted in an adverse \n     judgment against the defendant, nor were the subject of a \n     settlement that required a payment to a plaintiff by or on \n     behalf of that defendant; and\n\n       (ii) shall qualify for a two-tier main tier and a two-tier \n     subtier adjustment reducing the defendant participant's \n     payment obligation based on inequity by demonstrating that \n     not less than 95 percent of such person's prior asbestos \n     expenditures arose from claims related to the manufacture and \n     sale of railroad locomotives and related products, so long as \n     such person's manufacture and sale of railroad locomotives \n     and related products is temporally and causally remote. For \n     purposes of this clause, a person's manufacture and sale of \n     railroad locomotives and related products shall be deemed to \n     be temporally and causally remote if the asbestos claims \n     historically and generally filed against such person relate \n     to the manufacture and sale of railroad locomotives and \n     related products by an entity dissolved more than 25 years \n     before the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (B) Payment rate.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the \n     payment rate of a defendant participant is the payment amount \n     of the defendant participant as a percentage of such \n     defendant participant's gross revenues for the year ending \n     December 31, 2002.\n       (C) Term.--Subject to the annual availability of funds in \n     the defendant hardship and inequity adjustment account \n     established under subsection (j), an inequity adjustment \n     under this subsection shall have a term of 3 years.\n       (D) Renewal.--A defendant participant may renew an inequity \n     adjustment every 3 years by demonstrating that the adjustment \n     remains justified.\n       (E) Reinstatement.--\n       (i) In general.--Following the termination of an inequity \n     adjustment under subparagraph (A), and during the funding \n     period prescribed under subsection (a), the Administrator \n     shall annually determine whether there has been a material \n     change in conditions which would support a finding that the \n     amount of the defendant participant's payment under the \n     statutory allocation was not inequitable. Based on this \n     determination, the Administrator may, consistent with the \n     policies and legislative intent underlying this Act, \n     reinstate any or all of the payment obligations of the \n     defendant participant as if the inequity adjustment had not \n     been granted for that 3-year period.\n       (ii) Terms and conditions.--In the event of a reinstatement \n     under clause (i), the Administrator may require the defendant \n     participant to pay any part or all of amounts not paid due to \n     the inequity adjustment on such terms and conditions as \n     established by the Administrator.\n       (4) Limitation on adjustments.--The aggregate total of \n     financial hardship adjustments under paragraph (2) and \n     inequity adjustments under paragraph (3) in effect in any \n     given year shall not exceed $300,000,000, except to the \n     extent additional monies are available for such adjustments \n     as a result of carryover of prior years' funds under \n     subsection (j)(3) or as a result of monies being made \n     available in that year under subsection (k)(1)(A).\n       (5) Advisory panels.--\n       (A) Appointment.--The Administrator shall appoint a \n     Financial Hardship Adjustment Panel and an Inequity \n     Adjustment Panel to advise the Administrator in carrying out \n     this subsection.\n       (B) Membership.--The membership of the panels appointed \n     under subparagraph (A) may overlap.\n       (C) Coordination.--The panels appointed under subparagraph \n     (A) shall coordinate their deliberations and advice.\n       (e) Limitation on Liability.--The liability of each \n     defendant participant to pay to the Fund shall be limited to \n     the payment obligations under this Act, and, except as \n     provided in subsection (f) and section 203(b)(2)(D), no \n     defendant participant shall have any liability for the \n     payment obligations of any other defendant participant.\n       (f) Consolidation of Payments.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of determining the payment \n     levels of defendant participants, any affiliated group \n     including 1 or more defendant participants may irrevocably \n     elect, as part of the submissions to be made under paragraphs \n     (1) and (3) of subsection (i), to report on a consolidated \n     basis all of the information necessary to determine the \n     payment level under this subtitle and pay to the Fund on a \n     consolidated basis.\n       (2) Election.--If an affiliated group elects consolidation \n     as provided in this subsection--\n       (A) for purposes of this Act other than this subsection, \n     the affiliated group shall be treated as if it were a single \n     participant, including with respect to the assessment of a \n     single annual payment under this subtitle for the entire \n     affiliated group;\n       (B) the ultimate parent of the affiliated group shall \n     prepare and submit each submission to be made under \n     subsection (i) on behalf of the entire affiliated group and \n     shall be solely liable, as between the Administrator and the \n     affiliated group only, for the payment of the annual amount \n     due from the affiliated group under this subtitle, except \n     that, if the ultimate parent does not pay when due any \n     payment obligation for the affiliated group, the \n     Administrator shall have the right to seek payment of all or \n     any portion of the entire amount due (as well as any other \n     amount for which the affiliated group may be liable under \n     sections 223 and 224) from any member of the affiliated \n     group;\n       (C) all members of the affiliated group shall be identified \n     in the submission under subsection (i) and shall certify \n     compliance with this subsection and the Administrator's \n     regulations implementing this subsection; and\n       (D) the obligations under this subtitle shall not change \n     even if, after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     beneficial ownership interest between any members of the \n     affiliated group shall change.\n       (3) Cause of action.--Notwithstanding section 221(e), this \n     Act shall not preclude actions among persons within an \n     affiliated group with respect to the payment obligations \n     under this Act.\n       (g) Determination of Prior Asbestos Expenditures.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of determining a defendant \n     participant's prior asbestos expenditures, the Administrator \n     shall prescribe such rules as may be necessary or appropriate \n     to assure that payments by indemnitors before December 31, \n     2002, shall be counted as part of the indemnitor's prior \n     asbestos expenditures, rather than the indemnitee's prior \n     asbestos expenditures, in accordance with this subsection.\n       (2) Indemnifiable costs.--If an indemnitor has paid or \n     reimbursed to an indemnitee any indemnifiable cost or \n     otherwise made a payment on behalf of or for the benefit of \n     an indemnitee to a third party for an indemnifiable cost \n     before December 31, 2002, the amount of such indemnifiable \n     cost shall be solely for the account of the indemnitor for \n     purposes under this Act.\n       (3) Insurance payments.--When computing the prior asbestos \n     expenditures with respect to an asbestos claim, any amount \n     paid or reimbursed by insurance shall be solely for the \n     account of the indemnitor, even if the indemnitor would have \n     no direct right to the benefit of the insurance, if--\n       (A) such insurance has been paid or reimbursed to the \n     indemnitor or the indemnitee, or paid on behalf of or for the \n     benefit of the indemnitee; and\n       (B) the indemnitor has either, with respect to such \n     asbestos claim or any similar asbestos claim, paid or \n     reimbursed to its indemnitee any indemnifiable cost or paid \n     to any third party on behalf of or for the benefit of the \n     indemnitee any indemnifiable cost.\n       (4) Treatment of certain expenditures.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of this Act, where--\n       (A) an indemnitor entered into a stock purchase agreement \n     in 1988 that involved the sale of the stock of businesses \n     that produced friction and other products; and\n       (B) the stock purchase agreement provided that the \n     indemnitor indemnified the indemnitee and its affiliates for \n     losses arising from various matters, including asbestos \n     claims--\n       (i) asserted before the date of the agreement; and\n       (ii) filed after the date of the agreement and prior to the \n     10-year anniversary of the stock sale,\n\n     then the prior asbestos expenditures arising from the \n     asbestos claims described in clauses (i) and (ii) shall not \n     be for the account of either the indemnitor or indemnitee.\n       (h) Minimum Annual Payments.--\n       (1) In general.--The aggregate annual payments of defendant \n     participants to the Fund shall be at least $3,000,000,000 for \n     each calendar year in the first 30 years of the Fund, or \n     until such shorter time as the condition set forth in \n     subsection (a)(2) is attained.\n       (2) Guaranteed payment account.--To the extent payments in \n     accordance with sections 202 and 203 (as modified by \n     subsections (b), (d), (f) and (g) of this section) fail in \n     any year to raise at least $3,000,000,000 net of any \n     adjustments under subsection (d), the balance needed to meet \n     this required minimum aggregate annual payment shall be \n     obtained from the defendant guaranteed payment account \n     established under subsection (k).\n       (3) Guaranteed payment surcharge.--To the extent the \n     procedure set forth in paragraph (2) is insufficient to \n     satisfy the required minimum aggregate annual payment net of \n     any adjustments under subsection (d), the Administrator may \n     assess a guaranteed payment surcharge under subsection (l).\n       (i) Procedures for Making Payments.--\n       (1) Initial year: tiers ii-vi.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 120 days after enactment of \n     this Act, each defendant participant that is included in \n     Tiers II, III, IV, V, or VI shall file with the \n     Administrator--\n       (i) a statement of whether the defendant participant \n     irrevocably elects to report on a consolidated basis under \n     subsection (f);\n       (ii) a good-faith estimate of its prior asbestos \n     expenditures;\n       (iii) a statement of its 2002 revenues, determined in \n     accordance with section 203(a)(2);

incomplete response.--If no response in \n     accordance with paragraph (5) is received from a defendant \n     participant, or if the response is incomplete, the initial \n     determination shall be based on the best information \n     available to the Administrator.\n       (C) Payments.--Within 30 days of receiving a notice of \n     initial determination requiring payment, the defendant \n     participant shall pay the Administrator the amount required \n     by the notice, after deducting any previous payment made by \n     the participant under this subsection. If the amount that the \n     defendant participant is required to pay is less than any \n     previous payment made by the participant under this \n     subsection, the Administrator shall credit any excess payment \n     against the future payment obligations of that defendant \n     participant. The pendency of a petition for rehearing under \n     paragraph (10) shall not stay the obligation of the \n     participant to make the payment specified in the \n     Administrator's notice.\n       (7) Exemptions for information required.--\n       (A) Prior asbestos expenditures.--In lieu of submitting \n     information related to prior asbestos expenditures as may be \n     required for purposes of this subtitle, a non-debtor \n     defendant participant may consent to be assigned to Tier II.\n       (B) Revenues.--In lieu of submitting information related to \n     revenues as may be required for purposes of this subtitle, a \n     non-debtor defendant participant may consent to be assigned \n     to Subtier 1 of the defendant participant's applicable tier.\n       (8) New information.--\n       (A) Existing participant.--The Administrator shall adopt \n     procedures for requiring additional payment, or refunding \n     amounts already paid, based on new information received.\n       (B) Additional participant.--If the Administrator, at any \n     time, receives information that an additional person may \n     qualify as a defendant participant, the Administrator shall \n     require such person to submit information necessary to \n     determine whether that person is required to make payments, \n     and in what amount, under this subtitle and shall make any \n     determination or take any other act consistent with this Act \n     based on such information or any other information available \n     to the Administrator with respect to such person.\n       (9) Subpoenas.--The Administrator may request the Attorney \n     General to subpoena persons to compel testimony, records, and \n     other information relevant to its responsibilities under this \n     section.

A defendant participant may not file an action \n     under section 303 unless the defendant participant requests a \n     rehearing under this paragraph. The Administrator shall \n     publish a notice in the Federal Register of any change in a \n     defendant participant's tier or subtier assignment or payment \n     obligation as a result of a rehearing.\n       (j) Defendant Hardship and Inequity Adjustment Account.--\n       (1) In general.--To the extent the total payments by \n     defendant participants in any given year exceed the minimum \n     aggregate annual payments under subsection (h), excess monies \n     up to a maximum of $300,000,000 in any such year shall be \n     placed in a defendant hardship and inequity adjustment \n     account established within the Fund by the Administrator.\n       (2) Use of account monies.--Monies from the defendant \n     hardship and inequity adjustment account shall be preserved \n     and administered like the remainder of the Fund, but shall be \n     reserved and may be used only--\n       (A) to make up for any relief granted to a defendant \n     participant for severe financial hardship or demonstrated \n     inequity under subsection (d) or to reimburse any defendant \n     participant granted such relief after its payment of the \n     amount otherwise due; and\n       (B) if the condition set forth in subsection (a)(2) is met, \n     for any purpose that the Fund may serve under this Act.\n       (3) Carryover of unused funds.--To the extent the \n     Administrator does not, in any given year, use all of the \n     funds allocated to the account under paragraph (1) for \n     adjustments granted under subsection (d), remaining funds in \n     the account shall be carried forward for use by the \n     Administrator for adjustments in subsequent years.\n       (k) Defendant Guaranteed Payment Account.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to subsections (h) and (j), if \n     there are excess monies paid by defendant participants in any \n     given year, including any bankruptcy trust credits that may \n     be due under section 222(e), such monies--\n       (A) at the discretion of the Administrator, may be used to \n     provide additional adjustments under subsection (d), up to a \n     maximum aggregate of $50,000,000 in such year; and\n\n[[Page S1028]]\n\n       (B) to the extent not used under subparagraph (A), shall be \n     placed in a defendant guaranteed payment account established \n     within the Fund by the Administrator.\n       (2) Use of account monies.--Monies from the defendant \n     guaranteed payment account shall be preserved and \n     administered like the remainder of the Fund, but shall be \n     reserved and may be used only--\n       (A) to ensure the minimum aggregate annual payment set \n     forth in subsection (h) net of any adjustments under \n     subsection (d) is reached each year; and\n       (B) if the condition set forth in subsection (a)(2) is met, \n     for any purpose that the Fund may serve under this Act.\n       (l) Guaranteed Payment Surcharge.--\n       (1) In general.--To the extent there are insufficient \n     monies in the defendant guaranteed payment account \n     established in subsection (k) to attain the minimum aggregate \n     annual payment net of any adjustments under subsection (d) in \n     any given year, the Administrator may impose on each \n     defendant participant a surcharge as necessary to raise the \n     balance required to attain the minimum aggregate annual \n     payment net of any adjustments under subsection (d), as \n     provided in this subsection. Any such surcharge shall be \n     imposed on a pro rata basis, in accordance with each \n     defendant participant's relative annual liability under \n     sections 202 and 203 (as modified by subsections (b), (d), \n     (f), and (g) of this section).\n       (2) Certification.--\n       (A) In general.--Before imposing a guaranteed payment \n     surcharge under this subsection, the Administrator shall \n     certify that he or she has used all reasonable efforts to \n     collect mandatory payments for all defendant participants, \n     including by using the authority in subsection (i)(9) of this \n     section and section 223.\n       (B) Notice and comment.--Before making a final \n     certification under subparagraph (C), the Administrator shall \n     publish a notice in the Federal Register of a proposed \n     certification and provide in such notice for a public comment \n     period of 30 days.\n       (C) Final certification.--\n       (i) In general.--The Administrator shall publish a notice \n     of the final certification in the Federal Register after \n     consideration of all comments submitted under subparagraph \n     (B).\n       (ii) Written notice.--Not later than 30 days after \n     publishing any final certification under clause (i), the \n     Administrator shall provide each defendant participant with \n     written notice of that defendant participant's payment, \n     including the amount of any surcharge.\n\n     SEC. 205. STEPDOWNS AND FUNDING HOLIDAYS.\n\n       (a) Stepdowns.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the minimum \n     aggregate annual funding obligation under section 204(h) \n     shall be reduced by 10 percent of the initial minimum \n     aggregate funding obligation at the end of the tenth, \n     fifteenth, twentieth, and twenty-fifth years after the date \n     of enactment of this Act. The reductions under this paragraph \n     shall be applied on an equal pro rata basis to the funding \n     obligations of all defendant participants, except with \n     respect to defendant participants in Tier 1, Subtiers 2 and \n     3, and class action trusts.\n       (2) Limitation.--The Administrator shall suspend, cancel, \n     reduce, or delay any reduction under paragraph (1) if at any \n     time the Administrator finds, in accordance with subsection \n     (c), that such action is necessary and appropriate to ensure \n     that the assets of the Fund and expected future payments \n     remain sufficient to satisfy the Fund's anticipated \n     obligations.\n       (b) Funding Holidays.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Administrator determines, at any \n     time after 10 years following the date of enactment of this \n     Act, that the assets of the Fund at the time of such \n     determination and expected future payments, taking into \n     consideration any reductions under subsection (a), are \n     sufficient to satisfy the Fund's anticipated obligations \n     without the need for all, or any portion of, that year's \n     payment otherwise required under this subtitle, the \n     Administrator shall reduce or waive all or any part of the \n     payments required from defendant participants for that year.\n       (2) Annual review.--The Administrator shall undertake the \n     review required by this subsection and make the necessary \n     determination under paragraph (1) every year.\n       (3) Limitations on funding holidays.--Any reduction or \n     waiver of the defendant participants' funding obligations \n     shall--\n       (A) be made only to the extent the Administrator determines \n     that the Fund will still be able to satisfy all of its \n     anticipated obligations; and\n       (B) be applied on an equal pro rata basis to the funding \n     obligations of all defendant participants, except with \n     respect to defendant participants in Subtiers 2 and 3 of Tier \n     I and class action trusts, for that year.\n       (4) New information.--If at any time the Administrator \n     determines that a reduction or waiver under this section may \n     cause the assets of the Fund and expected future payments to \n     decrease to a level at which the Fund may not be able to \n     satisfy all of its anticipated obligations, the Administrator \n     shall revoke all or any part of such reduction or waiver to \n     the extent necessary to ensure that the Fund's obligations \n     are met. Such revocations shall be applied on an equal pro \n     rata basis to the funding obligations of all defendant \n     participants, except defendant participants in Subtiers 2 and \n     3 of Tier I and class action trusts, for that year.\n       (c) Certification.--\n       (1) In general.--Before suspending, canceling, reducing, or \n     delaying any reduction under subsection (a) or granting or \n     revoking a reduction or waiver under subsection (b), the \n     Administrator shall certify that the requirements of this \n     section are satisfied.\n       (2) Notice and comment.--Before making a final \n     certification under this subsection, the Administrator shall \n     publish a notice in the Federal Register of a proposed \n     certification and a statement of the basis therefor and \n     provide in such notice for a public comment period of 30 \n     days.\n       (3) Final certification.--\n       (A) In general.--The Administrator shall publish a notice \n     of the final certification in the Federal Register after \n     consideration of all comments submitted under paragraph (2).\n       (B) Written notice.--Not later than 30 days after \n     publishing any final certification under subparagraph (A), \n     the Administrator shall provide each defendant participant \n     with written notice of that defendant's funding obligation \n     for that year.\n\n                Subtitle B--Asbestos Insurers Commission\n\n     SEC. 210.

No member of \n     the Commission shall be a shareholder of any insurer \n     participant. No member of the Commission shall be a former \n     officer or director, or a former employee or former \n     shareholder of any insurer participant who was such an \n     employee, shareholder, officer, or director at any time \n     during the 2-year period ending on the date of the \n     appointment, unless that is fully disclosed.\n       (ii) Definition.--In clause (i), the term ``shareholder'' \n     shall not include a broadly based mutual fund that includes \n     the stocks of insurer participants as a portion of its \n     overall holdings.\n       (C) Federal employment.--A member of the Commission may not \n     be an officer or employee of the Federal Government, except \n     by reason of membership on the Commission.\n       (3) Period of appointment.--Members shall be appointed for \n     the life of the Commission.\n       (4) Vacancies.--Any vacancy in the Commission shall be \n     filled in the same manner as the original appointment.\n       (5) Chairman.--The President shall select a Chairman from \n     among the members of the Commission.\n       (c) Meetings.--\n       (1) Initial meeting.--Not later than 30 days after the date \n     on which all members of the Commission have been appointed, \n     the Commission shall hold its first meeting.\n       (2) Subsequent meetings.--The Commission shall meet at the \n     call of the Chairman, as necessary to accomplish the duties \n     under section 212.\n       (3) Quorum.--No business may be conducted or hearings held \n     without the participation of a majority of the members of the \n     Commission.\n\n     SEC. 212. DUTIES OF ASBESTOS INSURERS COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Determination of Insurer Payment Obligations.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Definitions.--For the purposes of this Act, the terms \n     ``insurer'' and ``insurer participant'' shall, unless stated \n     otherwise, include direct insurers and reinsurers, as well as \n     any run-off entity established, in whole or in part, to \n     review and pay asbestos claims.\n       (B) Procedures for determining insurer payments.--The \n     Commission shall determine the amount that each insurer \n     participant shall be required to pay into the Fund under the \n     procedures described in this section. The Commission shall \n     make this determination by first promulgating a rule \n     establishing a methodology for allocation of payments among \n     insurer participants and then applying such methodology to \n     determine the individual payment for each insurer \n     participant. The methodology may include 1 or more allocation \n     formulas to be applied to all insurer participants or groups \n     of similarly situated participants. The Commission's rule \n     shall include a methodology for adjusting payments by insurer \n     participants to make up, during\n\n[[Page S1029]]\n\n     any applicable payment year, any amount by which aggregate \n     insurer payments fall below the level required in paragraph \n     (3)(C). The Commission shall conduct a thorough study (within \n     the time limitations under this subparagraph) of the accuracy \n     of the reserve allocation of each insurer participant, and \n     may request information from the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission or any State regulatory agency. Under this \n     procedure, not later than 120 days after the initial meeting \n     of the Commission, the Commission shall commence a rulemaking \n     proceeding under section 213(a) to propose and adopt a \n     methodology for allocating payments among insurer \n     participants. In proposing an allocation methodology, the \n     Commission may consult with such actuaries and other experts \n     as it deems appropriate. After hearings and public comment on \n     the proposed allocation methodology, the Commission shall as \n     promptly as possible promulgate a final rule establishing \n     such methodology. After promulgation of the final rule, the \n     Commission shall determine the individual payment of each \n     insurer participant under the procedures set forth in \n     subsection (b).\n       (C) Scope.--Every insurer, reinsurer, and runoff entity \n     with asbestos-related obligations in the United States shall \n     be subject to the Commission's and Administrator's authority \n     under this Act, including allocation determinations, and \n     shall be required to fulfill its payment obligation without \n     regard as to whether it is licensed in the United States. \n     Every insurer participant not licensed or domiciled in the \n     United States shall, upon the first payment to the Fund, \n     submit a written consent to the Commission's and \n     Administrator's authority under this Act, and to the \n     jurisdiction of the courts of the United States for purposes \n     of enforcing this Act, in a form determined by the \n     Administrator. Any insurer participant refusing to provide a \n     written consent shall be subject to fines and penalties as \n     provided in section 223.\n       (2) Amount of payments.--\n       (A) Aggregate payment obligation.--The total payment \n     required of all insurer participants over the life of the \n     Fund shall be equal to $46,025,000,000.\n       (B) Accounting standards.--In determining the payment \n     obligations of participants that are not licensed or \n     domiciled in the United States or that are runoff entities, \n     the Commission shall use accounting standards required for \n     United States licensed direct insurers.\n       (C) Captive insurance companies.--No payment to the Fund \n     shall be required from a captive insurance company, unless \n     and only to the extent a captive insurance company, on the \n     date of enactment of this Act, has liability, directly or \n     indirectly, for any asbestos claim of a person or persons \n     other than and unaffiliated with its ultimate parent or \n     affiliated group or pool in which the ultimate parent \n     participates or participated, or unaffiliated with a person \n     that was its ultimate parent or a member of its affiliated \n     group or pool at the time the relevant insurance or \n     reinsurance was issued by the captive insurance company.\n       (D) Several liability.--Unless otherwise provided under \n     this Act, each insurer participant's obligation to make \n     payments to the Fund is several. Unless otherwise provided \n     under this Act, there is no joint liability, and the future \n     insolvency by any insurer participant shall not affect the \n     payment required of any other insurer participant.\n       (3) Payment of criteria.--\n       (A) Inclusion in insurer participant category.--\n       (i) In general.--Insurers that have paid, or been assessed \n     by a legal judgment or settlement, at least $1,000,000 in \n     defense and indemnity costs before the date of enactment of \n     this Act in response to claims for compensation for asbestos \n     injuries arising from a policy of liability insurance or \n     contract of liability reinsurance or retrocessional \n     reinsurance shall be insurer participants in the Fund. Other \n     insurers shall be exempt from mandatory payments.\n       (ii) Inapplicability of section 202.--Since insurers may be \n     subject in certain jurisdictions to direct action suits, and \n     it is not the intent of this Act to impose upon an insurer, \n     due to its operation as an insurer, payment obligations to \n     the Fund in situations where the insurer is the subject of a \n     direct action, no insurer subject to mandatory payments \n     pursuant to section 212 shall also be liable for payments to \n     the Fund as a defendant participant pursuant to section 202.\n       (B) Insurer participant allocation methodology.--\n       (i) In general.--The Commission shall establish the payment \n     obligations of individual insurer participants to reflect, on \n     an equitable basis, the relative tort system liability of the \n     participating insurers in the absence of this Act, \n     considering and weighting, as appropriate (but exclusive of \n     workers' compensation), such factors as--\n\n       (I) historic premium for lines of insurance associated with \n     asbestos exposure over relevant periods of time;\n       (II) recent loss experience for asbestos liability;\n       (III) amounts reserved for asbestos liability;\n       (IV) the likely cost to each insurer participant of its \n     future liabilities under applicable insurance policies; and\n       (V) any other factor the Commission may determine is \n     relevant and appropriate.\n\n       (ii) Determination of reserves.--The Commission may \n     establish procedures and standards for determination of the \n     asbestos reserves of insurer participants. The reserves of a \n     United States licensed reinsurer that is wholly owned by, or \n     under common control of, a United States licensed direct \n     insurer shall be included as part of the direct insurer's \n     reserves when the reinsurer's financial results are included \n     as part of the direct insurer's United States operations, as \n     reflected in footnote 33 of its filings with the National \n     Association of Insurance Commissioners or in published \n     financial statements prepared in accordance with generally \n     accepted accounting principles.\n       (C) Payment schedule.--The aggregate annual amount of \n     payments by insurer participants over the life of the Fund \n     shall be as follows:\n       (i) For years 1 and 2, $2,700,000,000 annually.\n       (ii) For years 3 through 5, $5,075,000,000.\n       (iii) For years 6 through 27, $1,147,000,000 annually.\n       (iv) For year 28, $166,000,000.\n       (D) Certain runoff entities.--\n       (i) In general.--Whenever the Commission requires payments \n     by a runoff entity that has assumed asbestos-related \n     liabilities from a Lloyd's syndicate or names that are \n     members of such a syndicate, the Commission shall not require \n     payments from such syndicates and names to the extent that \n     the runoff entity makes its required payments. In addition, \n     such syndicates and names shall be required to make payments \n     to the Fund in the amount of any adjustment granted to the \n     runoff entity for severe financial hardship or exceptional \n     circumstances.\n       (ii) Included runoff entities.--Subject to clause (i), a \n     runoff entity shall include any direct insurer or reinsurer \n     whose asbestos liability reserves have been transferred, \n     directly or indirectly, to the runoff entity and on whose \n     behalf the runoff entity handles or adjusts and, where \n     appropriate, pays asbestos claims.\n       (E) Financial hardship and exceptional circumstance \n     adjustments.--\n       (i) In general.--Under the procedures established in \n     subsection (b), an insurer participant may seek adjustment of \n     the amount of its payments based on exceptional circumstances \n     or severe financial hardship.\n       (ii) Financial adjustments.--An insurer participant may \n     qualify for an adjustment based on severe financial hardship \n     by demonstrating that payment of the amounts required by the \n     Commission's methodology would jeopardize the solvency of \n     such participant.\n       (iii) Exceptional circumstance adjustment.--An insurer \n     participant may qualify for an adjustment based on \n     exceptional circumstances by demonstrating--\n\n       (I) that the amount of its payments under the Commission's \n     allocation methodology is exceptionally inequitable when \n     measured against the amount of the likely cost to the \n     participant of its future liability in the tort system in the \n     absence of the Fund;\n       (II) an offset credit as described in subparagraphs (A) and \n     (C) of subsection (b)(4); or\n       (III) other exceptional circumstances.\n\n     The Commission may determine whether to grant an adjustment \n     and the size of any such adjustment, but adjustments shall \n     not reduce the aggregate payment obligations of insurer \n     participants specified in paragraph (2)(A) and (3)(C).\n       (iv) Time period of adjustment.--Except for adjustments for \n     offset credits, adjustments granted under this subsection \n     shall have a term not to exceed 3 years. An insurer \n     participant may renew its adjustment by demonstrating to the \n     Administrator that it remains justified.\n       (b) Procedure for Notifying Insurer Participants of \n     Individual Payment Obligations.--\n       (1) Notice to participants.--Not later than 30 days after \n     promulgation of the final rule establishing an allocation \n     methodology under subsection (a)(1), the Commission shall--\n       (A) directly notify all reasonably identifiable insurer \n     participants of the requirement to submit information \n     necessary to calculate the amount of any required payment to \n     the Fund under the allocation methodology; and\n       (B) publish in the Federal Register a notice--\n       (i) requiring any person who may be an insurer participant \n     (as determined by criteria outlined in the notice) to submit \n     such information; and\n       (ii) that includes a list of all insurer participants \n     notified by the Commission under subparagraph (A), and \n     provides for 30 days for the submission of comments or \n     information regarding the completeness and accuracy of the \n     list of identified insurer participants.\n       (2) Response required by individual insurer participants.--\n       (A) In general.--Any person who receives notice under \n     paragraph (1)(A), and any other person meeting the criteria \n     specified in the notice published under paragraph (1)(B), \n     shall respond by providing the Commission with all the \n     information requested in the notice under a schedule or by a \n     date established by the Commission.\n       (B) Certification.--The response submitted under \n     subparagraph (A) shall be signed by a responsible corporate \n     officer, general partner, proprietor, or individual of \n     similar authority, who shall certify under penalty of law the \n     completeness and accuracy of the information submitted.\n       (3) Notice to insurer participants of initial payment \n     determination.--\n       (A) In general.--\n\n[[Page S1030]]\n\n       (i) Notice to insurers.--Not later than 120 days after \n     receipt of the information required by paragraph (2), the \n     Commission shall send each insurer participant a notice of \n     initial determination requiring payments to the Fund, which \n     shall be based on the information received from the \n     participant in response to the Commission's request for \n     information. An insurer participant's payments shall be \n     payable over the schedule established in subsection \n     (a)(3)(C), in annual amounts proportionate to the aggregate \n     annual amount of payments for all insurer participants for \n     the applicable year.\n       (ii) Public notice.--Not later than 7 days after sending \n     the notification of initial determination to insurer \n     participants, the Commission shall publish in the Federal \n     Register a notice listing the insurer participants that have \n     been sent such notification, and the initial determination on \n     the payment obligation of each identified participant.\n       (B) No response; incomplete response.--If no response is \n     received from an insurer participant, or if the response is \n     incomplete, the initial determination requiring a payment \n     from the insurer participant shall be based on the best \n     information available to the Commission.\n       (4) Commission review, revision, and finalization of \n     initial payment determinations.--\n       (A) Comments from insurer participants.--Not later than 30 \n     days after receiving a notice of initial determination from \n     the Commission, an insurer participant may provide the \n     Commission with additional information to support adjustments \n     to the required payments to reflect severe financial hardship \n     or exceptional circumstances, including the provision of an \n     offset credit for an insurer participant for the amount of \n     any asbestos-related payments it made or was legally \n     obligated to make, including payments released from an \n     escrow, as the result of a bankruptcy judicially confirmed \n     after May 22, 2003, but before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (B) Additional participants.--If, before the final \n     determination of the Commission, the Commission receives \n     information that an additional person may qualify as an \n     insurer participant, the Commission shall require such person \n     to submit information necessary to determine whether payments \n     from that person should be required, in accordance with the \n     requirements of this subsection.\n       (C) Revision procedures.--The Commission shall adopt \n     procedures for revising initial payments based on information \n     received under subparagraphs (A) and (B), including a \n     provision requiring an offset credit for an insurer \n     participant for the amount of any asbestos-related payments \n     it made or was legally obligated to make, including payments \n     released from an escrow, as the result of a bankruptcy \n     confirmed after May 22, 2003, but before the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (5) Examinations and subpoenas.--\n       (A) Examinations.--The Commission may conduct examinations \n     of the books and records of insurer participants to determine \n     the completeness and accuracy of information submitted, or \n     required to be submitted, to the Commission for purposes of \n     determining participant payments.\n       (B) Subpoenas.--The Commission may request the Attorney \n     General to subpoena persons to compel testimony, records, and \n     other information relevant to its responsibilities under this \n     section. The Attorney General may enforce such subpoena in \n     appropriate proceedings in the United States district court \n     for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena was \n     addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.\n       (6) Escrow payments.--Without regard to an insurer \n     participant's payment obligation under this section, any \n     escrow or similar account established before the date of \n     enactment of this Act by an insurer participant in connection \n     with an asbestos trust fund that has not been judicially \n     confirmed by final order by the date of enactment of this Act \n     shall be the property of the insurer participant and returned \n     to that insurer participant.\n       (7) Notice to insurer participants of final payment \n     determinations.--Not later than 60 days after the notice of \n     initial determination is sent to the insurer participants, \n     the Commission shall send each insurer participant a notice \n     of final determination.\n       (c) Insurer Participants Voluntary Allocation Agreement.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the \n     Commission proposes its rule establishing an allocation \n     methodology under subsection (a)(1), direct insurer \n     participants licensed or domiciled in the United States, \n     other direct insurer participants, reinsurer participants \n     licensed or domiciled in the United States, or other \n     reinsurer participants, may submit an allocation agreement, \n     approved by all of the participants in the applicable group, \n     to the Commission.\n       (2) Allocation agreement.--To the extent the participants \n     in any such applicable group voluntarily agree upon an \n     allocation arrangement, any such allocation agreement shall \n     only govern the allocation of payments within that group and \n     shall not determine the aggregate amount due from that group.\n       (3) Certification.--The Commission shall determine whether \n     an allocation agreement submitted under subparagraph (A) \n     meets the requirements of this subtitle and, if so, shall \n     certify the agreement as establishing the allocation \n     methodology governing the individual payment obligations of \n     the participants who are parties to the agreement. The \n     authority of the Commission under this subtitle shall, with \n     respect to participants who are parties to a certified \n     allocation agreement, terminate on the day after the \n     Commission certifies such agreement. Under subsection (f), \n     the Administrator shall assume responsibility, if necessary, \n     for calculating the individual payment obligations of \n     participants who are parties to the certified agreement.\n       (d) Commission Report.--\n       (1) Recipients.--Until the work of the Commission has been \n     completed and the Commission terminated, the Commission shall \n     submit an annual report, containing the information described \n     under paragraph (2), to--\n       (A) the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate;\n       (B) the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (C) the Administrator.\n       (2) Contents.--The report under paragraph (1) shall state \n     the amount that each insurer participant is required to pay \n     to the Fund, including the payment schedule for such \n     payments.\n       (e) Interim Payments.--\n       (1) Authority of administrator.--During the period between \n     the date of enactment of this Act and the date when the \n     Commission issues its final determinations of payments, the \n     Administrator shall have the authority to require insurer \n     participants to make interim payments to the Fund to assure \n     adequate funding by insurer participants during such period.\n       (2) Amount of interim payments.--During any applicable \n     year, the Administrator may require insurer participants to \n     make aggregate interim payments not to exceed the annual \n     aggregate amount specified in subsection (a)(3)(C).\n       (3) Allocation of payments.--Interim payments shall be \n     allocated among individual insurer participants on an \n     equitable basis as determined by the Administrator. All \n     payments required under this subparagraph shall be credited \n     against the participant's ultimate payment obligation to the \n     Fund established by the Commission. If an interim payment \n     exceeds the ultimate payment, the Fund shall pay interest on \n     the amount of the overpayment at a rate determined by the \n     Administrator. If the ultimate payment exceeds the interim \n     payment, the participant shall pay interest on the amount of \n     the underpayment at the same rate. Any participant may seek \n     an exemption from or reduction in any payment required under \n     this subsection under the financial hardship and exceptional \n     circumstance standards established in subsection (a)(3)(D).\n       (4) Appeal of interim payment decisions.--A decision by the \n     Administrator to establish an interim payment obligation \n     shall be considered final agency action and reviewable under \n     section 303, except that the reviewing court may not stay an \n     interim payment during the pendency of the appeal.\n       (f) Transfer of Authority From the Commission to the \n     Administrator.--\n       (1) In general.--Upon termination of the Commission under \n     section 215, the Administrator shall assume all the \n     responsibilities and authority of the Commission, except that \n     the Administrator shall not have the power to modify the \n     allocation methodology established by the Commission or by \n     certified agreement or to promulgate a rule establishing any \n     such methodology.\n       (2) Financial hardship and exceptional circumstance \n     adjustments.--Upon termination of the Commission under \n     section 215, the Administrator shall have the authority, upon \n     application by any insurer participant, to make adjustments \n     to annual payments upon the same grounds as provided in \n     subsection (a)(3)(D). Adjustments granted under this \n     subsection shall have a term not to exceed 3 years. An \n     insurer participant may renew its adjustment by demonstrating \n     that it remains justified. Upon the grant of any adjustment, \n     the Administrator shall increase the payments required of all \n     other insurer participants so that there is no reduction in \n     the aggregate payment required of all insurer participants \n     for the applicable years. The increase in an insurer \n     participant's required payment shall be in proportion to such \n     participant's share of the aggregate payment obligation of \n     all insurer participants.\n       (3) Financial security requirements.--Whenever an insurer \n     participant's A.M. Best's claims payment rating or Standard \n     and Poor's financial strength rating falls below A-, and \n     until such time as either the insurer participant's A.M. \n     Best's Rating or Standard and Poor's rating is equal to or \n     greater than A-, the Administrator shall have the authority \n     to require that the participating insurer either--\n       (A) pay the present value of its remaining Fund payments at \n     a discount rate determined by the Administrator; or\n       (B) provide an evergreen letter of credit or financial \n     guarantee for future payments issued by an institution with \n     an A.M. Best's claims payment rating or Standard & Poor's \n     financial strength rating of at least A+.\n       (g) Judicial Review.--The Commission's rule establishing an \n     allocation methodology, its final determinations of payment \n     obligations and other final action shall be judicially \n     reviewable as provided in title III.\n\n     SEC. 213.

MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND.\n\n       (a) In General.--Amounts in the Fund shall be held for the \n     exclusive purpose of providing benefits to asbestos claimants \n     and their beneficiaries, including those provided in \n     subsection (c), and to otherwise defray the reasonable \n     expenses of administering the Fund.\n       (b) Investments.--\n       (1) In general.--Amounts in the Fund shall be administered \n     and invested with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence, \n     under the circumstances prevailing at the time of such \n     investment, that a prudent person acting in a like capacity \n     and manner would use.\n       (2) Strategy.--The Administrator shall invest amounts in \n     the Fund in a manner that enables the Fund to make current \n     and future distributions to or for the benefit of asbestos \n     claimants. In pursuing an investment strategy under this \n     subparagraph, the Administrator shall consider, to the extent \n     relevant to an investment decision or action--\n       (A) the size of the Fund;\n       (B) the nature and estimated duration of the Fund;\n       (C) the liquidity and distribution requirements of the \n     Fund;\n       (D) general economic conditions at the time of the \n     investment;\n       (E) the possible effect of inflation or deflation on Fund \n     assets;\n       (F) the role that each investment or course of action plays \n     with respect to the overall assets of the Fund;\n       (G) the expected amount to be earned (including both income \n     and appreciation of capital) through investment of amounts in \n     the Fund; and\n       (H) the needs of asbestos claimants for current and future \n     distributions authorized under this Act.\n       (c) Mesothelioma Research and Treatment Centers.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall provide $1,000,000 \n     from the Fund for each of fiscal years 2005 through 2009 for \n     each of up to 10 mesothelioma disease research and treatment \n     centers.\n       (2) Requirements.--The Centers shall--\n       (A) be chosen by the Director of the National Institutes of \n     Health;\n       (B) be chosen through competitive peer review;\n       (C) be geographically distributed throughout the United \n     States with special consideration given to areas of high \n     incidence of mesothelioma disease;\n       (D) be closely associated with Department of Veterans \n     Affairs medical centers to provide research benefits and care \n     to veterans who have suffered excessively from mesothelioma;\n       (E) be engaged in research to provide mechanisms for \n     detection and prevention of mesothelioma, particularly in the \n     areas of pain management and cures;\n       (F) be engaged in public education about mesothelioma and \n     prevention, screening, and treatment;\n       (G) be participants in the National Mesothelioma Registry; \n     and\n       (H) be coordinated in their research and treatment efforts \n     with other Centers and institutions involved in exemplary \n     mesothelioma research.\n       (d) Bankruptcy Trust Guarantee.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, the Administrator shall have the authority to \n     impose a pro rata surcharge on all participants under this \n     subsection to ensure the liquidity of the Fund, if--\n       (A) the declared assets from 1 or more bankruptcy trusts \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated on or before July 31, 2004, are not \n     available to the Fund because a final judgment that has been \n     entered by a court and is no longer subject to any appeal or \n     review has enjoined the transfer of assets required under \n     section 524(j)(2) of title 11, United States Code (as amended \n     by section 402(f) of this Act); and\n       (B) borrowing is insufficient to assure the Fund's ability \n     to meet its obligations under this Act such that the required \n     borrowed amount is likely to increase the risk of termination \n     of this Act under section 405 based on reasonable claims \n     projections.\n       (2) Allocation.--Any surcharge imposed under this \n     subsection shall be imposed over a period of 5 years on a pro \n     rata basis upon all participants, in accordance with each \n     participant's relative annual liability under this subtitle \n     and subtitle B for those 5 years.\n       (3) Certification.--\n       (A) In general.--Before imposing a surcharge under this \n     subsection, the Administrator shall publish a notice in the \n     Federal Register and provide in such notice for a public \n     comment period of 30 days.\n       (B) Contents of notice.--The notice required under \n     subparagraph (A) shall include--\n       (i) information explaining the circumstances that make a \n     surcharge necessary and a certification that the requirements \n     under paragraph (1) are met;\n       (ii) the amount of the declared assets from any trust \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated on or before July 31, 2004, that \n     was not made, or is no longer, available to the Fund;\n       (iii) the total aggregate amount of the necessary \n     surcharge; and\n       (iv) the surcharge amount for each tier and subtier of \n     defendant participants and for each insurer participant.\n       (C) Final notice.--The Administrator shall publish a final \n     notice in the Federal Register and provide each participant \n     with written notice of that participant's schedule of \n     payments under this subsection. In no event shall any \n     required surcharge under this subsection be due before 60 \n     days after the Administrator publishes the final notice in \n     the Federal Register and provides each participant with \n     written notice of its schedule of payments.\n       (4) Maximum amount.--In no event shall the total aggregate \n     surcharge imposed by the Administrator exceed the lesser of--\n       (A) the total aggregate amount of the declared assets of \n     the trusts established under a plan of reorganization \n     confirmed and substantially consummated prior to July 31, \n     2004, that are no longer available to the Fund; or\n       (B) $4,000,000,000.\n       (5) Declared assets.--\n       (A) In general.--In this subsection, the term ``declared \n     assets'' means--\n       (i) the amount of assets transferred by any trust \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated on or before July 31, 2004, to the \n     Fund that is required to be returned to that trust under the \n     final judgment described in paragraph (1)(A); or\n       (ii) if no assets were transferred by the trust to the \n     Fund, the amount of assets the Administrator determines would \n     have been available for transfer to the Fund from that trust \n     under section 402(f).\n       (B) Determination.--In making a determination under \n     subparagraph (A)(ii), the Administrator may rely on any \n     information reasonably available, and may request, and use \n     subpoena authority of the Administrator if necessary to \n     obtain, relevant information from any such trust or its \n     trustees.\n       (e) Bankruptcy Trust Credits.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, but subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, \n     the Administrator shall provide a credit toward the aggregate \n     payment obligations under sections 202(a)(2) and 212(a)(2)(A) \n     for assets received by the Fund from any bankruptcy trust \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated after July 31, 2004.\n       (2) Allocation of credits.--The Administrator shall \n     allocate, for each such bankruptcy trust, the credits for \n     such assets between the defendant and insurer aggregate \n     payment obligations as follows:\n       (A) Defendant participants.--The aggregate amount that all \n     persons other than insurers contributing to the bankruptcy \n     trust would have been required to pay as Tier I defendants \n     under section 203(b) if the plan of reorganization under \n     which the bankruptcy trust was established had not been \n     confirmed and substantially consummated and the proceeding \n     under chapter 11 of title 11, United States Code, that \n     resulted in the establishment of the bankruptcy trust had \n     remained pending as of the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (B) Insurer participants.--The aggregate amount of all \n     credits to which insurers are entitled to under section \n     202(c)(4)(A) of the Act.\n\n     SEC. 223. ENFORCEMENT OF PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS.\n\n       (a) Default.--If any participant fails to make any payment \n     in the amount of and according to the schedule under this Act \n     or as prescribed by the Administrator, after demand and a 30-\n     day opportunity to cure the default, there shall be a lien in \n     favor of the United States for the amount of the delinquent \n     payment (including interest) upon all property and rights to \n     property, whether real or personal, belonging to such \n     participant.\n       (b) Bankruptcy.--In the case of a bankruptcy or insolvency \n     proceeding, the lien imposed under subsection (a) shall be \n     treated in the same manner as a lien for taxes due and owing \n     to the United States for purposes of the provisions of title \n     11, United States Code, or section 3713(a) of title 31, \n     United States Code.

The positions taken or statements made by \n     the Administrator in any such proceeding shall not be binding \n     on or attributed to the insureds or cedents in any other \n     proceeding. The outcome of such a proceeding shall not have a \n     preclusive effect on the insureds or cedents in any other \n     proceeding and shall not be admissible against any subrogee \n     under this section. The Administrator shall have the \n     authority to settle or compromise any claims against a \n     nonpaying insurer participant under this subsection.\n       (e) Bar on United States Business.--If any direct insurer \n     or reinsurer refuses to furnish any information requested by \n     or to pay any contribution required by this Act, then, in \n     addition to any other penalties imposed by this Act, the \n     Administrator may issue an order barring such entity and its \n     affiliates from insuring risks located within the United \n     States or otherwise doing business within the United States. \n     Insurer participants or their affiliates seeking to obtain a \n     license from any State to write any type of insurance shall \n     be barred from obtaining any such license until payment of \n     all contributions required as of the date of license \n     application.\n       (f) Credit for Reinsurance.--If the Administrator \n     determines that an insurer participant that is a reinsurer is \n     in default in paying any required contribution or otherwise \n     not in compliance with this Act, the Administrator may issue \n     an order barring any direct insurer participant from \n     receiving credit for reinsurance purchased from the \n     defaulting reinsurer. Any State law governing credit for \n     reinsurance to the contrary is preempted.\n       (g) Defense Limitation.--In any proceeding under this \n     section, the participant shall be barred from bringing any \n     challenge to any determination of the Administrator or the \n     Asbestos Insurers Commission regarding its liability under \n     this Act, or to the constitutionality of this Act or any \n     provision thereof, if such challenge could have been made \n     during the review provided under section 204(i)(10), or in a \n     judicial review proceeding under section 303.\n       (h) Deposit of Funds.--\n       (1) In general.--Any funds collected under subsection \n     (c)(2) (A) or (C) shall be--\n       (A) deposited in the Fund; and\n       (B) used only to pay--\n       (i) claims for awards for an eligible disease or condition \n     determined under title I; or\n       (ii) claims for reimbursement for medical monitoring \n     determined under title I.\n       (2) No effect on other liabilities.--The imposition of a \n     fine under subsection (c)(2)(C) shall have no effect on--\n       (A) the assessment of contributions under subtitles A and \n     B; or\n       (B) any other provision of this Act.\n       (i) Property of the Estate.--Section 541(b) of title 11, \n     United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (4)(B)(ii), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (5), by striking ``prohibition.'' and \n     inserting ``prohibition; or''; and\n       (3) by inserting after paragraph (5) and before the last \n     undesignated sentence the following:\n       ``(6) the value of any pending claim against or the amount \n     of an award granted from the Asbestos Injury Claims \n     Resolution Fund established under the Fairness in Asbestos \n     Injury Resolution Act of 2005.''.\n\n     SEC. 224.

and\n       (ii) the resolution of claims for reimbursement or coverage \n     of liability or paid or incurred loss for which notice was \n     provided to the insurer before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (E) Scheduled payment amounts.--The term ``scheduled \n     payment amounts'' means the future payment obligation to the \n     Fund under this Act from a defendant participant in the \n     amount established under sections 203 and 204.\n       (F) Unearned erosion amount.--The term ``unearned erosion \n     amount'' means, in the event of any early sunset under \n     section 405(f), the difference between the deemed erosion \n     amount and the earned erosion amount.\n       (2) Quantum and timing of erosion.--\n       (A) Erosion upon enactment.--The collective payment \n     obligations to the Fund of the insurer and reinsurer \n     participants as assessed by the Administrator shall be deemed \n     as of the date of enactment of this Act to erode remaining \n     aggregate products limits available to a defendant \n     participant only in an amount of 59.64 percent of each \n     defendant participant's scheduled payment amount.\n       (B) No assertion of claim.--No insurer or reinsurer may \n     assert any claim against a defendant participant or captive \n     insurer for insurance, reinsurance, payment of a deductible, \n     or retrospective premium adjustment arising out of that \n     insurer's or reinsurer's payments to the Fund or the erosion \n     deemed to occur under this section.\n       (C) Policies without certain limits or with exclusion.--\n     Except as provided under subparagraph (E), nothing in this \n     section shall require or permit the erosion of any insurance \n     policy or limit that does not contain an aggregate products \n     limit, or that contains an asbestos exclusion.\n       (D) Treatment of consolidation election.--If an affiliated \n     group elects consolidation as provided in section 204(f), the \n     total erosion of limits for the affiliated group under \n     paragraph (2)(A) shall not exceed 59.64 percent of the \n     scheduled payment amount of the single payment obligation for \n     the entire affiliated group. The total erosion of limits for \n     any individual defendant participant in the affiliated group \n     shall not exceed its individual share of 59.64 percent of the \n     affiliated group's scheduled payment amount, as measured by \n     the individual defendant participant's percentage share of \n     the affiliated group's prior asbestos expenditures.\n       (E) Rule of construction.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section, nothing in this Act shall be \n     deemed to erode\n\n[[Page S1038]]\n\n     remaining aggregate products limits of a defendant \n     participant that can demonstrate by a preponderance of the \n     evidence that 75 percent of its prior asbestos expenditures \n     were made in defense or satisfaction of asbestos claims \n     alleging bodily injury arising exclusively from the exposure \n     to asbestos at premises owned, rented, or controlled by the \n     defendant participant (a ``premises defendant''). In \n     calculating such percentage, where expenditures were made in \n     defense or satisfaction of asbestos claims alleging bodily \n     injury due to exposure to the defendant participant's \n     products and to asbestos at premises owned, rented, or \n     controlled by the defendant participant, half of such \n     expenditures shall be deemed to be for such premises \n     exposures. If a defendant participant establishes itself as a \n     premises defendant, 75 percent of the payments by such \n     defendant participant shall erode coverage limits, if any, \n     applicable to premises liabilities under applicable law.\n       (3) Method of erosion.--\n       (A) Allocation.--The amount of erosion allocated to each \n     defendant participant shall be allocated among periods in \n     which policies with remaining aggregate product limits are \n     available to that defendant participant pro rata by policy \n     period, in ascending order by attachment point.\n       (B) Other erosion methods.--\n       (i) In general.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the \n     method of erosion of any remaining aggregate products limits \n     which are subject to--\n\n       (I) a coverage-in-place or settlement agreement between a \n     defendant participant and 1 or more insurance participants as \n     of the date of enactment; or\n       (II) a final and nonappealable judgment as of the date of \n     enactment or resulting from a claim for coverage or \n     reimbursement pending as of such date, shall be as specified \n     in such agreement or judgment with regard to erosion \n     applicable to such insurance participants' policies.\n\n       (ii) Remaining limits.--To the extent that a final \n     nonappealable judgment or settlement agreement to which an \n     insurer participant and a defendant participant are parties \n     in effect as of the date of enactment of this Act \n     extinguished a defendant participant's right to seek coverage \n     for asbestos claims under an insurer participant's policies, \n     any remaining limits in such policies shall not be considered \n     to be remaining aggregate products limits under subsection \n     (a)(1)(A).\n       (4) Restoration of aggregate products limits upon early \n     sunset.--\n       (A) Restoration.--In the event of an early sunset, any \n     unearned erosion amount will be deemed restored as aggregate \n     products limits available to a defendant participant as of \n     the date of enactment.\n       (B) Method of restoration.--The unearned erosion amount \n     will be deemed restored to each defendant participant's \n     policies in such a manner that the last limits that were \n     deemed eroded at enactment under this subsection are deemed \n     to be the first limits restored upon early sunset.\n       (C) Tolling of coverage claims.--In the event of an early \n     sunset, the applicable statute of limitations and contractual \n     provisions for the filing of claims under any insurance \n     policy with restored aggregate products limits shall be \n     deemed tolled after the date of enactment through the date 6 \n     months after the date of early sunset.\n       (5) Payments by defendant participant.--Payments made by a \n     defendant participant shall be deemed to erode, exhaust, or \n     otherwise satisfy applicable self-insured retentions, \n     deductibles, retrospectively rated premiums, and limits \n     issued by nonparticipating insolvent or captive insurance \n     companies. Reduction of remaining aggregate limits under this \n     subsection shall not limit the right of a defendant \n     participant to collect from any insurer not a participant.\n       (6) Effect on other insurance claims.--Other than as \n     specified in this subsection, this Act does not alter, \n     change, modify, or affect insurance for claims other than \n     asbestos claims.\n       (b) Dispute Resolution Procedure.--\n       (1) Arbitration.--The parties to a dispute regarding the \n     erosion of insurance coverage limits under this section may \n     agree in writing to settle such dispute by arbitration. Any \n     such provision or agreement shall be valid, irrevocable, and \n     enforceable, except for any grounds that exist at law or in \n     equity for revocation of a contract.\n       (2) Title 9, united states code.--Arbitration of such \n     disputes, awards by arbitrators, and confirmation of awards \n     shall be governed by title 9, United States Code, to the \n     extent such title is not inconsistent with this section. In \n     any such arbitration proceeding, the erosion principles \n     provided for under this section shall be binding on the \n     arbitrator, unless the parties agree to the contrary.\n       (3) Final and binding award.--An award by an arbitrator \n     shall be final and binding between the parties to the \n     arbitration, but shall have no force or effect on any other \n     person. The parties to an arbitration may agree that in the \n     event a policy which is the subject matter of an award is \n     subsequently determined to be eroded in a manner different \n     from the manner determined by the arbitration in a judgment \n     rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction from which no \n     appeal can or has been taken, such arbitration award may be \n     modified by any court of competent jurisdiction upon \n     application by any party to the arbitration. Any such \n     modification shall govern the rights and obligations between \n     such parties after the date of such modification.\n       (c) Effect on Nonparticipants.--\n       (1) In general.--No insurance company or reinsurance \n     company that is not a participant, other than a captive \n     insurer, shall be entitled to claim that payments to the Fund \n     erode, exhaust, or otherwise limit the nonparticipant's \n     insurance or reinsurance obligations.\n       (2) Other claims.--Nothing in this Act shall preclude a \n     participant from pursuing any claim for insurance or \n     reinsurance from any person that is not a participant other \n     than a captive insurer.\n       (d) Finite Risk Policies Not Affected.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, this Act shall not alter, affect or impair any \n     rights or obligations of--\n       (A) any party to an insurance contract that expressly \n     provides coverage for governmental charges or assessments \n     imposed to replace insurance or reinsurance liabilities in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act; or\n       (B) subject to paragraph (2), any person with respect to \n     any insurance or reinsurance purchased by a participant after \n     December 31, 1996, that expressly (but not necessarily \n     exclusively) provides coverage for asbestos liabilities, \n     including those policies commonly referred to as ``finite \n     risk'' policies.\n       (2) Limitation.--No person may assert that any amounts paid \n     to the Fund in accordance with this Act are covered by any \n     policy described under paragraph (1)(B) purchased by a \n     defendant participant, unless such policy specifically \n     provides coverage for required payments to a Federal trust \n     fund established by a Federal statute to resolve asbestos \n     injury claims.\n       (e) Effect on Certain Insurance and Reinsurance Claims.--\n       (1) No coverage for fund assessments.--No participant or \n     captive insurer may pursue an insurance or reinsurance claim \n     against another participant or captive insurer for payments \n     to the Fund required under this Act, except under a contract \n     specifically providing insurance or reinsurance for required \n     payments to a Federal trust fund established by a Federal \n     statute to resolve asbestos injury claims or, where \n     applicable, under finite risk policies under subsection (d).\n       (2) Certain insurance assignments voided.--Any assignment \n     of any rights to insurance coverage for asbestos claims to \n     any person who has asserted an asbestos claim before the \n     effective date, or to any trust, person, or other entity not \n     part of an affiliated group as defined in section 201(1) of \n     this Act established or appointed for the purpose of paying \n     asbestos claims which were asserted before the effective \n     date, or by any Tier I defendant participant, before any \n     sunset of this Act, shall be null and void. This subsection \n     shall not void or affect in any way any assignments of rights \n     to insurance coverage other than to asbestos claimants or to \n     trusts, persons, or other entities not part of an affiliated \n     group as defined in section 201(1) of this Act established or \n     appointed for the purpose of paying asbestos claims, or by \n     Tier I defendant participants.\n       (3) Insurance claims preserved.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, this Act shall not alter, affect, or \n     impair any rights or obligations of any person with respect \n     to any insurance or reinsurance for amounts that any person \n     pays, has paid, or becomes legally obligated to pay in \n     respect of asbestos or other claims, except to the extent \n     that--\n       (A) such person pays or becomes legally obligated to pay \n     claims that are superseded by section 403;\n       (B) any such rights or obligations of such person with \n     respect to insurance or reinsurance are prohibited by \n     paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (e); or\n       (C) the limits of insurance otherwise available to such \n     participant in respect of asbestos claims are deemed to be \n     eroded under subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 405. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ADMINISTRATOR AND SUNSET OF \n                   THE ACT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator shall submit an annual \n     report to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and \n     the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives on the operation of the Asbestos Injury \n     Claims Resolution Fund within 6 months after the close of \n     each fiscal year.\n       (b) Contents of Report.--The annual report submitted under \n     this subsection shall include an analysis of--\n       (1) the claims experience of the program during the most \n     recent fiscal year, including--\n       (A) the number of claims made to the Office and a \n     description of the types of medical diagnoses and asbestos \n     exposures underlying those claims;\n       (B) the number of claims denied by the Office and a \n     description of the types of medical diagnoses and asbestos \n     exposures underlying those claims, and a general description \n     of the reasons for their denial;\n       (C) a summary of the eligibility determinations made by the \n     Office under section 114;\n       (D) a summary of the awards made from the Fund, including \n     the amount of the awards; and\n       (E) for each eligible condition, a statement of the \n     percentage of asbestos claimants who filed claims during the \n     prior calendar year and were determined to be eligible to \n     receive compensation under this Act, who have received the \n     compensation to which such claimants are entitled according \n     to section 131;\n       (2) the administrative performance of the program, \n     including--\n\n[[Page S1039]]\n\n       (A) the performance of the program in meeting the time \n     limits prescribed by law and an analysis of the reasons for \n     any systemic delays;\n       (B) any backlogs of claims that may exist and an \n     explanation of the reasons for such backlogs;\n       (C) the costs to the Fund of administering the program; and\n       (D) any other significant factors bearing on the efficiency \n     of the program;\n       (3) the financial condition of the Fund, including--\n       (A) statements of the Fund's revenues, expenses, assets, \n     and liabilities;\n       (B) the identity of all participants, the funding \n     allocations of each participant, and the total amounts of all \n     payments to the Fund;\n       (C) a list of all financial hardship or inequity \n     adjustments applied for during the fiscal year, and the \n     adjustments that were made during the fiscal year;\n       (D) a statement of the investments of the Fund; and\n       (E) a statement of the borrowings of the Fund;\n       (4) the financial prospects of the Fund, including--\n       (A) an estimate of the number and types of claims, the \n     amount of awards, and the participant payment obligations for \n     the next fiscal year;\n       (B) an analysis of the financial condition of the Fund, \n     including an estimation of the Fund's ability to pay claims \n     for the subsequent 5 years in full as and when required, an \n     evaluation of the Fund's ability to retire its existing debt \n     and assume additional debt, and an evaluation of the Fund's \n     ability to satisfy other obligations under the program; and\n       (C) a report on any changes in projections made in earlier \n     annual reports or sunset analyses regarding the Fund's \n     ability to meet its financial obligations;\n       (5) any recommendations from the Advisory Committee on \n     Asbestos Disease Compensation and the Medical Advisory \n     Committee of the Fund to improve the diagnostic, exposure, \n     and medical criteria so as to pay only those claimants whose \n     injuries are caused by exposure to asbestos;\n       (6) a summary of the results of audits conducted under \n     section 115; and\n       (7) a summary of prosecutions under section 1348 of title \n     18, United States Code (as added by this Act).\n       (c) Claims Analysis.--If the Administrator concludes, on \n     the basis of the annual report submitted under this section, \n     that the Fund is compensating claims for injuries that are \n     not caused by exposure to asbestos and compensating such \n     claims may, currently or in the future, undermine the Fund's \n     ability to compensate persons with injuries that are caused \n     by exposure to asbestos, the Administrator shall include in \n     the report an analysis of the reasons for the situation, a \n     description of the range of reasonable alternatives for \n     responding to the situation, and a recommendation as to which \n     alternative best serves the interest of claimants and the \n     public. The report may include a description of changes in \n     the diagnostic, exposure, or medical criteria of section 121 \n     that the Administrator believes may be necessary to protect \n     the Fund from compensating claims not caused by exposure to \n     asbestos.\n       (d) Shortfall Analysis.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Analysis.--If the Administrator concludes, on the basis \n     of the information contained in the annual report submitted \n     under this section, that the Fund may not be able to pay \n     claims as such claims become due at any time within the next \n     5 years, the Administrator shall include in the report an \n     analysis of the reasons for the situation, an estimation of \n     when the Fund will no longer be able to pay claims as such \n     claims become due, a description of the range of reasonable \n     alternatives for responding to the situation, and a \n     recommendation as to which alternative best serves the \n     interest of claimants and the public. The report may include \n     a description of changes in the diagnostic, exposure, or \n     medical criteria of section 121 that the Administrator \n     believes may be necessary to protect the Fund.\n       (B) Range of alternatives.--The range of alternatives under \n     subparagraph (A) may include--\n       (i) triggering the termination of this Act under subsection \n     (f) at any time after the date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (ii) reform of the program set forth in titles I and II of \n     this Act (including changes in the diagnostic, exposure, or \n     medical criteria, changes in the enforcement or application \n     of those criteria, changes in the timing of payments, or \n     changes in award values).\n       (2) Considerations.--In formulating recommendations, the \n     Administrator shall take into account the reasons for any \n     shortfall, actual or projected, which may include--\n       (A) financial factors, including return on investments, \n     borrowing capacity, interest rates, ability to collect \n     contributions, and other relevant factors;\n       (B) the operation of the Fund generally, including \n     administration of the claims processing, the ability of the \n     Administrator to collect contributions from participants, \n     potential problems of fraud, the adequacy of the criteria to \n     rule out idiopathic mesothelioma, and inadequate flexibility \n     to extend the timing of payments;\n       (C) the appropriateness of the diagnostic, exposure, and \n     medical criteria, including the adequacy of the criteria to \n     rule out idiopathic mesothelioma;\n       (D) the actual incidence of asbestos-related diseases, \n     including mesothelioma, based on epidemiological studies and \n     other relevant data;\n       (E) compensation of diseases with alternative causes; and\n       (F) other factors that the Administrator considers \n     relevant.\n       (3) Recommendation of termination.--Any recommendation of \n     termination should include a plan for winding up the affairs \n     of the Fund (and the program generally) within a defined \n     period, including paying in full all claims resolved at the \n     time the report is prepared.\n       (4) Resolved claims.--For purposes of this section, a claim \n     shall be deemed resolved when the Administrator has \n     determined the amount of the award due the claimant, and \n     either the claimant has waived judicial review or the time \n     for judicial review has expired.\n       (e) Recommendations of Administrator and Commission.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Administrator recommends changes to \n     this Act under subsection (c), the recommendations and \n     accompanying analysis shall be referred to a special \n     commission consisting of the Attorney General, the Secretary \n     of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Commerce, or \n     their designees. The Commission shall hold public hearings on \n     the Administrator's alternatives and recommendations and then \n     make its own recommendations for reform of the program set \n     forth in titles I and II of this Act. Within 180 days after \n     receiving the Administrator's recommendations, the Commission \n     shall transmit its own recommendations to the Congress in the \n     same manner as set forth in subsection (a).\n       (2) Referral.--If the Administrator recommends changes to, \n     or termination of, this Act under subsection (d), the \n     recommendations and accompanying analysis shall be referred \n     to the Commission. The Commission shall hold public hearings \n     on the Administrator's alternatives and recommendations and \n     then make its own recommendations for reform of the program \n     set forth in titles I and II of this Act. Within 180 days \n     after receiving the Administrator's recommendations, the \n     Commission shall transmit its own recommendations to Congress \n     in the same manner as set forth in subsection (a).\n       (f) Sunset of Act.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Termination.--Subject to paragraph (4), titles I \n     (except subtitle A) and II and sections 403 and 404(e)(2) \n     shall terminate as provided under paragraph (2), if the \n     Administrator--\n       (i) has begun the processing of claims;\n       (ii) conducts a review of the operations of the Fund \n     similar to a review conducted to prepare an annual report \n     under this section; and\n       (iii) determines that if any additional claims are \n     resolved, the Fund will not have sufficient resources when \n     needed to pay 100 percent of all resolved claims while also \n     meeting all other obligations of the Fund under this Act, \n     including the payment of--\n\n       (I) debt repayment obligations; and\n       (II) remaining obligations to the asbestos trust of a \n     debtor and the class action trust.\n\n       (B) Remaining obligations.--For purposes of subparagraph \n     (A)(iii), the remaining obligations to the asbestos trust of \n     the debtor and the class action trust shall be determined by \n     the Administrator by assuming that, instead of a lump-sum \n     payment, such trust had transferred its assets to the Fund on \n     an annual basis, taking into consideration relevant factors, \n     including the most recent projections made by the trust's \n     actuary before the date of enactment of this Act of the \n     amount and timing of future claim payments and administrative \n     and operating expenses.\n       (2) Effective date of termination.--A termination under \n     paragraph (1) shall take effect 180 days after the date of a \n     determination of the Administrator under paragraph (1) and \n     shall apply to all asbestos claims that have not been \n     resolved by the Fund as of the date of the determination.\n       (3) Resolved claims.--If a termination takes effect under \n     this subsection, all resolved claims shall be paid in full by \n     the Fund.\n       (4) Extinguished claims.--A claim that is extinguished \n     under the statute of limitations provisions in section 113(b) \n     or preempted under section 403(e)(2) is not revived at the \n     time of sunset under this subsection.\n       (5) Continued funding.--If a termination takes effect under \n     this subsection, participants will still be required to make \n     payments as provided under subtitles A and B of title II. If \n     the full amount of payments required by title II is not \n     necessary for the Fund to pay claims that have been resolved \n     as of the date of termination, pay the Fund's debt and \n     obligations to the asbestos trusts and class action trust, \n     and support the Fund's continued operation as needed to pay \n     such claims, debt, and obligations, the Administrator may \n     reduce such payments. Any such reductions shall be allocated \n     among participants in approximately the same proportion as \n     the liability under subtitles A and B of title II.\n       (6) Sunset claims.--\n       (A) Definitions.--In this paragraph--\n       (i) the term ``sunset claims'' means claims as to which \n     this Act has terminated; and\n       (ii) the term ``sunset claimants'' means persons asserting \n     sunset claims.\n\n[[Page S1040]]\n\n       (B) In general.--If a termination takes effect under this \n     subsection, the applicable statute of limitations for the \n     filing of sunset claims under subsection (g) shall be tolled \n     for any past or pending sunset claimants while such claimants \n     were pursuing claims filed under this Act. For those \n     claimants who decide to pursue a sunset claim in accordance \n     with subsection (g), the applicable statute of limitations \n     shall apply, except that claimants who filed a claim against \n     the Fund under this Act before the date of termination shall \n     have 2 years after the date of termination to file a sunset \n     claim in accordance with subsection (g).\n       (7) Asbestos trusts and class action trust.--On and after \n     the date of termination under this subsection, the trust \n     distribution program of any asbestos trust and the class \n     action trust shall be replaced with the medical criteria \n     requirements of section 121.\n       (8) Payment to asbestos trusts and class action trust.--The \n     amounts determined under paragraph (1)(A)(iii) for payment to \n     the asbestos trusts and the class action trust shall be \n     transferred to the respective asbestos trusts of the debtor \n     and the class action trust within 90 days.\n       (g) Nature of Claim After Sunset.--\n       (1) In general.--On and after the date of termination under \n     subsection (f), any individual injured as a result of \n     exposure to asbestos, who has not previously had a claim \n     resolved by the Fund, may in a civil action obtain relief in \n     damages subject to the terms and conditions under this \n     subsection and paragraph (6) of subsection (f), except--\n       (A) an individual who has had a claim resolved by the Fund \n     may not pursue a court action, except that an individual who \n     received an award for a nonmalignant disease (Levels I \n     through V) from the Fund may assert a claim for a subsequent \n     or progressive disease under this subsection, unless the \n     disease was diagnosed or the claimant had discovered facts \n     that would have led a reasonable person to obtain such a \n     diagnosis before the date on which the previous claim against \n     the Fund was disposed; and\n       (B) an individual who received an award for a nonmalignant \n     or malignant disease (except mesothelioma) (Levels I through \n     IX) from the Fund may assert a claim for mesothelioma under \n     this subsection, unless the mesothelioma was diagnosed or the \n     claimant had discovered facts that would have led a \n     reasonable person to obtain such a diagnosis before the date \n     on which the nonmalignant or other malignant claim was \n     disposed.\n       (2) Exclusive remedy.--As of the effective date of a \n     termination of this Act under subsection (f), an action under \n     paragraph (1) shall be the exclusive remedy for any asbestos \n     claim that might otherwise exist under Federal, State, or \n     other law, regardless of whether such claim arose before or \n     after the effective date of this Act or of the termination of \n     this Act, except that claims against the Fund that have been \n     resolved before the date of the termination determination \n     under subsection (f) may be paid by the Fund.\n       (3) Venue.--\n       (A) In general.--Actions under paragraph (1) may be brought \n     in--\n       (i) any Federal district court;\n       (ii) any State court in the State where the claimant \n     resides; or\n       (iii) any State court in a State where the asbestos \n     exposure occurred.\n       (B) Defendants not found.--If any defendant cannot be found \n     in the State described in clause (ii) or (iii) of \n     subparagraph (A), the claim may be pursued only against that \n     defendant in the Federal district court or the State court \n     located within any State in which the defendant may be found.\n       (C) Determination of most appropriate forum.--If a person \n     alleges that the asbestos exposure occurred in more than one \n     county (or Federal district), the trial court shall determine \n     which State and county (or Federal district) is the most \n     appropriate forum for the claim. If the court determines that \n     another forum would be the most appropriate forum for a \n     claim, the court shall dismiss the claim. Any otherwise \n     applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled beginning \n     on the date the claim was filed and ending on the date the \n     claim is dismissed under this subparagraph.\n       (D) State venue requirements.--Nothing in this paragraph \n     shall preempt or supersede any State's law relating to venue \n     requirements within that State which are more restrictive.\n       (4) Class action trusts.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section--\n       (A) at no time after the assets of any class action trust \n     have been transferred to the Fund in accordance with section \n     203(b)(5), no sunset claim may be maintained with respect to \n     asbestos liabilities arising from the operations of a person \n     with respect to whose liabilities for asbestos claims a class \n     action trust has been established, whether such claim names \n     the person or its successors or affiliates as defendants; and\n       (B) if a termination takes effect under subsection (f), the \n     exclusive remedy for sunset claims arising from such \n     operations will be a claim against the class action trust to \n     which the Administrator has transferred funds under \n     subsection (f)(8) to pay asbestos claims, if necessary in \n     proportionally reduced amounts.\n       (h) Level VII Claims.--\n       (1) Monitoring claims.--In each fiscal year, the \n     Administrator shall monitor the number of claims of smokers \n     and ex-smokers filed with the Office for Level VII asbestos-\n     related disease and compare such number with the most recent \n     projection of the Congressional Budget Office before the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Analysis, estimates, and alternative actions.--If the \n     Administrator estimates that in the next fiscal year the \n     number of claims of smokers and ex-smokers filed with the \n     Office over the preceding 3 years may exceed the most recent \n     projection of the Congressional Budget Office before the date \n     of enactment of this Act by 15 percent, the Administrator \n     shall--\n       (A) conduct an analysis of the reasons for the results of \n     the estimation;\n       (B) estimate whether that number will exceed the projection \n     by 15 percent or more in subsequent fiscal years; and\n       (C) provide a range of reasonable alternatives of actions \n     which best serve the interests of claimants and the public \n     that the Administrator, Congress, or other authorities may \n     take to provide for that number not to exceed the projection \n     by 15 percent or more.\n       (3) Sunset of claims.--If in any fiscal year the \n     Administrator determines that the number of claims of smokers \n     and ex-smokers filed with the Office over the preceding 3 \n     years for Level VII asbestos-related disease exceed the most \n     recent projection of the Congressional Budget Office before \n     the date of enactment of this Act by 15 percent, the \n     Administrator shall take actions from the alternatives \n     described under paragraph (2)(C) to reduce that number to not \n     exceed 15 percent of that projection. If after taking such \n     actions, the Administrator determines that such number will \n     continue to exceed 15 percent of that projection, such claims \n     shall be treated as if this Act had ceased to be effective \n     under subsection (f).\n       (4) Transfer to class action trust.--On the effective date \n     of the sunset of Level VII claims under paragraph (3), the \n     Administrator shall transfer to a class action trust an \n     amount the Administrator determines is sufficient to pay \n     future claims for Level VII asbestos disease arising from the \n     operations of a person with respect to whose liabilities for \n     asbestos claims the class action trust has been established.\n       (5) New claims filed after sunset.--\n       (A) Venue.--If this Act ceases to be effective with respect \n     to Level VII claims of smokers and ex-smokers under paragraph \n     (3)--\n       (i) any actions shall be brought only in the Federal \n     district court located within--\n\n       (I) the State of residence of the claimant; or\n       (II) the State in which the asbestos exposure occurred; or\n\n       (ii) if any defendant cannot be found in the State \n     described in subclause (I) or (II) of clause (i), the claim \n     may be pursued against that defendant only in the Federal \n     district court or the State court located within any State in \n     which the defendant may be found.\n       (B) Determination of most appropriate forum.--If a person \n     alleges that the asbestos exposure occurred in more than one \n     Federal district, the trial court shall determine which \n     Federal district is the most appropriate forum for the claim. \n     If the court determines that another forum would be the most \n     appropriate forum for a claim, the court shall dismiss the \n     claim. Any otherwise applicable statute of limitations shall \n     be tolled beginning on the date the claim was filed and \n     ending on the date the claim is dismissed under this \n     subparagraph.\n       (C) Applicable law.--An action under subparagraph (A) shall \n     be governed by Federal common law, except that where national \n     uniformity is not required the court shall utilize otherwise \n     applicable State law, including statutes, to provide the \n     appropriate rule of Federal common law.\n       (D) Exclusive remedy.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of this section, after the sunset of claims under paragraph \n     (3), the exclusive remedy for actions for Level VII asbestos \n     disease arising from the operations of a person with respect \n     to whose liabilities for asbestos claims a class action trust \n     has been established shall be payment from the funds \n     transferred to the class action trust under paragraph (4). No \n     actions for such Level VII asbestos disease claims may be \n     maintained against a person that transferred the assets of \n     any class action trust in accordance with section 203(b)(5), \n     its successors or affiliates.\n       (E) Sunset of act.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if \n     this Act terminates as provided in subsection (f), all civil \n     actions for Level VII claims filed after the effective date \n     of such termination shall be governed by subsection (g).\n\n     SEC. 406.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to talk about \nasbestos reform, which is legislation that Senator Hatch had \nshepherded, along with Senator Leahy and Senator Frist, with \nsubstantial contributions by Senator Daschle, as well.\n  Today, I am going to submit for the record a bill which is a \ndiscussion draft. I had intended to submit this legislation late last \nweek, but I was asked by the majority leader to defer for a week so \nthat further consideration could be given today by the majority leader \nand by members of the Judiciary Committee, including the Presiding \nOfficer.\n  We have reached a critical stage in the analysis and presentation of \nthis legislation. It has had a long history. In July of 2003, more than \n19 months ago, the Judiciary Committee passed out a bill, which all \nagreed had a great many problems, but it was passed out of committee \nlargely along party lines. I voted for it, in order to move the bill \nalong.\n  As it is generally known, I then enlisted the aid of a senior Federal \njudge, Judge Edward R. Becker, who recently was the chief judge of the \nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit, to undertake discussions, \ncalled mediation, and for 2 days in August of 2003, Judge Becker and I \nsat in his chambers with the so-called stakeholders representatives of \nthe manufacturers, representatives of labor, AFL-CIO, representatives \nof the insurance industry, and representatives of the trial lawyers. \nThat has been followed by some 39 separate meetings which have been \nconvened in my conference room.\n  In addition to numerous discussions Judge Becker has held with \ninterested parties and which I have held with interested parties, we \nhave come to a point in our work where we have found agreement among \nthe parties on many items. We have found the stakeholders very close \ntogether on other items.\n  As might be expected, it has been necessary to make judgments, which \nis the responsibility of this Senator and which I have done in \ncollaboration with many other Senators, about what this bill \nrepresents, which in my considered judgment is an equitable bill.\n  In early January, I circulated a discussion draft which had certain \nblanks until we had a hearing, which was held on January 11. I have \nalso had an eye to trying to get the bill completed so that the \nmajority leader could take it up at an early date. If that is not done, \nand the bill languishes into the season where we take up the \nappropriations bills, it simply will not be taken up. The asbestos \nissue is a crisis in the United States today. There is general \nagreement on that, with some 74 companies having gone into bankruptcy, \nand with thousands of asbestos victims suffering from mesothelioma, \nwhich is a deadly disease, and other deadly diseases and not collecting \nbecause their employers have gone bankrupt.\n  We have found other very difficult issues on so-called ``mixed \ndust.'' We held a hearing last week, and I think we have worked through \nthe scientific evidence on that proposal so that we are now in a \nposition to know when someone comes forward with a claim, whether it is \nfrom asbestos, which has already been covered under the trust fund, or \nwhether it is from silica, which would be a separate cause of action.\n  The essential provisions of this legislation create a trust fund. In \norder to collect from the trust fund, victims--people exposed to \nasbestos--must establish certain levels of disability.\n\n[[Page S1010]]\n\nThere is a graduated scale as to compensation. The offset to the right \nof victims to give up their right to jury trial is the assurance that \nif this fund proves to be insufficient, people can go back to the jury \ntrial system. There had been a great deal of discussion as to what was \nan adequate amount for the trust fund.\n  The manufacturers and insurers made an offer of $140 billion. There \nwere discussions last fall between Senator Frist and Senator Daschle \nwhere there was agreement to that proposal as to the total amount, \nalthough there had not been and has not been any agreement by the AFL-\nCIO or by labor. After a lot of consideration, it is my judgment that \nis an equitable figure. It is impossible to say what the total claims \nwill be, what the total sum will be that is required because we do not \nknow how many claims there will be. But if that figure should prove \ninsufficient, then victims--claimants--have a right to go back to the \njury trial system.\n  There had been some disagreement as to how much money should be in at \nthe start, with manufacturers and insurers wanting $40 billion in the \nfirst 5 years, and labor wanting $60 billion. After considerable \ninquiry, I was satisfied that the fund would have the ability to borrow \nat least $20 billion extra, so that the $60 billion total looked to by \nlabor would be realized. Again, not to the satisfaction of all the \nparties, that is what the bill provides.\n  The manufacturers and the insurers were looking for a 7\\1/2\\ year \nperiod where they would be assured there would be no other claims made. \nAfter extensive consideration, it was my judgment that there were \ncertainly reasonable assurances that the fund would last for at least \n7\\1/2\\ years, but that if the fund was to fall short, that ought to be \na burden not met by the claimants, but they ought to have their right \nto reversion to a jury trial.\n  There was a consideration as to what would happen on startup, with \nthe manufacturers and insurers wanting a very lengthy period of time. \nThe bill strikes a compromise, with 270 days to start up the bill on \nexigent claims--that is, very serious claims involving mesothelioma--\nand 18 months on other claims. Labor and the trial lawyers felt there \nought to be access to the courts continuously until the fund was \nstarted. The reality is, there are many delays, and a 270-day delay, \nwhile nobody likes any delays, is not an excessive delay under our \nlitigation system in the United States. So that compromise and that \nadjustment was made.\n  As to the pending cases, labor and the trial lawyers wanted an \nexclusion on mesothelioma in cases which had been filed. This bill \nprovides that the requests of manufacturers and insurers had a very \nsolid basis, that if they were going to put up a very substantial trust \nfund, that all of the cases ought to go into the trust fund, and that \nis the structure of the bill unless the case is to a jury or unless \nthere has been a settlement with a particular individual.\n  We have worked through the problems of the Federal Employees \nLiability Act, where we are very near a solution. I talked to Judge \nBecker earlier today, and he has talked to the parties there, and they \nare very close to resolving that issue. But in any event, there has \nbeen an agreement that if there is not a way to reconcile all of those \nissues, then there will be an arbitration clause in the bill which will \nsolve that issue.\n  There had been a consideration as to the issue on medical screening, \nwith the manufacturers and the insurers objecting to medical screening. \nAfter considerable consideration, it was decided that medical screening \nought to be provided in the bill, although it ought to be provided in a \nvery tightened-up process so it would not bring into the litigation \nsystem people who did not have bona fide claims, that it would not \nincrease the litigation inappropriately. Where you have substantial \nmotivation for the trial lawyers to go out and find clients and bring \nclaims, that is one thing. But if that is absent because of the \nreduction in attorneys' fees, then it seemed to me that these are \npeople who do not ordinarily get physical examinations on an annual \nbasis, as Senators might, and that it was fair to have medical \nscreening, but it has been done on a tightened basis, and it was \nconsidered that was a fair approach here.\n  When it came to what is called level seven, where we have smokers \ninvolved with reduced compensation, it was generally agreed we were not \nlooking to have a smokers bill, so that if the claims exceeded 115 \npercent of the estimate by the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, \nthose cases would go back to the judicial system where the defendants \nare said to win most of those cases.\n  We have come to agreement on many contentious issues. The \nadministrative provisions have been agreed to with the Department of \nLabor. We have agreed to a provision that if you have a 40-year-old \nmesothelioma victim with dependent children, the administrator shall \nhave authority to give him more and to give somebody, illustratively, \nin their eighties with no dependents less, as long as the fund remains \nneutral.\n  We have come to agreement on judicial review. We have come to \nagreement on what courts will handle the cases if there was a \nreversion. There had been a request by the manufacturers and insurers \nto have all the cases go to Federal courts. Labor and the trial lawyers \nwanted the cases to go wherever the plaintiff chose to bring them. We \nhave come to agreement that they would go to the Federal courts with \nthe exception of the State courts where the individual lived as to \nvenue or where the matter occurred.\n  We have on a consensus basis agreed to tighten up the penalties on \nviolation of environment, safety requirements, and health requirements. \nLabor wanted a provision as to transparency, and after a lot of \nanalysis, we have worked that through.\n  In the course of these extensive negotiations, there have been, I \nwould estimate, some 150 to 250 legislative changes on modification. So \nwe have come to a point where we now have this bill to be submitted for \ndiscussion purposes again. I had wanted to introduce this bill on a \nnumber of occasions. As I said, for the record, 2 or 3 weeks ago, \nSenator Leahy wanted additional time to study it. I have worked closely \nwith Senator Feinstein and met with her and with her staff. As \nenumerated in the course of my written statements, some 27 Senators \nhave participated in this process. It is very, very complicated. I do \nnot think the Congress has ever tackled a more complicated legislative \nissue. In fact, I think the Congress has never tackled a legislative \nissue as complicated as this, certainly not during the 24 years-plus \ntenure of which I have had.\n  As it has been commented about publicly, this issue brings together \nfour of the most powerful if not the most powerful groups in \nWashington: the manufacturers; labor, with the AFL-CIO; the trial \nlawyers; and the insurance companies. Each has pressed very hard for \nadvantage, which you would expect them to make their press.\n  As I say, this bill, numbering some 291 pages, contains many \nagreements. On those issues where we could not structure and forge \nagreements, the judgments have been made. I take the responsibility for \nthe judgments which have been made here.\n  I submit that it is an equitable bill. I am not in concrete on any of \nthese provisions. I am willing to discuss them. I am willing to talk \nabout them further. But the basic approach of a trust fund is central \nto a resolution of this very difficult issue if we are to resolve it. \nIf you press on one part of a balloon, the air goes to another part of \nthe balloon, and while insurers and manufacturers may not like \nscreening, labor does not like the limitation on the fund, and every \ntime you turn, there is an issue where someone wants something more.\n  I believe that this bill, the structure of this bill, although not \nnecessarily the particulars, is the last best chance.\n  I have taken over the responsibility as chair of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and we have an agenda which is gigantic. In order to work in \nour first hearing on January 11, we had to work it around the hearings \non White House Counsel Gonzales. And last week we spent all of the week \non that issue. Last week the committee took up the issue of class \naction which is now on the floor. This Thursday we have hearings on \nbankruptcy because the majority leader wants to move forward. We have \nin the offing judicial nominations, and we have the prospect of a\n\n[[Page S1011]]\n\nSupreme Court nominee. So the Judiciary Committee calendar is \nabsolutely jammed.\n  If this cannot provide the framework for a resolution of this issue, \nconsidering the 20 months of very laborious effort put in by Judge \nBecker and by some 27 Senators and 39 separate conferences, I do not \nknow what would be fruitful for the Judiciary Committee for the Senate \nto do next.\n  I have sought recognition to introduce a discussion draft of the \nFairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005, FAIR Act, the \nsuccessor to S. 1125 and S. 2290, the FAIR Acts of 2003 and 2004. My \ncolleagues Senator Frist, Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy deserve \nenormous credit for the drafting of these acts and for the development \nof this legislation. There is a will in the Senate to enact legislation \nthat should put an end to the ongoing rash of bankruptcies, growing \nmonthly; diverting resources from those who are truly sick; endangering \njobs and pensions; and creating the worst litigation crisis in the \nhistory of the American judicial system. The FAIR Act is still alive. \nThe Senate plainly wants a more rational asbestos claims system, and I \nbelieve that this legislation offers a realistic prospect of \naccomplishing that result.\n  This legislation provides substantial assurances of acceptable \ncompensation to asbestos victims and substantial assurances to \nmanufacturers and insurers to resolve, with finality, asbestos claims. \nFor more than two decades, a solution to the asbestos crisis has eluded \nCongress and the courts. Seventy-four companies have gone bankrupt, \nthousands of individuals who have been exposed to asbestos have deadly \ndiseases--mesothelioma and other such ailments--and are not being \ncompensated. According to the RAND Institute for Civil Justice, ``about \ntwo-thirds of the claims are now filed by the unimpaired, while in the \npast they were filed only by the manifestly ill.'' According to RAND, \nthe number of claims continues to rise, with over 600,000 claims filed \nalready and 300,000 pending. The number of asbestos defendants also has \nrisen sharply, from about 300 in the 1980s, to more than 8,400 today \nand most are users of the product, not its manufacturers. These \ncompanies span 85 percent of the U.S. economy and nearly every U.S. \nindustry, and include automakers, shipbuilders, textile mills, \nretailers, insurers, shipbuilders, electric utilities and virtually any \ncompany involved in manufacturing or construction in the last thirty \nyears.\n  Asbestos leaves many victims in its wake. First and foremost, the \nsick and their families have suffered. But the flawed asbestos \nlitigation system not only hurts the sick and their chance at receiving \nfair compensation, but also claims other victims. These include \nemployees, retirees and shareholders of affected companies whose jobs, \nsavings and retirement plans are also jeopardized by the tide of \nasbestos cases. With asbestos litigation affecting so many companies, \nthis also impacts the overall economy, including jobs, pensions, stock \nprices, tax revenues and insurance costs. According to a 2002 study by \nNobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, asbestos bankruptcies have cost nearly \n60,000 workers their jobs and $200 million in lost wages. Employees' \nretirement funds have shrunken by 25 percent.\n  In July 2003, the Judiciary Committee knowingly voted out S. 1125, a \nbill with many problems, largely along party lines, in an effort to \nmove the legislation. S. 1125 created the basic structure of the \nlegislation, and made a huge stride in working out the medical \ncriteria. However, the bill floundered on other issues. In August, at \nmy request, Judge Edward R. Becker, a Federal judge for 33 years, \nconvened in his chambers in Philadelphia for 2 days the so-called \nstakeholders--manufacturers, labor, AFL-CIO, insurers and trial \nlawyers--to determine if some common ground could be found. Until the \npreceding May, Judge Becker had been the chief judge of the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals and wrote the opinion in the asbestos class \naction suit which was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  From September 2003 through January 2005, there have been 37 \nstakeholder meetings in my conference room, with Judge Becker as a pro-\nbono mediator, usually attended by 25 to 40 representatives and \nsometimes over 75 present. Judge Becker and I have sought an equitable \nbill which took into account, to the maximum extent possible, the \nconcerns of the stakeholders and to get their input on drafting of the \nbill. After analysis and deliberation, we found we could accommodate \nmany of the competing interests.\n  This process commenced with the blessing of Chairman Hatch and \nRanking Member Leahy of the Judiciary Committee. This extended process \nallowed the stakeholders an extraordinary ``hearing'' process and \nreally amounted to the longest ``mark-up'' in Senate history although \nnot in the customary framework. We have had the cooperation of many \nSenators. Senators Hatch and Leahy have had representatives at all the \nmeetings. The majority leader, Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy have \naddressed this ``working group'' at our meetings. Senator Hatch and \nSenator Leahy's representatives have been active participants at every \nmeeting, as well as the members of the staffs of Senators Feinstein, \nCarper, Cornyn, DeWine, Ben Nelson, Baucus, Biden, Chambliss, Craig, \nDodd, Durbin, Feingold, Graham, Grassley, Kennedy, Kohl, Kyl, Landrieu, \nLevin, Lincoln, Murray, Pryor, Schumer, Sessions, Snowe, Stabenow, and \nVoinovich.\n  The concept of a trust fund is an outstanding idea. Senator Hatch \ndeserves great credit for moving the legislation in the direction of a \ntrust fund with a schedule of payments analogous to worker's \ncompensation so the cases would not have to go through the litigation \nprocess. Under this proposal, the Federal Government would establish a \nnational trust fund privately financed by asbestos defendant companies \nand insurers. No taxpayer money would be involved. Asbestos victims \nwould simply submit their claims to the fund. Claimants would be fairly \ncompensated if they meet medical criteria for certain illnesses and \nshow past asbestos exposure. The Trust Fund would guarantee \ncompensation for impaired victims.\n\n  Through the series of meetings with Judge Becker, we have wrestled \nwith and have been able to solve a number of very complex issues. The \nsize of the trust fund was always a principal issue of dispute, \nstarting at $108 billion. The manufacturers/insurers raised their offer \nto $140 billion. Last October, Majority Leader Frist and then-\nDemocratic Leader Daschle agreed to $140 billion. When Senator Frist \nand Senator Daschle, in an adversarial context, agreed to the adequacy \nof the $140 billion figure, it is difficult to exceed it even though \nthe AFL-CIO did not contemporaneously agree.\n  It is not possible to say definitely what figure would be adequate \nbecause it depends on the uncertainty of how many claims will be filed. \nThere is support for the adequacy of the $140 billion figure from \nreputable projections. But they are, admittedly, only projections.\n  The real safety valve, if the fund is unable to pay claims, is for \nthe injured to have the ability to go back to court if the system is \nnot operational and able to pay exigent health claims within 9 months \nafter enactment, and all other valid claims within 18 months of \nenactment.\n  The claimants object to any hiatus between access to the courts and \nan operating system; but the reality is that court delays are \ncustomarily longer than the delay structured in this system. The \ndefendants and insurers object saying it is too short a time frame, but \nthey have the power to expedite the process by promptly paying their \nassessments. I am confident that there will be no problem in \nadministering the system and processing the claims. Conversations have \nbeen held with the leaders of the Manville Trust and the RAND Institute \nstudy and they persuade me that the volume of claims can be efficiently \nadministered by the fund administrator using a technique developed by \nthe Manville Trust and other similar claims facilities that have \nprocessed asbestos claims for many years. The Manville Trust has \nprocessed as many as 150,000 claims per year. The number of exigent \nclaims anticipated in the first 9 months of the fund is vastly smaller \nand even the total number of claims anticipated in the first 18 months \nis significantly less that which the Manville Trust has handled in a \ncomparable period. Additionally, the bill provides the administrator \nwith the option to contract out\n\n[[Page S1012]]\n\nthe exigent claims to a claims facility for expedited processing under \nthe standards of the fund on a voluntary basis. The short time frame \nwill prod the system to become operative at an early date. The bill \nsends the claims back to the fund as soon as it is certified \noperational with a credit for any payment of the scheduled amount.\n  Similarly, the defendants seek a commitment that the legislation will \nbar return to the courts for at least 7\\1/2\\ years. It is hard to see \nhow the substantial fund would be expended in a lesser period. Here \nagain, the legislation gives the defendant substantial assurances that \nthe system will last at least 7\\1/2\\ years. If it collapses, the \nclaimants should not bear the burden, but should reclaim their \nconstitutional right to a jury trial.\n  The claimants sought $60 billion in startup contributions within 5 \nyears and the defendants countered with a maximum of $40 billion. The \nfund's borrowing power should enable it to borrow at least the balance \nof $20 billion because of the defendants continuing substantial \nfinancial commitments. Here again, the bill meets the standard of \nsubstantial assurances, albeit not perfect certainty, that $60 billion \nwill be in hand within the first 5 years.\n  A key issue for the claimant has been that of workers' compensation \nsubrogation. This issue is important because the value of an award to \nthe claimant depends on whether the claimant may have to pay a \nsubstantial amount of it to others. While the precise picture is \ndifferent from State to State, in general, workers' compensation laws \ngive employers, and their insurance carriers, subrogation rights \nagainst third-party tortfeasors and a lien on the injured employee's \nrecovery from a third-part tortfeasor. This is a big deal because \nworkers' compensation covers the employee's medical costs.\n  I closely examined and considered including a proposal that would \nhave called for a so-called workers' compensation ``holiday.'' Such a \nproposal would have provided for a ``holiday'' from worker's \ncompensation payments during the period of receipt of payments from \ntrust fund except to the extent that the compensation would exceed \nthem, with a waiver of past and future subrogation. However, as each \nState has different workers' compensation laws and I concluded that \nsuch a proposal may go beyond the practice in a number of States \nleaving some claimants with a significantly reduced award.\n  Furthermore, while not undisputed like some other matters on this \nlegislation, there is some significant basis in the assertion by \nclaimants that the award values in the bill were designed with the \nconcept in mind that there would be no liens or rights of subrogation \nagainst the claimants based on workers' compensation awards and health \ninsurance payments.\n  Therefore, in the final analysis, I have determined that to be fair \nto victims, claimants should be allowed to retain and receive the full \nvalue of both their fund awards and workers' compensation payments. It \nis important that the bill must extinguish any liens or rights \nof subrogation that other parties might otherwise assert against the \nclaimants based on workers' compensation awards and health insurance \npayments.\n\n  Another key issue for the claimants has been the legislation's \ntreatment of asbestos disease claims under the Federal Employers' \nLiability Act, FELA, the workers' compensation system for rail workers. \nEarlier versions of the bill would have preempted FELA claims for \nasbestos-related diseases, limiting victim's recovery to compensation \nunder a national asbestos trust fund. Rail labor asserts that such an \napproach is unfair to rail workers, since for all other workers, the \nbill maintains workers' compensation rights. Alternative approaches to \ndealing with the FELA issue have been proposed, including providing for \na supplemental payment, in addition to awards under the bill, to \nprovide compensation to rail workers for work-related asbestos \ndiseases. The AFL-CIO's affiliates who represent workers in the rail \nindustry have been engaged in discussions with industry on this issue, \nand will continue to work to see if a fair resolution can be reached. I \nhave included in the bill language that would call for binding \narbitration between the parties if they do not arrive at a solution 30 \ndays post enactment.\n  In these marathon discussions, plus the January hearing, I understand \nthe deep concerns expressed by the stakeholder representatives on more \nconcessions for their clients. On the state of the 20 year record, this \nchoice is not between this bill and one which would give their clients \nmore concessions. The choice is between this bill and the continuation \nof the present chaotic system which leaves uncompensated thousands of \nvictims suffering from deadly diseases and litigation driving more \ncompanies into bankruptcy.\n  We considered at length the manufacturers/insurers objections to \nmedical screening, but concluded such a provision was necessary as an \noffset to the reduced role of claimant's attorney. With the previous \npotential of a substantial contingent fee, claimants' attorneys \nidentified those damaged by exposure to asbestos. Absent that \nmotivation, it is reasonable to have routine examinations for people \nwho would not be expected to go for such checkups on their own; so as a \nmatter of basic fairness, such screening is provided. By establishing a \nprogram with rigorous standards, as we have done in this bill, \nunmeritorious claims can be avoided with the fair determination of \nthose entitled to compensation under the statutory standard.\n  The legislation has closely examined the issues of so-called \n``leakage'' in the fund and has provided all asbestos claims pending on \nthe date of enactment, except for non-consolidated cases actually on \ntrial, and except cases subject to a verdict or final order or final \njudgment, will be brought into the asbestos trust fund. Furthermore, \nonly written settlement agreements, executed prior to date of \nenactment, between a defendant and a specifically identifiable \nplaintiff will be preserved outside of the fund; the settlement \nagreement must contain an express obligation by the settling defendant \nto make a future monetary payment to the individual plaintiff, but \ngives the plaintiff 60 days to fulfill all conditions of the settlement \nagreement.\n  I have also included in the legislation language which is designed to \nensure prompt judicial review of a variety of regulatory actions and to \nensure that any constitutional uncertainties with regard to the \nlegislation are resolved as quickly as possible. Specifically, it \nprovides that any action challenging the constitutionality of any \nprovision of the act must be brought in the United States District \nCourt for the District of Columbia. The bill also authorizes direct \nappeal to the Supreme Court on an expedited basis. An action under this \nsection is to be filed within 60 days after the date of enactment or 60 \ndays after the final action of the administrator or the commission \ngiving rise to the action, whichever is later. The district court and \nSupreme Court are required to expedite to the greatest possible extent \nthe disposition of the action and appeal.\n  Claimants also expressed the need for assurances that the \nmanufacturers payment into the fund. Therefore, the legislation I am \nintroducing also requires enhanced ``transparency'' of the payments by \nthe defendants and insurers into the fund. The proposal provides that \n20 days after the end of such 60-day period, the administrator shall \npublish in the Federal Register a list of such submissions, including \nthe name of such persons or ultimate parents and the likely tier to \nwhich such persons or affiliated groups may be assigned. After \npublication of such list, any person may submit to the administrator \ninformation on the identity of any other person that may have \nobligations under the fund. In addition, there are enhanced notice and \ndisclosure requirements included in the draft. It also provides that \nwithin 60 days after the date of enactment, any person who, acting in \ngood faith, has knowledge that such person or such person's affiliated \ngroup would result in placement in the top tiers, shall submit to the \nadministrator, 1, either the name of such person or such person's \nultimate parent; and, 2, the likely tier to which such person or \naffiliated group may be assigned under this act.\n  As I have mentioned previously, this legislation deals with a number \nof very complex issues, one of them being that of ``mixed-dust.'' I \nheld a hearing in the Judiciary Committee in this issue on Feb. 2, \n2005. The manufacturers fear that many asbestos claims will be \n``repackaged'' as silica claims in the tort\n\n[[Page S1013]]\n\nsystem. Evidence deduced at the hearing reflects that this has been \nhappening in a large number of jurisdictions. If a claim is due to \nasbestos exposure at all, the program should be the exclusive means of \ncompensation. The stakeholders agree that this is an asbestos bill, \ndesigned to dispose of all asbestos claims but that workers with \ngenuine silica exposure disease ought to be able to pursue their claims \nin the tort system. The problem is that with those claims where the \npoint of demarcation is unclear. Silica/asbestos defendants are worried \nthat they will find themselves in court with the burden of proving that \nthe plaintiff's injury is due to asbestos rather than silica. This \nlegislation makes clear that pure silica claims are not preempted, but \nclaims involving asbestos disease are preempted. A claimant must \nestablish by a preponderance of evidence that their functional \nimpairment was caused by exposure to silica, and asbestos exposure was \nnot a significant contributing factor. Although this does impose the \nburden on the claimant, this is no different than the burden the \nplaintiff or any party advancing a position has in producing medical \nevidence in any case that the physician will state that a disease was \ncaused by some condition or exposure or that it was not caused by some \ncondition or exposure.\n\n  Another very complicated issue I have addressed in my legislation, at \nthe request of the claimants, is that of providing for award \nadjustments for exceptional mesothelioma cases based on age and the \nnumber of dependents of the claimant. For example, a mesothelioma \nvictim who is 40 years old with two kids will be able to get an upwards \nadjustment in his award amount as compared to a 80-year-old \nmesothelioma victim with no dependents. The impact of such adjustments \nto the fund will remain revenue-neutral.\n  What I have introduced is a complicated bill, but one that is both \nintegrated and comprehensive and reflective of a remarkable will to \nenact legislation. If this bill is rejected, I do not see the agenda of \nthis Senate Judiciary Committee revisiting the issue because of other \nbusiness and the futility in doing so. I cannot conceive of more \nstrenuous effort being directed to this subject that has been done in \nthe past 2 years. This is the last best chance.\n  I remain confident that we can forge and enact a bill that is fair to \nthe claimants and to business and that will put an end once and for all \nto this nightmare chapter in American legal, economic and social \nhistory. If we can summon the legislative will in a bipartisan spirit, \nit can be done.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a 291-page discussion \ndraft.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S.   \n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Millions of Americans have been exposed to forms of \n     asbestos that can have devastating health effects.\n       (2) Various injuries can be caused by exposure to some \n     forms of asbestos, including pleural disease and some forms \n     of cancer.\n       (3) The injuries caused by asbestos can have latency \n     periods of up to 40 years, and even limited exposure to some \n     forms of asbestos may result in injury in some cases.\n       (4) Asbestos litigation has had a significant detrimental \n     effect on the country's economy, driving companies into \n     bankruptcy, diverting resources from those who are truly \n     sick, and endangering jobs and pensions.\n       (5) The scope of the asbestos litigation crisis cuts across \n     every State and virtually every industry.\n       (6) The United States Supreme Court has recognized that \n     Congress must act to create a more rational asbestos claims \n     system. In 1991, a Judicial Conference Ad Hoc Committee on \n     Asbestos Litigation, appointed by Chief Justice William \n     Rehnquist, found that the ``ultimate solution should be \n     legislation recognizing the national proportions of the \n     problem . . . and creating a national asbestos dispute \n     resolution scheme . . .''. The Court found in 1997 in Amchem \n     Products Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 595 (1997), that \n     ``[t]he argument is sensibly made that a nationwide \n     administrative claims processing regime would provide the \n     most secure, fair, and efficient means of compensating \n     victims of asbestos exposure.'' In 1999, the Court in Ortiz \n     v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 819, 821 (1999), found that the \n     ``elephantine mass of asbestos cases . . . defies customary \n     judicial administration and calls for national legislation.'' \n     That finding was again recognized in 2003 by the Court in \n     Norfolk & Western Railway Co. v. Ayers, 123 S. Ct. 1210 \n     (2003).\n       (7) This crisis, and its significant effect on the health \n     and welfare of the people of the United States, on interstate \n     and foreign commerce, and on the bankruptcy system, compels \n     Congress to exercise its power to regulate interstate \n     commerce and create this legislative solution in the form of \n     a national asbestos injury claims resolution program to \n     supersede all existing methods to compensate those injured by \n     asbestos, except as specified in this Act.\n       (8) This crisis has also imposed a deleterious burden upon \n     the United States bankruptcy courts, which have assumed a \n     heavy burden of administering complicated and protracted \n     bankruptcies with limited personnel.\n       (9) This crisis has devastated many communities across the \n     country, but hardest hit has been Libby, Montana, where \n     tremolite asbestos, 1 of the most deadly forms of asbestos, \n     was contained in the vermiculite ore mined from the area and \n     despite ongoing cleanup by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, many still suffer from the deadly dust.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to--\n\n[[Page S1014]]\n\n       (1) create a privately funded, publicly administered fund \n     to provide the necessary resources for a fair and efficient \n     system to resolve asbestos injury claims that will provide \n     compensation for legitimate present and future claimants of \n     asbestos exposure as provided in this Act;\n       (2) provide compensation to those present and future \n     victims based on the severity of their injuries, while \n     establishing a system flexible enough to accommodate \n     individuals whose conditions worsens;\n       (3) relieve the Federal and State courts of the burden of \n     the asbestos litigation; and\n       (4) increase economic stability by resolving the asbestos \n     litigation crisis that has bankrupted companies with asbestos \n     liability, diverted resources from the truly sick, and \n     endangered jobs and pensions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Any otherwise \n     applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled beginning \n     on the date the claim was filed and ending on the date the \n     claim is dismissed under this subparagraph.\n       (D) State venue requirements.--Nothing in this paragraph \n     shall preempt or supersede any State's law relating to venue \n     requirements within that State which are more restrictive.\n       (E) Credit of claim and effect of operational fund.--If an \n     asbestos claim is pursued in Federal or State court in \n     accordance with this paragraph, any recovery by the claimant \n     shall be a collateral source compensation for purposes of \n     section 134. If the Administrator subsequently certifies to \n     Congress that the Fund has become operational and the \n     procedures are in place to review and pay asbestos claims at \n     a reasonable rate, any claim in a civil action in Federal or \n     State court that is not actually on trial before a jury which \n     has been impaneled and presentation of evidence has \n     commenced, but before its deliberation, or before a judge and \n     is at the presentation of evidence, shall be deemed a \n     reinstated claim against the Fund and the civil action before \n     the Federal or State court shall be null and void.\n       (3) Pursual of asbestos claims in federal or state court.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, if, not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator cannot certify to \n     Congress that the Fund is operational and paying all valid \n     claims at a reasonable rate, any person with an asbestos \n     claim stayed under paragraph (1), or with an asbestos claim \n     arising after the date of enactment of this Act, may pursue \n     that claim in the Federal district court or State court \n     located within--\n       (i) the State of residence of the claimant; or\n       (ii) the State in which the asbestos exposure arose.\n       (B) Defendants not found.--If any defendant cannot be found \n     in the State described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph \n     (A), the claim may be pursued in the Federal district court \n     or State court located within any State in which the \n     defendant may be found.\n       (C) Determination of most appropriate forum.--If a person \n     alleges that the asbestos exposure occurred in more than 1 \n     county (or Federal district), the trial court shall determine \n     which State and county (or Federal district) is the most \n     appropriate forum for the claim. If the court determines that \n     another forum would be the most appropriate forum for a \n     claim, the court shall dismiss the claim. Any otherwise \n     applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled beginning \n     on the date the claim was filed and ending on the date the \n     claim is dismissed under this subparagraph.\n       (D) State venue requirements.--Nothing in this paragraph \n     shall preempt or supersede any State's law relating to venue \n     requirements within that State which are more restrictive.\n       (E) Credit of claim and effect of operational fund.--If an \n     asbestos claim is pursued in Federal or State court in \n     accordance with this paragraph, any recovery by the claimant \n     shall be a collateral source compensation for purposes of \n     section 134. If the Administrator subsequently certifies to \n     Congress that the Fund has become operational and the \n     procedures are in place to review and pay asbestos claims at \n     a reasonable rate, any claim in a civil action in Federal or \n     State court that is not actually on trial before a jury which \n     has been impaneled and presentation of evidence has \n     commenced, but before its deliberation, or before a judge and \n     is at the presentation of evidence, shall be deemed a \n     reinstated claim against the Fund and the civil action before \n     the Federal or State court shall be null and void.\n       (4) Sunset.--This subsection shall have no effect after the \n     date the Administrator certifies to Congress that the Fund is \n     operational and paying claims at a reasonable rate, except \n     that any case that has been filed or revived pursuant to this \n     subsection in a Federal or State court may, at the option of \n     the claimant, remain in that court.\n\n     SEC. 107.

GENERAL RULE CONCERNING NO-FAULT COMPENSATION.\n\n       An asbestos claimant shall not be required to demonstrate \n     that the asbestos-related injury for which the claim is being \n     made resulted from the negligence or other fault of any other \n     person.\n\n     SEC. 113. FILING OF CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) Who May Submit.--\n       (1) In general.--Any individual who has suffered from a \n     disease or condition that is believed to meet the \n     requirements established under subtitle C (or the personal \n     representative of the individual, if the individual is \n     deceased or incompetent) may file a claim with the Office for \n     an award with respect to such injury.\n       (2) Definition.--In this Act, the term ``personal \n     representative'' shall have the same meaning as that term is \n     defined in section 104.4 of title 28 of the Code of Federal \n     Regulations, as in effect on December 31, 2004.\n       (3) Limitation.--A claim may not be filed by any person \n     seeking contribution or indemnity.\n       (b) Statute of Limitations.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as otherwise provided in this \n     subsection, if an individual fails to file a claim with the \n     Office under this section within 4 years after the date on \n     which the individual first--\n       (A) received a medical diagnosis of an eligible disease or \n     condition as provided for under this subtitle and subtitle C; \n     or\n       (B) discovered facts that would have led a reasonable \n     person to obtain a medical diagnosis with respect to an \n     eligible disease or condition,\n     any claim relating to that injury, and any other asbestos \n     claim related to that injury, shall be extinguished, and any \n     recovery thereon shall be prohibited.\n       (2) Exception.--The statute of limitations in paragraph (1) \n     does not apply to the progression of non-malignant diseases \n     once the initial claim has been filed.\n       (3) Effect on pending claims.--\n       (A) In general.--If, on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     an asbestos claimant has any timely filed asbestos claim that \n     is pending--\n       (i) in a Federal or State court and for which a verdict or \n     final order or final judgment has not been entered by a court \n     before such date; or\n       (ii) with a trust established under title 11, United States \n     Code,\n     such claimant shall file a claim under this section within 4 \n     years after such date of enactment, or any claim relating to \n     that injury, and any other asbestos claim related to that \n     injury shall be extinguished, and recovery there shall be \n     prohibited.\n       (B) Special rule.--For purposes of this paragraph, a claim \n     shall not be treated as pending with a trust established \n     under title 11, United States Code, solely because a claimant \n     whose claim was previously compensated by the trust has or \n     alleges--\n       (i) a non-contingent right to the payment of future \n     installments of a fixed award; or\n       (ii) a contingent right to recover some additional amount \n     from the trust on the occurrence of a future event, such as \n     the reevaluation of the trust's funding adequacy or projected \n     claims experience.\n       (4) Effect of multiple injuries.--\n       (A) In general.--An asbestos claimant who receives an award \n     under this title for an eligible disease or condition, and \n     who subsequently develops another such injury, shall be \n     eligible for additional awards under this title (subject to \n     appropriate setoffs for such prior recovery of any award \n     under this title and from any other collateral source) and \n     the statute of limitations under paragraph (1) shall not \n     begin to run with respect to such subsequent injury until \n     such claimant obtains a medical diagnosis of such other \n     injury or discovers facts that would have led a reasonable \n     person to obtain such a diagnosis.\n       (B) Setoffs.--Except as provided in subparagraph (C), any \n     amounts paid or to be paid for a prior award under this Act \n     shall be deducted as a setoff against amounts payable for the \n     second injury claim.\n       (C) Exception.--Any amounts paid or to be paid for a prior \n     claim for a non-malignant disease (Levels I through V) filed \n     against the Fund shall not be deducted as a setoff against \n     amounts payable for the second injury claim for a malignant \n     disease (Levels VI through X), unless the malignancy was \n     diagnosed, or the asbestos claimant had discovered facts that \n     would have led a reasonable person to obtain such a \n     diagnosis, before the date on which the non-malignancy claim \n     was compensated.\n       (c) Required Information.--A claim filed under subsection \n     (a) shall be in such form, and contain such information in \n     such detail, as the Administrator shall by regulation \n     prescribe. At a minimum, a claim shall include--\n       (1) the name, social security number, gender, date of \n     birth, and, if applicable, date of death of the claimant;\n       (2) information relating to the identity of dependents and \n     beneficiaries of the claimant;\n       (3) a complete employment history of the claimant, \n     accompanied by social security records or a signed release \n     permitting access to such records;\n       (4) a description of the asbestos exposure of the claimant, \n     including, to the extent known, information on the site, or \n     location\n\n[[Page S1018]]\n\n     of exposure, and duration and intensity of exposure;\n       (5) a description of the tobacco product use history of the \n     claimant, including frequency and duration;\n       (6) an identification and description of the asbestos-\n     related diseases or conditions of the claimant, accompanied \n     by a written report by the claimant's physician with medical \n     diagnoses and x-ray films, and other test results necessary \n     to establish eligibility for an award under this Act;\n       (7) a description of any prior or pending civil action or \n     other claim, including any claim under a workers' \n     compensation law, brought by the claimant for asbestos-\n     related injury or any other pulmonary, parenchymal, or \n     pleural injury, including an identification of any recovery \n     of compensation or damages through settlement, judgment, or \n     otherwise;\n       (8) for any claimant who has made a claim for asbestos-\n     related injury or any other pulmonary, parenchymal, or \n     pleural injury under a workers' compensation law, a \n     certification that the claimant has notified the workers' \n     compensation insurer or self-insured employer of the claim \n     made under this Act; and\n       (9) for any claimant who asserts that he or she is a \n     nonsmoker or an ex-smoker, as defined in section 131, for \n     purposes of an award under Malignant Level VI, Malignant \n     Level VII, Malignant Level VIII, or Malignant Level IX, \n     evidence to support the assertion of nonsmoking or ex-\n     smoking, including relevant medical records.\n       (d) Date of Filing.--A claim shall be considered to be \n     filed on the date that the claimant mails the claim to the \n     Office, as determined by postmark, or on the date that the \n     claim is received by the Office, whichever is the earliest \n     determinable date.\n       (e) Incomplete Claims.--If a claim filed under subsection \n     (a) is incomplete, the Administrator shall notify the \n     claimant of the information necessary to complete the claim \n     and inform the claimant of such services as may be available \n     through the Claimant Assistance Program established under \n     section 104 to assist the claimant in completing the claim. \n     Any time periods for the processing of the claim shall be \n     suspended until such time as the claimant submits the \n     information necessary to complete the claim. If such \n     information is not received within 1 year after the date of \n     such notification, the claim shall be dismissed.\n\n     SEC. 114. ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS AND CLAIM AWARDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Review of claims.--The Administrator shall, in \n     accordance with this section, determine whether each claim \n     filed under this Act satisfies the requirements for \n     eligibility for an award under this Act and, if so, the value \n     of the award. In making such determinations, the \n     Administrator shall consider the claim presented by the \n     claimant, the factual and medical evidence submitted by the \n     claimant in support of the claim, the medical determinations \n     of any Physicians Panel to which a claim is referred under \n     section 121, and the results of such investigation as the \n     Administrator may deem necessary to determine whether the \n     claim satisfies the criteria for eligibility established by \n     this Act.\n       (2) Additional evidence.--The Administrator may request the \n     submission of medical evidence in addition to the minimum \n     requirements of section 113(c) if necessary or appropriate to \n     make a determination of eligibility for an award, in which \n     case the cost of obtaining such additional information or \n     testing shall be borne by the Office.\n       (b) Proposed Decisions.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     filing of a claim, the Administrator shall provide to the \n     claimant (and the claimant's representative) a proposed \n     decision accepting or rejecting the claim in whole or in part \n     and specifying the amount of the proposed award, if any. The \n     proposed decision shall be in writing, shall contain findings \n     of fact and conclusions of law, and shall contain an \n     explanation of the procedure for obtaining review of the \n     proposed decision.\n       (c) Review of Proposed Decisions.--\n       (1) Right to hearing.--\n       (A) In general.--Any claimant not satisfied with a proposed \n     decision of the Administrator under subsection (b) shall be \n     entitled, on written request made within 90 days after the \n     date of the issuance of the decision, to a hearing on the \n     claim of that claimant before a representative of the \n     Administrator. At the hearing, the claimant shall be entitled \n     to present oral evidence and written testimony in further \n     support of that claim.\n       (B) Conduct of hearing.--When practicable, the hearing will \n     be set at a time and place convenient for the claimant. In \n     conducting the hearing, the representative of the \n     Administrator shall not be bound by common law or statutory \n     rules of evidence, by technical or formal rules of procedure, \n     or by section 554 of title 5, United States Code, except as \n     provided by this Act, but shall conduct the hearing in such \n     manner as to best ascertain the rights of the claimant. For \n     this purpose, the representative shall receive such relevant \n     evidence as the claimant adduces and such other evidence as \n     the representative determines necessary or useful in \n     evaluating the claim.\n       (C) Request for subpoenas.--\n       (i) In general.--A claimant may request a subpoena but the \n     decision to grant or deny such a request is within the \n     discretion of the representative of the Administrator. The \n     representative may issue subpoenas for the attendance and \n     testimony of witnesses, and for the production of books, \n     records, correspondence, papers, or other relevant documents. \n     Subpoenas are issued for documents only if such documents are \n     relevant and cannot be obtained by other means, and for \n     witnesses only where oral testimony is the best way to \n     ascertain the facts.\n       (ii) Request.--A claimant may request a subpoena only as \n     part of the hearing process. To request a subpoena, the \n     requester shall--\n\n       (I) submit the request in writing and send it to the \n     representative as early as possible, but no later than 30 \n     days after the date of the original hearing request; and\n       (II) explain why the testimony or evidence is directly \n     relevant to the issues at hand, and a subpoena is the best \n     method or opportunity to obtain such evidence because there \n     are no other means by which the documents or testimony could \n     have been obtained.\n\n       (iii) Fees and mileage.--Any person required by such \n     subpoena to attend as a witness shall be allowed and paid the \n     same fees and mileage as are paid witnesses in the district \n     courts of the United States. Such fees and mileage shall be \n     paid from the Fund.\n       (2) Review of written record.--In lieu of a hearing under \n     paragraph (1), any claimant not satisfied with a proposed \n     decision of the Administrator shall have the option, on \n     written request made within 90 days after the date of the \n     issuance of the decision, of obtaining a review of the \n     written record by a representative of the Administrator. If \n     such review is requested, the claimant shall be afforded an \n     opportunity to submit any written evidence or argument which \n     he or she believes relevant.\n       (d) Final Decisions.--\n       (1) In general.--If the period of time for requesting \n     review of the proposed decision expires and no request has \n     been filed, or if the claimant waives any objections to the \n     proposed decision, the Administrator shall issue a final \n     decision. If such decision materially differs from the \n     proposed decision, the claimant shall be entitled to review \n     of the decision under subsection (c).\n       (2) Time and content.--If the claimant requests review of \n     all or part of the proposed decision the Administrator shall \n     issue a final decision on the claim not later than 180 days \n     after the request for review is received, if the claimant \n     requests a hearing, or not later than 90 days after the \n     request for review is received, if the claimant requests \n     review of the written record. Such decision shall be in \n     writing and contain findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n       (e) Representation.--A claimant may authorize an attorney \n     or other individual to represent him or her in any proceeding \n     under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 115. MEDICAL EVIDENCE AUDITING PROCEDURES.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Development.--The Administrator shall develop methods \n     for auditing and evaluating the medical evidence submitted as \n     part of a claim. The Administrator may develop additional \n     methods for auditing and evaluating other types of evidence \n     or information received by the Administrator.\n       (2) Refusal to consider certain evidence.--\n       (A) In general.--If the Administrator determines that an \n     audit conducted in accordance with the methods developed \n     under paragraph (1) demonstrates that the medical evidence \n     submitted by a specific physician or medical facility is not \n     consistent with prevailing medical practices or the \n     applicable requirements of this Act, any medical evidence \n     from such physician or facility shall be unacceptable for \n     purposes of establishing eligibility for an award under this \n     Act.\n       (B) Notification.--Upon a determination by the \n     Administrator under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall \n     notify the physician or medical facility involved of the \n     results of the audit.

The \n     Administrator may determine whether to grant an adjustment \n     and the size of any such adjustment, in accordance with this \n     subsection. A defendant participant has a right to obtain a \n     rehearing of the Administrator's determination under this \n     subsection under the procedures prescribed in subsection \n     (i)(10). The Administrator may adjust a defendant \n     participant's payment obligations under this subsection, \n     either by forgiving the relevant portion of the otherwise \n     applicable payment obligation or by providing relevant \n     rebates from the defendant hardship and inequity adjustment \n     account created under subsection (j) after payment of the \n     otherwise applicable payment obligation, at the discretion of \n     the Administrator.\n       (2) Financial hardship adjustments.--\n       (A) In general.--A defendant participant may apply for an \n     adjustment based on financial hardship at any time during the \n     period in which a payment obligation to the Fund remains \n     outstanding and may qualify for such adjustment by \n     demonstrating that the amount of its payment obligation under \n     the statutory allocation would constitute a severe financial \n     hardship.\n       (B) Term.--Subject to the annual availability of funds in \n     the defendant hardship and inequity adjustment account \n     established under subsection (j), a financial hardship \n     adjustment under this subsection shall have a term of 3 \n     years.\n       (C) Renewal.--After an initial hardship adjustment is \n     granted under this paragraph, a defendant participant may \n     renew its hardship adjustment by demonstrating that it \n     remains justified.\n       (D) Reinstatement.--Following the expiration of the \n     hardship adjustment period provided for under this section \n     and during the funding period prescribed under subsection \n     (a), the Administrator shall annually determine whether there \n     has been a material change in the financial condition of the \n     defendant participant such that the Administrator may, \n     consistent with the policies and legislative intent \n     underlying this Act, reinstate under terms and conditions \n     established by the Administrator any part or all of the \n     defendant participant's payment obligation under the \n     statutory allocation that was not paid during the hardship \n     adjustment term.\n       (3) Inequity adjustments.--\n       (A) In general.--A defendant participant--\n       (i) may qualify for an adjustment based on inequity by \n     demonstrating that the amount\n\n[[Page S1026]]\n\n     of its payment obligation under the statutory allocation is \n     exceptionally inequitable--\n\n       (I) when measured against the amount of the likely cost to \n     the defendant participant net of insurance of its future \n     liability in the tort system in the absence of the Fund;\n       (II) when compared to the median payment rate for all \n     defendant participants in the same tier; or\n       (III) when measured against the percentage of the prior \n     asbestos expenditures of the defendant that were incurred \n     with respect to claims that neither resulted in an adverse \n     judgment against the defendant, nor were the subject of a \n     settlement that required a payment to a plaintiff by or on \n     behalf of that defendant; and\n\n       (ii) shall qualify for a two-tier main tier and a two-tier \n     subtier adjustment reducing the defendant participant's \n     payment obligation based on inequity by demonstrating that \n     not less than 95 percent of such person's prior asbestos \n     expenditures arose from claims related to the manufacture and \n     sale of railroad locomotives and related products, so long as \n     such person's manufacture and sale of railroad locomotives \n     and related products is temporally and causally remote. For \n     purposes of this clause, a person's manufacture and sale of \n     railroad locomotives and related products shall be deemed to \n     be temporally and causally remote if the asbestos claims \n     historically and generally filed against such person relate \n     to the manufacture and sale of railroad locomotives and \n     related products by an entity dissolved more than 25 years \n     before the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (B) Payment rate.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the \n     payment rate of a defendant participant is the payment amount \n     of the defendant participant as a percentage of such \n     defendant participant's gross revenues for the year ending \n     December 31, 2002.\n       (C) Term.--Subject to the annual availability of funds in \n     the defendant hardship and inequity adjustment account \n     established under subsection (j), an inequity adjustment \n     under this subsection shall have a term of 3 years.\n       (D) Renewal.--A defendant participant may renew an inequity \n     adjustment every 3 years by demonstrating that the adjustment \n     remains justified.\n       (E) Reinstatement.--\n       (i) In general.--Following the termination of an inequity \n     adjustment under subparagraph (A), and during the funding \n     period prescribed under subsection (a), the Administrator \n     shall annually determine whether there has been a material \n     change in conditions which would support a finding that the \n     amount of the defendant participant's payment under the \n     statutory allocation was not inequitable. Based on this \n     determination, the Administrator may, consistent with the \n     policies and legislative intent underlying this Act, \n     reinstate any or all of the payment obligations of the \n     defendant participant as if the inequity adjustment had not \n     been granted for that 3-year period.\n       (ii) Terms and conditions.--In the event of a reinstatement \n     under clause (i), the Administrator may require the defendant \n     participant to pay any part or all of amounts not paid due to \n     the inequity adjustment on such terms and conditions as \n     established by the Administrator.\n       (4) Limitation on adjustments.--The aggregate total of \n     financial hardship adjustments under paragraph (2) and \n     inequity adjustments under paragraph (3) in effect in any \n     given year shall not exceed $300,000,000, except to the \n     extent additional monies are available for such adjustments \n     as a result of carryover of prior years' funds under \n     subsection (j)(3) or as a result of monies being made \n     available in that year under subsection (k)(1)(A).\n       (5) Advisory panels.--\n       (A) Appointment.--The Administrator shall appoint a \n     Financial Hardship Adjustment Panel and an Inequity \n     Adjustment Panel to advise the Administrator in carrying out \n     this subsection.\n       (B) Membership.--The membership of the panels appointed \n     under subparagraph (A) may overlap.\n       (C) Coordination.--The panels appointed under subparagraph \n     (A) shall coordinate their deliberations and advice.\n       (e) Limitation on Liability.--The liability of each \n     defendant participant to pay to the Fund shall be limited to \n     the payment obligations under this Act, and, except as \n     provided in subsection (f) and section 203(b)(2)(D), no \n     defendant participant shall have any liability for the \n     payment obligations of any other defendant participant.\n       (f) Consolidation of Payments.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of determining the payment \n     levels of defendant participants, any affiliated group \n     including 1 or more defendant participants may irrevocably \n     elect, as part of the submissions to be made under paragraphs \n     (1) and (3) of subsection (i), to report on a consolidated \n     basis all of the information necessary to determine the \n     payment level under this subtitle and pay to the Fund on a \n     consolidated basis.\n       (2) Election.--If an affiliated group elects consolidation \n     as provided in this subsection--\n       (A) for purposes of this Act other than this subsection, \n     the affiliated group shall be treated as if it were a single \n     participant, including with respect to the assessment of a \n     single annual payment under this subtitle for the entire \n     affiliated group;\n       (B) the ultimate parent of the affiliated group shall \n     prepare and submit each submission to be made under \n     subsection (i) on behalf of the entire affiliated group and \n     shall be solely liable, as between the Administrator and the \n     affiliated group only, for the payment of the annual amount \n     due from the affiliated group under this subtitle, except \n     that, if the ultimate parent does not pay when due any \n     payment obligation for the affiliated group, the \n     Administrator shall have the right to seek payment of all or \n     any portion of the entire amount due (as well as any other \n     amount for which the affiliated group may be liable under \n     sections 223 and 224) from any member of the affiliated \n     group;\n       (C) all members of the affiliated group shall be identified \n     in the submission under subsection (i) and shall certify \n     compliance with this subsection and the Administrator's \n     regulations implementing this subsection; and\n       (D) the obligations under this subtitle shall not change \n     even if, after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     beneficial ownership interest between any members of the \n     affiliated group shall change.\n       (3) Cause of action.--Notwithstanding section 221(e), this \n     Act shall not preclude actions among persons within an \n     affiliated group with respect to the payment obligations \n     under this Act.\n       (g) Determination of Prior Asbestos Expenditures.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of determining a defendant \n     participant's prior asbestos expenditures, the Administrator \n     shall prescribe such rules as may be necessary or appropriate \n     to assure that payments by indemnitors before December 31, \n     2002, shall be counted as part of the indemnitor's prior \n     asbestos expenditures, rather than the indemnitee's prior \n     asbestos expenditures, in accordance with this subsection.\n       (2) Indemnifiable costs.--If an indemnitor has paid or \n     reimbursed to an indemnitee any indemnifiable cost or \n     otherwise made a payment on behalf of or for the benefit of \n     an indemnitee to a third party for an indemnifiable cost \n     before December 31, 2002, the amount of such indemnifiable \n     cost shall be solely for the account of the indemnitor for \n     purposes under this Act.\n       (3) Insurance payments.--When computing the prior asbestos \n     expenditures with respect to an asbestos claim, any amount \n     paid or reimbursed by insurance shall be solely for the \n     account of the indemnitor, even if the indemnitor would have \n     no direct right to the benefit of the insurance, if--\n       (A) such insurance has been paid or reimbursed to the \n     indemnitor or the indemnitee, or paid on behalf of or for the \n     benefit of the indemnitee; and\n       (B) the indemnitor has either, with respect to such \n     asbestos claim or any similar asbestos claim, paid or \n     reimbursed to its indemnitee any indemnifiable cost or paid \n     to any third party on behalf of or for the benefit of the \n     indemnitee any indemnifiable cost.\n       (4) Treatment of certain expenditures.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of this Act, where--\n       (A) an indemnitor entered into a stock purchase agreement \n     in 1988 that involved the sale of the stock of businesses \n     that produced friction and other products;

Any such surcharge shall be \n     imposed on a pro rata basis, in accordance with each \n     defendant participant's relative annual liability under \n     sections 202 and 203 (as modified by subsections (b), (d), \n     (f), and (g) of this section).\n       (2) Certification.--\n       (A) In general.--Before imposing a guaranteed payment \n     surcharge under this subsection, the Administrator shall \n     certify that he or she has used all reasonable efforts to \n     collect mandatory payments for all defendant participants, \n     including by using the authority in subsection (i)(9) of this \n     section and section 223.\n       (B) Notice and comment.--Before making a final \n     certification under subparagraph (C), the Administrator shall \n     publish a notice in the Federal Register of a proposed \n     certification and provide in such notice for a public comment \n     period of 30 days.\n       (C) Final certification.--\n       (i) In general.--The Administrator shall publish a notice \n     of the final certification in the Federal Register after \n     consideration of all comments submitted under subparagraph \n     (B).\n       (ii) Written notice.--Not later than 30 days after \n     publishing any final certification under clause (i), the \n     Administrator shall provide each defendant participant with \n     written notice of that defendant participant's payment, \n     including the amount of any surcharge.\n\n     SEC. 205.

DUTIES OF ASBESTOS INSURERS COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Determination of Insurer Payment Obligations.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Definitions.--For the purposes of this Act, the terms \n     ``insurer'' and ``insurer participant'' shall, unless stated \n     otherwise, include direct insurers and reinsurers, as well as \n     any run-off entity established, in whole or in part, to \n     review and pay asbestos claims.\n       (B) Procedures for determining insurer payments.--The \n     Commission shall determine the amount that each insurer \n     participant shall be required to pay into the Fund under the \n     procedures described in this section. The Commission shall \n     make this determination by first promulgating a rule \n     establishing a methodology for allocation of payments among \n     insurer participants and then applying such methodology to \n     determine the individual payment for each insurer \n     participant. The methodology may include 1 or more allocation \n     formulas to be applied to all insurer participants or groups \n     of similarly situated participants. The Commission's rule \n     shall include a methodology for adjusting payments by insurer \n     participants to make up, during\n\n[[Page S1029]]\n\n     any applicable payment year, any amount by which aggregate \n     insurer payments fall below the level required in paragraph \n     (3)(C). The Commission shall conduct a thorough study (within \n     the time limitations under this subparagraph) of the accuracy \n     of the reserve allocation of each insurer participant, and \n     may request information from the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission or any State regulatory agency. Under this \n     procedure, not later than 120 days after the initial meeting \n     of the Commission, the Commission shall commence a rulemaking \n     proceeding under section 213(a) to propose and adopt a \n     methodology for allocating payments among insurer \n     participants. In proposing an allocation methodology, the \n     Commission may consult with such actuaries and other experts \n     as it deems appropriate. After hearings and public comment on \n     the proposed allocation methodology, the Commission shall as \n     promptly as possible promulgate a final rule establishing \n     such methodology. After promulgation of the final rule, the \n     Commission shall determine the individual payment of each \n     insurer participant under the procedures set forth in \n     subsection (b).\n       (C) Scope.--Every insurer, reinsurer, and runoff entity \n     with asbestos-related obligations in the United States shall \n     be subject to the Commission's and Administrator's authority \n     under this Act, including allocation determinations, and \n     shall be required to fulfill its payment obligation without \n     regard as to whether it is licensed in the United States. \n     Every insurer participant not licensed or domiciled in the \n     United States shall, upon the first payment to the Fund, \n     submit a written consent to the Commission's and \n     Administrator's authority under this Act, and to the \n     jurisdiction of the courts of the United States for purposes \n     of enforcing this Act, in a form determined by the \n     Administrator. Any insurer participant refusing to provide a \n     written consent shall be subject to fines and penalties as \n     provided in section 223.\n       (2) Amount of payments.--\n       (A) Aggregate payment obligation.--The total payment \n     required of all insurer participants over the life of the \n     Fund shall be equal to $46,025,000,000.\n       (B) Accounting standards.--In determining the payment \n     obligations of participants that are not licensed or \n     domiciled in the United States or that are runoff entities, \n     the Commission shall use accounting standards required for \n     United States licensed direct insurers.\n       (C) Captive insurance companies.--No payment to the Fund \n     shall be required from a captive insurance company, unless \n     and only to the extent a captive insurance company, on the \n     date of enactment of this Act, has liability, directly or \n     indirectly, for any asbestos claim of a person or persons \n     other than and unaffiliated with its ultimate parent or \n     affiliated group or pool in which the ultimate parent \n     participates or participated, or unaffiliated with a person \n     that was its ultimate parent or a member of its affiliated \n     group or pool at the time the relevant insurance or \n     reinsurance was issued by the captive insurance company.\n       (D) Several liability.--Unless otherwise provided under \n     this Act, each insurer participant's obligation to make \n     payments to the Fund is several. Unless otherwise provided \n     under this Act, there is no joint liability, and the future \n     insolvency by any insurer participant shall not affect the \n     payment required of any other insurer participant.\n       (3) Payment of criteria.--\n       (A) Inclusion in insurer participant category.--\n       (i) In general.--Insurers that have paid, or been assessed \n     by a legal judgment or settlement, at least $1,000,000 in \n     defense and indemnity costs before the date of enactment of \n     this Act in response to claims for compensation for asbestos \n     injuries arising from a policy of liability insurance or \n     contract of liability reinsurance or retrocessional \n     reinsurance shall be insurer participants in the Fund. Other \n     insurers shall be exempt from mandatory payments.\n       (ii) Inapplicability of section 202.--Since insurers may be \n     subject in certain jurisdictions to direct action suits, and \n     it is not the intent of this Act to impose upon an insurer, \n     due to its operation as an insurer, payment obligations to \n     the Fund in situations where the insurer is the subject of a \n     direct action, no insurer subject to mandatory payments \n     pursuant to section 212 shall also be liable for payments to \n     the Fund as a defendant participant pursuant to section 202.\n       (B) Insurer participant allocation methodology.--\n       (i) In general.--The Commission shall establish the payment \n     obligations of individual insurer participants to reflect, on \n     an equitable basis, the relative tort system liability of the \n     participating insurers in the absence of this Act, \n     considering and weighting, as appropriate (but exclusive of \n     workers' compensation), such factors as--\n\n       (I) historic premium for lines of insurance associated with \n     asbestos exposure over relevant periods of time;\n       (II) recent loss experience for asbestos liability;\n       (III) amounts reserved for asbestos liability;\n       (IV) the likely cost to each insurer participant of its \n     future liabilities under applicable insurance policies; and\n       (V) any other factor the Commission may determine is \n     relevant and appropriate.\n\n       (ii) Determination of reserves.--The Commission may \n     establish procedures and standards for determination of the \n     asbestos reserves of insurer participants. The reserves of a \n     United States licensed reinsurer that is wholly owned by, or \n     under common control of, a United States licensed direct \n     insurer shall be included as part of the direct insurer's \n     reserves when the reinsurer's financial results are included \n     as part of the direct insurer's United States operations, as \n     reflected in footnote 33 of its filings with the National \n     Association of Insurance Commissioners or in published \n     financial statements prepared in accordance with generally \n     accepted accounting principles.\n       (C) Payment schedule.--The aggregate annual amount of \n     payments by insurer participants over the life of the Fund \n     shall be as follows:\n       (i) For years 1 and 2, $2,700,000,000 annually.\n       (ii) For years 3 through 5, $5,075,000,000.\n       (iii) For years 6 through 27, $1,147,000,000 annually.\n       (iv) For year 28, $166,000,000.\n       (D) Certain runoff entities.--\n       (i) In general.--Whenever the Commission requires payments \n     by a runoff entity that has assumed asbestos-related \n     liabilities from a Lloyd's syndicate or names that are \n     members of such a syndicate, the Commission shall not require \n     payments from such syndicates and names to the extent that \n     the runoff entity makes its required payments. In addition, \n     such syndicates and names shall be required to make payments \n     to the Fund in the amount of any adjustment granted to the \n     runoff entity for severe financial hardship or exceptional \n     circumstances.\n       (ii) Included runoff entities.--Subject to clause (i), a \n     runoff entity shall include any direct insurer or reinsurer \n     whose asbestos liability reserves have been transferred, \n     directly or indirectly, to the runoff entity and on whose \n     behalf the runoff entity handles or adjusts and, where \n     appropriate, pays asbestos claims.\n       (E) Financial hardship and exceptional circumstance \n     adjustments.--\n       (i) In general.--Under the procedures established in \n     subsection (b), an insurer participant may seek adjustment of \n     the amount of its payments based on exceptional circumstances \n     or severe financial hardship.\n       (ii) Financial adjustments.--An insurer participant may \n     qualify for an adjustment based on severe financial hardship \n     by demonstrating that payment of the amounts required by the \n     Commission's methodology would jeopardize the solvency of \n     such participant.\n       (iii) Exceptional circumstance adjustment.--An insurer \n     participant may qualify for an adjustment based on \n     exceptional circumstances by demonstrating--\n\n       (I) that the amount of its payments under the Commission's \n     allocation methodology is exceptionally inequitable when \n     measured against the amount of the likely cost to the \n     participant of its future liability in the tort system in the \n     absence of the Fund;\n       (II) an offset credit as described in subparagraphs (A) and \n     (C) of subsection (b)(4); or\n       (III) other exceptional circumstances.\n\n     The Commission may determine whether to grant an adjustment \n     and the size of any such adjustment, but adjustments shall \n     not reduce the aggregate payment obligations of insurer \n     participants specified in paragraph (2)(A) and (3)(C).\n       (iv) Time period of adjustment.--Except for adjustments for \n     offset credits, adjustments granted under this subsection \n     shall have a term not to exceed 3 years. An insurer \n     participant may renew its adjustment by demonstrating to the \n     Administrator that it remains justified.\n       (b) Procedure for Notifying Insurer Participants of \n     Individual Payment Obligations.--\n       (1) Notice to participants.--Not later than 30 days after \n     promulgation of the final rule establishing an allocation \n     methodology under subsection (a)(1), the Commission shall--\n       (A) directly notify all reasonably identifiable insurer \n     participants of the requirement to submit information \n     necessary to calculate the amount of any required payment to \n     the Fund under the allocation methodology; and\n       (B) publish in the Federal Register a notice--\n       (i) requiring any person who may be an insurer participant \n     (as determined by criteria outlined in the notice) to submit \n     such information; and\n       (ii) that includes a list of all insurer participants \n     notified by the Commission under subparagraph (A), and \n     provides for 30 days for the submission of comments or \n     information regarding the completeness and accuracy of the \n     list of identified insurer participants.\n       (2) Response required by individual insurer participants.--\n       (A) In general.--Any person who receives notice under \n     paragraph (1)(A), and any other person meeting the criteria \n     specified in the notice published under paragraph (1)(B), \n     shall respond by providing the Commission with all the \n     information requested in the notice under a schedule or by a \n     date established by the Commission.\n       (B) Certification.--The response submitted under \n     subparagraph (A) shall be signed by a responsible corporate \n     officer, general partner, proprietor, or individual of \n     similar authority, who shall certify under penalty of law the \n     completeness and accuracy of the information submitted.\n       (3) Notice to insurer participants of initial payment \n     determination.--\n       (A) In general.--\n\n[[Page S1030]]\n\n       (i) Notice to insurers.--Not later than 120 days after \n     receipt of the information required by paragraph (2), the \n     Commission shall send each insurer participant a notice of \n     initial determination requiring payments to the Fund, which \n     shall be based on the information received from the \n     participant in response to the Commission's request for \n     information. An insurer participant's payments shall be \n     payable over the schedule established in subsection \n     (a)(3)(C), in annual amounts proportionate to the aggregate \n     annual amount of payments for all insurer participants for \n     the applicable year.\n       (ii) Public notice.--Not later than 7 days after sending \n     the notification of initial determination to insurer \n     participants, the Commission shall publish in the Federal \n     Register a notice listing the insurer participants that have \n     been sent such notification, and the initial determination on \n     the payment obligation of each identified participant.\n       (B) No response; incomplete response.--If no response is \n     received from an insurer participant, or if the response is \n     incomplete, the initial determination requiring a payment \n     from the insurer participant shall be based on the best \n     information available to the Commission.\n       (4) Commission review, revision, and finalization of \n     initial payment determinations.--\n       (A) Comments from insurer participants.--Not later than 30 \n     days after receiving a notice of initial determination from \n     the Commission, an insurer participant may provide the \n     Commission with additional information to support adjustments \n     to the required payments to reflect severe financial hardship \n     or exceptional circumstances, including the provision of an \n     offset credit for an insurer participant for the amount of \n     any asbestos-related payments it made or was legally \n     obligated to make, including payments released from an \n     escrow, as the result of a bankruptcy judicially confirmed \n     after May 22, 2003, but before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (B) Additional participants.--If, before the final \n     determination of the Commission, the Commission receives \n     information that an additional person may qualify as an \n     insurer participant, the Commission shall require such person \n     to submit information necessary to determine whether payments \n     from that person should be required, in accordance with the \n     requirements of this subsection.\n       (C) Revision procedures.--The Commission shall adopt \n     procedures for revising initial payments based on information \n     received under subparagraphs (A) and (B), including a \n     provision requiring an offset credit for an insurer \n     participant for the amount of any asbestos-related payments \n     it made or was legally obligated to make, including payments \n     released from an escrow, as the result of a bankruptcy \n     confirmed after May 22, 2003, but before the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (5) Examinations and subpoenas.--\n       (A) Examinations.--The Commission may conduct examinations \n     of the books and records of insurer participants to determine \n     the completeness and accuracy of information submitted, or \n     required to be submitted, to the Commission for purposes of \n     determining participant payments.\n       (B) Subpoenas.--The Commission may request the Attorney \n     General to subpoena persons to compel testimony, records, and \n     other information relevant to its responsibilities under this \n     section. The Attorney General may enforce such subpoena in \n     appropriate proceedings in the United States district court \n     for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena was \n     addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.\n       (6) Escrow payments.--Without regard to an insurer \n     participant's payment obligation under this section, any \n     escrow or similar account established before the date of \n     enactment of this Act by an insurer participant in connection \n     with an asbestos trust fund that has not been judicially \n     confirmed by final order by the date of enactment of this Act \n     shall be the property of the insurer participant and returned \n     to that insurer participant.\n       (7) Notice to insurer participants of final payment \n     determinations.--Not later than 60 days after the notice of \n     initial determination is sent to the insurer participants, \n     the Commission shall send each insurer participant a notice \n     of final determination.\n       (c) Insurer Participants Voluntary Allocation Agreement.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the \n     Commission proposes its rule establishing an allocation \n     methodology under subsection (a)(1), direct insurer \n     participants licensed or domiciled in the United States, \n     other direct insurer participants, reinsurer participants \n     licensed or domiciled in the United States, or other \n     reinsurer participants, may submit an allocation agreement, \n     approved by all of the participants in the applicable group, \n     to the Commission.\n       (2) Allocation agreement.--To the extent the participants \n     in any such applicable group voluntarily agree upon an \n     allocation arrangement, any such allocation agreement shall \n     only govern the allocation of payments within that group and \n     shall not determine the aggregate amount due from that group.\n       (3) Certification.--The Commission shall determine whether \n     an allocation agreement submitted under subparagraph (A) \n     meets the requirements of this subtitle and, if so, shall \n     certify the agreement as establishing the allocation \n     methodology governing the individual payment obligations of \n     the participants who are parties to the agreement. The \n     authority of the Commission under this subtitle shall, with \n     respect to participants who are parties to a certified \n     allocation agreement, terminate on the day after the \n     Commission certifies such agreement. Under subsection (f), \n     the Administrator shall assume responsibility, if necessary, \n     for calculating the individual payment obligations of \n     participants who are parties to the certified agreement.\n       (d) Commission Report.--\n       (1) Recipients.--Until the work of the Commission has been \n     completed and the Commission terminated, the Commission shall \n     submit an annual report, containing the information described \n     under paragraph (2), to--\n       (A) the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate;\n       (B) the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (C) the Administrator.\n       (2) Contents.--The report under paragraph (1) shall state \n     the amount that each insurer participant is required to pay \n     to the Fund, including the payment schedule for such \n     payments.\n       (e) Interim Payments.--\n       (1) Authority of administrator.--During the period between \n     the date of enactment of this Act and the date when the \n     Commission issues its final determinations of payments, the \n     Administrator shall have the authority to require insurer \n     participants to make interim payments to the Fund to assure \n     adequate funding by insurer participants during such period.\n       (2) Amount of interim payments.--During any applicable \n     year, the Administrator may require insurer participants to \n     make aggregate interim payments not to exceed the annual \n     aggregate amount specified in subsection (a)(3)(C).\n       (3) Allocation of payments.--Interim payments shall be \n     allocated among individual insurer participants on an \n     equitable basis as determined by the Administrator. All \n     payments required under this subparagraph shall be credited \n     against the participant's ultimate payment obligation to the \n     Fund established by the Commission. If an interim payment \n     exceeds the ultimate payment, the Fund shall pay interest on \n     the amount of the overpayment at a rate determined by the \n     Administrator. If the ultimate payment exceeds the interim \n     payment, the participant shall pay interest on the amount of \n     the underpayment at the same rate. Any participant may seek \n     an exemption from or reduction in any payment required under \n     this subsection under the financial hardship and exceptional \n     circumstance standards established in subsection (a)(3)(D).\n       (4) Appeal of interim payment decisions.--A decision by the \n     Administrator to establish an interim payment obligation \n     shall be considered final agency action and reviewable under \n     section 303, except that the reviewing court may not stay an \n     interim payment during the pendency of the appeal.\n       (f) Transfer of Authority From the Commission to the \n     Administrator.--\n       (1) In general.--Upon termination of the Commission under \n     section 215, the Administrator shall assume all the \n     responsibilities and authority of the Commission, except that \n     the Administrator shall not have the power to modify the \n     allocation methodology established by the Commission or by \n     certified agreement or to promulgate a rule establishing any \n     such methodology.\n       (2) Financial hardship and exceptional circumstance \n     adjustments.--Upon termination of the Commission under \n     section 215, the Administrator shall have the authority, upon \n     application by any insurer participant, to make adjustments \n     to annual payments upon the same grounds as provided in \n     subsection (a)(3)(D). Adjustments granted under this \n     subsection shall have a term not to exceed 3 years. An \n     insurer participant may renew its adjustment by demonstrating \n     that it remains justified. Upon the grant of any adjustment, \n     the Administrator shall increase the payments required of all \n     other insurer participants so that there is no reduction in \n     the aggregate payment required of all insurer participants \n     for the applicable years. The increase in an insurer \n     participant's required payment shall be in proportion to such \n     participant's share of the aggregate payment obligation of \n     all insurer participants.\n       (3) Financial security requirements.--Whenever an insurer \n     participant's A.M. Best's claims payment rating or Standard \n     and Poor's financial strength rating falls below A-, and \n     until such time as either the insurer participant's A.M. \n     Best's Rating or Standard and Poor's rating is equal to or \n     greater than A-, the Administrator shall have the authority \n     to require that the participating insurer either--\n       (A) pay the present value of its remaining Fund payments at \n     a discount rate determined by the Administrator; or\n       (B) provide an evergreen letter of credit or financial \n     guarantee for future payments issued by an institution with \n     an A.M. Best's claims payment rating or Standard & Poor's \n     financial strength rating of at least A+.\n       (g) Judicial Review.--The Commission's rule establishing an \n     allocation methodology, its final determinations of payment \n     obligations and other final action shall be judicially \n     reviewable as provided in title III.\n\n     SEC. 213.

In pursuing an investment strategy under this \n     subparagraph, the Administrator shall consider, to the extent \n     relevant to an investment decision or action--\n       (A) the size of the Fund;\n       (B) the nature and estimated duration of the Fund;\n       (C) the liquidity and distribution requirements of the \n     Fund;\n       (D) general economic conditions at the time of the \n     investment;\n       (E) the possible effect of inflation or deflation on Fund \n     assets;\n       (F) the role that each investment or course of action plays \n     with respect to the overall assets of the Fund;\n       (G) the expected amount to be earned (including both income \n     and appreciation of capital) through investment of amounts in \n     the Fund; and\n       (H) the needs of asbestos claimants for current and future \n     distributions authorized under this Act.\n       (c) Mesothelioma Research and Treatment Centers.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall provide $1,000,000 \n     from the Fund for each of fiscal years 2005 through 2009 for \n     each of up to 10 mesothelioma disease research and treatment \n     centers.\n       (2) Requirements.--The Centers shall--\n       (A) be chosen by the Director of the National Institutes of \n     Health;\n       (B) be chosen through competitive peer review;\n       (C) be geographically distributed throughout the United \n     States with special consideration given to areas of high \n     incidence of mesothelioma disease;\n       (D) be closely associated with Department of Veterans \n     Affairs medical centers to provide research benefits and care \n     to veterans who have suffered excessively from mesothelioma;\n       (E) be engaged in research to provide mechanisms for \n     detection and prevention of mesothelioma, particularly in the \n     areas of pain management and cures;\n       (F) be engaged in public education about mesothelioma and \n     prevention, screening, and treatment;\n       (G) be participants in the National Mesothelioma Registry; \n     and\n       (H) be coordinated in their research and treatment efforts \n     with other Centers and institutions involved in exemplary \n     mesothelioma research.\n       (d) Bankruptcy Trust Guarantee.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, the Administrator shall have the authority to \n     impose a pro rata surcharge on all participants under this \n     subsection to ensure the liquidity of the Fund, if--\n       (A) the declared assets from 1 or more bankruptcy trusts \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated on or before July 31, 2004, are not \n     available to the Fund because a final judgment that has been \n     entered by a court and is no longer subject to any appeal or \n     review has enjoined the transfer of assets required under \n     section 524(j)(2) of title 11, United States Code (as amended \n     by section 402(f) of this Act); and\n       (B) borrowing is insufficient to assure the Fund's ability \n     to meet its obligations under this Act such that the required \n     borrowed amount is likely to increase the risk of termination \n     of this Act under section 405 based on reasonable claims \n     projections.\n       (2) Allocation.--Any surcharge imposed under this \n     subsection shall be imposed over a period of 5 years on a pro \n     rata basis upon all participants, in accordance with each \n     participant's relative annual liability under this subtitle \n     and subtitle B for those 5 years.\n       (3) Certification.--\n       (A) In general.--Before imposing a surcharge under this \n     subsection, the Administrator shall publish a notice in the \n     Federal Register and provide in such notice for a public \n     comment period of 30 days.\n       (B) Contents of notice.--The notice required under \n     subparagraph (A) shall include--\n       (i) information explaining the circumstances that make a \n     surcharge necessary and a certification that the requirements \n     under paragraph (1) are met;\n       (ii) the amount of the declared assets from any trust \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated on or before July 31, 2004, that \n     was not made, or is no longer, available to the Fund;\n       (iii) the total aggregate amount of the necessary \n     surcharge; and\n       (iv) the surcharge amount for each tier and subtier of \n     defendant participants and for each insurer participant.\n       (C) Final notice.--The Administrator shall publish a final \n     notice in the Federal Register and provide each participant \n     with written notice of that participant's schedule of \n     payments under this subsection. In no event shall any \n     required surcharge under this subsection be due before 60 \n     days after the Administrator publishes the final notice in \n     the Federal Register and provides each participant with \n     written notice of its schedule of payments.\n       (4) Maximum amount.--In no event shall the total aggregate \n     surcharge imposed by the Administrator exceed the lesser of--\n       (A) the total aggregate amount of the declared assets of \n     the trusts established under a plan of reorganization \n     confirmed and substantially consummated prior to July 31, \n     2004, that are no longer available to the Fund; or\n       (B) $4,000,000,000.\n       (5) Declared assets.--\n       (A) In general.--In this subsection, the term ``declared \n     assets'' means--\n       (i) the amount of assets transferred by any trust \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated on or before July 31, 2004, to the \n     Fund that is required to be returned to that trust under the \n     final judgment described in paragraph (1)(A); or\n       (ii) if no assets were transferred by the trust to the \n     Fund, the amount of assets the Administrator determines would \n     have been available for transfer to the Fund from that trust \n     under section 402(f).\n       (B) Determination.--In making a determination under \n     subparagraph (A)(ii), the Administrator may rely on any \n     information reasonably available, and may request, and use \n     subpoena authority of the Administrator if necessary to \n     obtain, relevant information from any such trust or its \n     trustees.\n       (e) Bankruptcy Trust Credits.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, but subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, \n     the Administrator shall provide a credit toward the aggregate \n     payment obligations under sections 202(a)(2) and 212(a)(2)(A) \n     for assets received by the Fund from any bankruptcy trust \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated after July 31, 2004.\n       (2) Allocation of credits.--The Administrator shall \n     allocate, for each such bankruptcy trust, the credits for \n     such assets between the defendant and insurer aggregate \n     payment obligations as follows:\n       (A) Defendant participants.--The aggregate amount that all \n     persons other than insurers contributing to the bankruptcy \n     trust would have been required to pay as Tier I defendants \n     under section 203(b) if the plan of reorganization under \n     which the bankruptcy trust was established had not been \n     confirmed and substantially consummated and the proceeding \n     under chapter 11 of title 11, United States Code, that \n     resulted in the establishment of the bankruptcy trust had \n     remained pending as of the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (B) Insurer participants.--The aggregate amount of all \n     credits to which insurers are entitled to under section \n     202(c)(4)(A) of the Act.\n\n     SEC. 223.

The positions taken or statements made by \n     the Administrator in any such proceeding shall not be binding \n     on or attributed to the insureds or cedents in any other \n     proceeding. The outcome of such a proceeding shall not have a \n     preclusive effect on the insureds or cedents in any other \n     proceeding and shall not be admissible against any subrogee \n     under this section. The Administrator shall have the \n     authority to settle or compromise any claims against a \n     nonpaying insurer participant under this subsection.\n       (e) Bar on United States Business.--If any direct insurer \n     or reinsurer refuses to furnish any information requested by \n     or to pay any contribution required by this Act, then, in \n     addition to any other penalties imposed by this Act, the \n     Administrator may issue an order barring such entity and its \n     affiliates from insuring risks located within the United \n     States or otherwise doing business within the United States. \n     Insurer participants or their affiliates seeking to obtain a \n     license from any State to write any type of insurance shall \n     be barred from obtaining any such license until payment of \n     all contributions required as of the date of license \n     application.\n       (f) Credit for Reinsurance.--If the Administrator \n     determines that an insurer participant that is a reinsurer is \n     in default in paying any required contribution or otherwise \n     not in compliance with this Act, the Administrator may issue \n     an order barring any direct insurer participant from \n     receiving credit for reinsurance purchased from the \n     defaulting reinsurer. Any State law governing credit for \n     reinsurance to the contrary is preempted.\n       (g) Defense Limitation.--In any proceeding under this \n     section, the participant shall be barred from bringing any \n     challenge to any determination of the Administrator or the \n     Asbestos Insurers Commission regarding its liability under \n     this Act, or to the constitutionality of this Act or any \n     provision thereof, if such challenge could have been made \n     during the review provided under section 204(i)(10), or in a \n     judicial review proceeding under section 303.\n       (h) Deposit of Funds.--\n       (1) In general.--Any funds collected under subsection \n     (c)(2) (A) or (C) shall be--\n       (A) deposited in the Fund; and\n       (B) used only to pay--\n       (i) claims for awards for an eligible disease or condition \n     determined under title I; or\n       (ii) claims for reimbursement for medical monitoring \n     determined under title I.\n       (2) No effect on other liabilities.--The imposition of a \n     fine under subsection (c)(2)(C) shall have no effect on--\n       (A) the assessment of contributions under subtitles A and \n     B; or\n       (B) any other provision of this Act.\n       (i) Property of the Estate.--Section 541(b) of title 11, \n     United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (4)(B)(ii), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (5), by striking ``prohibition.'' and \n     inserting ``prohibition; or''; and\n       (3) by inserting after paragraph (5) and before the last \n     undesignated sentence the following:\n       ``(6) the value of any pending claim against or the amount \n     of an award granted from the Asbestos Injury Claims \n     Resolution Fund established under the Fairness in Asbestos \n     Injury Resolution Act of 2005.''.\n\n     SEC. 224.

and\n       (ii) the resolution of claims for reimbursement or coverage \n     of liability or paid or incurred loss for which notice was \n     provided to the insurer before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (E) Scheduled payment amounts.--The term ``scheduled \n     payment amounts'' means the future payment obligation to the \n     Fund under this Act from a defendant participant in the \n     amount established under sections 203 and 204.\n       (F) Unearned erosion amount.--The term ``unearned erosion \n     amount'' means, in the event of any early sunset under \n     section 405(f), the difference between the deemed erosion \n     amount and the earned erosion amount.\n       (2) Quantum and timing of erosion.--\n       (A) Erosion upon enactment.--The collective payment \n     obligations to the Fund of the insurer and reinsurer \n     participants as assessed by the Administrator shall be deemed \n     as of the date of enactment of this Act to erode remaining \n     aggregate products limits available to a defendant \n     participant only in an amount of 59.64 percent of each \n     defendant participant's scheduled payment amount.\n       (B) No assertion of claim.--No insurer or reinsurer may \n     assert any claim against a defendant participant or captive \n     insurer for insurance, reinsurance, payment of a deductible, \n     or retrospective premium adjustment arising out of that \n     insurer's or reinsurer's payments to the Fund or the erosion \n     deemed to occur under this section.\n       (C) Policies without certain limits or with exclusion.--\n     Except as provided under subparagraph (E), nothing in this \n     section shall require or permit the erosion of any insurance \n     policy or limit that does not contain an aggregate products \n     limit, or that contains an asbestos exclusion.\n       (D) Treatment of consolidation election.--If an affiliated \n     group elects consolidation as provided in section 204(f), the \n     total erosion of limits for the affiliated group under \n     paragraph (2)(A) shall not exceed 59.64 percent of the \n     scheduled payment amount of the single payment obligation for \n     the entire affiliated group. The total erosion of limits for \n     any individual defendant participant in the affiliated group \n     shall not exceed its individual share of 59.64 percent of the \n     affiliated group's scheduled payment amount, as measured by \n     the individual defendant participant's percentage share of \n     the affiliated group's prior asbestos expenditures.\n       (E) Rule of construction.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section, nothing in this Act shall be \n     deemed to erode\n\n[[Page S1038]]\n\n     remaining aggregate products limits of a defendant \n     participant that can demonstrate by a preponderance of the \n     evidence that 75 percent of its prior asbestos expenditures \n     were made in defense or satisfaction of asbestos claims \n     alleging bodily injury arising exclusively from the exposure \n     to asbestos at premises owned, rented, or controlled by the \n     defendant participant (a ``premises defendant''). In \n     calculating such percentage, where expenditures were made in \n     defense or satisfaction of asbestos claims alleging bodily \n     injury due to exposure to the defendant participant's \n     products and to asbestos at premises owned, rented, or \n     controlled by the defendant participant, half of such \n     expenditures shall be deemed to be for such premises \n     exposures. If a defendant participant establishes itself as a \n     premises defendant, 75 percent of the payments by such \n     defendant participant shall erode coverage limits, if any, \n     applicable to premises liabilities under applicable law.\n       (3) Method of erosion.--\n       (A) Allocation.--The amount of erosion allocated to each \n     defendant participant shall be allocated among periods in \n     which policies with remaining aggregate product limits are \n     available to that defendant participant pro rata by policy \n     period, in ascending order by attachment point.\n       (B) Other erosion methods.--\n       (i) In general.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the \n     method of erosion of any remaining aggregate products limits \n     which are subject to--\n\n       (I) a coverage-in-place or settlement agreement between a \n     defendant participant and 1 or more insurance participants as \n     of the date of enactment; or\n       (II) a final and nonappealable judgment as of the date of \n     enactment or resulting from a claim for coverage or \n     reimbursement pending as of such date, shall be as specified \n     in such agreement or judgment with regard to erosion \n     applicable to such insurance participants' policies.\n\n       (ii) Remaining limits.--To the extent that a final \n     nonappealable judgment or settlement agreement to which an \n     insurer participant and a defendant participant are parties \n     in effect as of the date of enactment of this Act \n     extinguished a defendant participant's right to seek coverage \n     for asbestos claims under an insurer participant's policies, \n     any remaining limits in such policies shall not be considered \n     to be remaining aggregate products limits under subsection \n     (a)(1)(A).\n       (4) Restoration of aggregate products limits upon early \n     sunset.--\n       (A) Restoration.--In the event of an early sunset, any \n     unearned erosion amount will be deemed restored as aggregate \n     products limits available to a defendant participant as of \n     the date of enactment.\n       (B) Method of restoration.--The unearned erosion amount \n     will be deemed restored to each defendant participant's \n     policies in such a manner that the last limits that were \n     deemed eroded at enactment under this subsection are deemed \n     to be the first limits restored upon early sunset.\n       (C) Tolling of coverage claims.--In the event of an early \n     sunset, the applicable statute of limitations and contractual \n     provisions for the filing of claims under any insurance \n     policy with restored aggregate products limits shall be \n     deemed tolled after the date of enactment through the date 6 \n     months after the date of early sunset.\n       (5) Payments by defendant participant.--Payments made by a \n     defendant participant shall be deemed to erode, exhaust, or \n     otherwise satisfy applicable self-insured retentions, \n     deductibles, retrospectively rated premiums, and limits \n     issued by nonparticipating insolvent or captive insurance \n     companies. Reduction of remaining aggregate limits under this \n     subsection shall not limit the right of a defendant \n     participant to collect from any insurer not a participant.\n       (6) Effect on other insurance claims.--Other than as \n     specified in this subsection, this Act does not alter, \n     change, modify, or affect insurance for claims other than \n     asbestos claims.\n       (b) Dispute Resolution Procedure.--\n       (1) Arbitration.--The parties to a dispute regarding the \n     erosion of insurance coverage limits under this section may \n     agree in writing to settle such dispute by arbitration. Any \n     such provision or agreement shall be valid, irrevocable, and \n     enforceable, except for any grounds that exist at law or in \n     equity for revocation of a contract.\n       (2) Title 9, united states code.--Arbitration of such \n     disputes, awards by arbitrators, and confirmation of awards \n     shall be governed by title 9, United States Code, to the \n     extent such title is not inconsistent with this section. In \n     any such arbitration proceeding, the erosion principles \n     provided for under this section shall be binding on the \n     arbitrator, unless the parties agree to the contrary.\n       (3) Final and binding award.--An award by an arbitrator \n     shall be final and binding between the parties to the \n     arbitration, but shall have no force or effect on any other \n     person. The parties to an arbitration may agree that in the \n     event a policy which is the subject matter of an award is \n     subsequently determined to be eroded in a manner different \n     from the manner determined by the arbitration in a judgment \n     rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction from which no \n     appeal can or has been taken, such arbitration award may be \n     modified by any court of competent jurisdiction upon \n     application by any party to the arbitration. Any such \n     modification shall govern the rights and obligations between \n     such parties after the date of such modification.\n       (c) Effect on Nonparticipants.--\n       (1) In general.--No insurance company or reinsurance \n     company that is not a participant, other than a captive \n     insurer, shall be entitled to claim that payments to the Fund \n     erode, exhaust, or otherwise limit the nonparticipant's \n     insurance or reinsurance obligations.\n       (2) Other claims.--Nothing in this Act shall preclude a \n     participant from pursuing any claim for insurance or \n     reinsurance from any person that is not a participant other \n     than a captive insurer.\n       (d) Finite Risk Policies Not Affected.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, this Act shall not alter, affect or impair any \n     rights or obligations of--\n       (A) any party to an insurance contract that expressly \n     provides coverage for governmental charges or assessments \n     imposed to replace insurance or reinsurance liabilities in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act; or\n       (B) subject to paragraph (2), any person with respect to \n     any insurance or reinsurance purchased by a participant after \n     December 31, 1996, that expressly (but not necessarily \n     exclusively) provides coverage for asbestos liabilities, \n     including those policies commonly referred to as ``finite \n     risk'' policies.\n       (2) Limitation.--No person may assert that any amounts paid \n     to the Fund in accordance with this Act are covered by any \n     policy described under paragraph (1)(B) purchased by a \n     defendant participant, unless such policy specifically \n     provides coverage for required payments to a Federal trust \n     fund established by a Federal statute to resolve asbestos \n     injury claims.\n       (e) Effect on Certain Insurance and Reinsurance Claims.--\n       (1) No coverage for fund assessments.--No participant or \n     captive insurer may pursue an insurance or reinsurance claim \n     against another participant or captive insurer for payments \n     to the Fund required under this Act, except under a contract \n     specifically providing insurance or reinsurance for required \n     payments to a Federal trust fund established by a Federal \n     statute to resolve asbestos injury claims or, where \n     applicable, under finite risk policies under subsection (d).\n       (2) Certain insurance assignments voided.--Any assignment \n     of any rights to insurance coverage for asbestos claims to \n     any person who has asserted an asbestos claim before the \n     effective date, or to any trust, person, or other entity not \n     part of an affiliated group as defined in section 201(1) of \n     this Act established or appointed for the purpose of paying \n     asbestos claims which were asserted before the effective \n     date, or by any Tier I defendant participant, before any \n     sunset of this Act, shall be null and void. This subsection \n     shall not void or affect in any way any assignments of rights \n     to insurance coverage other than to asbestos claimants or to \n     trusts, persons, or other entities not part of an affiliated \n     group as defined in section 201(1) of this Act established or \n     appointed for the purpose of paying asbestos claims, or by \n     Tier I defendant participants.\n       (3) Insurance claims preserved.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, this Act shall not alter, affect, or \n     impair any rights or obligations of any person with respect \n     to any insurance or reinsurance for amounts that any person \n     pays, has paid, or becomes legally obligated to pay in \n     respect of asbestos or other claims, except to the extent \n     that--\n       (A) such person pays or becomes legally obligated to pay \n     claims that are superseded by section 403;\n       (B) any such rights or obligations of such person with \n     respect to insurance or reinsurance are prohibited by \n     paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (e); or\n       (C) the limits of insurance otherwise available to such \n     participant in respect of asbestos claims are deemed to be \n     eroded under subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 405. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ADMINISTRATOR AND SUNSET OF \n                   THE ACT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator shall submit an annual \n     report to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and \n     the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives on the operation of the Asbestos Injury \n     Claims Resolution Fund within 6 months after the close of \n     each fiscal year.\n       (b) Contents of Report.--The annual report submitted under \n     this subsection shall include an analysis of--\n       (1) the claims experience of the program during the most \n     recent fiscal year, including--\n       (A) the number of claims made to the Office and a \n     description of the types of medical diagnoses and asbestos \n     exposures underlying those claims;\n       (B) the number of claims denied by the Office and a \n     description of the types of medical diagnoses and asbestos \n     exposures underlying those claims, and a general description \n     of the reasons for their denial;\n       (C) a summary of the eligibility determinations made by the \n     Office under section 114;\n       (D) a summary of the awards made from the Fund, including \n     the amount of the awards; and\n       (E) for each eligible condition, a statement of the \n     percentage of asbestos claimants who filed claims during the \n     prior calendar year and were determined to be eligible to \n     receive compensation under this Act, who have received the \n     compensation to which such claimants are entitled according \n     to section 131;\n       (2) the administrative performance of the program, \n     including--\n\n[[Page S1039]]\n\n       (A) the performance of the program in meeting the time \n     limits prescribed by law and an analysis of the reasons for \n     any systemic delays;\n       (B) any backlogs of claims that may exist and an \n     explanation of the reasons for such backlogs;\n       (C) the costs to the Fund of administering the program; and\n       (D) any other significant factors bearing on the efficiency \n     of the program;\n       (3) the financial condition of the Fund, including--\n       (A) statements of the Fund's revenues, expenses, assets, \n     and liabilities;\n       (B) the identity of all participants, the funding \n     allocations of each participant, and the total amounts of all \n     payments to the Fund;\n       (C) a list of all financial hardship or inequity \n     adjustments applied for during the fiscal year, and the \n     adjustments that were made during the fiscal year;\n       (D) a statement of the investments of the Fund; and\n       (E) a statement of the borrowings of the Fund;\n       (4) the financial prospects of the Fund, including--\n       (A) an estimate of the number and types of claims, the \n     amount of awards, and the participant payment obligations for \n     the next fiscal year;\n       (B) an analysis of the financial condition of the Fund, \n     including an estimation of the Fund's ability to pay claims \n     for the subsequent 5 years in full as and when required, an \n     evaluation of the Fund's ability to retire its existing debt \n     and assume additional debt, and an evaluation of the Fund's \n     ability to satisfy other obligations under the program; and\n       (C) a report on any changes in projections made in earlier \n     annual reports or sunset analyses regarding the Fund's \n     ability to meet its financial obligations;\n       (5) any recommendations from the Advisory Committee on \n     Asbestos Disease Compensation and the Medical Advisory \n     Committee of the Fund to improve the diagnostic, exposure, \n     and medical criteria so as to pay only those claimants whose \n     injuries are caused by exposure to asbestos;\n       (6) a summary of the results of audits conducted under \n     section 115; and\n       (7) a summary of prosecutions under section 1348 of title \n     18, United States Code (as added by this Act).\n       (c) Claims Analysis.--If the Administrator concludes, on \n     the basis of the annual report submitted under this section, \n     that the Fund is compensating claims for injuries that are \n     not caused by exposure to asbestos and compensating such \n     claims may, currently or in the future, undermine the Fund's \n     ability to compensate persons with injuries that are caused \n     by exposure to asbestos, the Administrator shall include in \n     the report an analysis of the reasons for the situation, a \n     description of the range of reasonable alternatives for \n     responding to the situation, and a recommendation as to which \n     alternative best serves the interest of claimants and the \n     public. The report may include a description of changes in \n     the diagnostic, exposure, or medical criteria of section 121 \n     that the Administrator believes may be necessary to protect \n     the Fund from compensating claims not caused by exposure to \n     asbestos.\n       (d) Shortfall Analysis.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Analysis.--If the Administrator concludes, on the basis \n     of the information contained in the annual report submitted \n     under this section, that the Fund may not be able to pay \n     claims as such claims become due at any time within the next \n     5 years, the Administrator shall include in the report an \n     analysis of the reasons for the situation, an estimation of \n     when the Fund will no longer be able to pay claims as such \n     claims become due, a description of the range of reasonable \n     alternatives for responding to the situation, and a \n     recommendation as to which alternative best serves the \n     interest of claimants and the public. The report may include \n     a description of changes in the diagnostic, exposure, or \n     medical criteria of section 121 that the Administrator \n     believes may be necessary to protect the Fund.\n       (B) Range of alternatives.--The range of alternatives under \n     subparagraph (A) may include--\n       (i) triggering the termination of this Act under subsection \n     (f) at any time after the date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (ii) reform of the program set forth in titles I and II of \n     this Act (including changes in the diagnostic, exposure, or \n     medical criteria, changes in the enforcement or application \n     of those criteria, changes in the timing of payments, or \n     changes in award values).\n       (2) Considerations.--In formulating recommendations, the \n     Administrator shall take into account the reasons for any \n     shortfall, actual or projected, which may include--\n       (A) financial factors, including return on investments, \n     borrowing capacity, interest rates, ability to collect \n     contributions, and other relevant factors;\n       (B) the operation of the Fund generally, including \n     administration of the claims processing, the ability of the \n     Administrator to collect contributions from participants, \n     potential problems of fraud, the adequacy of the criteria to \n     rule out idiopathic mesothelioma, and inadequate flexibility \n     to extend the timing of payments;\n       (C) the appropriateness of the diagnostic, exposure, and \n     medical criteria, including the adequacy of the criteria to \n     rule out idiopathic mesothelioma;\n       (D) the actual incidence of asbestos-related diseases, \n     including mesothelioma, based on epidemiological studies and \n     other relevant data;\n       (E) compensation of diseases with alternative causes; and\n       (F) other factors that the Administrator considers \n     relevant.\n       (3) Recommendation of termination.--Any recommendation of \n     termination should include a plan for winding up the affairs \n     of the Fund (and the program generally) within a defined \n     period, including paying in full all claims resolved at the \n     time the report is prepared.\n       (4) Resolved claims.--For purposes of this section, a claim \n     shall be deemed resolved when the Administrator has \n     determined the amount of the award due the claimant, and \n     either the claimant has waived judicial review or the time \n     for judicial review has expired.\n       (e) Recommendations of Administrator and Commission.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Administrator recommends changes to \n     this Act under subsection (c), the recommendations and \n     accompanying analysis shall be referred to a special \n     commission consisting of the Attorney General, the Secretary \n     of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Commerce, or \n     their designees. The Commission shall hold public hearings on \n     the Administrator's alternatives and recommendations and then \n     make its own recommendations for reform of the program set \n     forth in titles I and II of this Act. Within 180 days after \n     receiving the Administrator's recommendations, the Commission \n     shall transmit its own recommendations to the Congress in the \n     same manner as set forth in subsection (a).\n       (2) Referral.--If the Administrator recommends changes to, \n     or termination of, this Act under subsection (d), the \n     recommendations and accompanying analysis shall be referred \n     to the Commission. The Commission shall hold public hearings \n     on the Administrator's alternatives and recommendations and \n     then make its own recommendations for reform of the program \n     set forth in titles I and II of this Act. Within 180 days \n     after receiving the Administrator's recommendations, the \n     Commission shall transmit its own recommendations to Congress \n     in the same manner as set forth in subsection (a).\n       (f) Sunset of Act.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Termination.--Subject to paragraph (4), titles I \n     (except subtitle A) and II and sections 403 and 404(e)(2) \n     shall terminate as provided under paragraph (2), if the \n     Administrator--\n       (i) has begun the processing of claims;\n       (ii) conducts a review of the operations of the Fund \n     similar to a review conducted to prepare an annual report \n     under this section; and\n       (iii) determines that if any additional claims are \n     resolved, the Fund will not have sufficient resources when \n     needed to pay 100 percent of all resolved claims while also \n     meeting all other obligations of the Fund under this Act, \n     including the payment of--\n\n       (I) debt repayment obligations; and\n       (II) remaining obligations to the asbestos trust of a \n     debtor and the class action trust.\n\n       (B) Remaining obligations.--For purposes of subparagraph \n     (A)(iii), the remaining obligations to the asbestos trust of \n     the debtor and the class action trust shall be determined by \n     the Administrator by assuming that, instead of a lump-sum \n     payment, such trust had transferred its assets to the Fund on \n     an annual basis, taking into consideration relevant factors, \n     including the most recent projections made by the trust's \n     actuary before the date of enactment of this Act of the \n     amount and timing of future claim payments and administrative \n     and operating expenses.\n       (2) Effective date of termination.--A termination under \n     paragraph (1) shall take effect 180 days after the date of a \n     determination of the Administrator under paragraph (1) and \n     shall apply to all asbestos claims that have not been \n     resolved by the Fund as of the date of the determination.\n       (3) Resolved claims.--If a termination takes effect under \n     this subsection, all resolved claims shall be paid in full by \n     the Fund.\n       (4) Extinguished claims.--A claim that is extinguished \n     under the statute of limitations provisions in section 113(b) \n     or preempted under section 403(e)(2) is not revived at the \n     time of sunset under this subsection.\n       (5) Continued funding.--If a termination takes effect under \n     this subsection, participants will still be required to make \n     payments as provided under subtitles A and B of title II. If \n     the full amount of payments required by title II is not \n     necessary for the Fund to pay claims that have been resolved \n     as of the date of termination, pay the Fund's debt and \n     obligations to the asbestos trusts and class action trust, \n     and support the Fund's continued operation as needed to pay \n     such claims, debt, and obligations, the Administrator may \n     reduce such payments. Any such reductions shall be allocated \n     among participants in approximately the same proportion as \n     the liability under subtitles A and B of title II.\n       (6) Sunset claims.--\n       (A) Definitions.--In this paragraph--\n       (i) the term ``sunset claims'' means claims as to which \n     this Act has terminated; and\n       (ii) the term ``sunset claimants'' means persons asserting \n     sunset claims.\n\n[[Page S1040]]\n\n       (B) In general.--If a termination takes effect under this \n     subsection, the applicable statute of limitations for the \n     filing of sunset claims under subsection (g) shall be tolled \n     for any past or pending sunset claimants while such claimants \n     were pursuing claims filed under this Act. For those \n     claimants who decide to pursue a sunset claim in accordance \n     with subsection (g), the applicable statute of limitations \n     shall apply, except that claimants who filed a claim against \n     the Fund under this Act before the date of termination shall \n     have 2 years after the date of termination to file a sunset \n     claim in accordance with subsection (g).\n       (7) Asbestos trusts and class action trust.--On and after \n     the date of termination under this subsection, the trust \n     distribution program of any asbestos trust and the class \n     action trust shall be replaced with the medical criteria \n     requirements of section 121.\n       (8) Payment to asbestos trusts and class action trust.--The \n     amounts determined under paragraph (1)(A)(iii) for payment to \n     the asbestos trusts and the class action trust shall be \n     transferred to the respective asbestos trusts of the debtor \n     and the class action trust within 90 days.\n       (g) Nature of Claim After Sunset.--\n       (1) In general.--On and after the date of termination under \n     subsection (f), any individual injured as a result of \n     exposure to asbestos, who has not previously had a claim \n     resolved by the Fund, may in a civil action obtain relief in \n     damages subject to the terms and conditions under this \n     subsection and paragraph (6) of subsection (f), except--\n       (A) an individual who has had a claim resolved by the Fund \n     may not pursue a court action, except that an individual who \n     received an award for a nonmalignant disease (Levels I \n     through V) from the Fund may assert a claim for a subsequent \n     or progressive disease under this subsection, unless the \n     disease was diagnosed or the claimant had discovered facts \n     that would have led a reasonable person to obtain such a \n     diagnosis before the date on which the previous claim against \n     the Fund was disposed; and\n       (B) an individual who received an award for a nonmalignant \n     or malignant disease (except mesothelioma) (Levels I through \n     IX) from the Fund may assert a claim for mesothelioma under \n     this subsection, unless the mesothelioma was diagnosed or the \n     claimant had discovered facts that would have led a \n     reasonable person to obtain such a diagnosis before the date \n     on which the nonmalignant or other malignant claim was \n     disposed.\n       (2) Exclusive remedy.--As of the effective date of a \n     termination of this Act under subsection (f), an action under \n     paragraph (1) shall be the exclusive remedy for any asbestos \n     claim that might otherwise exist under Federal, State, or \n     other law, regardless of whether such claim arose before or \n     after the effective date of this Act or of the termination of \n     this Act, except that claims against the Fund that have been \n     resolved before the date of the termination determination \n     under subsection (f) may be paid by the Fund.\n       (3) Venue.--\n       (A) In general.--Actions under paragraph (1) may be brought \n     in--\n       (i) any Federal district court;\n       (ii) any State court in the State where the claimant \n     resides; or\n       (iii) any State court in a State where the asbestos \n     exposure occurred.\n       (B) Defendants not found.--If any defendant cannot be found \n     in the State described in clause (ii) or (iii) of \n     subparagraph (A), the claim may be pursued only against that \n     defendant in the Federal district court or the State court \n     located within any State in which the defendant may be found.\n       (C) Determination of most appropriate forum.--If a person \n     alleges that the asbestos exposure occurred in more than one \n     county (or Federal district), the trial court shall determine \n     which State and county (or Federal district) is the most \n     appropriate forum for the claim. If the court determines that \n     another forum would be the most appropriate forum for a \n     claim, the court shall dismiss the claim. Any otherwise \n     applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled beginning \n     on the date the claim was filed and ending on the date the \n     claim is dismissed under this subparagraph.\n       (D) State venue requirements.--Nothing in this paragraph \n     shall preempt or supersede any State's law relating to venue \n     requirements within that State which are more restrictive.\n       (4) Class action trusts.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section--\n       (A) at no time after the assets of any class action trust \n     have been transferred to the Fund in accordance with section \n     203(b)(5), no sunset claim may be maintained with respect to \n     asbestos liabilities arising from the operations of a person \n     with respect to whose liabilities for asbestos claims a class \n     action trust has been established, whether such claim names \n     the person or its successors or affiliates as defendants; and\n       (B) if a termination takes effect under subsection (f), the \n     exclusive remedy for sunset claims arising from such \n     operations will be a claim against the class action trust to \n     which the Administrator has transferred funds under \n     subsection (f)(8) to pay asbestos claims, if necessary in \n     proportionally reduced amounts.\n       (h) Level VII Claims.--\n       (1) Monitoring claims.--In each fiscal year, the \n     Administrator shall monitor the number of claims of smokers \n     and ex-smokers filed with the Office for Level VII asbestos-\n     related disease and compare such number with the most recent \n     projection of the Congressional Budget Office before the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Analysis, estimates, and alternative actions.--If the \n     Administrator estimates that in the next fiscal year the \n     number of claims of smokers and ex-smokers filed with the \n     Office over the preceding 3 years may exceed the most recent \n     projection of the Congressional Budget Office before the date \n     of enactment of this Act by 15 percent, the Administrator \n     shall--\n       (A) conduct an analysis of the reasons for the results of \n     the estimation;\n       (B) estimate whether that number will exceed the projection \n     by 15 percent or more in subsequent fiscal years; and\n       (C) provide a range of reasonable alternatives of actions \n     which best serve the interests of claimants and the public \n     that the Administrator, Congress, or other authorities may \n     take to provide for that number not to exceed the projection \n     by 15 percent or more.\n       (3) Sunset of claims.--If in any fiscal year the \n     Administrator determines that the number of claims of smokers \n     and ex-smokers filed with the Office over the preceding 3 \n     years for Level VII asbestos-related disease exceed the most \n     recent projection of the Congressional Budget Office before \n     the date of enactment of this Act by 15 percent, the \n     Administrator shall take actions from the alternatives \n     described under paragraph (2)(C) to reduce that number to not \n     exceed 15 percent of that projection. If after taking such \n     actions, the Administrator determines that such number will \n     continue to exceed 15 percent of that projection, such claims \n     shall be treated as if this Act had ceased to be effective \n     under subsection (f).\n       (4) Transfer to class action trust.--On the effective date \n     of the sunset of Level VII claims under paragraph (3), the \n     Administrator shall transfer to a class action trust an \n     amount the Administrator determines is sufficient to pay \n     future claims for Level VII asbestos disease arising from the \n     operations of a person with respect to whose liabilities for \n     asbestos claims the class action trust has been established.\n       (5) New claims filed after sunset.--\n       (A) Venue.--If this Act ceases to be effective with respect \n     to Level VII claims of smokers and ex-smokers under paragraph \n     (3)--\n       (i) any actions shall be brought only in the Federal \n     district court located within--\n\n       (I) the State of residence of the claimant; or\n       (II) the State in which the asbestos exposure occurred; or\n\n       (ii) if any defendant cannot be found in the State \n     described in subclause (I) or (II) of clause (i), the claim \n     may be pursued against that defendant only in the Federal \n     district court or the State court located within any State in \n     which the defendant may be found.\n       (B) Determination of most appropriate forum.--If a person \n     alleges that the asbestos exposure occurred in more than one \n     Federal district, the trial court shall determine which \n     Federal district is the most appropriate forum for the claim. \n     If the court determines that another forum would be the most \n     appropriate forum for a claim, the court shall dismiss the \n     claim. Any otherwise applicable statute of limitations shall \n     be tolled beginning on the date the claim was filed and \n     ending on the date the claim is dismissed under this \n     subparagraph.\n       (C) Applicable law.--An action under subparagraph (A) shall \n     be governed by Federal common law, except that where national \n     uniformity is not required the court shall utilize otherwise \n     applicable State law, including statutes, to provide the \n     appropriate rule of Federal common law.\n       (D) Exclusive remedy.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of this section, after the sunset of claims under paragraph \n     (3), the exclusive remedy for actions for Level VII asbestos \n     disease arising from the operations of a person with respect \n     to whose liabilities for asbestos claims a class action trust \n     has been established shall be payment from the funds \n     transferred to the class action trust under paragraph (4). No \n     actions for such Level VII asbestos disease claims may be \n     maintained against a person that transferred the assets of \n     any class action trust in accordance with section 203(b)(5), \n     its successors or affiliates.\n       (E) Sunset of act.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if \n     this Act terminates as provided in subsection (f), all civil \n     actions for Level VII claims filed after the effective date \n     of such termination shall be governed by subsection (g).\n\n     SEC. 406.

Mr. President, it is a privilege for me today \nto call to the attention of the Senate the very good relations the \nUnited States has with the country of Argentina.\n  We are honored to have as our guest the Vice President of Argentina, \nDaniel Scioli, who, in his capacity, has the privilege of the floor \nbecause, as under the Argentine Constitution, so, too, under our \nConstitution, the Vice President of the country is also the President \nof the Argentine Senate. Since we have parliamentarians of the various \nparliaments of the world who have the privilege of the floor, it is my \nprivilege to bring Daniel Scioli, a personal friend, to see the \ngreatest deliberative body in the world, the United States Senate.\n  Argentina has had quite an economic revival. Under Vice President \nScioli and President Kirchner, they have had an economic turnaround in \nthe course of the last couple of years, particularly evident within the \nlast year because we have seen a number of their economic problems \nstart to come under control. We have seen a lessening of their \ninflation. We have seen them attempting to deal with their debt that is \nowed to international institutions as well as to other countries. As a \nmatter of fact, there are very significant negotiations going on now \nwith Argentine bondholders that are held around the world as to whether \nthere will be some kind of forgiveness. Of course, you can imagine the \nbondholders are resisting that enormously. But we do know this: For \nArgentina to increase its economic capacity as the leader that \nArgentina is in Latin America, as it is very reflective of an elected \ngovernment and elected democracy, it is clearly in the interest of the \nUnited States that Argentina does well.\n  We see that the Kirchner administration has benefited from the \nresults of that economic revival, for President Kirchner and, no doubt, \nVice President Scioli, in fact, are very high in popularity in the \npolls in Argentina.\n  It is interesting that another country in Latin America that has had \ntremendous economic problems--Peru, under President Toledo--likewise, \nis coming up in their economy, but President Toledo does not enjoy the \nhigh standing in the polls in his country of Peru that the Kirchner \nadministration is enjoying in the polls in Argentina. I think, over the \ncourse of time, we will see President Toledo begin to rise in the \npolls, but he has had a very tough time.\n  The Vice President and I just had a discussion about a number of \ntopics that are of mutual interest to our country. On his border with \nBrazil and with Paraguay, the Argentine-Paraguay-Brazilian border, \ncalled the triborder area, there is a city called Ciudad del Este, a \nplace about which we are concerned because there is a lot of money \nlaundering, there is a lot of fundraising for Muslim charities, there \nare a lot of knockoff goods that are being sold, contraband being sold. \nSo those conditions are ripe for terrorists to infiltrate, and it is \nour hope that these countries in the triborder region, the three major \ncountries, will continue to cooperate with us.\n  I can tell you that Argentina has clearly cooperated with us. In the \nrecent trip I took with Senator Dodd and Senator Chafee where we \nvisited these areas, we were quite encouraged with the cooperation on \nterrorism getting a foothold in that region. We have seen terrorism \nmove from the Middle East. We have seen it in Europe. We have seen it \nmove into Africa. Our concern now is that terrorism is moving into \nLatin America.\n\n  Another topic of enormous mutual interest to our two countries is the \nquestion of the direction that Venezuela will take and the direction \nthat President Chavez is taking it.\n  In a recent meeting with President Chavez with these other Senators, \nhe was very friendly. He said that he was, in fact, clamping down on \nthe FARC and the ELN, the guerrillas in Colombia coming across into \nVenezuela. He said, in fact, he had just returned nine FARC members to \nPresident Uribe of Colombia, and then, lo and behold, we find evidence \nto the contrary shortly thereafter.\n  I have spoken with Vice President Scioli, as well as President \nKirchner of Argentina, to intercede to see if there is any common \nground with the President of Venezuela because Venezuela and the United \nStates have a mutual interest. They sell half of their daily production \nof oil to us. We import 15 percent of our daily consumption of oil from \nVenezuela. Who knows, it could be a leader just like the leader from \nArgentina who is visiting with us today who could be the intermediary \nto help improve the relations if President Chavez is sincere.\n  Mr. President, I wish to welcome our distinguished guest from \nArgentina, who has now become a personal friend of mine and my wife \nGrace, to this cradle of our democracy, this great deliberative body. \nEarlier today, he visited with our Vice President, Vice President \nCheney. We are now glad to have him come and see the body over which \nthe Vice President of the United States sits as the President of the \nSenate.\n  Welcome, Mr. Vice President.\n  I thank the Chair for this opportunity. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/07/senate-section/article/S1043-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1043-S1046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         COMMENDING THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ ON DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 38, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 38) commending the People of Iraq on \n     the January 30, 2005, national elections.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 5:30 will be equally divided \nbetween the leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be speaking as the designee of \nSenator Reid, the Democratic leader.\n  I rise to speak to the resolution congratulating the people of Iraq \nfor their historic elections which took place on January 30.\n  The Iraqi elections were an important step forward and a tribute to \nthe courage of the Iraqi people. It was actually incredible to see them \ngo to the polls literally as they heard explosions in the streets. The \nimages that we saw were quite moving.\n  The election is only the first step in a long road filled with \npotentially lethal potholes, and the next months are going to be very \ncritical.\n  If the elections are to be a true turning point in the history of \nIraq, then it is critical, and I believe the administration fully \nunderstands, that the administration act with the urgency that is \nneeded in several key areas to sustain this very positive momentum.\n  In my view, the first priority is to build Iraqi capacity. The \nelection, hopefully, strengthened the political legitimacy of the Iraqi \ngovernment, but it did nothing to build its governing capacity.\n  The Iraqi government is no more capable today than it was the day \nbefore the elections of providing law and order, defeating the \ninsurgents, or delivering basic services like water, gasoline, and \nelectricity.\n  We have squandered 2 years developing these capabilities, and now it \nis time to move into high gear, especially in training Iraqi forces \nthat are able to operate independently and effectively. Our ability to \ndraw down responsibly in Iraq depends on that happening.\n  Second, we must promote political power sharing. Because many Sunni \nArabs stayed home or, quite frankly, were scared away, understandably I \nmight add, from the polls, they may feel even more alienated and \ncontinue to support the insurgency.\n  I am encouraged by conciliatory statements by some Sunni-affiliated \norganizations that suggest they are willing to work with the new \ngovernment in drafting Iraq's permanent constitution. We all should \nremember this election was primarily about electing people who are \ngoing to be the people who write the constitution. In a sense, it is a \nlittle bit like our Constitutional Convention that took place in \nPhiladelphia. These folks are going to write\n\n[[Page S1044]]\n\na constitution, then they are going to present it to the Iraqi people \nessentially in a referendum at the end of this year, next fall. If the \nSunni Arabs are not in on the deal, it is not likely to be accepted.\n  We must use our influence with the Shi'a and the Kurds to reach out \nto those who were left out, that is the Sunni Arabs, who are willing to \nparticipate in the writing of that constitution. They also have to be \nwell represented in the cabinet of this transitional government.\n  Finally, just as the international community appointed a first-rate \nrepresentative to the independent Iraqi election commission, so, too, \nshould it consider similar assistance as Iraqis begin to grapple with \nthe complexities of drafting a constitution.\n  Thirdly, we have to make Iraq the world's problem, not just our own. \nSecretary Rice said before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee ``the \ntime for diplomacy is now.'' The proof will be the administration's \nefforts and success in getting more help to train Iraqi security forces \nand to build Iraq's infrastructure. The administration has to make a \ndiplomatic full court press.\n  Our allies claim to be concerned about the plight of the Iraqi \npeople. Well, now is their chance to prove it. The Europeans have to \nget over it. George Bush has been elected for the next 4 years. The \nfact is, they must get involved and stop shirking their responsibility. \nWe also must help the Iraqi government develop positive relations with \nits neighbors and regional states. Our Presidential elections are over, \nthe American people have spoken, and it is time for our allies to get \nover their past differences with the Bush administration and act in \ntheir own self-interest to promote a stable, unified, representative \nIraq.\n  A week ago, several of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle had \nthe chance to visit with President Chirac. I think it is fair to say we \nsensed a new willingness to work with us if France is given a seat at \nthe table.\n  Similarly, Chancellor Schroeder, during Secretary Rice's visit last \nweek, offered additional German assistance to train Iraqi security \nforces, build Iraqi ministries, and support Iraqi civil institutions.\n  We must not squander yet another opportunity to bring our key allies \ninto the effort.\n  Last April, I called for the creation of a board of directors--a \ncontact group--consisting of the major powers, the Iraqi government, \nand key regional countries to support Iraq's transition. It would meet \non a monthly basis to coordinate diplomatic, political, economic, and \nsecurity support for Iraq.\n  I urge the administration to reconsider creating a contact group. The \nPresident could use his forthcoming visit to Europe to launch the \neffort.\n  A broader group which includes other nations on the U.N. Security \nCouncil, the G-8, and the multinational force can meet on a regular, \nbut more infrequent basis to discuss ways to support the contact \ngroup's efforts.\n  Fourth, we must show reconstruction results. More than a year ago, \nthe administration told Congress it urgently needed $18.4 billion for \nIraq's reconstruction.\n  Congress delivered but the administration has not: Less than 20 \npercent of that money has been spent. Electricity production in Iraq \nhas fallen to below the level it was under Saddam. Lines for gasoline \nstretch for miles. Oil production is lagging behind targets.\n  The administration must develop a plan to spend the money \nefficiently, with clear benchmarks. We should emphasize small-scale, \nIraqi-run projects that deliver quick benefits to the Iraqi people--at \nleast 40 percent of whom are unemployed and on giving our military \ncommanders more flexibility to spend money directly on reconstruction.\n  Finally, I know that I do not need to remind my colleagues that we \nmust support our military.\n  Our troops in Iraq must be equipped and trained for the mission in \nIraq. The troop rotation schedule must not degrade readiness or \ndiminish retention.\n  Above all, the administration must do what it has consistently failed \nto do in Iraq: Level with the American people.\n  A week ago Sunday was a good day for democracy, but there are many \nhard days and more sacrifice ahead. The President must make that clear \nif he is to sustain the support of the American people.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this resolution, and I join in \ncommending the people of Iraq for the inspiring step they have taken \ntoward self-government and a democratic future.\n  We all share the goal of spreading freedom and democracy and ending \ntyranny around the globe. There is no disagreement about these goals, \nand the importance of these ideals. America has been a beacon of \ndemocracy and freedom for more than two centuries.\n  When America is at its best, our deeds match our words. But many of \nus feel we haven't done that in Iraq. We care about our country. \nStephen Decatur famously said, ``My country, right or wrong.'' But \nothers through the years have said it better--``our country right or \nwrong. When right, to be kept right. When wrong, to be set right.''\n  We've paid a high price for the invasion of Iraq. Saddam is gone, but \nthere were no weapons of mass destruction. The cakewalk the \nadministration predicted became a quagmire instead. We shifted our \nfocus away from the real threat to our national security--Osama bin \nLaden. We shattered our alliances and lost our respect in the world. \nMore than 1,400 American soldiers have given their lives. 150,000 of \nour soldiers are tied down in Iraq. Our military has been stretched to \nthe breaking point, with other threats ever-present. The families of \nour military, and our guard and reserves are suffering. The American \noccupation has fueled the insurgency.\n  We are all moved by the bravery of the Iraqi people who voted in the \nrecent election, and we honor the courageous men and women of our Armed \nForces who continue to risk their lives for a better future for the \nIraqi people.\n  The election is an opening, if we are wise enough to seize it, to \ndemonstrate to the Iraqi people that we have no long-term designs on \ntheir country.\n  I hope the administration's decision to withdraw 15,000 American \ntroops from Iraq is a down-payment on a more enlightened policy, and \nthat the administration will seize this opening.\n  Our men and women in uniform deserve more. We need to redouble our \nefforts to train the Iraqi security forces before the election of a \npermanent Iraqi government at the end of the year, so that a stable and \nfree Iraq will be established and our troops can come home with dignity \nand honor.\n  I congratulate the Iraqi people and the men and women of our Armed \nForces who made this election possible, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this resolution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first, let me express my appreciation to the \nranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Biden is \nsomeone who has knowledge of foreign affairs that is astounding. Having \nserved on that committee when I was in the House of Representatives, I \nknow it is a great committee. It is so important to the success or \nfailure of what happens in this country in relation to our foreign \nneighbors. I feel so relieved, knowing he is there, leading us on this \nmost important committee. I appreciate his statement today.\n  The resolution now before the Senate commends the Iraqi people for \ntheir courage during the election on January 30. I think it is \nimportant that we express our admiration for the Iraqi citizens. That \nis what this resolution does. Millions cast their votes on that day. \nThey turned out at the polls in spite of threats to voters, candidates, \nelection workers, and in spite of acts of violence by those seeking to \nundermine the election process. The acts of violence took place. \nApproximately 40 Iraqis were killed that day, and a number of American \nsoldiers.\n  I think we should express our gratitude to our troops in Iraq. They \nare the ones who have allowed this election to go forward. The U.S. \nmilitary was central to the success of the election on election day. \nWithout them and the overwhelming security they provided, there would \nnot have been an election.\n  The Iraqi Independent Election Commission and the United Nations also \ndid a good job. They also should be commended. They took the daunting \ntask of trying to hold a free and fair election in the most dangerous \nconditions.\n  But no one should underestimate the challenges that lie ahead, as \noutlined\n\n[[Page S1045]]\n\nby Senator Biden. The election was only one step in Iraq's long march \ntoward peace and stability. With the violence unending and the \ninsurgency showing no signs of weakness, the President needs to spell \nout a clear and understandable plan for success in Iraq. In his State \nof the Union Address, the President said only that U.S. troops will \nremain until Iraq becomes a representative democracy that can defend \nitself and is at peace with its neighbors. This is not a strategy for \nsuccess; it is an open-ended commitment with no end or plan in sight. \nOur troops and the American people deserve better than that.\n  It was only yesterday that the Pentagon, through its Secretary, Mr. \nRumsfeld, when pressed for details about the insurgency and about the \nplan for going forward in Iraq, said only that there is an assessment \ntaking place. This is not leadership.\n  The President needs to level with the American people. Once and for \nall he needs to spell out his plan, No. 1, to crush the insurgency, No. \n2, to build Iraq's capacity to defend itself and deliver basic services \nto its people, No. 3, to get the reconstruction process back on track, \nand, No. 4, to increase political participation by all parties, \nespecially the moderates, and finally, No. 5, to increase international \ninvolvement. These are five concrete steps that must take place. Much \nmore is being done, for example, to enlist the international \ncommunity's help in the training of Iraqi security forces and in the \ndevelopment of the Iraqi political and economic systems.\n  Will the President finally reach out to the other nations to take \nsome of the burden off our forces and off the U.S. taxpayers? The proof \nwill be in the President's actions, not in his rhetoric. As the \nadministration continues on month by month, without a firm course or \ndirection, the situation in Iraq grows more complex and more dangerous. \nThe President's own National Intelligence Council concluded that Iraq \nis now a magnet for international terrorism. We have to do better--for \nour troops, for the American people, and for success in Iraq.\n  I, again, compliment the people of Iraq for a successful election.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it has been 1 week since 8 million Iraqis \ncast their historic vote for freedom. Already a new sense of optimism \nis infusing the Iraqi people. I refer my colleagues to a story in the \nWashington Post this morning on this rising tide of civic pride.\n  A young pharmacy owner tells the paper:\n\n       You can feel the situation is changed. People seem to \n     linger on the street longer. You can feel the momentum, the \n     sense of optimism.\n\n  A Baghdad bakery store manager said that he, too:\n\n     . . . feels very optimistic things will change for the better \n     because of the strong turnout in elections that reinforced \n     our faith.\n\n  The Post reports car stereos and storefront speakers proudly blare \nthe anthem, ``My Homeland,'' which was banned by Saddam Hussein. \nNeighbors have more trust for one another after years and years of \nforced fear and suspicion.\n  Most encouragingly, Iraqi police officers and national guardsmen are \ngetting better tips and better information on the terrorist insurgents \nwho are widely regarded by the Iraqi people as criminals.\n  History is not going to soon forget that extraordinary sight of 8 \nmillion Iraqis risking their lives for freedom. Amidst those terrorist \nthreats and bomb blasts, Iraqi voters streamed to over 5,000 polling \nstations across the country to cast their ballots. Families brought \ntheir young sons and daughters so they, too, could be witnesses to \nhistory.\n  We also cannot forget the Iraqis who voted in over a dozen countries \nbesides Iraq, including the United States. In fact, in my own hometown \nof Nashville, TN, we saw thousands of Iraqis voting in their first \nelection in years. Election officials say they will have the total vote \ncount by Thursday of this week. Whatever the outcome, January 30, 2005, \nmarked the beginning of a new era in Iraq and the beginning of changes \nthat will reverberate throughout the region.\n  In the words of the President: The world heard ``the voice of freedom \nfrom the center of the Middle East.''\n  As we know, many Sunnis in the Baghdad region did not vote out of \nfear--probably it was more a mistaken belief that their actions would \nin some way delegitimize the electoral process.\n  Over the last several days we have heard encouraging reports that \nSunni leaders want to play an active role in the drafting of the \nconstitution; that they want to be a part of the process and not \nseparate from it, not isolated from it. Equally inspiring is the news \nthat Shiite leaders are reaching out to the Sunnis and other \nminorities, reaching out to include them in the process. They, too, \nwant the Sunni Iraqis to be part of that constitutional process, a part \nof the new, free, and democratic Iraq.\n  What we saw on the 30th mirrors what many in Iraq told me and my \ncolleagues who went to Iraq, now several weeks ago. They were right. \nBefore we went over, and actually after we came back, you would hear \nagain and again the doubts about the elections. Many watchers were \nhumbled by the transformative power of these elections, similar to what \nwe saw in Afghanistan last October.\n  The effect these elections can have on a people and on a government \nand on a nation is so powerful, and we saw it played out recently in \nthese elections.\n  We saw it in the Ukraine, we saw it in the Palestinian Authority and, \nas I mentioned, in October in Afghanistan and now in Iraq. We hope to \nsee it in the broader Middle East in the months and years ahead.\n  Once oppressed by a brutal dictatorship, the Iraqis are inspiring \npeople all over the world with their courage and determination. They \nnow stand as a great, bright hope in a land that was too long shrouded \nby tyranny and by violence.\n  We still have a long road and a hard road ahead. We all recognize \nthat. No one should expect the violence to end, but the election and \nits ripple effects confirm that the Iraqi people are on the right path; \nand it renews our confidence in the human desire for liberty and for \nself-determination.\n  The United States joins the President in his praise of the Iraqi \npeople by the resolution we are about to pass here in the Senate. In a \nfew moments, we will pass a resolution that expresses our support for \nthe Iraqis as they move forward toward a free and full democracy that \nrespects the rule of law and the rights of all its citizens.\n  I want to give my personal thanks and thanks on behalf of all our \ncolleagues to Senators Lugar, Dole, and the Democratic leader, Harry \nReid, for all their leadership on this particular resolution.\n  The Senate and the American people stand shoulder to shoulder with \nthe Iraqis as they continue their remarkable journey toward freedom and \ndemocracy.

Res. 38\n\n       Whereas on January 30, 2005, Iraq held its first democratic \n     elections in nearly half a century;\n       Whereas after more than 3 decades of enduring harsh \n     repression and lack of freedom, millions cast ballots on \n     January 30, 2005, to determine the future of their country in \n     an election widely recognized as a success by the \n     international community;\n       Whereas the hard work, contributions, vision, and \n     sacrifices of the Interim Iraqi Government in undertaking \n     major political, economic, social, and legal reforms and, in \n     conjunction with the efforts of the Iraqi Independent \n     Electoral Commission, in ensuring that Iraq held nationwide \n     elections on January 30, and in not being intimidated by \n     terrorist and insurgent forces resulted in the successful \n     elections of January 30;\n       Whereas on January 30, President George W. Bush stated that \n     the election in Iraq was a ``milestone'' in Iraq's history \n     and that the ``world is hearing the voice of freedom from the \n     center of the Middle East'';\n       Whereas the January 30 election is another step in the \n     process of developing a free and democratic Iraq;\n       Whereas the people of Iraq cast votes to freely choose the \n     275-member Transitional National Assembly that will serve as \n     the national legislature of Iraq for a transition period, \n     name a Presidency Council, and select a Prime Minister;\n       Whereas the Transitional National Assembly will draft the \n     permanent constitution of Iraq;\n       Whereas the election establishes a credible process for \n     governing Iraq under a mandate from the majority of the \n     people of Iraq for a new Iraq in which all communities are \n     represented, minority rights are respected, and violence is \n     not tolerated;\n       Whereas an estimated 14,300,000 Iraqis were registered to \n     vote at more than 5,000 polling stations across Iraq and in \n     14 other countries;\n       Whereas, with 256 political entities composed of 18,900 \n     Iraqi candidates standing for election in 20 different \n     elections (the national election, 18 provincial elections, \n     and Kurdistan Regional government election), voter turnout \n     demonstrated widespread enthusiasm for self-determination;\n       Whereas Iraqi security forces joined with United States and \n     Coalition forces in providing security for the elections;\n       Whereas despite these efforts, many Sunni Iraqis in some \n     provinces did not vote because of fear and intimidation;\n       Whereas the United Nations Electoral Assistance Division \n     and other nongovernmental organizations provided technical \n     support and assistance to the Independent Electoral \n     Commission of Iraq and the Iraqi Interim Government;\n       Whereas the people of Iraq will again exercise their \n     popular will through a national referendum in October 2005, \n     when the Transitional National Assembly presents a draft \n     constitution for Iraq;\n       Whereas national elections based on that constitution are \n     then to be held in December 2005 to choose an Iraqi \n     government in a manner prescribed by the constitution;\n       Whereas it is in the interest of Iraq, the Middle East, the \n     United States, and the international community that Iraq \n     successfully transitions to a functioning democratic state, \n     as this may serve as a catalyst for peace and stability in \n     the region; and\n       Whereas the Iraqi government needs assistance from the \n     broader international community to further develop governing \n     capacity, train effective security forces who can defeat the \n     terrorists and insurgents and maintain law and order, improve \n     economic conditions, and maintain essential services, such as \n     the delivery of electricity, gasoline, and water: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the people of Iraq on the successful \n     nationwide elections held in Iraq on January 30, 2005, and \n     recognizes the elections as another step in developing a free \n     and democratic Iraq;\n       (2) recognizes the desire for freedom and liberty of all \n     individuals who served as candidates, campaign workers, \n     United Nations and Iraqi election officials, and voters in \n     the January 30, 2005, elections in Iraq and congratulates the \n     new members of the Transitional National Assembly and the \n     leaders of the provincial and regional governments;\n       (3) urges the new leadership of Iraq to move forward with \n     drafting the constitution, upholding the law, and holding a \n     referendum on the new constitution in October 2005;\n       (4) encourages participation of all groups and communities \n     in the drafting of a new constitution and the formation of a \n     permanent government for Iraq;\n       (5) recognizes and honors the sacrifices made for freedom \n     and liberty in Iraq by the people of Iraq;\n       (6) commends the Iraqi security forces, and the U.S. armed \n     forces and Coalition forces, who ensured the elections could \n     be conducted in a relatively safe, secure, and credible \n     manner;\n       (7) condemns and deplores all acts of violence and \n     intimidation against the people of Iraq by members of the \n     former Iraqi regime, insurgents, and other extremists and \n     terrorists;\n       (8) supports the establishment of a fully democratic Iraqi \n     government that respects the rule of law, promotes ethnic and \n     religious tolerance, respects the rights of women and all \n     minorities, provides security and stability for the people of \n     Iraq, and has the capacity to maintain basic services such as \n     the delivery of sufficient electricity, gasoline, and water;\n       (9) believes that it is in the interest of the people of \n     Iraq, the Middle East, the United States, and the \n     international community that Iraq transitions to a fully \n     democratic state, and that doing so may serve as a catalyst \n     for peace and stability in the region;\n       (10) calls on the international community, particularly \n     Arab states, countries with predominantly Muslim populations, \n     and all North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, to \n     provide military and police personnel to train and assist \n     Iraqi security forces and to otherwise assist in the \n     political and economic development of Iraq;\n       (11) encourages the newly-elected transitional government \n     of Iraq to ensure that all Iraqis, including members of the \n     Sunni religious community, are represented in the \n     Constitution-writing process and in the new Iraqi cabinet to \n     improve the prospects for national unity and consensus; and\n       (12) looks forward to welcoming Iraq into the world \n     community of democratic nations.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, over the past several years, we have \nwitnessed a disturbing erosion in Russia's democracy. Checks and \nbalances, essential to the functioning of any democracy, have been \nundermined in Russia through the elimination of the independent media, \nthe weakening of the judiciary, and the decline of a political \nopposition and citizen participation.\n  In his inauguration speech, President Bush spoke about the ``force of \nhuman freedom'' and stated that it is the policy of the United States \n``to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and \ninstitutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of \nending tyranny in our world.''\n  But, the President has been unable to capitalize on his friendship \nwith President Putin to prevent a backsliding in Russia's democracy. \nWhile President Putin speaks about his commitment to move down the path \nof democracy, his actions demonstrate otherwise.\n  From 2000 until the present day, President Putin has tightened his \ngrip on Russia, increasing the authoritarian nature of the Russian \nstate. While many Russian experts understand that President Putin \ninherited a state mired in corruption and political violence, and \ndominated by powerful, unaccountable oligarchs, they have called \nPutin's approach to establishing security ``flawed and unfair.'' A \nWashington Post article in March 2004 described how fear was creeping \nback into Russia, reminiscent of the Soviet Union. A week before the \nRussian Presidential election in 2004, the article states:\n\n       Scholars, journalists, reformist politicians, human rights \n     activists and even business moguls describe an atmosphere of \n     anxiety that has left them wary of crossing the Kremlin.\n\n  The imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man and an \noil tycoon, the disappearances of critics of Putin, as well as the \nflawed parliamentary elections in 2003, have been disturbing signs for \nthose who care about democracy in Russia.\n  The U.S. State Department in its Country Report on Human Rights \nPractices for 2003 raise concerns over human rights abuses committed by \nthe Government of Russia in Chechnya, as well as by Chechen rebels, the \nfailure of the 2003 parliamentary elections to meet international \nstandards, the impunity of law enforcement officials responsible for \nabuses, poor prison conditions, and a weakening of freedom of \nexpression and the independence and freedom of some media. In the \nglobal survey, ``Freedom in the World,'' published by Freedom House in \nDecember 2004, Russia was downgraded to ``Not Free,'' the only country \nto register a negative category change in 2004.\n  On all fronts, Russia's democracy appears to be weakening. In January \n2002, the last significant independent Moscow TV station was shut down, \nmany believe due to government pressure. Furthermore, radio and print \nmedia have increasingly been restricted. It was widely reported that \nduring the parliamentary elections of 2003, television coverage was \nheavily biased toward the propresidency party, largely ignoring or \ncriticizing Putin's opponents. In May 2004, the nongovernmental \norganization, the Committee to Protect Journalists, CPJ, named Russia \none of the 10 worst places to be a journalist. CPJ states:\n\n       A shift from blatant pressures to more subtle and covert \n     tactics, such as politicized lawsuits and hostile corporate \n     takeovers by businessmen with close ties to Putin, has \n     allowed the Kremlin to stifle criticism of the president and \n     reports on government corruption and human rights abuses \n     committed by Russian forces in Chechnya.\n\n  Furthermore, they note that journalists in Russia's provinces are \nmurdered with impunity.\n  As President Putin moves from ``managed democracy'' to soft \nauthoritarianism, Freedom House, Human Rights Watch, and others argue \nthat Putin appears to be cracking down on civil society, a vital \nelement of any thriving democracy. In May 2004, Putin used his state-\nof-the-nation speech to attack nongovernmental organizations, NGOs, \naccusing them of ``receiving financing from influential foreign \nfoundations and serving dubious groups and commercial interests.'' The \nvery real need to stop terrorist financing through charities or other \norganizations does not justify targeting legitimate civic groups and \nNGOs. Following Putin's state-of-the-nation speech, masked intruders \nransacked the office of a major human rights organization in Tatarstan \nthat provides legal support for victims of torture. In addition, the \nstate-owned Center TV criticized NGOs, accusing them of being tied to \nanti-Russian interests. And, in June 2004, Russia's Foreign Minister \nmet with several NGOs and urged them to rebut criticisms of the Council \nof Europe regarding Russia's human rights policies.\n  Russia's judicial system is also believed to be far from independent, \nfailing to serve as a counterweight to other branches of government. \nHuman Rights Watch has expressed concern that the government under \nPresident Putin has conducted ``selective criminal prosecutions against \nperceived opponents . . . and scientists working with foreigners on \nsensitive topics.'' President Putin has proposed establishing executive \ncontrol over the nomination of members of a key supreme court body that \nsupervises the hiring and dismissal of judges. Furthermore, despite \nprogress in implementing trial by jury, the Putin government appears to \nhave manipulated jury selection in several high-profile cases or \notherwise tried to influence jury deliberations.\n  Chechnya continues to be an area of particular concern. While Russia \nhas the right to combat terrorist threats on its territory, Russian and \nproxy forces regularly violate basic human rights of Chechen civilians. \nDisappearances, extrajudicial executions, rape, and torture of \ndetainees all continue with disturbing frequency and with absolute \nimpunity. Russian forces regularly conduct sweeps and cleansing \noperations, resulting in death, injury and abductions in what many call \na . disproportionate use of force. These human rights abuses must end \nand those responsible should be held accountable.\n  Since President Putin's reelection in March 2004, he has taken more \nsteps to exert control over the state. In September 2004, following the \ntragic deaths of 330 people in Beslan, half of whom were children, \nPresident Putin undertook a set of political reforms that concentrated \npower in Moscow and decreased the power of Russia's regions. He \nproposed that regional governors no longer be popularly elected but \ninstead be appointed by the President and ratified by regional \nlegislatures. Legislation to this effect was introduced in October 2004 \nand signed into law by President Putin on December 12, 2004. Putin also \ndecided that all Duma deputies be elected on the basis of national \nparty lists, based on the proportion of votes each party gets \nnationwide. As Human Rights Watch states in its recent World Report \n2005:\n\n       The proposals would give the president de facto power to \n     appoint governors, even more sway over the parliament, or \n     State Duma, and increase the executive's influence over the \n     judiciary.\n\n  While it is clear that President Putin must act to confront a \nlegitimate threat to security, a marginalization of different regions \noutside of Moscow may create an even greater political backlash.\n  President Putin faces a challenging political environment in Russia. \nHowever, human rights and political freedoms must not be ignored in an \nattempt to establish security; their neglect will only lead to greater \npolitical\n\n[[Page S1048]]\n\nturmoil. The United States must stand by its commitment to democracy in \nits relations with Russia. If Russia wants to be a member of the \ncommunity of democracies, it must demonstrate a meaningful commitment \nto democratic principles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/07/senate-section/article/S1048-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           WARREN V. HILEMAN\n\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the life and \nservice of Mr. Warren V. Hileman, who passed away recently at the \nIllinois Veterans Home in Anna.\n  Last week, the Southern Illinoisan reported that the State believes \nMr. Hileman was the last World War I veteran to have lived in Illinois.\n  He joined the U.S. Army in 1919, and served with the American \nExpeditionary Force in Siberia from September of 1919 to March 1920. \nTraveling thousands of miles across Siberia in temperatures that often \nreached 30 below, Mr. Hileman and the 27th infantry served long after \nthe Armistice was signed in Europe.\n  In Posolskaya, their unit was involved in a hostile encounter that \nlater won Mr. Hileman the World War I Victory Medal, which he was \nawarded in January of 2004.\n  After the war, he came home to Illinois where he worked in a North \nChicago veterans hospital. Later, he and his wife moved back down south \nto Union County, where they spent the rest of their lives.\n  Warren was only 17 years old when he first landed in Vladivostok, \nRussia. Perhaps he was anxious about the war ahead of him; perhaps he \nalready missed the home that lay behind. But above all, he was ready \nand eager to serve this country. At just 17, he was ready to make the \nultimate sacrifice in the defense of freedom.\n  Today, we honor his service and remember a man who returned from war \nto live over a century on this Earth. Through more wars and depression, \nthrough great advances for civil rights and great struggles for \nfreedom, Mr. Hileman was there--a patriot who had proudly written his \nown page in the story of 20th century America.\n  It is said that whether a life is long or short, its completeness \ndepends on what it was lived for. And so, while Warren Hileman left us \nat the age of 103, the true completeness of his life comes from what he \nlived it for--for his friends, for his family, and for the defense of \nthe country he loved. May his memory serve as a reminder for all of us \nto keep faith with our Nation's veterans, and may Warren Hileman rest \nin eternal peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/07/senate-section/article/S1048-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FUTURE BUSINESS LEADERS OF AMERICA--PHI BETA LAMBDA\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida.

The \n2006 Budget will help America continue to meet these goals. In order to \nsustain our economic expansion, we must continue pro-growth policies \nand enforce even greater spending restraint across the Federal \nGovernment. By holding Federal programs to a firm test of \naccountability and focusing our resources on top priorities, we are \ntaking the steps necessary to achieve our deficit reduction goals.\n  Our Nation's most critical challenge since September 11, 2001, has \nbeen to protect the American people by fighting and winning the War on \nTerror. Overseas and at home, our troops and homeland security \nofficials are receiving the funding needed to protect our homeland, \nbring terrorists to justice, eliminate terrorists safe havens and \ntraining camps, and shut down their financing.\n  In Afghanistan and Iraq, we are helping establish democratic \ninstitutions. Together with our coalition partners, we are helping the \nAfghan and Iraqi people build schools, establish the rule of law, \ncreate functioning economies, and protect basic human rights. And while \nthe work is dangerous and difficult, America's efforts are helping \npromote societies that will serve as beacons of freedom in the Middle \nEast. Free nations are peaceful nations and are far less likely to \nproduce the kind of terrorism that reached our shores just over the \nthree years ago.\n  To ensure our security at home, the 2006 Budget increases funding for \nanti-terrorism investigations; border security; airport and seaport \nsecurity; nuclear and radiological detection systems and \ncountermeasures; and improved security for our food supply and drinking \nwater.\n  This Budget also promotes economic growth and opportunity. We must \nensure that America remains the best place in the world to do business \nby keeping taxes low, promoting new trade agreements with other \nnations, and protecting American businesses from litigation abuse and \noverregulation. To make sure the entrepreneurial spirit remains strong, \nthe Budget includes important initiatives to help American businesses \nand families cope with the rising cost of health care. This Budget \nfunds important reforms in our schools, and promotes homeownership in \nour communities. In addition, the 2006 Budget supports the development \nof technology and innovation throughout our economy.\n  The 2006 Budget also affirms the values of our caring society. It \npromotes programs that are effectively providing assistance to the most \nvulnerable among us. We are launching innovative programs such as Cover \nthe Kids, which will expand health insurance coverage for needy \nchildren. We are funding global initiatives with unprecedented \nresources to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic, respond to natural disasters, \nand provide humanitarian relief to those in need. The 2006 Budget \ncontinues to support domestic programs and policies that fight drug \naddiction and homelessness and promote strong families and lives of \nindependence. And in all our efforts, we will continue to build working \nrelationships with community organizations, including faith-based \norganizations, which are doing so much to bring hope to Americans.\n  In every program, and in every agency, we are measuring success not \nby\n\n[[Page S1049]]\n\ngood intentions, or by dollars spent, but rather by results achieved. \nThis Budget takes a hard look at programs that have not succeeded or \nshown progress despite multiple opportunities to do so. My \nAdministration is pressing for reforms so that every program will \nachieve its intended results. And where circumstances warrant, the 2006 \nBudget recommends significant spending reductions or outright \nelimination of programs that are falling short.\n  This Budget builds on the spending restraint we have achieved, and \nwill improve the process by which the Congress and the Administration \nwork together to produce a budget that remains within sensible spending \nlimits. In every year of my Administration, we have brought down the \ngrowth in non-security related discretionary spending. This year, I \npropose to go further and reduce this category of spending by about one \npercent, and to hold the growth in overall discretionary spending, \nincluding defense and homeland security spending, to less than the rate \nof inflation. I look forward to working closely with the Congress to \nachieve these reductions and reforms. By doing so, we will remain on \ntrack to meet our goal to cut the deficit in half by 2009.\n  Our greatest fiscal challenges are created by the long-term unfunded \npromises of our entitlement programs. I will be working with the \nCongress to develop a Social Security reform plan that strengthens \nSocial Security for future generations, protects the benefits of \ntoday's retirees and near-retirees, and provides ownership, choice, and \nthe opportunity for today's young workers to build a nest egg for their \nretirement.\n  In the past four years, America has faced many challenges, both \noverseas and at home. We have overcome these challenges not simply with \nour financial resources, but with the qualities that have always made \nAmerica great: creativity, resolve, and a caring spirit. America has \nvast resources, but no resource is as abundant as the strength of the \nAmerican people. It is this strength that will help us to continue to \nprosper and meet any challenge that lies before us.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe reduction in the deductible portion of expenses for business meals \nand entertainment; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to repeal \nthe current 50 percent tax deduction for business meals and \nentertainment expenses, and to restore the tax deduction to 80 percent \ngradually over a five-year period. Restoration of this deduction is \nessential to the livelihood of small and independent businesses as\n\n[[Page S1051]]\n\nwell as the food service, travel, tourism, and entertainment industries \nthroughout the United States. These industries are being economically \nharmed as a result of the 50 percent tax deduction.\n  Small businesses rely heavily on the business meal to conduct \nbusiness, even more so than larger corporations. The Small Business \nAdministration (SBA) Office of Advocacy, in releasing a study last May, \n``The Impact of Tax Expenditure Policies on Incorporated Small \nBusiness,'' found that small incorporated businesses benefit more than \ntheir larger counterparts from the meal and entertainment tax \ndeduction. According to the study, small firms that take advantage of \nthe business-meal deduction reduce their effective tax rate by 0.75 \npercent on average, while larger firms only receive a 0.11 percent \nreduction in their effective tax rate. More importantly, the study \nstrongly suggests that full reinstatement of the business meal and \nentertainment deduction should be a major policy priority for small \nbusinesses.\n  Small companies often use restaurants as ``conference space'' to \nconduct meetings or close deals. Meals are their best and sometimes \nonly marketing tool. Certainly, an increase in the meal and \nentertainment deduction would have a significant impact on a small \nbusinesses bottom line. In addition, the effects on the overall economy \nwould be significant.\n  Accompanying my statement is the National Restaurant Association's, \nNRA, State-by-State chart reflecting the estimated economic impact of \nincreasing the business meal deductibility from 50 percent to 80 \npercent. The NRA estimates that an increase to 80 percent would \nincrease business meal sales by $6 billion and create a $13 billion \nincrease to the overall economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the NRA's State-by-State \nchart and the text of my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n ESTIMATED IMPACT OF INCREASING BUSINESS MEAL DEDUCTIBILITY FROM 50% TO\n                                   80%\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                       Increase in\n                                      business meal      Total economic\n               State                 spending, 50% to    impact in the\n                                    80% deductibility      state (in\n                                      (in millions)        millions)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama...........................                $86               $177\nAlaska............................                 19                 32\nArizona...........................                128                254\nArkansas..........................                 46                 92\nCalifornia........................                970              2,149\nColorado..........................                131                284\nConnecticut.......................                 90                168\nDelaware..........................                 24                 43\nDistrict of Columbia..............                 34                 45\nFlorida...........................                376                768\nGeorgia...........................                215                481\nHawaii............................                 44                 84\nIdaho.............................                 25                 49\nIllinois..........................                315                738\nIndiana...........................                136                279\nIowa..............................                 54                115\nKansas............................                 53                109\nKentucky..........................                 93                187\nLouisiana.........................                 98                191\nMaine.............................                 28                 54\nMaryland..........................                133                277\nMassachusetts.....................                207                411\nMichigan..........................                223                435\nMinnesota.........................                123                278\nMississippi.......................                 49                 94\nMissouri..........................                133                302\nMontana...........................                 21                 38\nNebraska..........................                 37                 77\nNevada............................                 77                135\nNew Hampshire.....................                 35                 65\nNew Jersey........................                196                407\nNew Mexico........................                 40                 75\nNew York..........................                439                858\nNorth Carolina....................                196                411\nNorth Dakota......................                 13                 24\nOhio..............................                266                581\nOklahoma..........................                 74                158\nOregon............................                 86                178\nPennsylvania......................                272                606\nRhode Island......................                 35                 64\nSouth Carolina....................                 98                195\nSouth Dakota......................                 17                 33\nTennessee.........................                140                306\nTexas.............................                551              1,287\nUtah..............................                 44                 95\nVermont...........................                 13                 25\nVirginia..........................                164                346\nWashington........................                168                342\nWest Virginia.....................                 31                 54\nWisconsin.........................                115                249\nWyoming...........................                 11                 18\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: National Restaurant Association estimates, 2005.\n\n                                 S. 298\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to make information regarding certain investments in \nthe energy sector in Iran available to the public, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in his inaugural address and again in the \nstate of the union President Bush promised to take on tyranny around \nthe world. There's one corner of the world where tyranny is the \ncurrency of the realm, and where one country stands head and shoulders \nabove the rest for its record of brutality towards its own people and \nhostility toward its neighbors. That country is Iran.\n  The lifeblood of the Iranian economy is oil. Oil accounts for 80 \npercent of Iran's export earnings, almost half of the government's \nbudget and nearly one-fifth of the country's GDP. Every time the price \nof crude oil rises $1 a barrel, Iran gains about $900 million in export \nrevenues. Crude oil prices rose around $15 over the course of 2004, \ngiving Iran a hurricane-force revenue windfall last year.\n  Although most U.S. energy companies ceased dealing with Iran when \nPresident Clinton imposed sanctions against the regime in 1995, some \nappear unable to resist the lure of investing in a country that holds \n10 percent of the world's proven oil reserves, is OPEC's second largest \nproducer and has the world's second largest natural gas reserves, \nbehind Russia.\n  In June of last year, for example, a grand jury in the U.S. issued a \nsubpoena to Halliburton seeking information on the work in Iran of its \nCayman Islands subsidiary. The Department of Justice has an ongoing \ncriminal investigation into whether Halliburton violated any laws by \ntrading with Iran through a subsidiary. Just a few days ago, \nHalliburton's CEO announced the company would withdraw its employees \nfrom Iran and end its business activities there when it fulfills its \nongoing contracts, including a $35 million gas drilling project it just \nwon last month. GE just made a similar announcement about its \nsubsidiary's activities in Iran.\n  Foreign companies seeking profits from Iran's energy reserves do not \nhave to worry about such impediments as economic sanctions. Indeed, \ntheir governments often bless and sometimes lend Them a hand to help \nwin lucrative contracts. When U.S.-based Conoco had to terminate its \n$550 million contract to develop some offshore oil and gas fields in \n1995, France's Total and Malaysia's Petronas jumped in. In March 1999, \nFrance's Elf Aquitaine and Italy's Eni/Agip won a $1 billion contract \nfor a secondary offshore recovery program. In April 1999, TotalFinaElf \nteamed up with Eni and Canada's Bow Valley Energy to develop an \noffshore oil field. Shell, BP and Lukoil are also frequently mentioned \nas being in the chase for Iranian oil and gas contracts. The Economist \nIntelligence Unit estimates Iran has attracted $15-$20 billion in \ncombined foreign investment in hydrocarbons.\n  Not only are foreign companies heavily invested in Iran's hydrocarbon \nsector, but Iran ships some 2.6 million barrels of oil a day to Japan, \nChina, South Korea, Taiwan and Europe.\n  If President Bush is serious about chasing down tyrants around the \nglobe, he should use every possible means. The legislation I am \nintroducing today, the Investor in Iran Accountability Act, would give \nthe President a powerful tool by holding accountable those\n\n[[Page S1052]]\n\nwho lend the Iranian regime crucial financial assistance by investing \nin its energy sector.\n  First, the legislation would shine a spotlight on those American \ncompanies, like Halliburton, which have used the loophole in the Iran \nsanctions act to continue to do business with Iran in the energy \nsector. The bill would require the Treasury Secretary to publish a list \nof the United States companies whose subsidiaries continue to do energy \ndeals with Iran. While I personally do not believe there should be any \nmore backdoor deals with Iran, my view is that an informed American \npublic is best equipped to hold these companies accountable.\n  Second, the legislation would hold up to the light of public \naccountability those foreign companies that have more than $1 million \ninvested in Iran's energy interests by requiring the Treasury \nDepartment to publish a list of those companies as well. Third, the \nlegislation would give American investors for the first time an idea of \nthose U.S. pension and retirement plans, mutual funds and other \nfinancial instruments that hold investments in these U.S. and foreign \ncompanies by requiring the Treasury Department to publish a list of all \npublic and private U.S. financial interests that hold more than \n$100,000-worth of investment in these companies. Finally, because \nunilateral economic sanctions penalize American companies and open the \nfield to foreign companies without inflicting any real economic pain on \nIran, the bill directs the President to negotiate an end to foreign \ninvestment in Iran's energy sector with the appropriate foreign \ngovernments.\n  Some of my colleagues will remember that in the late 1970s and 1980s \nCongress struggled with ways to force the South African regime to \nabandon apartheid. One of the most effective tools in that fight was a \npublic armed with information about which companies were doing business \nthere so that American shareholders could choose to place their money \nelsewhere. The movement by American investors to rid their portfolios \nof holdings in companies that persisted in doing business with the \napartheid regime in South African proved to be one of the most potent \ntools in the fight to end apartheid. This legislation will arm American \ninvestors with knowledge about which U.S. and foreign companies are \nsupporting Iran's critical energy sector and which U.S. entities hold \ninvestments in them. With this knowledge, it is my hope that American \ninvestors will choose not to aid and abet the Iranian regime by \ncontinuing to hold shares in companies or funds that invest in the \nIranian oil and gas sector.\n  The Iranian regime has made no secret of its desire to attract \nbillions of dollars-worth of foreign investment, particularly to the \nenergy sector. It even adopted a law in January 2003 specifically \ndesigned to attract foreign investors. Iran, which has recently \ndiscovered some new reserves of 30 billion barrels of crude oil, has \nambitious plans to expand oil production from around 3.9 million \nbarrels a day in 2004 to 5 million barrels a day in 2009. But with \ndeteriorating equipment and the natural decline rate of existing wells, \nit simply cannot achieve those goals without significant foreign help.\n  In closing, I would point out that the Securities and Exchange \nCommission has determined that significant corporate operations in \ncountries subject to U.S. economic sanctions, such as Iran, can \nrepresent a material risk to United States investors and that such \ninvestments should be properly disclosed. My bill would make sure this \ninformation is disclosed to the American public.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 299\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Investor in Iran \n     Accountability Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of State's Patterns of Global Terrorism \n     report for 2003 stated that ``Iran remained the most active \n     state sponsor of terrorism in 2003''.\n       (2) That report further stated that--\n       (A) Iran continues to provide funding, safehaven, training, \n     and weapons to known terrorist groups, including Hizballah, \n     HAMAS, the Palestine Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for \n     the Liberation of Palestine; and\n       (B) the Government of Iran's poor human rights record \n     continues to worsen.\n       (3) In 1979, in response to the Islamic Revolution in Iran \n     and the holding of United States citizens as hostages in \n     Iran, the United States imposed economic sanctions against \n     Iran that prohibit virtually all trade and investment \n     activities with Iran by citizens of the United States or \n     United States companies.\n       (4) The United States does not prohibit foreign \n     subsidiaries of United States companies from investing in \n     Iran if the foreign subsidiary is independent of the United \n     States parent company.\n       (5) A number of subsidiaries of United States companies \n     appear to be taking advantage of this condition and are \n     investing in the energy sector in Iran through such \n     subsidiaries.\n       (6) According to the Energy Information Administration of \n     the Department of Energy, Iran is the second largest oil \n     producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting \n     Countries (OPEC) and holds 10 percent of the world's proven \n     oil reserves.\n       (7) According to the Energy Information Administration, the \n     economy of Iran relies heavily on revenues generated by the \n     export of oil and such revenues account for approximately 80 \n     percent of Iran's total annual export earnings, nearly one-\n     half of the annual budget of the Government of Iran, and as \n     much as one-fifth of the gross domestic product of Iran.\n       (8) According to the Energy Information Administration, \n     Iran is actively seeking significant new foreign investment \n     in the energy sector and experts believe that with sufficient \n     investment Iran could increase its crude oil production \n     capacity significantly.\n       (9) The Department of Justice is conducting a criminal \n     investigation into whether United States companies have \n     violated any law by trading or investing with Iran through a \n     subsidiary company that may not be completely independent of \n     the parent company.\n       (10) The Securities and Exchange Commission has determined \n     that significant corporate operations in countries subject to \n     economic sanctions, such as Iran, can represent a material \n     risk to investors in the United States and that such \n     investments should be properly disclosed.\n\n     SEC. 3. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to enforce fully existing economic sanctions imposed by \n     United States law against Iran, including sanctions imposed \n     under the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 (50 U.S.C. \n     1701 note) on persons that make certain investments that \n     contribute to Iran's ability to develop and exploit its \n     petroleum and natural gas resources;\n       (2) to make available to the public information regarding a \n     United States person or a person that is controlled in fact \n     by a United States person who maintains any direct or \n     indirect investment in the energy sector in Iran; and\n       (3) to seek international cooperation in fully enforcing \n     economic sanctions against Iran and in prohibiting any direct \n     or indirect investment in Iran until Iran ceases to support \n     international terrorism.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Controlled in fact.--The term ``controlled in fact'' \n     includes--\n       (A) with respect to a corporation, the holding of at least \n     50 percent (by vote or value) of the capital structure of the \n     corporation; and\n       (B) with respect to a legal entity other than a \n     corporation, the holding of interests representing at least \n     50 percent of the capital structure of the entity.\n       (2) Energy sector.--The term ``energy sector'' means any \n     research, exploration, development, production, sale, \n     distribution, or advertising of natural gas, oil, or \n     petroleum resources or nuclear power.\n       (3) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several \n     States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and \n     other territories or possessions of the United States.\n       (4) United states person.--The term ``United States \n     person'' means any citizen of the United States, permanent \n     resident alien, or entity organized under the laws of the \n     United States or of any State, wherever located (including \n     foreign branches).\n\n     SEC. 5.

EXTENSION OF THE IRAN AND LIBYA SANCTIONS ACT OF \n                   1996.\n\n       Section 13(b) of the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 \n     (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) is amended by striking ``10'' and \n     inserting ``15''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Lugar, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Burns, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Bond, Mr. Thomas, Mr. \n        Cochran, Mr. Santorum, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Conrad, \n        and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 300. A bill to extend the temporary increase in payments under the \nmedicare program for home health services furnished in a rural area; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare \nRural Home Health Payment Fairness Act to extend the additional payment \nfor home health services in rural areas for 2 years. This 5 percent \nadd-on payment is currently scheduled to sunset on April 1st of this \nyear.\n  Home health has become an increasingly important part of our health \ncare system. The kinds of highly skilled--and often technically \ncomplex--services that our Nation's home health caregivers provide have \nenabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable older and disabled \ncitizens to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where they \nwant to be--in the comfort and security of their own homes. I have \naccompanied several of Maine's caring home health nurses on their \nvisits to some of their patients. I have seen first hand the difference \nthat they are making for Maine's elderly.\n  Surveys have shown that the delivery of home health services in rural \nareas can be as much as 12 to 15 percent more costly because of the \nextra travel time required to cover long distances between patients, \nhigher transportation expenses, and other factors. Because of the \nlonger travel times, rural caregivers are unable to make as many visits \nin a day as their urban counterparts. The Executive Director of the \nVisiting Nurses of Aroostook in Northern Maine, where I am from, tells \nme her agency covers 6,600 square miles with a population of only \n73,000. Her costs are understandably much higher than other agencies' \ndue to the long distances her staff must drive to see clients. \nMoreover, her staff is not able to see as many patients in one day as \nshe would like.\n  Agencies in rural areas are also frequently smaller than their urban \ncounterparts, which means that their relative costs are higher. Smaller \nagencies with fewer patients and fewer visits mean that fixed costs, \nparticularly those associated with meeting regulatory requirements, are \nspread over a much smaller number of patients and visits, increasing \noverall per-patient and per-visit costs.\n  Moreover, in many rural areas, home health agencies are the primary \ncaregivers for homebound beneficiaries with limited access to \ntransportation. These rural patients often require more time and care \nthan their urban counterparts, and are understandably more expensive \nfor agencies to serve. If the extra rural payment is not extended, \nagencies may be forced to make decisions not to accept rural patients \nwith greater care needs. That could translate into less access to \nhealth care for ill, homebound seniors. The result also would likely be \nthat these seniors would be hospitalized more frequently and would have \nto seek care in nursing homes, adding considerable cost to the system.\n  Failure to extend the rural add-on payment will only put more \npressure on rural home health agencies that are already operating on \nvery narrow margins and could force some of these agencies to close \ntheir doors altogether. Many home health agencies operating in rural \nareas are the only home health providers in large geographic areas. If \nany of these agencies were forced to close, the Medicare patients in \nthat region could lose all their access to home care.\n  The bipartisan legislation that I am introducing today with Senators \nFeingold, Lugar, Bond, Landrieu, Burns, Murkowski, Thomas, Cochran, \nSantorum, Lincoln, Jeffords, Conrad and Leahy will help to ensure that \nMedicare patients in rural areas continue to have access to the home \nhealth services they need. I urge all of our colleagues to join us as \ncosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. \n        Sununu):\n  S. 301. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide \nassistance in implementing cultural heritage, conservation, and \nrecreational activities in the Connecticut River watershed of the \nStates of New Hampshire and Vermont; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the Upper \nConnecticut River Partnership Act. This legislation will help bring \nrecognition to New England's largest river ecosystem and one of our \nNation's fourteen American Heritage Rivers.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to help the communities along the \nriver protect and enhance their rich cultural history, economic \nvitality, and the environmental integrity of the river.\n  From its origin in the mountains of northern New Hampshire, the \nConnecticut River runs over 400 miles and eventually empties into Long \nIsland Sound. The river forms a natural boundary between my home state \nof Vermont and New Hampshire, and travels through the States of \nMassachusetts and Connecticut. The river and surrounding valley have \nlong shaped and influenced development in the New England region. This \nriver is one of America's earliest developed rivers, with European \nsettlements going back over 350 years. The industrial revolution \nblossomed in the Connecticut River Valley, supported by new \ntechnologies such as canals and mills run by hydropower.\n  I am pleased that the entire Senate delegations from Vermont and New \nHampshire have cosponsored this bill. For years, our offices and our \nStates have worked together to help communities on both sides of the \nriver develop local partnerships to protect the Connecticut River \nvalley of Vermont and New Hampshire. And, while great improvements have \nbeen made to the river, its overall health remains threatened by water \nand air pollution, habitat loss, hydroelectric dams, and invasive \nspecies such as the zebra mussel.\n  Historically, the people throughout the Upper Connecticut River \nValley have functioned cooperatively and the river serves to unite \nVermont and New Hampshire communities economically, culturally and \nenvironmentally.\n  Citizens on both sides of the river know just how special this region \nis and have worked side by side for years to protect it. Efforts have \nbeen underway for some time to restore the Atlantic salmon fishery, \nprotect threatened and endangered species, and support urban riverfront \nrevitalization\n  In 1993, Vermont and New Hampshire came together to create the \nConnecticut River Joint Commissions--a unique partnership between the \nstates, local businesses, all levels of government within the two \nstates and citizens from all walks of life. This partnership helps \ncoordinate the efforts of towns, watershed managers and other local \ngroups to implement the Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan. \nThis Plan has become the blueprint for how communities along the river \ncan work with one another with Vermont and New Hampshire and with\n\n[[Page S1054]]\n\nthe federal government to protect the river's resources.\n  The Upper Connecticut River Partnership Act would help carry out the \nrecommendations of the Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan, \nwhich was developed under New Hampshire law with the active \nparticipation of Vermont citizens and communities.\n  This Act would also provide the Secretary of the Interior with the \nability to assist the States of New Hampshire and Vermont with \ntechnical and financial aid for the Upper Connecticut River Valley \nthrough the Connecticut River Joint Commissions. The Act would also \nassist local communities with cultural heritage outreach and education \nprograms while enriching the recreational activities already active in \nthe Connecticut River Watershed of Vermont and New Hampshire.\n  Lastly, the bill will require that the Secretary of the Interior \nestablish a Connecticut River Grants and Technical Assistance Program \nto help local community groups develop new projects as well as build on \nexisting ones to enhance the river basin.\n  Over the next few years, I hope this bill will help bring renewed \nrecognition and increased efforts to conserve the Connecticut River as \none of our nation's great natural and economic resources.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 301\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Upper Connecticut River \n     Partnership Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the upper Connecticut River watershed in the States of \n     New Hampshire and Vermont is a scenic region of historic \n     villages located in a working landscape of farms, forests, \n     and the mountainous headwaters and broad fertile floodplains \n     of New England's longest river, the Connecticut River;\n       (2) the River provides outstanding fish and wildlife \n     habitat, recreation, and hydropower generation for the New \n     England region;\n       (3) the upper Connecticut River watershed has been \n     recognized by Congress as part of the Silvio 0. Conte \n     National Fish and Wildlife Refuge, established by the Silvio \n     O. Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge Act (16 U.S.C. \n     668dd note; Public Law 102-212);\n       (4) the demonstrated interest in stewardship of the River \n     by the citizens living in the watershed led to the \n     Presidential designation of the River as 1 of 14 American \n     Heritage Rivers on July 30, 1998;\n       (5) the River is home to the bistate Connecticut River \n     Scenic Byway, which will foster heritage tourism in the \n     region;\n       (6) each of the legislatures of the States of Vermont and \n     New Hampshire has established a commission for the \n     Connecticut River watershed, and the 2 commissions, known \n     collectively as the ``Connecticut River Joint Commissions''--\n       (A) have worked together since 1989; and\n       (B) serve as the focal point for cooperation between \n     Federal agencies, States, communities, and citizens;\n       (7) in 1997, as directed by the legislatures, the \n     Connecticut River Joint Commissions, with the substantial \n     involvement of 5 bistate local river subcommittees appointed \n     to represent riverfront towns, produced the 6-volume \n     Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan, to be used as a \n     blueprint in educating agencies, communities, and the public \n     in how to be good neighbors to a great river;\n       (8) this year, by Joint Legislative Resolution, the \n     legislatures have requested that Congress provide for \n     continuation of cooperative partnerships and support for the \n     Connecticut River Joint Commissions from the New England \n     Federal Partners for Natural Resources, a consortium of \n     Federal agencies, in carrying out recommendations of the \n     Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan;\n       (9) this Act effectuates certain recommendations of the \n     Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan that are most \n     appropriately directed by the States through the Connecticut \n     River Joint Commissions, with assistance from the National \n     Park Service and United States Fish and Wildlife Service; and\n       (10) where implementation of those recommendations involves \n     partnership with local communities and organizations, support \n     for the partnership should be provided by the Secretary.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to authorize the \n     Secretary to provide to the States of New Hampshire and \n     Vermont (including communities in those States), through the \n     Connecticut River Joint Commissions, technical and financial \n     assistance for management of the River.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n       (2) State.--The term ``State'' means--\n       (A) the State of New Hampshire; or\n       (B) the State of Vermont.\n\n     SEC. 4. CONNECTICUT RIVER GRANTS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall establish a \n     Connecticut River Grants and Technical Assistance Program to \n     provide grants and technical assistance to State and local \n     governments, nonprofit organizations, and the private sector \n     to carry out projects for the conservation, restoration, and \n     interpretation of historic, cultural, recreational, and \n     natural resources in the Connecticut River watershed.\n       (b) Criteria.--The Secretary, in consultation with the \n     Connecticut River Joint Commissions, shall develop criteria \n     for determining the eligibility of applicants for, and \n     reviewing and prioritizing applications for, grants or \n     technical assistance under the program.\n       (c) Cost-sharing.--\n       (1) Federal share.--The Federal share of the cost of \n     carrying out a grant project under subsection (a) shall not \n     exceed 75 percent.\n       (2) Non-federal share.--The non-Federal share of the cost \n     of a project may be provided in the form of in-kind \n     contributions of services or materials.\n\n     SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     Act $1,000,000 for each fiscal year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Frist, and \n        Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 302. A bill to make improvements in the Foundation for the \nNational Institutes of Health; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join Senator Frist, \nSenator Enzi, Senator Gregg, and Senator Bingaman in introducing the \nFoundation for the National Institutes of Health Improvement Act.\n  Our bill makes several improvements in the 1990 law that established \nthe Foundation. Most significant, it assures the Foundation at least \n$500,000 annually from the NIH to support its administrative and \noperating expenses. These funds will enable the Foundation to use its \nown resources for the actual support of projects to strengthen NIH \nprograms, rather than raise money for its own expenses. As the bill \nmakes clear, the NIH Director and the Commissioner of Food and Drugs \nare ex officio members of the Foundation's board of directors.\n  Congress established the Foundation to raise private funds to support \nthe research of the NIH. For every dollar the Foundation received from \nthe NIH in 2003, it raised $426 in private funds. Since its creation, \nthe Foundation has raised $270 million, or $68 in private support for \nevery dollar from the NIH.\n  The Foundation is currently managing 37 programs supported by $270 \nmillion generated from private contributions. For example, the Edmond \nJ. Safra Family Lodge on the NIH campus gives families of patients \nreceiving in-patient treatment at the NIH Clinical Center a place to \nstay, at no cost to them.\n  In addition, the Foundation has formed partnerships with the NIH to \ndevelop new cancer treatments, to identify biochemical signs of \nosteoarthritis and Alzheimer's Disease, and to build on the promise of \ngenomics. Through a public-private partnership, the Foundation helped \naccelerate the sequencing of the mouse genome. The Foundation is also \ncollecting private funds to study drugs in children. In 2003, Bill \nGates announced a gift to the Foundation of $200 million over the next \n10 years to support research on global health priorities. Clearly, the \nFoundation's partnership with the NIH will grow productively in the \ncoming years.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this legislation, so \nthat the Foundation can continue its effective support of the work and \nmission of the NIH. \n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 302\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Foundation for the National \n     Institutes of Health Improvement Act''.\n\n[[Page S1055]]\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \ncertain interstate conduct gng to exotic animals; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Sportsmanship \nin Hunting Act of 2005. This bill would prohibit the barbaric and \nunsporting practice of ``canned hunts.'' I am pleased to be joined by \nmy cosponsors, Senators Biden, Kennedy, Levin, Corzine, Feingold, Kohl, \nDurbin, Schumer, Mikulski, and Akaka.\n  Canned hunts, also called canned shoots, take place on private land \nunder circumstances that virtually assure a customer of a kill. \nAlthough they are advertised under a variety of names, such as hunting \npreserves or game ranches, canned hunts have two things in common: they \ncharge a fee for killing an animal; and they violate the generally \naccepted practices of the hunting community, which are based on the \nconcept of ``fair chase.'' Some canned hunts specialize in native \nspecies, such as white-tailed deer or elk, while others deal in \nexotic--non-native--animals that are either bred on-site or bought from \ndealers or breeders. Exotic animals include surplus animals bought from \nwild animal parks, circuses, and petting zoos. Many canned hunts offer \nboth native and exotic species to their customers. The Humane Society \nof the United States estimates that there are more than 1000 canned \nhunt operations in at least 25 States.\n  Canned hunts cater to persons who lack the time, and sometimes the \nskill, for normal sports hunting. They do not require skill in tracking \nor shooting. For a price, many canned hunts quarantee a shooter a kill \nof the animal of his or her choice. A wild boar ``kill'' may sell for \nup to $1,000, a water buffalo for $3,500, and a red deer for up to \n$6,000.\n  The ``hunt'' of these tame animals occurs within a fenced enclosure, \nleaving the animal virtually no chance for escape. Fed and cared for by \nhumans, these animals have often lost their instinctive impulse to flee \nfrom shooters who ``stalk'' them. In addition to fencing, canned hunts \nuse other practices to assure their customers a kill. For example, they \nmay bait them, using feeding stations to attract animals and make them \neasy targets from nearby shooting blinds or stands. These practices are \nprohibited by many State game commissions.\n  Canned hunts violate the principles of the sport of hunting. The \nBoone and Crockett Club, a hunting organization founded by Teddy \nRoosevelt, defines ``fair chase'' as the ``ethical, sportsmanlike, and \nlawful pursuit and taking of any free-ranging wild, native North \nAmerican game animal in a manner that does not give the hunter an \nimproper advantage over such animals.'' Surely exotic animals held in \ncanned hunt facilities can in no way be considered ``free-ranging,'' \nand the hunters at such facilities clearly have an enormous ``improper \nadvantage'' over animals. As a result, many real hunters are opposed to \nthe practice of canned hunting, believing it to make a mockery of their \nsport.\n  Canned hunts are strongly condemned by animal protection groups. \nOften, in order to preserve the animal as a ``trophy,'' customers will \nfire multiple shots into nonvital organs, condemning the animal to a \nslow and painful death. Because the animal cannot escape, the shooter \nhas the time to place his shots. The Fund for animals has launched a \nnational campaign against what it calls a ``cruel, unsporting, and \negregious type of hunting.'' The Humane Society says that ``There is no \nmore repugnant hunting practice than shooting tame, exotic mammals in \nfenced enclosures for a fee in order to obtain a trophy.'' The group \nbelieves that Federal legislation is needed ``to halt the cruel and \nunsportsmanlike business of canned hunts.''\n\n  In addition to being unethical, canned hunts may pose a serious \nhealth and safety threat to domestic livestock and native wildlife. \nAccidental escapes of exotic animals from game ranches is not uncommon, \nposing a danger to nearby livestock and indigenous wildlife. A dire \nthreat to native deer and elk populations in this country is chronic \nwasting disease, the deer equivalent of cow disease. In some states, \nexperts believe that canned hunts, with their high concentrations of \nanimals, are encouraging transmission of this disease.\n  In recognition of these threats, several States have banned canned \nhunting of mammals. Unfortunately, most States lack laws to outlaw this \npractice. Because interstate commerce in exotic animals is common, \nfederal legislation is essential to control these cruel practices.\n  My bill is essentially the same as legislation that was introduced in \nthe 108th Congress, S. 2731, and legislation reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee in the 107th Congress and sponsored by Senator Biden, S. \n1655. It is similar to legislation that I introduced in the 106th, S. \n1345, 105th, S. 995, and 104th, S. 1493, Congresses. The legislation \nthat I am introducing today will target only canned hunt facilities \nthat allow the hunting of exotic (nonnative) mammals. It is important \nto note what the bill does and does not do: 1. The bill does not \nregulate the hunting of native mammals, such as white-tail deer; 2. The \nbill does not regulate the hunting of any birds; 3. The bill protects \nonly exotic (non-native) mammals in areas where they do not have an \nopportunity to avoid hunters, smaller than 1000 acres; and 4. The bill \nregulates the conduct of persons who operate canned hunts or traffic in \nexotic mammals used in such hunts, not the hunters who patronize canned \nhunt facilities. In summary, my bill would merely ban the transport and \ntrade of non-native, exotic mammals for the purpose of staged trophy \nhunts.\n  The idea of a defenseless animal meeting a violent end as the target \nof a canned hunt is, at the very least, distasteful to many Americans. \nIn an era when we are seeking to curb violence in our culture, canned \nhunts are certainly one form of gratuitous brutality that does not \nbelong in society. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation, which will help end this needless practice.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 304\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sportsmanship in Hunting Act \n     of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The ethic of hunting involves the consideration of fair \n     chase, which allows the animal the opportunity to avoid the \n     hunter.\n       (2) At more than 1,000 commercial canned hunt operations \n     across the country, trophy\n\n[[Page S1056]]\n\n     hunters pay a fee to shoot captive exotic animals, from \n     African lions to giraffes and blackbuck antelope, in fenced-\n     in enclosures.\n       (3) Clustered in a captive setting at unusually high \n     densities, confined exotic animals attract disease more \n     readily than more widely dispersed native species who roam \n     freely.\n       (4) The transportation of captive exotic animals to \n     commercial canned hunt operations can facilitate the spread \n     of disease across great distances.\n       (5) The regulation of the transport and treatment of exotic \n     animals on shooting preserves falls outside the traditional \n     domains of State agriculture departments and State fish and \n     game agencies.\n       (6) This Act is limited in its purpose and will not limit \n     the licensed hunting of any native mammals or any native or \n     exotic birds.\n       (7) This Act does not aim to criticize those hunters who \n     pursue animals that are not enclosed within a fence.\n       (8) This Act does not attempt to prohibit slaughterhouse \n     activities, nor does it aim to prohibit the routine \n     euthanasia of domesticated farm animals.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to recruit \nvolunteers to assist with or facilitate the activities of various \nagencies and offices of the Department of the Interior; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Department of \nInterior Volunteer Recruitment Act of 2005. This bill would allow the \nDepartment of the Interior to recruit and use volunteers in the Bureau \nof Indian Affairs and the Offices of the Secretary. It also addresses \nsome problems with existing volunteer authorities at the Bureau of \nReclamation and the U.S. Geological Survey.\n  The Department of the Interior is a leader in the Federal Government \nin providing opportunities for volunteer service, and this bill \nsignificantly enhances our ability to provide volunteer opportunities \nto interested Americans. The bill provides for appropriate ethics and \ntort claims coverage for DOI volunteers and ensures against the \ndisplacement of employees by volunteers. Last, the bill contains \nprovisions which explicitly protect private property rights.\n  By making it easier for people to volunteer in more Department of the \nInterior bureaus, this legislation contributes a crucial piece to the \nPresident's call to all Americans to volunteer in their communities and \nto the Secretary's Take Pride in America program, which is working in \nconcert with that call. There is wide support for the bill and there is \nno known opposition.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this excellent \nbill through the legislative process quickly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Enzi, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n        Talent, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Hatch, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, and \n        Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 306. A bill to prohibit discrimination on the basis of genetic \ninformation with respect to health insurance and employment; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Genetic \nInformation Nondiscrimination Act of 2005 and I am joined in doing so \nby a number of my colleagues including, Majority Leader Frist, Senator \nJeffords, Senator Gregg as well as the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Senate HELP Committee, Senators Enzi and Kennedy. The bill we are \nintroducing today is the result of a collaborative effort spanning more \nthan 8 years and I know I speak for my colleagues when I say that it is \nmy hope that this bill will again receive the unanimous support of the \nSenate this year and that this will allow the House of Representatives \nto act swiftly in considering this bill this session.\n  This day has been a long time coming and, over the years, we have not \nonly retraced our steps in some respects but--most importantly--forged \nahead on new ground.\n  Since April of 1996, when I introduced for the first time the Genetic \nInformation Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act, science has \ncontinued to hurtle forward, further opening the door to early \ndetection and medical intervention through the discovery and \nidentification of specific genes linked to diseases like breast cancer, \nHuntington's Disease, glaucoma, colon cancer, and cystic fibrosis. That \n1996 bill recognized that with progress in the field of genetics \naccelerating at a breathtaking pace, we needed to ensure that with the \nscientific advances to come, we would advance the treatment and \nprevention of disease--without advancing a new basis for \ndiscrimination.\n  The following year, with the commitment of Senators Frist and \nJeffords to addressing this issue, I introduced a bill to ensure we \nwould effectively address the need for protections against genetic \ndiscrimination in the health insurance industry. In turn, that bill was \nthe basis for an amendment offered by Senator Jeffords, to the fiscal \nyear 2001 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services \nAppropriations bill which passed the Senate by a vote of 58-40.\n  While that victory was a notable step forward, unfortunately, it was \nnot followed by the enactment of our bill. It did, however, respark the \ndebate--which helped lay the foundation for our subsequent efforts.\n  Indeed, in March 2002, I was again joined by Senators Frist and \nJeffords in introducing an updated version of our bill with the new \nsupport of Senators Gregg and Enzi. That bill not only addressed what \nhad become the real threat of employment discrimination but also \ncaptured the changing world of science as this was the first bill to \ninclude what we had learned with the completion of the Genome Project.\n  I think back to when Representative Louise Slaughter and I had first \nintroduced our bills in the 103rd Congress, and the completion of the \nGenome still seemed years away. Yet it was only four years later when \neverything changed with the unveiling of the first working draft of our \nentire genetic code. As we had known--and as with so many other \nscientific breakthroughs in history--the completion of the Genome not \nonly brought about\n\n[[Page S1057]]\n\nthe prospect of medical advances, such as improved detection and \nearlier intervention, but also the potential for harm and abuse. Every \nday since--absent enactment of a law such as the bill we are \nintroducing--has been a day the American people have been left \nunprotected from this type of discrimination. Every day since we have \nleft the full potential of the Genome untapped.\n  The very real fear of repercussions from one's genetic makeup was \nbrought home to me through the real life experience of one of my \nconstituents, Bonnie Lee Tucker. In 1997, Bonnie Lee wrote me about her \nfear of having the BRCA test for breast cancer, even though she has \nnine women in her immediate family who were diagnosed with breast \ncancer, and she herself is a survivor. She wrote to me about her fear \nof having the BRCA test, because she worried it will ruin her \ndaughter's ability to obtain insurance in the future. And Bonnie Lee \nisn't the only one who has this fear. When the National Institutes of \nHealth offered women genetic testing, nearly 32 percent of those who \nwere offered a test for breast cancer risk declined to take it citing \nconcerns about health insurance discrimination. What good is scientific \nprogress if it cannot be applied to those who would most benefit?\n  I recall the testimony before Congress of Dr. Francis Collins, the \nDirector of the National Human Genome Research Institute, without whom \nwe wouldn't have reached this day. In speaking of the next step for \nthose involved in the Genome project, he explained that the project's \nscientists were engaged in a major endeavor to ``uncover the \nconnections between particular genes and particular diseases,'' to \napply the knowledge they just unlocked. In order to do this, Dr. \nCollins said, ``we need a vigorous research enterprise with the \ninvolvement of large numbers of individuals, so that we can draw more \nprecise connections between a particular spelling of a gene and a \nparticular outcome.'' Well, this effort cannot be successful if people \nare afraid of possible repercussions of their participation in genetic \ntesting.\n  The bottom line is that, given the advances in science, there are two \nseparate issues at hand. The first is to restrict discrimination by \nhealth insurers. The second is to prevent employment discrimination \nbased simply upon an individual's genetic information.\n  The bill we are introducing again today addresses both these issues \nbased on the firm foundation of current law. With regard to health \ninsurance, the issues are clear and familiar, and something the Senate \nhas debated before, in the context of the consideration of larger \nprivacy issues. Indeed, as Congress considered what is now the Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, we also addressed \nthe issues of privacy of medical information.\n  Moreover, any legislation that seeks to fully address these issues \nmust consider the interaction of the new protections with the privacy \nrule which was mandated by HIPAA--and our legislation does just that. \nSpecifically, we clarify the protections of genetic information as well \nas information about the request or receipt of genetic tests, from \nbeing used by the insurer against the patient.\n  Because the fact of the matter is, genetic information only detects \nthe potential for a genetically linked disease or disorder--and \npotential does not equal a diagnosis of disease. At the same time, it \nis critical that this information be available to doctors and other \nhealth care professionals when necessary to diagnose, or treat, an \nillness. This is a distinction that begs our acknowledgment, as we \ndiscuss ways to protect patients from potential discriminatory \npractices by insurers.\n  On the subject of employment discrimination, unlike our legislative \nhistory on debating health privacy matters, the issues surrounding \nprotecting genetic information from workplace discrimination is not as \nextensive. To that end, our bipartisan bill creates these protections \nin the workplace--and there should be no question of this need.\n  As demonstrated by the Burlington Northern case, the threat of \nemployment discrimination is very real, and therefore it is essential \nthat we take this information off the table, so to speak, before the \nuse of this information becomes widespread. While Congress has not yet \ndebated this specific type of employment discrimination, we have a \ngreat deal of employment case law and legislative history on which to \nbuild.\n\n  Indeed, as we considered the need for this type of protection, we \nagreed that we must extend current law discrimination protections to \ngenetic information. We reviewed current employment discrimination law \nand considered what sort of remedies people would have for instances of \ngenetic discrimination and if these remedies would be different from \nthose available to people under current law--for instance under the ADA \nor the EEOC. The bill we introduce today creates new protections by \nparalleling current law and clarifies the remedies available to victims \nof discrimination. Ensuring that regardless of whether a person is \ndiscriminated against because of their religion, their race or their \nDNA, these people will all receive the same strong protections under \nthe law.\n  It has been more than 3 years since the completion of the working \ndraft of the Human Genome. Like a book which is never opened, the \nwonders of the Human Genome are useless unless people are willing to \ntake advantage of it. This bill is the product of more than 16 months \nof bipartisan negotiations and is a shining example of what we can \naccomplish if we set aside partisan differences in order to address the \nchallenges facing the American people. Certainly this bill was only \npossible due to the commitment of each of the Members here today to \nwork together to come to a successful end and for that I am grateful.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill as they have in the past \nand that its broad support will be seen as a clarion call by the House \nof Representatives that it is time for us to do our part so that the \nPresident can sign this bill into law and finally ensure the American \npublic is protected from this newest form of discrimination.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Snowe, \nSenator Prist, Senator Gregg, and Senator Enzi in introducing the \nGenetic Information Non-Discrimination Act. Today we take another step \nin our national journey to a fairer and more just America.\n  I particularly commend our colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, for \nher dedication to this vital issue. Senator Snowe first proposed \nlegislation on genetic discrimination in 1996. Hopefully, the \nbipartisan momentum we have built up in recent years will produce a \nconsensus bill we can enact into law this year.\n  Two years ago, we celebrated an accomplishment that once seemed \nunimaginable--deciphering the entire sequence of the human DNA code. \nThis amazing accomplishment will affect the 21st century as profoundly \nas the invention of the computer or the splitting of the atom affected \nthe 20th century. But the extraordinary promise of science to improve \nhealth and relieve suffering is in jeopardy if our laws fail to provide \nadequate protections against misuse of genetic information.\n  Our bipartisan legislation prohibits health insurers from using \ngenetic information to deny health coverage or raise premiums. It bars \nemployers from using genetic information to make employment decisions.\n  Few kinds of information are more personal or more information than a \nperson's genetic makeup. This information should not be shared by \ninsurers or employers or be used in decisions about health coverage or \na job. It should only be used by patients and their doctors to help \nthem make the best possible decisions on diagnosis and treatment.\n  Breakthroughs in genetic science are bringing remarkable new \nopportunities for improving health care. But it also carries the danger \nthat genetic information will be used as a basis for discrimination. I \nhope we can all agree that discrimination on the basis of a person's \ngenetic traits is as unacceptable as discrimination on the basis of \nrace or religion. No American should be denied health insurance or \nfired from a job because of a genetic test.\n  The vast potential of genetic knowledge to improve health care may go \nunfulfilled, if patients fear that information about their genetic \ncharacteristics will be used against them. Congress has a \nresponsibility to guarantee\n\n[[Page S1058]]\n\nthat genetic information remains private and is not used for improper \npurposes.\n  Experts in genetics are united in calling for strong protections to \nprevent this misuse and abuse of science. The HHS advisory panel on \ngenetic testing--with experts in law, science, medicine, and business--\nrecommended unambiguously that Federal legislation is needed to \nprohibit discrimination in employment or health insurance based on \ngenetic information. Last fall, witnesses testified about their first \nhand accounts of genetic discrimination. Heidi Williams' children were \ndenied health insurance because they were carriers for a genetic \ndisorder. Phil Hardt's children feared discrimination so much that they \nsought genetic tests in secret, paying out of their own pockets and not \nusing their real names.\n  Francis Collins, the leader of the NIH project to sequence the human \ngenome, said, ``Genetic information and genetic technology can be used \nin ways that are fundamentally unjust. Already, people have lost their \njobs, lost their health insurance, and lost their economic well-being \nbecause of the misuse of genetic information.''\n  Genetic tests are becoming even cheaper and more widely available. If \nwe don't ban discrimination now, it may soon be routine for employers \nto use genetic tests to deny jobs to employees, based on their risk for \ndisease.\n  When Congress enacts clear protections against genetic discrimination \nin employment health insurance, all Americans will be able to enjoy the \nbenefits of genetic research, free from the fear that their personal \ngenetic information will be used against them. If Congress fails to see \nthat genetic information is used only for legitimate purposes, we will \nsquander the vast potential of genetic research to improve the Nation's \nhealth.\n  Effective enforcement will be essential. It makes no sense to enact \nlegislation giving the American people the promise of protection \nagainst this form of discrimination and then deny them the reality of \nthat protection.\n  President Bush recognizes the seriousness of this problem, and \nsupports a ban on genetic discrimination. In his words, ``genetic \ninformation should be an opportunity to prevent and treat disease, not \nan excuse for discrimination. Just as our Nation addressed \ndiscrimination based on race, we must now prevent discrimination based \non genetic information.'' I commend the President for his support, and \nI look forward to working with the administration to see that a strong \nbill on genetic discrimination is signed into law this year.\n  It is time for Congress to act, and I urge the Senate to do so \nwithout delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 307. A bill to amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of \n2002 to extend national dairy market loss payments; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President I rise today to introduce a bill to \nextend the Milk Income Loss Contract, MILC program, the MILC Extension \nAct. In the 106th Congress, I called for a programmatic solution to \nmarket instability, when I introduced S. 2706, the National Dairy \nFarmers Fairness Act of 2000. S. 2706 was designed to eliminate the \nneed for Congress to provide supplemental market loss payments to dairy \nproducers by setting up a counter cyclical payment based on the market \nprice of class III milk. Elements of S. 2706 were later borrowed to \nconstruct the MILC program, which was included in the 2002 Farm Bill.\n  My bill would extend MILC for 2 years at current support levels. All \ncommodity support programs, except MILC, were authorized for the full \nlength of the current Farm Bill. As constructed, the MILC program \nprovides a safety net for all dairy producers by providing a payment \nwhenever the minimum monthly market price for Class I milk price in \nBoston falls below $16.94 per hundredweight, cwt. MILC represents a \nbroad regional compromise and while it is not perfect, I recognize its \nimportance as a safety net for dairy producers. As such I am working to \nextend the program until 2007 when Congress will consider the next Farm \nBill.\n  Budget constraints and compliance with our trade agreements requires \nus to reexamine the role of the federal government in agriculture. \nDuring this session of Congress I will engage in a focused effort to \ndecrease direct payments and countercyclical programs. These \ndiscussions and reforms will be forthcoming, but allowing an important \nprogram that acts as a safety net for small farmers to expire would be \ntoo drastic of a first step.\n  Others have suggested that we grow this program. I will be steadfast \nin my opposition to growing this program. Growing the size of this \nprogram sends a potentially dangerous signal to our producers. At a \ntime when the experts are predicting that the market may soften over \ncoming months, Congress should not send a signal to producers to \nincrease production. Dairy producers should look to the market, not to \nWashington, DC, for guidance as they manage their businesses.\n  As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee who represents the \nfourth largest dairy producing state in the nation, I am committed to \npreserving the viability of Pennsylvania's dairy farmers. This \nlegislative proposal represents a commonsense approach in the often-\nheated debate of dairy policy. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues, the President and the Secretary of Agriculture to extend \nthis important program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/07/senate-section/article/S1058-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1058-S1064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 38--COMMENDING THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ ON THE JANUARY 30, \n                        2005, NATIONAL ELECTIONS\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Biden Mr. Akaka, Mr. \nAlexander, Mr. Allard, Mr. Allen, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, \nMr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \nBurns, Mr. Burr, Mr. Byrd, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Carper, Mr. Chafee, Mr. \nChambliss, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Coleman, Ms. \nCollins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Craig, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \nDayton, Mr. DeMint, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \nDorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, \nMr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, \nMrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \nJohnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. \nLott, Mr. Martinez, Mr. McCain, Mr. McConnell, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. \nMurkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, \nMr. Obama, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \nSalazar, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \nShelby, Mr. Smith, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Stevens, \nMr. Sununu, Mr. Talent, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Thune, Mr. Vitter, Mr. \nVoinovich, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S. Res. 38\n\n       Whereas on January 30, 2005, Iraq held its first democratic \n     elections in nearly half a century;\n       Whereas after more than 3 decades of enduring harsh \n     repression and lack of freedom, millions cast ballots on \n     January 30, 2005, to determine the future of their country in \n     an election widely recognized as a success by the \n     international community;\n       Whereas the hard work, contributions, vision, and \n     sacrifices of the Interim Iraqi Government in undertaking \n     major political, economic, social, and legal reforms and, in \n     conjunction with the efforts of the Iraqi Independent \n     Electoral Commission, in ensuring that Iraq held nationwide \n     elections on January 30, and in not being intimidated by \n     terrorist and insurgent forces resulted in the successful \n     elections of January 30;\n       Whereas on January 30, President George W. Bush stated that \n     the election in Iraq was a ``milestone'' in Iraq's history \n     and that the ``world is hearing the voice of freedom from the \n     center of the Middle East'';\n       Whereas the January 30 election is another step in the \n     process of developing a free and democratic Iraq;\n       Whereas the people of Iraq cast votes to freely choose the \n     275-member Transitional National Assembly that will serve as \n     the national legislature of Iraq for a transition period, \n     name a Presidency Council, and select a Prime Minister;\n\n[[Page S1059]]\n\n       Whereas the Transitional National Assembly will draft the \n     permanent constitution of Iraq;\n       Whereas the election establishes a credible process for \n     governing Iraq under a mandate from the majority of the \n     people of Iraq for a new Iraq in which all communities are \n     represented, minority rights are respected, and violence is \n     not tolerated;\n       Whereas an estimated 14,300,000 Iraqis were registered to \n     vote at more than 5,000 polling stations across Iraq and in \n     14 other countries;\n       Whereas, with 256 political entities composed of 18,900 \n     Iraqi candidates standing for election in 20 different \n     elections (the national election, 18 provincial elections, \n     and Kurdistan Regional government election), voter turnout \n     demonstrated widespread enthusiasm for self-determination;\n       Whereas Iraqi security forces joined with United States and \n     Coalition forces in providing security for the elections;\n       Whereas despite these efforts, many Sunni Iraqis in some \n     provinces did not vote because of fear and intimidation;\n       Whereas the United Nations Electoral Assistance Division \n     and other nongovernmental organizations provided technical \n     support and assistance to the Independent Electoral \n     Commission of Iraq and the Iraqi Interim Government;\n       Whereas the people of Iraq will again exercise their \n     popular will through a national referendum in October 2005, \n     when the Transitional National Assembly presents a draft \n     constitution for Iraq;\n       Whereas national elections based on that constitution are \n     then to be held in December 2005 to choose an Iraqi \n     government in a manner prescribed by the constitution;\n       Whereas it is in the interest of Iraq, the Middle East, the \n     United States, and the international community that Iraq \n     successfully transitions to a functioning democratic state, \n     as this may serve as a catalyst for peace and stability in \n     the region; and\n       Whereas the Iraqi government needs assistance from the \n     broader international community to further develop governing \n     capacity, train effective security forces who can defeat the \n     terrorists and insurgents and maintain law and order, improve \n     economic conditions, and maintain essential services, such as \n     the delivery of electricity, gasoline, and water: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the people of Iraq on the successful \n     nationwide elections held in Iraq on January 30, 2005, and \n     recognizes the elections as another step in developing a free \n     and democratic Iraq;\n       (2) recognizes the desire for freedom and liberty of all \n     individuals who served as candidates, campaign workers, \n     United Nations and Iraqi election officials, and voters in \n     the January 30, 2005, elections in Iraq and congratulates the \n     new members of the Transitional National Assembly and the \n     leaders of the provincial and regional governments;\n       (3) urges the new leadership of Iraq to move forward with \n     drafting the constitution, upholding the law, and holding a \n     referendum on the new constitution in October 2005;\n       (4) encourages participation of all groups and communities \n     in the drafting of a new constitution and the formation of a \n     permanent government for Iraq;\n       (5) recognizes and honors the sacrifices made for freedom \n     and liberty in Iraq by the people of Iraq;\n       (6) commends the Iraqi security forces, and the U.S. armed \n     forces and Coalition forces, who ensured the elections could \n     be conducted in a relatively safe, secure, and credible \n     manner;\n       (7) condemns and deplores all acts of violence and \n     intimidation against the people of Iraq by members of the \n     former Iraqi regime, insurgents, and other extremists and \n     terrorists;\n       (8) supports the establishment of a fully democratic Iraqi \n     government that respects the rule of law, promotes ethnic and \n     religious tolerance, respects the rights of women and all \n     minorities, provides security and stability for the people of \n     Iraq, and has the capacity to maintain basic services such as \n     the delivery of sufficient electricity, gasoline, and water;\n       (9) believes that it is in the interest of the people of \n     Iraq, the Middle East, the United States, and the \n     international community that Iraq transitions to a fully \n     democratic state, and that doing so may serve as a catalyst \n     for peace and stability in the region;\n       (10) calls on the international community, particularly \n     Arab states, countries with predominantly Muslim populations, \n     and all North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, to \n     provide military and police personnel to train and assist \n     Iraqi security forces and to otherwise assist in the \n     political and economic development of Iraq;\n       (11) encourages the newly-elected transitional government \n     of Iraq to ensure that all Iraqis, including members of the \n     Sunni religious community, are represented in the \n     Constitution-writing process and in the new Iraqi cabinet to \n     improve the prospects for national unity and consensus; and\n       (12) looks forward to welcoming Iraq into the world \n     community of democratic nations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 39--APOLOGING TO THE VICTIMS OF LYNCHING AND THE \n  DESCENDANTS OF THOSE VICTIMS FOR THE FAILURE OF THE SENATE TO ENACT \n                       ANTI-LYNCHING LEGISLATION\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Allen, Mr. Levin, Mr. Frist, Mr. Reid, \nMr. Allard, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bayh, Ms. Collins, Mr. Biden, \nMr. Ensign, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Dayton, \nMr. McCain, Mr. Dodd, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Specter, Mr. Feingold, \nMr. Stevens, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Talent, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \nJohnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \nLieberman, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Schumer) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was refered to the Committed on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 39\n\n       Whereas the crime of lynching succeeded slavery as the \n     ultimate expression of racism in the United States following \n     Reconstruction;\n       Whereas lynching was a widely acknowledged practice in the \n     United States until the middle of the 20th century;\n       Whereas lynching was a crime that occurred throughout the \n     United States, with documented incidents in all but 4 States;\n       Whereas at least 4,742 people, predominantly African-\n     Americans, were reported lynched in the United States between \n     1882 and 1968;\n       Whereas 99 percent of all perpetrators of lynching escaped \n     from punishment by State or local officials;\n       Whereas lynching prompted African-Americans to form the \n     National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \n     (NAACP) and prompted members of B'nai B'rith to found the \n     Anti-Defamation League;\n       Whereas nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced in \n     Congress during the first half of the 20th century;\n       Whereas, between 1890 and 1952, 7 Presidents petitioned \n     Congress to end lynching;\n       Whereas, between 1920 and 1940, the House of \n     Representatives passed 3 strong anti-lynching measures;\n       Whereas protection against lynching was the minimum and \n     most basic of Federal responsibilities, and the Senate \n     considered but failed to enact anti-lynching legislation \n     despite repeated requests by civil rights groups, Presidents, \n     and the House of Representatives to do so;\n       Whereas the recent publication of ``Without Sanctuary: \n     Lynching Photography in America'' helped bring greater \n     awareness and proper recognition of the victims of lynching;\n       Whereas only by coming to terms with history can the United \n     States effectively champion human rights abroad; and\n       Whereas an apology offered in the spirit of true repentance \n     moves the United States toward reconciliation and may become \n     central to a new understanding, on which improved racial \n     relations can be forged: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) apologizes to the victims of lynching for the failure \n     of the Senate to enact anti-lynching legislation;\n       (2) expresses the deepest sympathies and most solemn \n     regrets of the Senate to the descendants of victims of \n     lynching, the ancestors of whom were deprived of life, human \n     dignity, and the constitutional protections accorded all \n     citizens of the United States; and\n       (3) remembers the history of lynching, to ensure that these \n     tragedies will be neither forgotten nor repeated.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I join with my colleague, the junior \nsenator from Virginia, to resubmit our resolution of apology for the \nSenate's failure to pass anti-lynching legislation. We brought this \nlegislation to the Senate's attention in the closing days of the 108th \nCongress, and indicated then that we would return in February, Black \nHistory Month, and seek its adoption his body.\n  When submitting the resolution earlier, I provided a narrative that \ndescribed the horrors lynching. It is not necessary to review those \nfacts at this time. The focus of my comments today concerns a critique \nof the need for this bill. As with many historical errors, there are \nthose who suggest that we are looking at history with twenty-twenty \nvision. They assert we cannot pass judgment on people living in another \ncontext; everyone is blind to their own prejudices, while seeing those \nof the past clearly.\n  That is a critique that has a lot of merit in some cases. Societal \nmorays evolve. In fact, our nation's entire history may be viewed as a \ngiant experiment. Viewed from this perspective we find a slow, \nevolutionary understanding of the meanings of justice, liberty and \ndemocracy. However, Senator Allen and I remain confident in what we are \nseeking to do. The reason is that the Senate's failure to pass anti-\nlynching legislation is not merely a tragedy now, it was a tragedy \nthen.\n  Socrates taught us that ``the greatest way to live with honor in this \nworld is\n\n[[Page S1060]]\n\nto be what we pretend to be.'' The Senate filibusters that blocked \nanti-lynching legislation on three separate occasions besmirched the \nhonor of this institution. We style ourselves the greatest deliberative \nbody in the world, yet we showed little real deliberation on those \ndays. We think of ourselves as the ``saucer'' that cools the passions \nof the House of Representatives. Yet the passions that needed cooling \nwere found in this chamber. We argue that the Senate is the institution \nthat protects the grand traditions of our nation, yet it was the \ntraditions of the Declaration of Independence that we trampled over on \nthose occasions. In short, when we consider the Senate's role in anti-\nlynching legislation, we simply were not what we pretend to be.\n  There is other contextual evidence that the Senate was out of step \nwith justice and morality even when viewed at the time. In 1918, in the \nmidst of the First World War, President Woodrow Wilson pleaded for the \nenactment of anti-lynching legislation. He stated:\n\n       There have been many lynchings and every one of them has \n     been a blow at the heart of ordered law and humane justice. \n     No man who loves America, no man who really cares for her \n     fame and honor and character, or who is truly loyal to her \n     institutions, can justify mob action while the courts of \n     justice are open and the Governments of the States and the \n     Nation are ready and able to do their duty . . . We proudly \n     claim to be the champions of democracy. If we really are in \n     deed and in truth, let us see to it that we do not discredit \n     our own. I say, plainly, that every American who takes part \n     in the action of a mob or gives any sort of countenance is no \n     true son of this great democracy, but its betrayer, and does \n     more to discredit her by that single disloyalty to her \n     standards of law and right than the words or her statesmen or \n     the sacrifices of her heroic boys in the trenches can do to \n     make suffering peoples believe her to be their savior.\n\n  There are two remarkable things about this quote. First, it is an \nindication of just how much lynching was impacting our country's \nreputation. In the middle of an enormous military effort that allied \nthe forces of democracy against the great autocratic empires, the \nPresident had to take to reprimand his own countrymen. Furthermore, \nhistorians have long noted that President Wilson did not hold \nparticularly progressive views of African Americans. Nevertheless, here \nhe is taking his countrymen to task. Why? Because the injustice of our \nactions was clear to him, and were being laid bare--rather \nembarrassingly--before the whole world. While we struggled to \ndemonstrate the strength and righteousness of democracy, we were \nbelying our own story with lynchings. Once again, we simply were not \nbeing what we pretended to be.\n  Finally, I know in my heart that the people of the South were aware \nof the injustice that they were inflicting on African Americans. I know \nbecause I understand how deeply important religion and Christianity are \nto the people of the South. It pervades every aspect of our culture and \nhistory. But it was surely lost on no one in the South that the \ngreatest victim of mob violence was Jesus. When looking at James \nAllen's book ``Without Sanctuary'' I think people will get a sense of \nGod's suffering. You will also see the tragedy of humanity in the faces \nof the crowds. You quickly realize that man's inhumanity to man is an \nancient question that still plagues us today. Yet in the helpless \nnobility of the victims, we are also reminded that God intends true \npeace and justice to come in the next world and not this one.\n  We have an opportunity today to teach, an opportunity to express \nremorse, and most importantly an opportunity to be what we pretend to \nbe. In so doing, I hope we may return some of the lost honor of this \nChamber.\n  Mr. President, it has been said that ``ignorance, allied with power, \nis the most ferocious enemy justice can have.'' Sadly, this great body, \nin which I am so proud to serve, once allied its power with ignorance. \nIn so doing, it condoned unspeakable injustice that diminished the role \nof the Senate, and heaped untold suffering on Americans sorely in need \nof our protection. I am referring to the Senate's role in the decades \nlong campaign to end lynching in this country. On three separate \noccasions, our colleagues in the House of Representatives passed anti-\nlynching legislation with overwhelming majorities. On all three of \nthose occasions members of this Chamber blocked, or filibustered the \nconsideration of that legislation.\n  Between 1882, when records first began to be collected, and 1968 \n4,742 Americans lost their lives to lynch mobs. The experts believe \nthat undocumented cases might double that figure. The vast majority of \nthose killed --3,445 Americans--were African American. Sadly, a \ndisproportionate number of those deaths occurred within my home region \nof the South, but 46 of the 50 States experienced these atrocities. \nLynching was truly a national problem deserving the attention of the \nnational legislative bodies.\n  Frederick Douglas seems to have captured the real reason for this \ndark period of our national history. These acts of terrorism were not \nso much an admission of African Americans' weakness, but of their \nperseverance, and indomitable spirit. Douglas wrote:\n\n       It is proof that the Negro is not standing still. He is not \n     dead, but alive and active. He is not drifting with the \n     current, but manfully resisting it . . . A ship rotting at \n     anchor meets with no resistance, but when she sails on the \n     sea, she has to buffet opposing billows. The enemies of the \n     Negro see that he is making progress and they naturally wish \n     to stop him and keep him in just what they consider his \n     proper place.\n\n  It was, in short, the ability of African Americans to overcome Jim \nCrow laws, to overcome share-cropping, to overcome second-class \ncitizenship that provoked such savagery. Its an old story that repeats \nitself throughout human history. Whether it was the Israelites in \nEgypt, the colonial empires in Africa or America's own history of \nApartheid, rulers that assume superiority inevitably prove themselves \nmodels of mankind's basest instincts.\n  It should also be noted that this was not only an outrage committed \nagainst African Americans. The effort to dehumanize people on the basis \nof race or ethnicity did not limit itself to black Americans. In fact, \nthe single largest incident of lynching occurred in my home State, in \nmy home town of New Orleans. Yet, the victims were not black. They were \nItalians. On March 14, 1891, 11 Italian immigrants were lynched in the \ncity of New Orleans. These immigrants too were thought to be less than \nhuman, and were simply rounded up as a group of the ``usual suspects'' \nfollowing the murder of Police Superintendent David Hennessy. Already \nedgy from a media prompted Mafia scare, a mob surrounded the prison and \neventually battered down the doors. An armed group of 25 men overtook \nthe guards and summarily riddled the bodies of the 11 Italian prisoners \nwith bullets. Their bodies were hung on lampposts outside the prison. \nEyewitnesses described the cheering of the crowd as deafening.\n\n  Of course, the attacks on that day are an example of mob justice and \nits irrational prejudices. However, in nearly 25 percent of all \nlynchings the motivations of the attackers came down to a bald attempt \nto maintain a caste system in this country. The NAACP cataloged the \nreported motivations for these forms of attack. They included: using \ndisrespectful, insulting, slanderous, boastful, threatening or \nincendiary language; insubordination, impertinence, or improper \ndemeanor, a sarcastic grin, laughing at the wrong place, a prolonged \nsilence; refusing to take off one's hat to a white person or to give \nthe right-of-way when encountering a white on the sidewalk; resisting \nassault by whites; being troublesome generally; disorderly conduct, \npetty theft or drunkenness; writing an improper letter to a white \nperson; paying undue or improper attention to a white female; accusing \na white man of writing love letters to a black woman; or living or \nkeeping company with a white woman; turning or refusing to turn State's \nevidence; testifying or bringing suit against a white person; being \nrelated to a person accused of a crime and already lynched; political \nactivities; union organizing; conjuring; discussing a lynching; \ngambling; operating a house of ill fame; a personal debt; refusing to \naccept an employment offer; vagrancy; refusing to give up one's farm; \nconspicuously displaying one's wealth or property; and trying to act \nlike a white man.\n  In many instances, lynchings were little more than a way to remove an \neconomic competitor and confiscate his property. This was true in a \nnumber of cases in Mississippi involving successful African American \nlandowners,\n\n[[Page S1061]]\n\nand in one notorious Hawaiian case involving a Japanese immigrant \ncompeting with established white businessmen.\n  Many of my colleagues might wonder why now? After all, some of these \nincidents are over a century old. There are two reasons. First, this \naspect of American history is not well known or understood. As \nreconstruction concluded in the South, a very ugly struggle to reassert \nthe social structure that preceded the Civil War took place. A great \ndeal of it occurred with the tacit consent of the Federal Government, \nand the most part, the media either shared in the common prejudice, or \nsimply ignored what was occurring.\n  Fortunately, we have the publication of the book ``Without \nSanctuary'' by James Allen, Hilton Als, Congressman John Lewis, and \nLeon F. Litwak to serve as a focal point for our attention to this \nneglected history. This is a difficult book to examine. It serves as a \ncatalog of inhuman crime perpetrated by very ordinary citizens. Looking \nat anything so tragic as the victims of these crimes would be \ndisturbing, but that is not what will leave a lasting impression. It is \nthe festive attitude, the smiles and smirks on the crowd gathered \naround the victim. They clearly take a perverse pride in this act. \nHannah Arendt, the famous political philosopher, subtitled her book on \nAdolph Eichman's war crimes trials ``A Report on the Banality of \nEvil.'' When you look at the expressions on the faces of the murders in \nthese photos, that is all you can think about. These are not crazed \nkillers, these are rational people going about their every day lives, \nand committing unspeakable acts in the process.\n  Photos like these serve to remind us that a healthy society is not \nsomething that is built up over time, and then like a great monument, \nexists for centuries. Rather, a healthy society is a thin levee that \nmust be constantly improved and maintained to hold back the worst \ninstincts of mankind. I think the horrible pictures that came from Abu \nGharib prison served as a reminder of this lesson. This book is even \ngreater testimony that atrocities are not events that only occur in far \noff places. They can and have occurred here in the United States.\n  The only way to maintain a healthy society is to acknowledge and \ndiscuss our mistakes. No one would defend the Senate's filibuster of \nanti-lynching legislation today. I would like to think that any Senator \nwho did so would quickly be looking for another line of work. However, \ndespite the change of attitude we have taken no action to remedy our \nwrong. That is the purpose of this resolution today. I would like to \nextend my deep thanks to my courageous colleague, the Junion Senator \nfrom Virginia. He seemed to instantly understand the significance of \nthis effort, and I believe it was vitally important to proceed with \nthis resolution in a bipartisan manner. His input and drive have made \nthis effort much more successful than it otherwise would have been.\n  It is our intention to introduce this legislation today, and use the \nrecess period to confer with our colleagues about it. When we reconvene \nnext year, we will re-introduce this resolution, and at that time, we \nhope to have the co-sponsorship of every member of this body. Then, we \nendeavor to enact the resolution to commemorate Black History month.\n  I said ignorance allied with power is justice's most ferocious enemy. \nYet imagine what truth allied with power can bring. For over 50 years, \nAfrican American achievement was seen as a threat to the majority of \npeople in this nation. It is time to close the book on that tragic \nperiod and begin to celebrate the achievements of black Americans as \naccomplishments that have bettered us all. I believe that this \nresolution of apology will be an important symbolic step in this \nprocess of healing and growth.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of an \nimportant resolution of apology that Senator Mary Landrieu and I are \nresubmitting today. Since first submitting this measure last September, \nI am proud to say that approximately a third of my colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle have lent their support by serving as original \ncosponsors this Congress.\n  Like all of my colleagues, I am proud to be a Member of this Chamber, \nnot for its grandeur, but because of the grand ideas it represents. It \nis here, at these small, wood desks, that big ideas have been debated \nand argued throughout the course of history for the greater good of the \npeople of the United States and the world. It is here in this Chamber, \non this floor, that representative democracy has reached consensus from \nwhat our Founding Fathers called the ``Will of the People.''\n  In the history of this Chamber, there have been many great minds and \ndefenders of freedom. One of those, whose words still reverberate here \ntoday, is Daniel Webster. Standing in the old Senate Chamber, Webster \ntold his colleagues in 1834 that a ``representative of the people is a \nsentinel on the watch tower of liberty.''\n  Indeed, the United States Senate has been a great watchtower on \nliberty. Many individuals have venerated the Senate as the world's \ngreatest deliberative body. The formidable British Member of \nParliament, William Gladstone, called the American Senate, ``that \nremarkable body, the most remarkable of all the inventions of modern \npolitics.''\n  But unfortunately, this august body has a stain on its history: \nlynching. Americans died from a noose, from flogging, from a torch, \nfrom the evil hearts of men outside this Chamber. While three-fourths \nof the 4,742 victims of these injustices were African-Americans, no \nrace escaped the cruel act that is so contrary to the rule of law, due \nprocess and equal protection that we pride ourselves on in the United \nStates. Jewish people, Asians, Hispanics, American Indians, Italians \nand others found themselves unprotected.\n  I rise today to offer a formal and heartfelt apology to all the \nvictims of lynching in our history, and for the failure of the United \nStates Senate to take action when action was most needed.\n  This body failed to act as these vile killings captivated front-page \nheadlines, drew crowds with morbid curiosity and left thousands of \nmostly African Americans hanging from trees or bleeding to death from \nthe lashings of whips. In not acting, this body failed to protect the \nliberty of which Webster spoke.\n  According to the archives of the Tuskegee Institute, 4,472 Americans \ndied by lynching starting in 1882. Three-fourths of these acts of \nhatred were perpetrated against black men, women, and children. Many \ntimes these lynchings were not lone acts by a few white men. Rather, \nthey were angry gangs or mobs whipped into frenzies by skewed \nmentalities of right and wrong.\n  One of those who suffered this awful fate was an African American \nnamed Zachariah Walker of Coatesville, VA. In 1911, Walker was dragged \nfrom a hospital bed where he was recovering from a gunshot wound. \nAccused of killing a white man--which he claimed was in self-defense--\nWalker was burned alive at the stake without a trial.\n  Such horrendous acts were not just a regional phenomenon of the \nSouth. States like Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and even the Washington, \nDC area experienced mob violence. Lynching was not just a regional \nproblem; it was a national crime, which occurred in 46 States of our \ncountry.\n  Despite the national scope of these acts, the Senate failed to pass \nany of the nearly 200 anti-lynching bills introduced in Congress during \nthe first half of the twentieth century. After three bills were passed \nby the House of Representatives, they faced filibusters on this Senate \nfloor.\n  Seven Presidents from 1890 to 1952 asked that such laws be passed. A \nFederal law would have afforded more protection to the innocent and \nwould have brought the resources of the Federal Government to bear on \nthose responsible for such egregious acts. Sadly, only one percent of \nsuch acts were prosecuted by the State or local authorities. I am proud \nto say Virginia passed an anti-lynching law which logically accounts \nfor relatively fewer lynchings than in any other States in our region.\n  During the winter of 1937-1938, one grisly lynching captivated this \nbody's attention. The previous April, two African Americans were taken \nfrom their jail cells in Mississippi, were whipped and slowly torched \nto death. Senator Champ Clark of Missouri posted photographs of the \nbrutality back here in the cloakroom. For six weeks, this\n\n[[Page S1062]]\n\nbody debated legislation to make lynching a Federal crime. For six \nweeks. In the end, those in favor of the pending anti-lynching bill \nfailed to enact cloture to break the filibuster.\n  Historians will no doubt disagree as to a single reason why Senators \nblocked anti-lynching legislation in the 1920's to 1940's. My desire \nhere is not to get into motivations.\n  Regardless of their reasoning, our reason tells us that it was wrong \nand it is appropriate to apologize for this lack of action.\n  Thankfully justice in our Nation has moved forward and left such \ndespicable acts to history. In ignoring the protections of our Founding \nFathers that everyone is innocent until proven guilty, the Senate \nturned its back on the most helpless in our society at a time when the \nweak needed protection.\n  I stand here today as a proud Senator from a Southern State. I look \naround this chamber and know of its abundance of honor and integrity \nthroughout its history.\n  As Ephesians teaches us, ``all things that are reproved are made \nmanifest by light.''\n  My fellow Senators, this simple, dignified apology is appropriate. It \nis not about any reparations. I respectfully urge my colleagues to \nreprove this tragedy and pass this resolution this month, February, in \ncommemoration of Black History Month.\n  I shall close with the words of our Resolution:\n\n       Whereas an apology offered in the spirit of true repentance \n     moves the United States toward reconciliation and may become \n     central to a new understanding, on which improved racial \n     relations can be forged: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       Apologizes to the victims of lynching for the failure of \n     the Senate to enact anti-lynching legislation;\n       Expresses the deepest sympathies and most solemn regrets of \n     the Senate to the descendents of victims of lynching, the \n     ancestors of whom were deprived of life, human dignity, and \n     the constitutional protections accorded all citizens of the \n     United States; and\n       Remembers the history of lynching, to ensure that these \n     tragedies will be neither forgotten nor repeated.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 40--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEAS OF NATIONAL TIME \n      OUT DAY TO PROMOTE THE ADOPTION OF THE JOINT COMMISSION ON \n   ACCREDITATION OF HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS' UNIVERSAL PROTOCOL FOR \n                PREVENTING ERRORS IN THE OPERATING ROOM\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Santorum) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, we have all heard the expression, ``To \nerr is human.'' We teach our children that mistakes are okay because we \nlearn from them. However, there are some mistakes that are more costly \nto make than others. In 2000, the Institute of Medicine released a \nreport entitled, ``To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System.'' \nThe report revealed the following devastating statistic: every year, \nbetween 44,000 and 98,000 hospitalized people in the United States die \ndue to medical errors.\n  Science has not yet found a cure to cancer or even the common cold, \nbut it has discovered a way to prevent the thousands of fatalities that \noccur every year due to medical errors. The Joint Commission on \nAccreditation of Healthcare Organizations developed a universal \nprotocol that calls for surgical teams to literally call a ``time out'' \nbefore surgeries begin. This ``time out'' serves a brief period for \nsurgeons and nurses to verify the patient's identity, the procedure to \nbe performed, and the site of the procedure. Endorsed by the American \nCollege of Surgeons, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the \nAmerican Hospital Association, the Association of periOperative \nRegistered Nurses, and the American Society for Healthcare Risk \nManagement, this idea of a ``time out'' may seem almost simplistic, but \nthe fact of the matter is even the best surgeon in the world can make a \nvery costly mistake if he or she does not stop for a moment for surgery \nand take a ``time out.\n  Therefore, it is my pleasure to rise today to submit this resolution, \nwhich promotes a National Time Out Day and promotes the adoption of the \nJoint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization's \nuniversal protocol for preventing errors in the operating room.\n  To err may be human, but for the thousands of relatives that are \ncurrently sitting in a hospital waiting room, waiting for a loved one \nto come out of surgery, human error is not an acceptable answer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 41--CONGRATULATING THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS ON THEIR \n                      VICTORY IN SUPER BOWL XXXIX\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Reed, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Dodd, \nand Mr. Lieberman) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

THE GLOBAL HIV VACCINE ENTERPRISE.\n\n       The Senate urges the President to continue the efforts of \n     the United States to generate global support for the Global \n     HIV Vaccine Enterprise by carrying out an initiative that--\n       (1) is in coordination and partnership with the members of \n     the Group of Eight, the private sector, and other countries, \n     especially those countries most affected by the HIV/AIDS \n     pandemic;\n       (2) encourages the members of the Group of Eight to act \n     swiftly to mobilize money and resources to support the Global \n     HIV Vaccine Enterprise;\n       (3) includes a strategic plan to prioritize the scientific \n     and other challenges to the development of an HIV vaccine, as \n     set out in the Scientific Strategic Plan developed by the \n     Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise, to coordinate research and \n     product development efforts, and to encourage greater use of \n     information-sharing networks and technologies;\n       (4) encourages the establishment of a number of coordinated \n     global HIV vaccine development centers that have a sufficient \n     number of researchers who possess the scientific expertise \n     necessary to advance the development of an HIV vaccine; and\n       (5) increases cooperation, communication, and sharing of \n     information on issues related to HIV and AIDS among \n     regulatory authorities in various countries.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution expressing \nthe Sense of the Senate on promoting initiatives to develop an HIV \nvaccine.\n  On June 6, 2004, I introduced Senate Resolution 398 urging the \nPresident to promote initiatives to develop an HIV vaccine. While I am \nencouraged by the progress that has taken place in the months since I \nsubmitted that resolution, much remains to be done to develop an \neffective HIV vaccine. Because of the gravity and urgency of this \nissue, I am submitting my resolution.\n  The HIV/AIDS pandemic is unlike any disease in history and has \nprofound implications for political stability, development, and human \nwelfare. The sheer magnitude of the crisis is overwhelming. An \nestimated 40,000,000 people around the world live with HIV or AIDS, and \nnearly 8,500 people die every day from AIDS. Last year alone, more than \n3 million people died from AIDS. Every 14 seconds, a child loses a \nparent to AIDS. An estimated 14,000,000 children have lost one or both \nparents to AIDS, and this number is expected to\n\n[[Page S1064]]\n\nincrease to 25 million by 2010. According to recent projections from \nthe World Health Organization and the Joint United Nations Program on \nHIV/AIDS, UNAIDS, if the pandemic spreads at its current rate, there \nwill be 45 million new infections by 2010 and nearly 70 million deaths \nby 2020. Sub-Saharan Africa has been hardest hit by the disease, with \nmore than 75 percent of the people infected with HIV living in the \nregion.\n  The U.S. is leading global efforts to combat the pandemic through its \n$15 billion Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and its commitment to the \nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. But the human and \neconomic toll of the HIV pandemic demands that these activities be \ncomplemented by accelerated efforts to develop an HIV vaccine. An HIV \nvaccine would prevent new HIV and AIDS cases, which could save millions \nof lives and dramatically reduce the negative social and economic \nconsequences of the disease. Yet, HIV vaccine development is still not \nprominent on national or international public health agendas.\n  Developing an HIV vaccine is particularly challenging because HIV is \none of the most complicated viruses ever identified. In addition, many \nprivate sector biotechnology companies have not invested money and \nexpertise in the search for an HIV vaccine. Developing an HIV vaccine, \ntherefore, is unlikely to occur without a well-coordinated and focused \nglobal research effort.\n  The Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise is mobilizing such an effort. The \nEnterprise is an alliance of the world's leading scientists and \nindependent organizations around the world committed to accelerating \nthe development of a preventive vaccine for HIV/AIDS. The Enterprise, \nlike the Human Genome Project, seeks to promote a new level of \ncoordination and information-sharing to address a complex scientific \nproblem. In addition, the HIV Vaccine Enterprise is intended to \naccelerate progress by promoting international public-private \ncollaboration.\n  The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, IAVI, has been \ninstrumental in laying the groundwork for the Enterprise. The IAVI is \nan international organization that collaborates with developing \ncountries, governments, and international agencies dedicated to \naccelerating the development of a vaccine to halt the AIDS epidemic. \nThe IAVI, however, cannot accomplish this task alone. Here in the \nUnited States, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the \nRockefeller Foundation have joined forces to help address the financial \nproblems faced by small biotechnology companies. They founded BIO \nVentures for Global Health to help small biotechnology companies \naddress the problems they confront in developing new medical products \nfor poor countries. The wider application of this model would greatly \nimprove the development of vaccines and other medicines aimed at \nimproving health in the developing world.\n  Under President Bush's leadership, the Members of the Group of Eight \nIndustrialized Nations, G-8, during their meeting at Sea Island last \nJune, endorsed the Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise. At the meeting, \nPresident Bush announced plans to establish a second HIV Vaccine \nResearch and Development Center in the United States, in addition to \nthe one already operating at the U.S. National Institutes of Health. \nRecently, the President announced funding for that second center, the \nCenter for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology, CHAVI, which will become a key \ncomponent of the Enterprise.\n  I commend the President's leadership on this critically important \nissue.

Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to \ncongratulate the New England Patriots for winning yesterday's exciting \nSuper Bowl against the Philadelphia Eagles, 24-21.\n  What a year our sports teams in New England have had. The Patriots \nwon the Super Bowl and the Boston Red Sox won the World Series. It \ndoesn't get much better than that.\n  The Patriots deserve great credit for another brilliant season. They \nhave shattered the NFL record by winning 21 straight games. The \nprevious record was held by the Miami Dolphins in 1972, who won 15 \nstraight games.\n  With nine seconds left in the game yesterday, Rodney Harrison \nintercepted his second pass of the day, clinching the Patriot's second \nstraight Super Bowl and their third Super Bowl championship in 4 years.\n  All three of those Super Bowl victories were by the same narrow \nmargin--three points. In their two previous Super Bowl victories, they \nwon by last-second field goals. This year, the field\n\n[[Page S1065]]\n\ngoal came earlier, but the game was no less a cliff-hanger.\n  Deion Branch, a wide receiver of the Patriots, was a special hero in \nthe game. He tied a Super Bowl record by catching eleven passes, and \nwas named the Super Bowl's Most Valuable Player. Quarterback Tom Brady, \nas usual, was outstanding. There were many other heroes as well on both \noffense and defense, and it took all their skill and great teamwork to \nput points on the scoreboard. In fact, they sacked the quarterback four \ntimes and had three interceptions, two by Rodney Harrison.\n  Much of the credit in the victory also goes to Bill Belichick and his \ntwo outstanding Assistant Coaches, Romeo Crennel and Charlie Weiss, who \nmade sure that the team was well prepared with the strongest possible \ngame plan every week throughout the season, and especially for the \nplayoffs and the Super Bowl.\n  Finally, I congratulate Patriots owner Bob Kraft for his strong \nsupport of the team, and for his very generous tribute to all the \nPatriots fans as well. He was right when he said this Super Bowl \nvictory would not have been possible without the strong support of \nmillions of Patriots fans throughout New England.\n  The pending resolution commends the Patriots for their dramatic \nvictory. I urge the Senate to approve it, and I hope very much we'll be \nback here in 2006 to pass a similar resolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and the preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, that any statements related \nto the resolution be printed in the Record at the appropriate place as \nif read, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 41) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 41\n\n       Whereas, on Sunday, February 6, 2005 the New England \n     Patriots defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 24-21 in Super Bowl \n     XXXIX, in Jacksonville, Florida;\n       Whereas this victory is the second consecutive Super Bowl \n     championship for the New England Patriots and their third \n     Super Bowl championship in the past four years;\n       Whereas all three Super Bowl victories by the New England \n     Patriots were cliffhangers and were won by three points in \n     each game;\n       Whereas the New England Patriots have set a National \n     Football League record this season by winning 21 consecutive \n     games;\n       Whereas Head Coach Bill Belichick and Assistant Coaches \n     Romeo Crennel and Charlie Wiess of the New England Patriots \n     brilliantly created successful game plans throughout the \n     season;\n       Whereas wide receiver Deion Branch of the New England \n     Patriots tied a Super Bowl record by catching eleven passes \n     and was named Most Valuable Player in the Super Bowl;\n       Whereas extraordinary efforts by other players of the New \n     England Patriots, including Tom Brady, Troy Brown, Teddy \n     Bruschi, Corey Dillon, David Givens, Rodney Harrison, Willie \n     McGinest, Richard Seymour, Adam Vinatieri, and Mike Vrabel, \n     also contributed to the Super Bowl victory;\n       Whereas the offensive linemen of the New England Patriots, \n     Matt Light, Joe Andruzzi, Dan Koppen, Stephen Neal, and \n     Brandon Gorin deserve great credit for protecting quarterback \n     Tom Brady and blocking for running back Corey Dillon in the \n     Super Bowl; and\n       Whereas owner Bob Kraft of the New England Patriots \n     deserves great credit for his strong support of the team, and \n     for his gracious acknowledgement that the Super Bowl \n     Championship would not have been possible without the strong \n     support of the millions of fans throughout New England.\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the United States \n     congratulates the New England Patriots on their dramatic \n     victory Super Bowl XXXIX.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/07/senate-section/article/S1065-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 2005\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, Barry Goldwater was a proud, conservative \nRepublican. Many credit him as being the father of the modern \nconservative movement in this country.\n  He defended his conservative ideas and ideals vigorously. But he \ndidn't attack his political adversaries personally. And he didn't like \nit when others did.\n  Barry Goldwater once said of the radical right, ``If they disagree \nwith you one bit, you're a no-good S.O.B.'' That is Barry Goldwater's \nworld.\n  Something tells me Barry Goldwater would dislike very much the \ncharacter-assassination campaign being waged by the Republican National \nCommittee against the Democratic leader of this Senate, Harry Reid.\n  This morning, the Senate began debate on a controversial plan \nproposed by our Republican colleagues, under a time agreement \nnegotiated by Senator Reid--Democrats are not filibustering this \nproposal. We came to work this morning to discover this article.\n  The lead story in this morning's Roll Call is ``RNC Turns up Heat on \nReid.''\n  The RNC is sending out a 13-page ``research document'' on Senator \nReid to 1 million journalists, donors, and grassroots activists'' \naccusing Senator Reid of obstructionism and other imagined \ngrievances. Despite the fact that every nominee of the President has \ngone through this Chamber, and I believe we have only had two record \nvotes and both of those cleared the Chamber, they are arguing that \nSenator Reid is guilty of obstructionism.\n\n  The RNC Communications Director is quoted as saying, ``This is the \ninitial salvo in the upcoming discussion that we are going to be having \nwith Senator Reid.'' This is not a discussion they're planning. This is \nan effort to try to intimidate political opponents into silence--and it \nis shameful.\n  Harry Reid is the walking definition of moderate. I have served with \nhim in the House and Senate.\n  Why is the RNC doing this now? Because they do not want to debate \ntheir radical proposals on the merits.\n  They don't want to debate their radical proposals on the merits. They \ndon't want to talk about the details of Social Security privatization, \nwhich is becoming increasingly unpopular in America. They don't want to \ntalk about the budget they released today, which will make deep cuts in \nhealth care, veterans care, and education. They want to silence \neverybody and anybody who dares to question any part of the agenda.\n  That is not what America is about. It is not the way this Senate is \nsupposed to work.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, is there one \namongst us who could withstand this type of\n\n[[Page S1066]]\n\nwithering scrutiny and criticism? I think, frankly, my friends should \nstop and realize we have 2 years ahead of us in this session. We need \nto work with one another. We have and we will. Starting with this \napproach is bad.\n  I call on Senator Frist to call the Republican National Committee the \nfirst thing in the morning and tell them that they have to suspend this \npersonal attack on Harry Reid. If we are going to work in a cooperative \nbipartisan fashion, this attack is going to poison the well.\n\n  There is another element here, too. I have some rules in my life that \nare hard and fast when it comes to politics, and one rule is that I \nnever attack my opponent's family. Never. There have been ample \nopportunities when some relative of my opponent did something very \nembarrassing or I could have issued a press release and taken advantage \nof it. I never did it because I never want people attacking my family.\n  The Republican National Committee starts off their campaign by \nattacking Senator Reid's family. I think the hottest ring in hell is \nreserved for politicians who attack their opponents' families, and I \nhope Senator Frist believes that, too.\n  In 1962, Jack Kennedy and Barry Goldwater thought they would probably \nface each other in the 1964 Presidential race. As different as their \npolitics were, they respected one another, and they respected the \nAmerican tradition of government and debate. They hoped that if they \ndid face each other in 1964, they would be able to hold a series of \ndebates around the country on the big issues of the day.\n  That is how politics was going to be waged in 1964. That is exactly \nhow it should be waged today. Let's not make this the politics of \nmudslinging and the politics of personal attack. Let's, early on in the \nsession, say that we are going to address the great issues that face us \nin a responsible manner. We should make a bipartisan pact at this time \nthat there will be no more politics of personal destruction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/07/senate-section/article/S1066-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
