The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this morning the time until 10 a.m. will be \nequally divided for debate prior to the cloture vote. That cloture vote \nis scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. promptly. We\n\n[[Page S11954]]\n\nwill be on the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. We started that bill now \n6 days ago, last Friday. Senators have had ample opportunity to debate \nand offer amendments. Therefore, I expect that we will invoke cloture \nthis morning. Once cloture is invoked, the chairman can begin the \nprocess of bringing that bill to a close. If we work together and \nMembers are reasonable with their requests for amendments, we will be \nable to finish the bill tonight. If we are unable to get passage of the \nbill tonight, then we would return to session tomorrow and stay on the \nbill with votes until completion. That gives added incentive for people \nto finish it today, but we will be here tomorrow to vote if we do not \nfinish it tonight.\n  Today we may also receive the Agriculture appropriations conference \nreport from the House, and I will be talking to the Democratic leader \nabout the scheduling for consideration.\n  Finally, we have some Executive Calendar nominations ready for Senate \naction, including a couple of judges. We need to dispose of those \nnominations as soon as possible.\n\n\n               Withdrawal of Nomination of Harriet Miers\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the last several minutes, Harriet \nMiers has formally requested to withdraw as a nominee to serve as \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court. I had a conversation with Ms. \nMiers early this morning, and she told me that it was last evening that \nshe spoke to the President and formally requested her nomination to be \nwithdrawn. She stated clearly to me this morning and in a letter, which \nI will refer to shortly, that she felt that withdrawal was in the best \ninterest of the United States. She came to this decision on her own, \nbased on what she has experienced and witnessed and with the requests \nthat are currently being made and as she projected forward to the \nhearings, again, in the best interests of the country. This morning she \nwas gracious and forthcoming, confident, expressed appreciation for all \nof the work that has been done to date in the Senate and asked me to \nexpress that to each of the Senators, asking me to say thank you for \ntheir individual courtesy over the past several days and weeks. As one \nmay expect, she was disappointed but confident and upbeat.\n  Earlier this morning, following that, I did talk to the President. It \nis appropriate, because things are moving so quickly for me, to quote \nfrom her letter, again, to use Harriet Miers' own words. As this is \naddressed by the political pundits and the commentators over the course \nof today, I think it would be helpful for our colleagues to hear \ndirectly what Ms. Miers sent to the President.\n\n                                                 October 27, 2005.\n       Dear Mr. President: I write to withdraw as a nominee to \n     serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the \n     United States. I have been greatly honored and humbled by the \n     confidence that you have shown in me, and have appreciated \n     immensely your support and the support of many others. \n     However, I am concerned that the confirmation process \n     presents a burden for the White House and our staff that is \n     not in the best interest of the country.\n       As you know, members of the Senate have indicated their \n     intention to seek documents about my service in the White \n     House in order to judge whether to support me. I have been \n     informed repeatedly that in lieu of records, I would be \n     expected to testify about my service in the White House to \n     demonstrate my experience and judicial philosophy. While I \n     believe that my lengthy career provides sufficient evidence \n     for consideration of my nomination, I am convinced the \n     efforts to obtain Executive Branch materials and information \n     will continue.\n       As I stated in my acceptance remarks in the Oval Office, \n     the strength and independence of our three branches of \n     government are critical to the continued success of this \n     great Nation. Repeatedly in the course of the process of \n     confirmation for nominees for other positions, I have \n     steadfastly maintained that the independence of the Executive \n     Branch be reserved and its confidential documents and \n     information not be released to further a confirmation \n     process. I feel compelled to adhere to this position, \n     especially related to my own nomination. Protection of the \n     prerogatives of the Executive Branch and continued pursuit of \n     my confirmation are in tension. I have decided that seeking \n     my confirmation should yield.\n       I share your commitment to appointing judges with a \n     conservative judicial philosophy, and I look forward to \n     continuing to support your efforts to provide the American \n     people judges who will interpret the law, not make it. I am \n     most grateful for the opportunity to have served your \n     Administration and this country.\n           Most respectfully,\n                                              Harriet Ellan Miers.\n\n  Those are her words, and I think they are very direct. I did have a \nchance to talk to the President moments ago. He says that he accepted \nthis withdrawal. Harriet Miers will continue as White House counsel, of \ncourse. And I believe that we can expect another nomination in the very \nnear future. I will be talking to Chairman Specter a little bit later \nthis morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n\n                             Harriet Miers\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have heard, since I have been in \nWashington these many years, about what a tough town it is. I rarely \nhave felt that in my work here. But today I feel what some have said. \nFor Harriet Miers, this is a tough town.\n  Here is a fine woman, gentle and kind, has a lengthy career. Her \nrecord: First woman to become a member of a large law firm in Texas; \nfirst woman to be president of the Dallas Bar Association. The Dallas \nBar Association is larger than most State bar associations. She \nfollowed that with being the president of the Texas Bar Association, \none of the three or four largest bar associations in the United States. \nShe has served in elective office for a short period. She has had \nextensive experience in the courts.\n  I was in Texas this past weekend with a bunch of Democratic lawyers, \nmembers of the Democratic Party. They all said the nicest things about \nHarriet Miers. She was a fine litigator.\n  It is no secret I thought she would be an appropriate nomination for \nthe President. I suggested that to the President in a meeting that was \nattended by the distinguished majority leader. I believe the 35 to 40 \npercent of the people who have served on the Supreme Court with no \njudicial experience before getting there have been equally as good as \nthose people who have come to the Court with judicial experience. I \nbelieve those Justices with whom I had lunch a few months ago, who \nsaid, we would like to have people with no judicial experience come to \nthe Supreme Court--that is what they said--were right. I believe they \nare still right.\n  I have talked a little bit about Harriet Miers. She called me this \nmorning. I agree with the distinguished Republican leader that she was \nupbeat, but she wasn't happy. She was very disappointed. It was obvious \nshe was very disappointed. Who wouldn't be? In her experience as a \nlawyer, elected city councilperson, in her whole career she has shown \nthat she has been a strong supporter for law firm diversity policies, a \nleader in promoting legal services for the poor. She made statements, \nwritten and otherwise, where she spoke her beliefs on basic fairness.\n  I believe, without any question, that when the history books are \nwritten about all this, it will show that the radical rightwing of the \nRepublican Party drove this woman's nomination right out of town. \nApparently, Ms. Miers didn't satisfy those who want to pack the Supreme \nCourt with rigid ideologists. The only voices heard in this process \nwere the far right. She wasn't even given a chance to speak for herself \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee. Her credentials, which are \nexcellent, weren't good enough for the rightwing. They wanted a nominee \nwith a proven record of supporting their skewed goals.\n  I hope our President, in choosing a replacement for his lawyer--and \nthat is what she is--will not reward the bad behavior of his rightwing \nbase. President Bush should reject the demands of these extremists and \nchoose a Justice who will protect the constitutional rights of all \nAmericans. The President should listen to all Americans, not just \nextreme elements of his own party.\n  I repeat what the distinguished Senator from Maryland said, Ms. \nMikulski, that she sensed a whiff--I think that is a direct quote--of \nsexism in all of the attacks on this nominee.\n  Mr. President, it is over with. She has given her withdrawal to the \nPresident. I don't think it is a good day for our country.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. I yield to the distinguished Senator from New York.\n  How much time do we have, Mr. President?\n\n[[Page S11955]]\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Eight minutes 11 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. And that is equally divided; is that right?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority has 7 minutes 42 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. While the distinguished majority leader is here, Mr. \nPresident, through you to the distinguished Republican leader, we had a \nhalf hour set aside and I took more than my share. You didn't take much \ntime. I ask unanimous consent that there be 30 minutes for morning \nbusiness and the vote at 10 o'clock be scheduled at 10:15.\n  I understand the Senator from New York is not talking in morning \nbusiness. I withdraw my request. I yield to her whatever time she may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2313\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my brief remarks my colleague, Senator Schumer, be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Subject to the control of the time, yes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I believe amendment 2313 is pending before the Senate; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Pending before the Senate is H.R. 3010.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Is amendment 2313 at the desk?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is the pending amendment, \nthe one we go on in regular business.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Will we be going \nto regular business before the cloture vote?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are on the bill at this time.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Then if we are on the bill at this time, I wish to \nspeak briefly about amendment 2313 and ask that it be pending before \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has the right to make that \namendment the regular order if she desires.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I do desire, Mr. President, to make amendment 2313 the \nregular order.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this amendment addresses a problem that is quite \nunprecedented with respect to the funds that were appropriated \noriginally from this body following the attacks of September 11. The \nfunds were part of the original emergency appropriation passed by the \nCongress and signed by the President. The money addressed in this \namendment is intended for use for medical services and related matters \non behalf of first responders, construction workers, and others who \nworked at Ground Zero, who were in a variety of ways injured, whose \nhealth was impacted, often leading to employment-ending disabilities. \nThe people who gave so much in the immediate aftermath of those attacks \ninclude, of course, those who lost their lives and also those who as \npart of the rescue and recovery operations suffered long-lasting \nphysical and mental damage.\n  A number of those people have not been able to return to work. They \nare suffering from ailments ranging from physical disability, loss of \nlimbs, loss of the use of limbs. They have suffered an incredible range \nof lung-related and breathing diseases--asthma, respiratory \ndysfunction. Others have suffered greatly from the stresses they \nconfronted, particularly working on what was called ``the pile'' day \nafter day after day; some who worked out at Freshkills, the formerly \nvery large landfill on Staten Island where the remains of so many who \nlost their lives, including the debris from the cleanup, were taken and \ndeposited. Detectives worked there hour after hour after hour \nrecovering evidence, and often that evidence included, tragically, body \nparts. Many of these people who were directly impacted continued to \nwork as long as they could. They tried to return to some semblance of \nnormalcy. Unfortunately, they often could not continue.\n  The money that was directed to be used for their medical and \nemployment-related needs was caught up in some of the efforts to deal \nwith the budget currently, and an unprecedented rescission of these \nfunds previously appropriated was called for.\n  On both sides of the aisle, in the Senate as well as the House, we \nhave a number of our colleagues who understand completely the need for \nthese funds to be reinstated and available for the purposes they were \nintended. Certainly, the Governor of our State, the mayor of our city, \nalong with representatives of many of the workers, the police officers, \ndetectives, the firefighters, the construction workers, and others who \nwere adversely impacted because they responded to the need for their \nservices and their heroic efforts, are all united in our effort on both \nsides of the aisle at all levels of Government to make sure that what \nwas promised is fulfilled.\n  I greatly appreciate the chairman of the committee and the ranking \nmember working with us over the last weeks to make sure we correct this \nunprecedented rescission. I believe the amendment has been agreed to by \nthe chairman and ranking member. I hope we are able to move forward \nwith that expeditiously today.\n  This is a righting of an inadvertent wrong. I don't think the full \nintent and understanding of what these funds were for was perhaps \nappreciated, but there seems to be a great willingness, which I greatly \nappreciate, on behalf of the majority----\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. And so, Mr. President, let me, if I could----\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no further time for the minority \nto yield.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, may we have unanimous consent to use the \nleader time?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The leadership time is reserved. The \nleadership is to use that time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given 2 \nminutes. It can be deducted from the Republican time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, that request can be \nagreed to.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair. I want to add my voice in support of \nthis amendment on behalf of Senator Clinton and myself.\n  We all know the help this country has generously offered those who \nput their lives on the line--some survived, some did not--after 9/11. \nMany emerged wounded. I want to add one other element here. When we \nnegotiated with the President for the $20 billion, there was a great \nmoment of unity. When this Congress stood up, it was a great moment of \nunity. I have to say the President has never wavered in his commitment \nof the $20 billion. In fact, the White House has been generous in \ngranting us flexibility--seeking to take $2 billion of the tax dollars \nand move them to transportation.\n  This one rescission is the only mark where there has been a wavering \nin the commitment made to New York in those bleak weeks right after 9/\n11. We don't know how it came about. I doubt it came from the \nPresident--maybe somebody in OMB. But removing this rescission rights \nthat wrong and keeps the ledger unblemished about this Nation's \ncommitment to $20 billion to New York.\n  I thank Senator Specter and Senator Cochran for understanding that \nneed, and Senator Clinton and I look forward to the fact that this \namendment, which will now be in the Senate bill, will prevail in the \nHouse and that the White House will help us make that happen.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nremainder of the time be allocated to Senator Schumer and myself.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. There \nis 5 minutes 44 seconds remaining.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, as you can tell from both Senator \nSchumer and myself, we are very grateful for this understanding and \npending action that will give us a chance to right this wrong. Again I \nthink it is difficult to trace how it happened. I believe it is in the \nrush of trying to figure out how to maybe make things balance a little \nbit more that this was seized upon.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from Governor Pataki and Mayor \nBloomberg be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S11956]]\n\n\n                                                Executive Chamber,\n\n\n                                                State Capitol,\n\n                                     Albany, NY, October 21, 2005.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chair, Appropriations Committee, Senate Dirksen Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Ranking Member, Appropriations Committee, Senate Hart Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Cochran and Byrd: I would like to voice my \n     strong concerns over a provision in the House Labor-HHS \n     Appropriations bill which would rescind $125 million from the \n     New York State Workers' Compensation Board sent to New York \n     as part of the response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist \n     attacks. As the Senate considers its own Labor-HHS \n     appropriations bill, I would ask that this rescission not be \n     included. If it is not feasible to reverse the rescission, \n     then I would respectfully ask that you support passage of a \n     new emergency appropriation.\n       Under P.L. 107-117, Congress provided New York a total of \n     $175 million for the Workers' Compensation Board. The funding \n     was for paying benefits to the volunteers who responded to \n     Ground Zero or the Staten Island Landfill and to pay claims \n     to the employees of uninsured employers. These funds were \n     made available ``until expended.''\n       Consistent with Congressional intent, I am requesting that \n     all funds from the initial appropriation remain available to \n     ensure that the continuing needs of affected individuals are \n     met.\n       I appreciate that you have incredibly difficult decisions \n     to make given the funding constraints under which you must \n     pass the Labor-HHS bill. However, the aftermath of 9/11 \n     continues to manifest itself with responders' illnesses \n     emerging late and lasting longer than expected. To rescind \n     the funding provided to deal with these needs would be \n     turning our back on the very people who stepped up to the \n     plate in the wake of a national emergency.\n       Thank you for your attention to this critical issue.\n           Very truly yours,\n     George E.

Robert C. Byrd,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Appropriations Committee,\n     Capitol Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, \n         Health and Human Services, Education and Related \n         Agencies, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairmen Cochran and Specter and Ranking Members Byrd \n     and Harkin: In the aftermath of the attacks on the World \n     Trade Center (WTC), the Federal Government promised to \n     appropriate $20 billion to help New York City in its recovery \n     efforts. As you are aware, $125 million of that Federal \n     funding has been rescinded. I am asking your support for an \n     amendment to be offered by Senators Clinton and Schumer to \n     restore these funds to meet the ongoing needs of those harmed \n     by the September 11th attacks and (their aftermath. The funds \n     in question were originally to be used to process workers' \n     compensation claims, but have not proven necessary for that \n     purpose.\n       It is impossible to predict exactly the needs of the \n     governments, businesses and individuals hurt by such a \n     crisis. Jurisdictions affected by major disasters, be they \n     man-made or from natural causes, should get the benefit of \n     hindsight to make full and proper use of allocated funds. \n     Thus it is important that the Congress allow these \n     jurisdictions to come back to Congress to make revisions in \n     the federal assistance provided.\n       In New York, there is still a need for New York State to \n     retain $50 million of the aforementioned $125 million, but we \n     are writing you about the remaining $75 million. New York has \n     significant, ongoing needs for continued monitoring and \n     possible medical treatment as a result of the September \n     11th attacks.\n       It is our understanding that Senators Clinton and Schumer \n     will be offering an amendment to restore this $75 million so \n     it can be used to administer baseline and follow-up screening \n     and clinical examinations and long-term medical health \n     monitoring, analysis, and treatment for emergency services \n     personnel and rescue and recovery personnel through the FDNY \n     Bureau of Health Services and Counseling Services Unit, the \n     NYPD, Project Cope, the Police Organization Providing Peer \n     Assistance (POPPA), the World Trade Center Health Registry \n     and the Mount Sinai Center for Occupational and Environmental \n     Medicine working with the State and City of New York.\n       The New York City Fire Department (FDNY) estimates that \n     this funding would enable the World Trade Center (WTC) \n     Medical Monitoring Program, that the Department's Bureau of \n     Health Services runs in partnership with Mt. Sinai Medical \n     Center, and the FDNY Medical Treatment Program to continue \n     for several more years, although additional funds would be \n     needed beyond that time period. The WTC Medical Monitoring \n     Program monitors and treats the WTC rescue and recovery \n     workers and volunteers affected by environmental contaminants \n     and other exposures at the WTC site. It is the only long-\n     term, national program that provides periodic medical \n     monitoring exams, as well as short- and long-term medical \n     treatment, for the approximately 12,000 FDNY rescue workers \n     and 12,000 other responders who could be at risk for WTC-\n     related illnesses as a result of their efforts in rescue and \n     recovery, service restoration or debris removal and clean up \n     at the WTC site. Federal and private funding is due to expire \n     in 2009 for the monitoring program and 2007 for the treatment \n     program. This is a much-needed amendment that would continue \n     this federal partnership for several more years.\n       The FDNY's workforce was the most severely affected by \n     September 11, 2001. On that day alone, the Department \n     suffered 343 fatalities, and 200 of our responders needed \n     medical treatment--some for life-threatening injuries. In \n     all, more than 12,000 FDNY rescue workers performed rescue \n     and recovery efforts from September 11, 2001 through July \n     2002. Since then, nearly 4,000 have developed respiratory \n     and/or mental health-related illnesses. Potentially disabling \n     conditions that our rescue workers face include asthma, \n     chronic bronchitis, chronic sinusitis, gastroesophageal \n     reflux disorders and psychological distress as a result of \n     their repeated exposures to the injured, the dying, the dead, \n     human remains, potentially life threatening situations for \n     themselves and other traumatic events. Our FDNY rescue \n     workers are also concerned about other potential exposures to \n     environmental toxins. More than 500 firefighters have \n     qualified for early retirement disability.\n       This funding would also provide critical support for the \n     New York City WTC Health Registry. The WTC Health Registry, \n     operated by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, \n     tracks many highly affected subgroups present on 9/11, \n     including Lower Manhattan residents, children, building \n     survivors and visitors, as well as rescue workers and rescue/\n     clean-up volunteers. The Registry has enrolled 71,000 \n     persons, including those who were contacted from known \n     employer and building listings, as well as eligible \n     individuals who voluntarily enrolled. The Registry is \n     designed to maintain contact with and systematically document \n     potential health effects related to 9/11 through periodic \n     monitoring of mental and physical health conditions over the \n     course of the next 20 years. To benefit participants and \n     others affected by the disaster, the Registry provides \n     immediate information on health and mental health outcomes, \n     as well as available resources and treatment options. It is a \n     unique resource open to health experts around the country \n     conducting more in-depth health investigations. Special \n     studies by a number of academic institutions have already \n     begun, with the Registry providing a means to contact \n     interested participants. The findings of these studies will \n     benefit individuals affected by 9/11 and physicians concerned \n     with their care.\n       The Registry provides one of the few opportunities to \n     conduct future population-based assessments of WTC health \n     effects on different affected populations. It was established \n     with funding provided through the federal Agency for Toxic \n     Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). The cost of this \n     program is modest and provides a platform to monitor the \n     public health consequences of the WTC attacks and develops \n     essential health and emergency preparedness information. This \n     amendment will ensure that the Registry receives funding for \n     several more years. It is also essential that the federal \n     government keep faith with the 71,000 WTC survivors who \n     enrolled by ensuring the stability and long-term survival of \n     this crucial project.\n       Thank you for all you have done to help us on behalf of \n     those affected by September 11.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael R. Bloomberg,\n\n                                                            Mayor.\n\n     Nicholas Scoppetta,\n                              Commissioner, Fire Department of the\n                                                 City of New York.\n     Thomas R. Frieden,\n                                       M.D., M.P.H., Commissioner,\n     Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           Fire Department of New York--Mt. Sinai Partnership\n\n       To continue the existing medical monitoring and treatment \n     program, the FDNY needs federal assistance for a 30-year \n     medical monitoring program that to date has been funded by \n     the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the \n     National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). \n     This would allow the FDNY Bureau of Health Services to \n     continue to provide comprehensive periodic follow-up \n     monitoring exams to FDNY WTC rescue workers (active and \n     retired) at periodic (e.g., 18-month) intervals, thereby \n     maintaining needed services and medical continuity for this \n     group.\n       Based on current patient enrollment and the anticipated \n     health/economic needs of this population, the FDNY needs \n     federal assistance to support the medical treatment for the \n     FDNY WTC rescue workers (active and retired). This funding \n     would support necessary medical and mental health treatment \n     programs already in place for what we estimate to be, \n     conservatively, 30 percent of the FDNY WTC responder \n     population. Funding for these monitoring and treatment \n     programs would allow the FDNY to provide to\n\n[[Page S11957]]\n\n     our WTC rescue workers the same level and number of medical \n     and mental health services as Mount Sinai plans for the non-\n     FDNY WTC responders.\n       The FDNY treatment program, treating an estimated 3,000 \n     patients, has a current budget of $15 million annually. The \n     Mt. Sinai portion of this program has a similar budget. \n     Funding for these programs is uncertain after 2007. The FDNY \n     monitoring and evaluations program, treating an estimated \n     12,000 patients, has a current budget of $5 million per year. \n     Funding for this program is uncertain after 2009.\n\n                  World Trade Center Registry (WTCHR)\n\n       The WorId Trade Center Health Registry is designed to \n     monitor the physical and mental health of the 71,000 \n     enrollees for 20 years. The Registry is the only systematic \n     way to document and verify the possible long-term \n     consequences of the WTC disaster in groups most directly \n     affected by the attacks, such as residents, children, \n     building survivors, visitors, and rescue/recovery workers and \n     volunteers. This is the largest effort ever in the U.S. to \n     systemically monitor the health of persons exposed to a \n     large-scale disaster.\n       The Registry has developed a comprehensive resource guide, \n     which is updated regularly, to help WTC-affected persons find \n     physical or mental health services and other 9/11-related \n     assistance. It is the only comprehensive and updated resource \n     directory for people affected by the attack. To accompany \n     this, the Department is collaborating with Mt. Sinai Medical \n     Center to develop a set of clinical guidelines for physicians \n     treating patients affected by 9/11.\n       An average cost of $46 per enrollee per year is required to \n     support the registry for its 20 year life span--a modest cost \n     to monitor the health consequences of this major disaster and \n     to develop essential health and emergency preparedness \n     information. Average annual and recurring support of $3.31 \n     million is needed to support the registry. A cooperative \n     agreement between ATSDR and the New York City Department of \n     Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) provides partial and \n     declining support only through 2007, leaving a shortfall \n     averaging $2.2 million through that date. After 2007, no \n     funding has been committed to support the $3.31 million need. \n     New York City is working with our federal partners and \n     representatives to secure long-term funding for WTCHR.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. This money has been counted on to meet the needs of so \nmany of these workers, through the workers comp system, through the \nhealth care system. We fought very hard to make sure there was a \nsufficient amount of money for the diagnosis of the various physical \nand mental ills that people suffered after 9/11. I was very grateful we \nwere able to do that. People are being diagnosed. They are being given \nsome help. Unfortunately, without this money, that help cannot \ncontinue. After 9/11, we learned that many of the people who were \ninvolved in the horrible bombing in Oklahoma City years before were \nfinally coming to ask for help, that they had been suffering in \nsilence. Often there had been terrible memories that interfered with \ntheir ability to continue working. This is something that we know from \nexperts is, unfortunately, a very long-term, slow-moving problem, that \nnot everybody suffers the same way immediately. There are those for \nwhom it takes longer to come to grips with what has happened. We are \nseeing that. We are seeing still people who for the first time go to a \nphysician, for the first time ask for help. I have worked closely with \nthe fire department over the last 4 years and they have been absolutely \nsuperb in trying to make sure that help was available, people knew \nabout it, but they are the first to tell you not every one of the \nfirefighters was ready to ask for it. They had to be convinced it was \nOK to do.\n  So having this money reinstated will fulfill the promise we have made \nto all of these men and women that we are not going to forget them, we \nare going to take care of them; that when they are ready to ask for \nhelp, they will get help, and that the resources will be available for \nthem to get that help.\n  It is very heartening, and I obviously understand we are going to \nhave a challenge in the conference committee, but all of our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle in the House, particularly those who serve \non the Appropriations Committee, are part of this team and are working \nhard to make sure their leadership understands what our leadership \ndoes, which is that this is keeping faith with the people who kept \nfaith with America, a lot of brave and heroic and very extraordinary \nhuman beings who ran toward danger instead of away from it. I am very \ngrateful that this will be in the Senate bill and we will be able to go \nwith a united front on behalf of the Senate joining with those in the \nmajority and minority in the House to make sure we provide this funding \nas soon as possible.\n  I appreciate all the hard work we have seen from the chairman and the \nchairman's staff, from the ranking member and the ranking member's \nstaff. This was a challenge they undertook because they supported what \nwe were trying to do and understood how significant it was to correct \nthis situation.\n  I also appreciate the chairman of the full committee and the ranking \nmember of the full committee who have similarly been very supportive in \nhelping us work out a solution to this issue.\n  I can only hope that when we get to conference the House will \nunderstand and accept how we have worked this out and give us a chance \nto make our case. I believe it is a worthy case. It has bipartisan \nsupport. I think the House will see that and understand it.\n  I am grateful to everyone who has helped us get to this point.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on behalf of the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Specter, I want to state that this amendment \nrestores $125 million previously appropriated to New York as part of \nthe emergency supplemental bill under chapter 11, relief and recovery, \npassed by the Congress and signed into law by President Bush on January \n10, 2002.\n  The funds would be used for such purposes as mental health treatment \nand long-term health monitoring of rescue and recovery personnel.\n  The amendment is fully offset.\n  I ask for a voice vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2313.\n  The amendment (No. 2313) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Without objection, the matter before the \nSenate is amendment 2283.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, before I talk about this amendment that \nhas to do with avian flu, I add my congratulations to the Chicago White \nSox for a sterling performance--four straight games in the World \nSeries--to congratulate the team, and to congratulate their owner, \nJerry Reinsdorf. The last time the Chicago White Sox won\n\n[[Page S11959]]\n\nthe World Series was 1917. Of course, they were the Black Sox at that \ntime. And the outstanding performer during that 1917 classic was a guy \nby the name of Joseph Jefferson Jackson from Greenville, SC. Baseball \nfans and aficionados perhaps may not recognize his real name, but they \nwill recognize the name Shoeless Joe Jackson.\n  In 1999, along with Senator Thurmond and Senator Hollings, we \nintroduced a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It was accepted by the \nSenate. Commissioner Selig agreed to review the Shoeless Joe Jackson \ncase to reinstate him to baseball. However, 6 years have passed and Mr. \nSelig has done nothing.\n  With the winning of the World Series by the Chicago White Sox, it is \ntime to revisit this issue. In that regard, Senator DeMint from South \nCarolina and I have submitted a resolution. We will be talking about it \nlater today at an appropriate time when Senator DeMint and I can both \nbe on the Senate floor. I want Senators to know we have a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution that Senator DeMint and I will be submitting similar \nto the one we offered in 1999 once again trying to honor one of \nbaseball's all-time great players who suffered a great injustice at the \nhands of the then Commissioner Landis, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who was \na commissioner of baseball for almost 40 years. It was Commissioner \nLandis who banned Shoeless Joe Jackson from baseball, and robbed him of \nhis rightful place in the Baseball Hall of Fame. We will have more to \nsay about that later today.\n  I congratulate the Chicago White Sox on a great victory and thank my \ncolleague and my friend from South Carolina for working to get this new \nresolution. Hopefully, we will take it up in the Senate this afternoon \nand pass it sometime this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, we have an amendment before the Senate that is crucial \nto maybe even our most basic survival as a nation, perhaps crucial to \nthe survival of our economy and the future. I know that sounds like \noverblown rhetoric, but everyone has probably been reading lately about \nthe threat of an avian flu pandemic. It has been on all the news \nmagazines and all the news shows. Newsweek magazine last week had a \nvery comprehensive expose or at least a delineation of the flu, how it \nis spread, how virulent it is, and what it can do to us. So I don't \nthink it is overblown to say this perhaps could be the biggest threat \nour country has faced in the last 100 years.\n  As has been pointed out in numerous articles and I think elsewhere in \nthe Newsweek article I referred to earlier, what this pandemic could do \nto us as a people is even more threatening than what a few terrorists \ncould do and, as they point out, even a few terrorists with a nuclear-\ntype device. This pandemic could literally--estimated by the experts, \nnot by me--cause the death of anywhere from 200,000 to 2 million \nAmericans, with tens of millions of Americans hospitalized without any \ncapacity to take care of them. This would cause a disruption in our \neconomy the likes of which we have probably never seen.\n  I have been involved in looking at avian flu for the last several \nyears, tracking it and keeping in close contact with the National \nInstitutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nin Atlanta. I always try to be careful we do not unduly alarm people. I \ndon't want to put myself nor do I think we should put ourselves in the \nposition of unduly alarming or generating a phobia that paralyzes our \ncountry, but alarm bells must be rung. The warning signs are there. We \nhave to start preparing. The time for planning and thinking about it \nhas passed. We have to do something immediately.\n  The amendment we are debating allows the United States to \ndramatically step up emergency preparations for an avian flu pandemic. \nLast month, I offered on the Defense appropriations bill a similar \namendment that provided $3.9 billion to prepare for such a pandemic. At \nthat time, we did not know when or if the Labor-HHS bill would ever \ncome to the Senate. Obviously, this is the appropriate place for it \nsince this appropriations subcommittee under the leadership of Senator \nSpecter has jurisdiction over both the Department of Health and Human \nServices and also the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and \nalso the National Institutes of Health.\n  Between last month when this amendment was adopted on the Defense \nappropriations bill and now, I have gone back to NIH, the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, and a number of drug companies involved \nin either vaccine production or the production of antivirals to get a \nbetter handle on what it is we need to do. Just what is it?\n  I will admit that in the first amendment, which I offered on the \nDefense appropriations bill, we were missing some information. But now \nwe have that information. So the amendment we have before us today is a \nmore robust version of that earlier amendment we had on the Defense \nappropriations bill which was adopted by the Senate. This version is \nbased on more and better information.\n  There is a broad consensus in the scientific community as to the \nsteps we need to take to get ready for a potential pandemic. Reflecting \nthat scientific consensus, this amendment will do four broad things.\n  One, as our first line of defense, it will dramatically step up \ninternational surveillance of avian flu outbreaks overseas.\n  Two, it will ramp up our vaccine production infrastructure here in \nthe United States.\n  Three, it will give us resources to build up both stockpiles of \nvaccines currently believed to be effective against avian flu as well \nas stockpiling antiviral medications that you take if, in fact, you get \ninfected.\n  Fourth, this amendment will strengthen our public health \ninfrastructure at the Federal, State, and local levels, which today is \nsimply not equipped to cope with a major pandemic.\n  Some have suggested that we be patient and we wait for the \nadministration to put forward a plan to fight avian flu. We have \nalready waited too long. I am not saying we don't need a plan. We do \nneed an action plan. But we have been warned for years. The first \nwarning came in 1997 that an avian flu pandemic was not just possible \nbut likely, just as we were warned for years that the levees in New \nOrleans would fail in the case of a major hurricane. Yet the Federal \nGovernment did not come forward with any plan of action. I am not \nsaying this Government under President Bush. It was previous Federal \nGovernments. We did not heed the warnings. As I might even say, we were \nwarned in 1997 about a coming avian flu pandemic. Well, nothing was \ndone then either. There is a lot of blame to go around. I am not \nblaming anyone. I am saying, look, we have turned a blind eye and a \ndeaf ear to our warnings. Now we have to take action.\n  Within the last year, the threat of a pandemic has become even more \nurgent and immediate. The alarm bells are ringing at full volume, and \nwe in Congress cannot in good conscience wait any longer. We need to \nact. If the administration offers a plan at a later date, that is fine. \nIt will almost certainly have to include the elements we have in our \namendment. We are all talking to the same people, after all.\n  But here is the thing. I do not know when they are going to come up \nwith their plan. I do know at least there is talk around here that we \nare going to adjourn by Thanksgiving, finish our business, be out of \nhere by Thanksgiving. Well, if the administration comes up with a plan \nnext week, or the week after, and we are out of here, what happens in \nterms of needing the resources, the money? That is what we have.\n  Our responsibility as appropriators is to come up with the money. \nThat is what this amendment does, so that if the administration does \ncome up with a good action plan, we will not have lost any time. The \nmoney will be there, and we can move ahead as rapidly as possible.\n  There is no question the United States is woefully unprepared for a \nmajor outbreak of human-to-human transmitted avian flu. We have had \nclear warnings, as we did prior to 9/11, prior to Katrina, but, again, \nthe Federal Government did not do anything. Now we have been warned in \nno uncertain terms about avian flu, but, again, under two \nadministrations, nothing has happened.\n  As many of my colleagues know, avian flu--or H5N1, as it is called in \nthe scientific community--has passed from\n\n[[Page S11960]]\n\nbird to bird and from birds to humans. We know of one specific case--we \nknow of one specific case--where it went from human to human. Now, \nthere may be others, but we do know of them. And we do know that 50 \npercent of the humans who have been infected with avian flu have died--\n50 percent. It has a 50-percent mortality rate. We also know another \nthing: Every chicken, every member of the poultry family that has been \ninfected with avian flu dies--100 percent. This is a very virulent \nstrain.\n  Experts in virology at the Department of Health and Human Services \nsay it is only a matter of time before the virus mutates and human-to-\nhuman transmission becomes both widespread and sustained. That has not \nhappened yet. We have had some cases of the avian flu jumping from a \nbird to a human. As I said, we have had one known case of it going from \none human to another; and, I might add, both died. We have had no cases \nwhere the transmission is both sustained and pervasive, widespread, but \nthe virologists say it is only a matter of time before that happens.\n  An outbreak in China, Vietnam, Cambodia, or anywhere such as that, \ncould trigger within weeks a worldwide outbreak, facilitated by air \ntravel, the mass movement of people across borders. As I said, 50 \npercent of the individuals who have been infected have died. You can \nenvision a nightmare scenario, a kind of 21st century ``Black Death'' \nthat is not difficult to picture. Indeed, most experts say it is not a \nmatter of if but when.\n  Let me quote from an article that was in the recent Newsweek magazine \nof October 31, an article by Fareed Zakaria, entitled ``A Threat Worse \nThan Terror\":\n\n       ``A flu pandemic is the most dangerous threat the United \n     States faces today,'' says Richard Falkenrath, who until \n     recently served in the Bush administration as deputy Homeland \n     Security adviser. ``It's a bigger threat than terrorism. In \n     fact it's bigger than anything I dealt with when I was in \n     government.''\n       One makes a threat assessment on the basis of two factors: \n     the probability of the event, and the loss of life if it \n     happened. On both counts, a pandemic ranks higher than a \n     major terror attack, even one involving weapons of mass \n     destruction. A crude nuclear device would probably kill \n     hundreds of thousands. A flu pandemic could easily kill \n     millions.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Newsweek article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            [From Newsweek]\n\n                       A Threat Worse Than Terror\n\n                          (By Fareed Zakaria)\n\n       ``A flu pandemic is the most dangerous threat the United \n     States faces today,'' says Richard Falkenrath, who until \n     recently served in the Bush administration as deputy Homeland \n     Security adviser. ``It's a bigger threat than terrorism. In \n     fact it's bigger than anything I dealt with when I was in \n     government.'' One makes a threat assessment on the basis of \n     two factors: the probability of the event, and the loss of \n     life if it happened. On both counts, a pandemic ranks higher \n     than a major terror attack, even one involving weapons of \n     mass destruction. A crude nuclear device would probably kill \n     hundreds of thousands. A flu pandemic could easily kill \n     millions.\n       Whether this particular virus makes the final, fatal \n     mutation that allows it to move from human to human, one day \n     some virus will. The basic factor that is fueling this surge \n     of viruses is China's growth. (China is the natural habitat \n     of the influenza virus.) As China develops, it urbanizes, and \n     its forests and wetlands shrink. That forces migratory birds \n     to gather closer together--and closer to human habitation--\n     which increases the chances of a virus spreading from one \n     species to the next. Also, growth means a huge rise in \n     chicken consumption. Across thousands of homes in China every \n     day, chickens are slaughtered in highly unhygienic ways. \n     ``Every day the chances that this virus or another such virus \n     will move from one species to another grow,'' says Laurie \n     Garrett, author of ``The Coming Plague,'' who has been \n     writing brilliantly on this topic for years.\n       Nobody really disputes that we are badly unprepared for \n     this threat. ``If something like this pandemic were to happen \n     today,'' says Falkenrath, ``the government would be mostly an \n     observer, not a manager.'' The government can't even give \n     intelligent advice to its citizens because it doesn't \n     actually know what to say. We don't know whether people \n     should stay put, leave cities, stay home or go to the nearest \n     hospital. During the cold war, hundreds of people in \n     government participated in dozens of crisis simulations of \n     nuclear wars, accidents and incidents. These ``tabletop \n     exercises'' were conducted so that if and when a real crisis \n     hit, policymakers would not be confronting critical decisions \n     for the first time. No such expertise exists for today's \n     deadliest threat.\n       Beyond short-term measures for this virus--mainly stocking \n     up on Tamiflu--the only credible response to the development \n     of countermeasures. The best response would be a general \n     vaccine that would work against all strains of the flu. \n     That's a tall order, but it could be achieved. The model of \n     the Manhattan Project is often bandied about loosely, but \n     this is a case in which it makes sense. We need a massive \n     biomedical project aimed at tackling these kinds of diseases, \n     whether they're natural or engineered by terrorists.\n       The total funding request for influenza-related research \n     this year is about $119 million. To put this in perspective, \n     we are spending well over $10 billion to research and develop \n     ballistic-missile defenses, which protect us against an \n     unlikely threat (even if they worked). We are spending $4.5 \n     billion a year on R!--for the Pentagon's new \n     joint strike fighter. Do we have our priorities right?\n       The final sense in which we are unprepared is that we have \n     weak global organizations to deal with pandemics. The bird \n     flu is a problem that began in Guangdong, China, and spread \n     to Indonesia, Russia, Turkey, Romania and now possibly Iran. \n     It may move next into Africa. Some of these governments are \n     competent; others are not. Some hide information from \n     everyone; others simply refuse to share it with the United \n     States. We need a system that everyone will follow. The World \n     Health Organization should become the global body that \n     analyzes samples, monitors viruses, evaluates cures and keeps \n     track of the best practices. Yet the WHO leads a hand-to-\n     mouth existence, relying on the whims and grants of \n     governments. A year ago its flu branch had five people. Now \n     it has 12. It needs a much, much larger staff and its own set \n     of laboratories around the world that would allow it to \n     fulfill this clearinghouse function. Countries have finally \n     agreed to a new set of conventions that give the U.N. and the \n     WHO some of the authority they need. And Kofi Annan has \n     appointed one person to coordinate the global efforts to \n     fight pandemics.\n       Many people believed that globalization meant that \n     government would become less important. But as we see, \n     today's world has actually made government more crucial. Only \n     government can tackle a problem like this one, not by being \n     big but by being smart and effective. And we need good \n     governance not just at home but beyond. Without effective \n     international coordination, we are doomed to failure. John \n     Bolton once said that you could chop off 10 floors of the \n     United Nations and we'd all be better off. Let's hope that \n     the scientists fighting global diseases aren't on any of \n     those floors.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. We have to ask some very tough questions now. Where do \nour preparedness efforts stand? What can we do better? We are facing a \nthreat, a huge threat. We are doing nothing. We can do better. We must \ndo better for the American people to prepare for an avian flu pandemic.\n  First, let's look at the issue of global surveillance, which is No. 1 \nin terms of the first part of our amendment that we have addressed.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is doing a great job \nworking in cooperation with the World Health Organization and \ngovernments in affected regions to detect the disease and to help stop \nits spread. Dr. Gerberding, the head of the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention in Atlanta--I don't know if she is getting any sleep now \nbecause this is topmost on their agenda. They are on the case.\n  Surveillance can alert us to an outbreak, and governments can then \ntake measures to isolate the disease. This is our first line of \ndefense. The sooner we identify and contain an outbreak of human-to-\nhuman transmitted avian flu virus, the better off we will be. To coin a \nwell-worn phrase: It is better to fight them over there than to fight \nthem here. It is better to stop H5N1, isolate it, contain it where it \nmight break out, rather than having it transmitted and brought to other \ncountries and brought to America.\n  Again, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention know how to do \nthis. We had success with surveillance during the SARS outbreak a \ncouple years ago. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nmanaged to control its spread. It never got to America. I think the \nclosest it got, if I am not mistaken, was Toronto. But we also learned \nsome invaluable lessons from the SARS episode. We learned we have to be \nprepared, that our surveillance efforts have to be more than they have \nbeen in the past.\n  Secretary Leavitt, who I know has also been on top of this, recently \ntook a tour of Southeast Asia. He took Dr. Fauci, the Director of the \nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Gerberding, \nand others. I\n\n[[Page S11961]]\n\nknow they met with people in various parts of the governments of \nseveral countries in Southeast Asia.\n  What I heard back from that is, while the governments are willing to \nwork with us, and to report and survey, a lot of times they do not have \nthe capacity, they do not have the knowledge, they do not have the \nwherewithal of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They \ncould use our help. Many of these outbreaks of avian flu in those \ncountries are in remote locations, and the central government may not \nhave a lot of control over that.\n  If you take a small village where they have a lot of poultry, and \nmaybe that is one of their major sources of livelihood, and where they \ndo not understand the dimensions of avian flu and what it means, well, \nmaybe they do not report it, or it may be reported in a minor way. We \nneed people there on the ground who can move rapidly to the sites to \nsee whether a case of avian flu has broken out.\n  As I understand it, the governments of these countries are willing to \nwork with us to allow us to do that, but we do not have the resources \nto do that right now because the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention simply does not have the money. That is what is in our \namendment: to give the Secretary of Health and Human Services the money \nto be able to respond and get CDCP action prone, right now, in those \ncountries.\n  Secondly, what is the status of our capacity to produce vaccines here \nin the United States? Unfortunately, the news is almost all bad. It is \nastonishing that the United States has one plant--one plant--capable of \nmanufacturing flu vaccines. That plant happens to be in the State of \nour distinguished chairman, Pennsylvania. It is a great company. They \ndo great work. I have met with them. They use one technology. It is \negg-based technology. That is basically the technology we have been \nusing for a long time in which to grow vaccines from a virus strain.\n  So since we only have that one plant right now, in the event of a \nworldwide pandemic, the U.S. would have to rely on imported vaccines, \nvaccines other countries may not be willing to ship to us. In other \nwords, the first responsibility of any government is to protect its own \npeople. If this pandemic ever breaks out, I doubt any other government \nis going to be willing to ship us vaccines. They are going to want it \nfor their own people.\n  We are very vulnerable. We need to play some catch-up ball. The \nFederal Government needs to help private industry develop more vaccine \nmanufacturing capacity. These should be next-generation cell-based \nfacilities, which would then be capable of producing vaccines at twice \nthe rate of egg-based facilities.\n  This is the only way we are going to be able to produce enough \nvaccine rapidly enough to deal with a major outbreak. Right now it is \nall egg-based. As I understand it, the manufacturing plant I mentioned \nis in the process of enlarging its capacity for egg-based vaccines. \nThat is all well and good, but that still will not be enough to protect \nus in the future. It will not be sufficient to take a strain of the \nvirus and develop a vaccine specifically for that virus in a short \nperiod of time. Some say it would take 2 to 3 years to produce a \nnonegg-based production capacity. I don't accept that. This is a matter \nof incredible urgency. We have already given one grant to a company--it \nis public, I can mention it--Sanofi Pasteur, which is the company based \nin Pennsylvania that already has a cell-based vaccine manufacturing \nplant which they are increasing. The Government has already given them \na grant--it was under a competitive bid situation--to build a cell-\nbased plant. That is all well and good. But we have to do a lot more \nthan that. We need two or three on line being built now, not just one.\n  Our goal should be to have the research and production capacity to \nisolate a virus, convert it to a vaccine, produce enough vaccine for \nthe American populace, all within a timeframe of 3 to 6, maybe 9 months \nat the most. We can do that. That can be done. We don't have the \ncapacity to do it right now, and we are a long way from reaching that \ngoal.\n  Again, keep in mind that H5N1, the strain of the virus that is there \nnow, we have a vaccine for that. The National Institutes of Health, \nunder the great leadership of Dr. Zerhouni and Dr. Fauci at the \nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases--Dr. Fauci got a \nstrain of the virus earlier this year. They then began a crash program \nto develop a vaccine. They have. That vaccine is now in clinical \ntrials. It looks as though it is going to be pretty good against H5N1. \nBut we have been warned by experts that H5N1 may not be the strain that \ncomes here. It could be H5N2, N3, N4, N5, something else just as \nvirulent. Experts believe the vaccine being developed will have some \neffect, perhaps, on different strains, but they can't be sure.\n  What we need is a vaccine manufacturing capacity, cell-based, so you \ncan manufacture a vaccine in a hurry, so if a different strain were to \nhit here, we could again isolate the virus, develop the vaccine, and \nhave a vaccine within 6 to 9 months, not just developed but also \nmanufactured in sufficient capacity to vaccinate our people. That is \nalso in our amendment.\n  I hasten to add that in our amendment, we don't specify exactly how \nthis is to be done. We will leave that up to the Secretary--hopefully, \nworking with us in a collaborative effort--to figure out the best way \nof doing it. The point is to get the money out there now, to know it is \nthere, that we can move ahead with contractual relationships, cost-\nshare agreements, guaranteed purchases, whatever it takes to get these \nfacilities constructed in the shortest possible timeframe.\n  The third part of our amendment, we need an aggressive program of \npurchasing and stockpiling vaccines and antivirals. I just talked about \nvaccines. Vaccines are what you take to prevent getting the illness. \nAntivirals are what would you take if you get the illness so you don't \nget very sick. The World Health Organization a few years ago \nrecommended that nations stockpile enough antiviral medication to cover \nat least 25 percent of the population. Guess where we are right now. \nOne percent. We have enough antiviral medication to cover 1 percent of \nour people. Again, we have to play catch-up ball. Antivirals are the \nmedications one would take if they get sick. It will prevent a lot of \npeople from dying, help them get through the illness.\n  I had Senator Kennedy prepare this chart, which illustrates how \nunprepared we are. These are the stockpiles of antiviral medicine. \nAustralia has enough for 20 percent of the population; Great Britain \nhas enough for 25 percent, the World Health Organization \nrecommendation; France has 25 percent; Japan is rapidly building up, \nthey are at 17 percent. The U.S.A. is at 1 percent stockpile of \nmedications. Again, if the pandemic hits here, are we going to go to \nBritain and say: Send us some of yours, or Japan or France or some \nother place? No. They are going to keep their antivirals for their own \npeople. That is why we need to put the money out right now to begin the \npurchase of antivirals and to stockpile them. It has a long shelf life \nso we don't have to worry about it. That is the antivirals.\n  As for vaccines, we are facing a catch-22 situation. We won't be able \nto produce a vaccine until we actually see what the variant is, H5N1, \nH5N3, whatever it might be that causes the outbreak. Scientists at NIH \nhave developed a vaccine for H5N1. They believe it will be effective \nagainst some of the future variants, but we don't know exactly how \neffective. It is the best we have. It will at least provide some \nprotection. We should be stockpiling it now.\n  The fourth part of our amendment is the public health infrastructure. \nRight now our public health infrastructure is simply not capable of \ndealing either with an avian flu pandemic or even a major act of \nbioterrorism. Let's assume we build up adequate stocks of the vaccine. \nLet's say we are able to get a crash course and we can get up to 25 \npercent, like Great Britain, in our antivirals. Let's say we can do \nthat in a short period of time. I believe we can, if we put the funds \nout there. Let's say we have all that. It is going to go for naught if \nwe don't have a public health infrastructure to deliver it, to identify \nthe people who need it, to make sure these drugs and antivirals and \nvaccines get out there.\n  One thing I am upset about--the President's budget for fiscal year \n2006 proposed to cut $120 million from State public health agencies. \nThat is the\n\n[[Page S11962]]\n\nwrong way to go. Our amendment doesn't just restore that; it goes a lot \nfurther. It is not enough just to restore the funding. That funding \nwould basically take care of ``normal'' illnesses people get around the \ncountry. It wouldn't even come close if we had an outbreak of avian \nflu. We need to hire more public health professionals, epidemiologists, \nphysicians, lab technicians, others. We need people who are trained and \neducated to recognize, to know how to isolate, to know how to put the \nrings around populations if avian flu breaks out, and how to distribute \nit, who gets these, who is the first line of individuals.\n  Someone is detected having avian flu; let's say they do get H5N1. How \ndo we find out who that person came in contact with in the last 48 \nhours, track them down, get them the vaccines immediately, or the \nantivirals? Did the person work in a building that had central air-\nconditioning that could have taken the virus and spread it around? Who \nworks there? Get them the antivirals and the vaccines immediately. This \ntakes expertise. This takes people. This takes a knowledge base and \neducation.\n\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention know how to do it. \nThey can do it for minor outbreaks now. But something this big, we need \nto do more to build up that public health infrastructure. In consonance \nwith the public health infrastructure, we need to dramatically increase \nthe surge capacity of hospitals all across the country. Most hospitals \nright now have trouble coping if we have a bad flu season with what we \ncall ordinary flu. They would be overwhelmed by an avian flu pandemic.\n  Dr. Rick Blum, president of the American College of Emergency Room \nPhysicians, recently said:\n\n       We have pumped billions of dollars into preparedness since \n     9/11, but virtually none of that has gone to the one place \n     where we know 80 percent of patients go first, [the emergency \n     room].\n\n  For example, most victims of avian flu would need ventilators to help \nthem breathe. Right now there are only 105,000 ventilators in the \nentire United States, three-quarters of them in use on any given \ntypical day. So we have to prepare for surge capacity. Where do the \ntens of millions of Americans go? Don't take my word. Ask the experts. \nThat is what they are saying: a million to as high as maybe 10 million \nhospitalizations.\n  We have our work cut out for us. We face enormous technical and \nlogistical challenges. We have no time to waste. This amendment would \nprovide for nearly $8 billion for a comprehensive national effort to \nprepare in the ways I have outlined. More specifically, the total is \ndivided up as follows: $3.080 billion would be allocated for \nstockpiling antivirals and the necessary medical supplies to deal with \na pandemic once it has broken out; $3.3 billion would go to stockpiling \nflu vaccines, expanding the U.S. flu vaccine manufacturing capacity and \nfor vaccine-related research; $600 million in additional grants to \nState and public health agencies for their own emergency preparedness; \n$750 million to improve hospital preparedness and surge capacity--where \nis the overflow going to go--and for health technology information \nnetworks; $60 million for stepped-up global surveillance--this would \nquadruple the current level of surveillance we have right now, our \nfirst line of defense--$75 million allocated for communication and \noutreach to the public in case of an avian flu pandemic.\n  Again, this is where you have to tread lightly. You want to get \npeople informed. People should be understanding of this. If a case of \navian flu were to break out in this country, we don't want panic to \nensue. People need to be adequately informed and advised. This has to \ndo with communications and outreach.\n  Lastly, $100 million will be channeled into research and CDC lab \ncapacity related to an avian flu pandemic.\n  Now, this is about double what we had in the Defense appropriations \nbill almost a month ago. And the reason for that is simply because in \nthe meetings we have had with Government officials, with drug \ncompanies, and others, it has become clear that the big gap in the \namendment we offered earlier was the $3.3 billion in stockpiling flu \nvaccine and getting money out there to rapidly build cell-based \ntechnology through vaccine-manufacturing plants. We have to do that \nright away.\n  I know the analogy may not be correct, but when people say you can't \ndo that in a big hurry, I say just think about the Pentagon over here, \nhow big it is. Have you ever seen the Pentagon? We built the Pentagon \nin 9 months during World War II, by the way. Now, I know that vaccine \nmanufacturing is not the same but, come on, we can do it. We can build \nthe facilities. A lot of it is in equipment. But if the money is there, \nwe know we can get the equipment built. Maybe we can't do it in 9 \nmonths, but don't tell me we can't do it within a year and a half, or \nat least have a couple on line within a year. That is really the big \ndifference between this amendment and the one that was offered a month \nago on the Defense appropriations bill.\n  Let me again sum up by saying this is the proper bill for it to be \non. If we had had Labor-HHS earlier, we would have offered the \namendment to that. This is the proper place for it. We do have the \njurisdiction. It ought to be here. And, again, we are not tying the \nhands of the Secretary or anyone else. We are not being absolutely \nspecific on how you do things in the amendment. We want the money to be \nthere. When the administration comes up with their plan and they want \nto move ahead, it is there. We have 3 more weeks--I don't know how many \nweeks. Everybody tells us 3 more weeks. Let's face it, there are a lot \nof things happening in the administration--Supreme Court Justices, \nother things that are bouncing around here that divert attention. We \ncannot divert our attention. We cannot. We have to get this money out \nthere and get it appropriated.\n  I will have more to say perhaps later on. I know there are other \nSenators who wish to speak on this amendment and about the threat of an \navian flu pandemic. So I will yield the floor at this time and just say \nI hope we can have a strong vote or have this amendment accepted as we \ndid under the Defense appropriations bill that was taken up earlier. \nAnd, again, this is emergency funding--emergency funding. It ought to \nbe emergency funding. It is something we have to do. We just cannot \nwait any longer.\n  So I will yield the floor and ask any Senators who want to speak on \nthis amendment to come over and speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commend my distinguished colleague from \nIowa for his leadership on this very important issue. I spoke briefly \nyesterday about the matter and expressed my agreement with the basic \nthrust of what the Senator from Iowa is seeking to accomplish. There is \nno doubt that we face a tremendous potential problem with the impact, \nwhich could be devastating, as Senator Harkin has outlined.\n  We have been awaiting a plan from the administration because in the \nnormal course of events, with the expertise at the Department of Health \nand Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control, we would look \nto the administration to give us an appraisal as to what their plans \nare, what their evaluation has been, and how much money they think they \nneed.\n  Senator Harkin has gone over a number of facts and factors, but the \nexecutive branch has more at its disposal than does the Congress, at \nleast at this stage. Our subcommittee has scheduled a hearing on this \nissue. It is fair to say that we have been under a heavy workload in \npreparing this bill, and we have had other very heavy commitments, most \nnotably in the confirmation proceedings which were recently concluded \nfor Chief Justice Roberts, and the confirmation hearings which have \nbeen intense for Ms. Harriet Miers until her withdrawal this morning.\n  We have been in touch with the executive branch and have sought to \nget information from them as to what they would like to have done. And \nI have a call in to Secretary Leavitt at the moment, the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, to get as much information as we can from \nthe executive branch.\n  We have been exploring an alternative and are in the process of \nmodifying the amendment from the Senator from Iowa to call for the \ndisbursement of these funds at the discretion of the President after \nconsultation with certain designated Members of the Congress. We are \nnow talking about the\n\n[[Page S11963]]\n\nbreadth of what we have in mind: The chairmen and ranking members of \nthe Appropriations committees of both Houses, perhaps adding the \nchairmen and ranking members of the Appropriations subcommittees on \nlabor, health and human services and education. Also, the suggestion \nhas been made about having the chairmen and ranking members of the \ncommittees on health, education, labor, and pensions. We are trying to \nsort through that now to have a workable consultation but leaving the \njudgment to the President.\n  We are well aware of the very substantial sum of money which is in \nthis amendment, in the range of $8 billion. We are also well aware of \nthe scope and magnitude of the problem. It would have to receive 60 \nvotes to have an emergency designation but, again, with the \nexpenditures in the hands of the President, there is about as good an \nassurance as you can have it would be wisely disbursed.\n  At any rate, we are in the midst of trying to work this through. If \nthe Congress does not act--we are not too far away from adjournment--\nthe funding will not be present. The President can't spend money \nwithout the appropriation coming from the Congress. If there is to be \nan emergency supplemental, all of that takes time. And once you go \nthrough a supplemental, then there is the risk of it becoming a \nChristmas tree with many other items being included.\n  So when we have the appropriations for the Department of Health and \nHuman Services and this subcommittee working with that Department and \nwith the Centers for Disease Control, we are the logical subcommittee \nto take up the issue and to grapple with it. We, obviously, are very \nconcerned about the responsibility for appropriating this kind of \nfunding.\n  So that is where we stand. I note the senior Senator from Illinois \nhas come to the floor, and Senator Harkin and I would urge anyone else \nwho wants to speak to come to the floor now because we are going to be \nmoving for a vote on this subject in the immediate short timespan.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator just yield for a minute?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to respond by thanking the chairman and my good \nfriend from Pennsylvania for his great leadership on this issue. You \nsaid it about me, but you have been the chairman. You have led this \nsubcommittee. You know what is needed. You have been first and foremost \nin insisting that we get the funds necessary for both CDC and for NIH \nfor this research.\n  I might just say again for public knowledge, obviously our chairman, \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania, has to wear other hats. As chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee he has been tied up a lot on Supreme Court \nnominees, and I recognize he has had to deal with that on his side, in \nchairing that committee. It is an awesome responsibility, and I commend \nhim for the work he has done, by the way. I thought the hearings on \nJudge Roberts were superb, and I commend my friend for his leadership \nin chairing that committee.\n  So we find ourselves in the situation now where we have asked for \ninformation in the past, but things happen around here and we move on \nand our focus gets diverted a little bit on this and that. That is \nhuman nature. I understand that. I hope we can hear back from the \nadministration.\n  I say to my friend from Pennsylvania that I have no problem in \nmodifying the amendment or whatever it might be that would say that the \nmoney is there. In fact, the amendment does not say how they would \nspend it. It would be there for them. If there is any way we can modify \nthat, if they have some other ways on what to do, that is fine with me. \nI do not mind that at all. I am just concerned that we have it there so \nthat we don't have to come back at some point and they can't say, well, \nwe would do it, but Congress didn't appropriate the money.\n  I sure do not want to have that sitting on our plate, I say to \nchairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment being \noffered by the Senator from Iowa. It might not be this winter, it might \nnot be next winter, but it is going to happen. The virtual certainty of \na pandemic flu is what public health leaders are telling us we as a \ncountry need to be prepared for. So are we prepared? The obvious answer \nis no.\n  Last week, HCD Research polled 846 doctors from across the country \nabout their sense of how well prepared America is to face a pandemic \nflu. Four out of five of the doctors surveyed said America is not \nprepared for a public health crisis that we have been told is virtually \ncertain to occur.\n  When it comes to public health challenges, America can do better. \nWhat is our national leadership on this issue? We still do not have a \nnational pandemic preparedness plan. The administration has been \nworking on a plan, literally, for years.\n  As we head into this flu season, still there is no plan coming from \nthis administration. Communities need Federal guidance. This is not an \nissue where every village, every town, every State can make its own \npolicy.\n  California's State health officer said:\n\n       While state and local officials have been taking what steps \n     they can to prepare for avian flu, they've been eagerly \n     anticipating a national preparedness plan to tell them how to \n     seal up those gaps. And where is that plan? The \n     administration tells us to expect one sometime soon but it is \n     long, long overdue.\n\n  Japan has had its national pandemic preparedness plan in place since \n1997. Canada, Austria, Great Britain, all have a national preparedness \nplan in place. We look forward to seeing this plan from this \nadministration.\n  In the meantime, I am joining Senators Harkin, Obama, and Kennedy to \noffer this pandemic flu amendment. Senator Harkin has been our voice \nand our leader on this issue. Senator Kennedy has made a lifetime of \npublic service devoted to public health issues. Senator Obama, my new \ncolleague from the State of Illinois, was one of the first to speak out \nin our State and bring this to my attention and the attention of so \nmany Members. I salute all three of them for their extraordinary \nleadership.\n  This proposal would make $8 billion available to immediately ramp up \npreparation for the flu pandemic, whether it is the H5N1 strain now \nrampant in birds or another virulent strain that might threaten us. We \nknow this pandemic is virtually inevitable, in the words of Dr. \nGerberding of the Centers for Disease Control.\n  What does this amendment do? It gives the Federal health agencies \nwhat they need to move immediately and aggressively to get this country \nready for a global pandemic flu.\n  Let's start with hospitals. That is an important line of defense for \npeople sick with flu. Communities and hospitals need to develop surge \ncapacity to figure out how to take care of people when the beds are \nfilled and the emergency room is overwhelmed and the neighboring \ncounties face similar situations. The Trust for America's Health \nanticipates U.S. hospitals will swell by more than 2 million people if \nwe face this flu pandemic. But Health and Human Services Secretary \nLeavitt has worried aloud that communities haven't even prepared for \nthis surge in hospital admissions.\n  The American College of Emergency Physicians President Rick Blum \nsays:\n\n       We've pumped billions of dollars into preparedness since 9/\n     11 but virtually none of that has gone to the one place where \n     we know that 80 percent of the patients go first.\n\n  Whether it is a terrorist attack, a natural disaster, or a public \nhealth disaster, hospitals are stretched now to have staff to handle \nthe daily flow of patients. They are already operating with a real \nshortage of nurses and other health professionals.\n  Realistically, aren't a significant percentage of those health care \nworkers going to get sick themselves if we have a new pandemic or stay \naway from the clinical setting once the pandemic hits?\n  These are serious and important questions we need to ask, answer, and \nbe prepared to face.\n  The Harkin amendment provides $750 million for communities to prepare \nfor additional hospital beds and working with shortages of doctors, \nnurses, and other health professionals.\n  The amendment also provides $3 billion so the Federal Government can \nget in line to buy antiviral medicines to have on hand for an outbreak \nof flu. Until there is cash in hand to purchase the drugs, the \nGovernment cannot contractually commit to buy them; they cannot even \nget in line to buy them.\n\n[[Page S11964]]\n\n  The United States has about 2.3 million courses of antiviral \nmedications stockpiled--2.3 million for a nation of our size. We expect \nanother 2 million by the end of next month. That is enough to treat \nabout 2 percent of the U.S. population, far short of the international \nstandard of 20 to 25 percent.\n  Senator Frist has asked the Secretary to try to increase that \nstockpile to ensure treatment so that we could treat 50 percent of \nAmerica. Our amendment would provide Secretary Leavitt with the \nresources he needs to make it happen. We go beyond political rhetoric \nto political reality.\n  Our amendment also provides $3.3 billion so we can intensify our \nsearch for a vaccine that could protect Americans from contracting flu \nin the first case. If we can develop and manufacture a vaccine that is \neffective against the pandemic flu, we might be able to stop this flu \nepidemic in its tracks. Testing drugs is expensive. It is time \nconsuming. We have to invest in it and invest in it now.\n  The amendment also adds $60 million for global surveillance. I heard \none public health official describe this as ``situational awareness.'' \nMargaret Chan, who leads the pandemic flu planning efforts for the \nWorld Health Organization, estimates there is a window of only ``20 to \n21 days'' in which a local outbreak could be controlled before it is \nturned loose on the world.\n  Fareed Zakaria, in the recent issue of Newsweek on this particular \nissue of the flu pandemic, wrote as follows:\n\n       Many people believed that globalization meant that \n     government would become less important. But as we see, \n     today's world has actually made government more crucial. Only \n     government can tackle a problem like this one, not by being \n     big but by being smart and effective. And we need good \n     governance not just at home but beyond. Without effective \n     international coordination, we are doomed to failure.\n\n  If we hope to contain this flu, we have to know where and when the \nfirst outbreak occurs, and we can only do that if we step up the work \nwe are doing with other countries to monitor contagious diseases.\n  Karen Hughes, a confidante of President Bush, now with the State \nDepartment, recently spoke about the $5.5 million the United States has \nspent on technical assistance to other countries--$5.5 million. That is \nnot enough, and we know it.\n  Secretary Leavitt concluded his trip to seven Asian countries with \nthis observation:\n\n       Right now, the world's surveillance is not adequate to \n     protect us.\n\n  Many people in the Bush administration are acknowledging the problem. \nWhat we want them to do is acknowledge the solution, the Harkin-\nKennedy-Obama amendment. We need this money. Americans deserve Federal \nleadership. We need leadership that prepares us for a disaster, not \njust telling us it is coming but doing something. America can do better \nto make our individuals and families safe from these public health \nthreats.\n  A few weeks ago, President Bush praised John Barry's book, ``The \nGreat Influenza,'' a historical account of the 1918 pandemic flu. If \nyou read the book, you will find John Barry was critical of the role of \nGovernment in that influenza outbreak. He blamed lack of preparation in \nthis country on Congress. Here is what he said:\n\n       They cut every budget request in half.\n\n  Are we facing the same thing today? Are we doomed to repeat that same \nmistake when it comes to this avian influenza? We will not be if we \ntake the leadership initiative of Senator Harkin. We are not seeing the \nleadership from the White House at this moment that the country needs. \nIt is time for Congress to move decisively, to enact this amendment, to \nprovide direction in funding and progress to prepare the United States \nfor the virtual certainty of a pandemic flu outbreak.\n  Senator Frist has made it clear he wants the Senate to finish its \nbusiness and go home by Thanksgiving, but unless and until we address \nthe avian flu pandemic, we should not go home. We should go home to an \nAmerica that gives thanks that its leaders in Congress--in the House \nand the Senate--had the vision and determination to deal with this \npublic health challenge. Our work will not be completed until we do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n             withdrawal of the nominations of harriet miers\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Harriet Miers confirmation process \nhas been one of the most unusual and troubling Supreme Court \nnominations in our modern history.\n  The loudest voices heard in this process were the voices of the \nextreme factions of the President's own political party.\n  They had a litmus test, and they decided Harriet Miers didn't meet \nthat test even before giving her a fair chance to have her own voice \nheard. That is not what the confirmation process is about, and their \nlitmus test is not what the Supreme Court is about.\n  The more Ms. Miers's record indicated that she might in fact be \npersonally committed to the basic constitutional rights and liberties \nthat make our country what it is for all Americans, the more committed \nthose extreme groups and their partisan voices in the media became to \nprevent her nomination from being confirmed by the Senate.\n  Most of us in the Senate were ready to give Harriet Miers a fair \nchance and a fair hearing. We wanted to have a dignified process in \nwhich the evidence would come first, and then the decision, and Harriet \nMiers deserved that chance.\n  It is disingenuous for the President to suggest that Senators' \ninsistence on White House records was somehow responsible for the \nwithdrawal of the Miers' nomination. If the President were willing to \nstand up to the extremists in his party, a realistic compromise could \neasily have been found on this issue.\n  The fact that the White House and Senate Republicans were not willing \nto stand up for principle and fairness against the extremists in their \nmidst should be disturbing to all Americans. But now we have all seen \nthat fringe of our society at its worst, and we know that their agenda \nis not the Nation's agenda.\n  President Bush has an opportunity now to unite the country. In \nchoosing the next nominee, he should listen to all Americans, not just \nthe far right.\n  If he does, we can have a smooth and dignified confirmation process \nand avoid the kind of harsh battle that the extremists on the right \nseem bent on provoking.\n  President Bush should take whatever time is necessary to find a \nconsensus nominee to fill Justice O'Connor's seat on the Court.\n  Justice O'Connor is willing to serve the Court and the Nation for as \nlong as it takes, so there is no need to rush to send a new nominee to \nthe Senate. Hopefully, the next selection will share Justice O'Connor's \nvalues and her commitment to the Nation's progress in achieving equal \nrights for all.\n  We are reminded that the nomination of Justice O'Connor was sent to \nthe Senate by President Reagan and had a unanimous vote in the Senate. \nShe has served with great distinction and eloquence and is a beloved \nfigure in the United States.\n  That kind of nomination brought the country together. It certainly is \nan opportunity now for the President to follow what President Ronald \nReagan did in bringing the country together on a Supreme Court nominee. \nIt seems to me that would best serve the country, best serve the \nConstitution, and best serve the Supreme Court.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2283, as Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I thank my friend from Iowa, Senator Harkin, for his \nextraordinary leadership on the issue of avian flu. I thank my other \ncolleagues in the Senate--Senator Reid, Senator Barack Obama, Senator \nDurbin, and others--who have been important voices in helping us focus \nthe attention of this body on the issue of avian flu.\n  I also acknowledge the support that has been given to the Harkin \nproposal by the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee dealing \nwith health, Senator Specter. I also acknowledge and commend the work \nof my colleagues and friends, the chairman of our Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, Senator Enzi, and Senator Burr, the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Bioterrorism and Public Health \nPreparedness. He has spent a great portion of his time in the Senate, \nworking on biodefense and related public health threats, and the\n\n[[Page S11965]]\n\nchallenges in developing countermeasures, vaccines and antivirals to \ndeal with new public health challenges.\n  We are at a very important step. We are on an issue which is of such \ncentral importance to health care that we have seen the Senate come \ntogether. There are a lot of issues that are divisive, but it seems \nthat we are making remarkable progress in this area.\n  Our legislation is timely. I remind the Senate that this issue, \npandemic flu, has been a concern of the world community for some time. \nThis chart says, ``The U.S. Missed the Warning Signs of the Flu \nPandemic.'' The Institute of Medicine warned us about this in 1992; \nthen we had the General Accounting Office warning us in November of \n2000. This is what the General Accounting Office had stated:\n\n       Influenza pandemic. Plan Needed for Federal and State \n     Response, November 2000.\n\n  Despite these warnings, we still do not have a plan.\n  The warnings continue: In the year 2001, we had the warning of the \nEuropean Commission, and in 2002 the World Health Organization. And \nthen we have had recent outbreaks take place in South Korea and \nVietnam.\n  The current avian flu strain poses a deadly threat. If you have this \nvirus, this chart displays the chances of survival. One can see from \nthis chart that there is only a 50-percent chance of survival. Granted, \nthere have only been several dozen cases in each of these countries, \nbut nonetheless, this figure, of 50 percent, does show that we are in \ngreat danger if there is a pandemic.\n  We have seen other countries move ahead: Japan released its pandemic \nplan in October 1997; Canada, February 2004; the Czech Republic, April \n2004; Hong Kong, February 2005; Britain, March 2005; and the United \nStates, we're still waiting.\n  What is important here is the fact that we are taking three major \napproaches to preparing for a pandemic.\n  One, we are going to have an important commitment to stockpiling \nantivirals and vaccines. That is going to be enormously important, \nparticularly given the fact that we have such an inadequate stockpile \ntoday. We've stockpiled antivirals for only 1 percent of the \npopulation. This is incredibly low in comparison to other countries. \nWith this amendment, we will have the opportunity to stockpile what is \nneeded.\n  Secondly, we will be supporting efforts to detect the potential \nspread of the virus globally and in the United States, and we provide \nresources to contain it and improve our surge capacity, which is \nenormously important.\n  I know there are some differences with our friends and colleagues on \nthe other side about the public health aspects of this. And I know \nSenator Burr is strongly committed to doing a review of the entire \npublic health system and making a series of recommendations--which I \nthink are going to be enormously important, and I look forward to \njoining him--but this is a small downpayment to ensure we begin making \nprogress in the area of pandemic preparedness and public health.\n  A review of any other country's pandemic preparedness plan will show \nthat it is not only the stockpiling of the vaccines and antivirals \nthat's needed, but also the public health component. So this has that \ndimension, which is very important: improving the public health system, \nand stockpiling antivirals and vaccines.\n  The third aspect, which will be included in the proposal by Senator \nEnzi and Senator Burr and others, will deal with the incentives that \nwill be made available to industry to develop countermeasures and \nvaccines, and also, hopefully, some compensation, for example, for \nfirst responders who might take a particular vaccine or antiviral that \nmight not have gone through the complete safety process at the FDA and \nstill, as a first responder, be committed and dedicated to protecting \nthe public. We want to make sure that if those individuals, who are \ncommitted to protecting the public, suffer from an adverse reaction to \nthe vaccine or antiviral, they won't be left high and dry. They deserve \nprotection for themselves and for their families.\n\n  This is a complex issue, but I think the Senate has come together and \nwill come together with the succeeding legislation in a very important \nway.\n  The final dimension is where the administration, HHS, will be in \nterms of their plan. We eagerly await its release. We understand it \nwill be forthcoming in a very short period of time, but we don't have \nit yet.\n  We have seen examples of national pandemic plans, for example, the \nCanadian plan which was issued in 2004, that talks about what does this \nplan address? Who is responsible for pandemic planning? It goes into \nthe roles and responsibilities of all of the different governmental \nagencies.\n  Why is this an important health issue? It goes into great detail \nabout what is going to be communicated to the public, the legal \nconsiderations, the ethical considerations, and then it goes into what \npreparations are being made. It addresses specific components of the \npreparation: surveillance, vaccine, antivirals, health service, \nemergency planning, emergency service, public health interests, \ncommunications, and then what needs to happen to ensure a comprehensive \nresponse. It goes into a whole series of recommendations and details \nwhat will be involved in the recovery.\n  This plan is very thorough. I think the American people are entitled \nto that kind of plan in order to protect their health and safety.\n  I thank Senator Harkin, Senator Specter, my friend and colleague \nSenator Enzi, Senator Burr, and others who have been involved. I think \nthis is going to be an enormously important and historic action by the \nSenate when it is completed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I express my appreciation for the comments \nof Senator Kennedy, Senator Harkin, and others on the floor, discussing \nthe importance of this biodefense legislation in the overall response \nto bird flu and other potential infectious diseases.\n  I express special thanks to Senator Burr and Senator Kennedy for \ntheir help on the subcommittee that has been in charge of this, for the \nextensive hearings they have had, which have included a number of \nmeetings many of us attended with experts from around the world who \ndeal with these problems, and for coming up with a comprehensive \nsolution that will address whatever happens to come up, whether it is \navian flu, SARS, or some other pandemic we have not envisioned yet.\n  We have a bill that was reported out of the committee a little over a \nweek ago that deals with that comprehensive response. I am hoping \neverybody will take a look at the work we did on that. Again, I want to \nexpress my thanks to Senator Burr for his work and the leadership he \nhas provided.\n  One of the key principles of that legislation is that our response \nactivities must be more broadly focused, not focused solely on the \nlatest, newly emerging disease. So that, even if bird flu never becomes \na pandemic, we will be prepared for the next infectious disease, as I \nmentioned, perhaps even a new SARS outbreak. The money spent will not \nbe wasted because the process that will be set up will be able to \nhandle a wide range of things.\n  Given that, I believe the additional funding for a potential flu \npandemic should be focused on broader response activities. In examining \nthe initial amendment proposed by Senator Harkin, and as Senator \nKennedy discussed on the floor yesterday, the overall funding was \nintended for stockpiling antivirals, strengthening public health \nresponses, increasing global health surveillance, dramatically \nincreasing the vaccine infrastructure, improving hospital preparedness, \nincluding surge capacity and health information technology systems, and \nother key elements.\n  These elements are broader than bird flu. If targeted appropriately \nand implemented properly, it will mean that we Americans will be better \nprepared for whatever new infectious disease comes our way, not just \nbird flu. That is why I have worked with Senator Harkin to come up with \nan amendment that clarifies we are going for the broader picture that \nall of us worked on in committee.\n  I was pleased with the unanimous response we had for getting it out \nof committee. So rather than the funding provided in the Labor, HHS \nbill being for a very limited thing, we want to focus on the broader \ncontext we have all worked on and agreed on, for the most part. We will \nbe bringing a bill to the floor, I hope, to cover this in great\n\n[[Page S11966]]\n\ndetail and then a second bill that will deal with public health.\n  I appreciate the work Senator Harkin has done on this and the way he \nhas brought it to the attention of the American public. I appreciate \nthe work of Senator Burr on this to have a bill that actually does this \ncomprehensively. I also appreciate the way people are working together \nto come up with a safe, secure United States.\n  I particularly thank the Senator from Texas for her indulgence, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I do thank the Senator from Wyoming \nfor the great leadership he is providing for our Nation to start \npreparing us for the different types of flu viruses that might come our \nway. I know he has worked very hard on this in his chairmanship of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. I certainly was \npleased to hear his comments on this very important issue. It is one \nthat is important for all of us to assure that our country is ready if \nwe have the kind of pandemic that could happen. It reminds me of Y2K \nwhen many were concerned that computers would crash all over America \nwhen we turned into the next century, and because we were prepared, \nthere was no crisis. That is what I hope is the result of our \naddressing the potential flu strains that may be making their way \nacross the world and could affect Americans in the future.\n\n\n                             Harriet Miers\n\n  Mr. President, I particularly will talk today about my friend Harriet \nMiers. All of us were stunned this morning--I certainly was--when I \nheard she had submitted her resignation as a nominee to the Supreme \nCourt because I have total confidence in her. I have total confidence \nshe would have been a superb Justice of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. I have that confidence because I know her.\n  Many people were making judgments before they knew her. They were not \ngiving her the benefit of the opportunity to come into an open forum \nand talk about her views.\n  She wrote today to the President: As you know, Members of the Senate \nhave indicated their intention to seek documents about my service in \nthe White House in order to judge whether to support me. I have been \ninformed repeatedly that in lieu of records I would be expected to \ntestify about my service in the White House to demonstrate my \nexperience and judicial philosophy. While I believe that my lengthy \ncareer provides sufficient evidence for consideration of my nomination, \nI am convinced the efforts to obtain executive branch materials and \ninformation will continue.\n  This is a letter that was written by a woman who cares more about our \ncountry, more about our President and his role and the respect for his \nrole under the separation of powers in the Constitution, than she cares \nabout a wonderful cap for a wonderful career, and that is her career. I \nadmire her even more, if that is possible, for the decision she has \nmade. I have to say I am disappointed in that decision because I know \nshe would have been a superb Justice. She would have been a strict \nconstructionist. She would have been a judge who knew the place of a \njudge, not to make law, which is a requirement and responsibility for \nthose elected for that purpose. She would have been a Justice who \nlooked at and interpreted the law.\n  I will tell my colleagues what else Harriet Miers would have done \nthat I think is very important. She would have known what it was she \ncould do on the Supreme Court to give guidance to legislatures, to \nMembers of Congress, to clients who are being represented by lawyers \nthroughout the country, about how the law should be interpreted. She \nwould have given the guidance to legislatures about what the \nconstitutional requirement would be.\n  When one is giving tests for discrimination, for instance, the \nSupreme Court has said there are varying tests for discrimination. \nThere are rigid tests in some circumstances, there are more moderate \ntests in other circumstances. I would like to have had someone on the \nCourt with real-world experience to more clearly define those tests so \nthat Congress, so that legislatures, would know when they pass a law \nmore how the Court would interpret that law in light of a more clear \npath to the right result.\n  I would have liked someone who has had the experience of living in a \npart of the country that is different from other members of the Court. \nI think we need diversity of geography. I think there are different \nissues in eminent domain, in business and commerce, in regard for \nprivate property rights, in States that have a lot of Federal lands \nversus States that do not have a lot of Federal lands. There are \ndifferent approaches to these issues by people who live in different \nparts of the country and I think that kind of diversity is important.\n  This is a woman who has been a leader in the legal field. She worked \nher way through SMU Law School. She was also case notes editor of the \nSouthwestern Law Journal, which is now the SMU Law Review. She became \none of the first women to be hired by a major Dallas law firm as an \nassociate. She then rose to lead that law firm, to be the managing \npartner, the first woman to do so in the State of Texas. She worked in \nthe leadership of the bar association, which is the legal organization \nthat sets the standards of ethics, propriety, and practice for our \nlawyers in this country. She rose to be the first woman president of \nthe Dallas Bar Association and later the first woman president of the \nState Bar Association.\n  I graduated from law school about the same time she did. I graduated \nfrom the University of Texas. She graduated from SMU. I know how hard \nit was to get a job. I know the obstacles she faced. I know she did not \nhave the door opened for her with her outstanding record at SMU that \nmany of our male colleagues in law school had. Yet, she attacked those \nbarriers with a positive attitude and spirit. She knew if she proved \nherself, she would be rewarded as anyone else. She never gave up.\n  She caught the eye of a Governor of Texas, and she had been a \nDemocrat. I think everyone knows she was a Democrat in the early years. \nMost people in Texas were. In 1989, she made a decision that she wanted \nto support a Republican, George W. Bush. That changed her views in many \nthings. I think some of the things that were being brought up from \nbefore she changed her views and her support have been used to indicate \nshe is not firm in her views. Well, I think she is firm in her views. I \nthink she is firmly a strict constructionist, a person who has proven \nherself intellectually in business, in experience, and in leadership. \nShe would have been a terrific Justice. I do not think she was given \nher due.\n\n  I am disappointed, but I do not question her decision because I know \nshe made the decision on the right points and for the right reasons. \nShe wanted to protect the Presidency from invasion of the rights of the \nPresident.\n  Can you imagine if a President had to stop and think--before asking \nadvice from his legal counsel or his top staff as he is trying to make \nan important decision for our country: If I ask this question in \nwriting, is that going to be recoverable in the public arena? Do I then \nhave to temper what I say?\n  A President cannot talk to each of his staff members all day. He has \nmany other responsibilities, so he has to communicate in writing. I \nthink he should be able to communicate with his key staff people as he \nis in the decision making process, and I think he should not have to \nworry that it is going to, all of a sudden, be misconstrued in the \npublic arena when it was part of his decision making process.\n  That is what Harriet Miers is also trying to protect. She is giving \nup probably something she never dreamed she would be, because it is the \npinnacle of a legal career to be a Justice on the Supreme Court. She is \ngiving that up because she believes that right of the President would \neither be invaded or it would be made a cause celebre, and that would \nnot be healthy for our country or for the President. So she gave up \nwhat could have been a dream of hers, to do what is right for our \ncountry.\n  I want to reaffirm my view that she would have been an excellent \nSupreme Court Justice, that she had the right background and \nexperience, that she would have brought a viewpoint that is a very \nimportant viewpoint to the Court. You know, if we didn't want diversity \nof experience in making these\n\n[[Page S11967]]\n\nimportant decisions, we would have one Justice of the Supreme Court; we \nwouldn't have to have nine. Our Founding Fathers decided to have nine. \nI think they were right, as they are in so many parts of the \nConstitution that they thought would be important for the Constitution \nto last over 200 years. I think diversity of experience and background \nis very helpful for a Court of nine Justices.\n  I am disappointed today, but I am very supportive of her decision \nbecause it was her decision and because she made it for the right \nreasons. I wish her well and I am very pleased she is going to stay as \nWhite House Counsel, one of the most important jobs in the White House. \nShe will continue serving our country. When I talked to her this \nmorning she was upbeat, she was positive, she was strong, and I know \nshe will be a great contributor to the United States of America and to \nthe President she serves. I commend her today, with all that she has \ngone through, for the grace with which she has gone through it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I understand there are other speakers who wish to be \nheard on the pandemic amendment. I urge them to come to the floor now. \nWe still have quite a list of amendments to deal with. It is Thursday \nafternoon. I know that is a signal of Members' special interest.\n  To those who have amendments they want to have heard and disposed of \nbefore we go to third reading and final passage, I urge them to come to \nthe floor at this time.\n  In the absence of any Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to address the issue which is being \ndebated here relative to the amendment by Senator Harkin regarding the \navian flu and how we are going to address this very serious potential \npandemic. We all recognize this is a threat of dramatic proportions, \nnot only to our society but to the world generally. As a Congress, we \nhave tried to begin to address this matter relative to other issues \nthat could have an equal impact, involving biologics that could be used \nagainst our society in a terrorist attack.\n  Three years ago I authored a bill called the BioShield bill. Along \nwith a number of Members of this Senate, including Senator Kennedy, who \nwas the ranking member of the committee I chaired at that time, the \nHELP Committee, we put together a package which basically created a \nstructure which we hoped would lead to development of vaccines to \naddress the threat which was posed by the use of biological weapons \nagainst our country, specifically things such as smallpox, anthrax, \nbotulism, and plague.\n  That proposal, the BioShield bill, was funded at $5.6 billion, which \nis a lot of money. The reason we put that much money in the pipeline \nwas because we wanted to create an incentive for the pharmaceutical \nindustry and for startup biological companies to begin to develop \nvaccines.\n  Our country, regrettably, has seen basically a devastation of the \nvaccine industry. We used to have 30 to 40 companies that were involved \nin the production of vaccines. Regrettably, that number is down to \nthree or four. The reason we have seen this dramatic reduction in \ncompanies that are willing to invest in research and then develop \nvaccines is pretty simple. The return on investing in a vaccine is \nsignificantly less than the cost of investing in that vaccine as looked \nat through the eyes of a pharmaceutical company or those of a \nbiological company, because of the threat of lawsuit.\n  The fact is, the potential liabilities created by doing a vaccine are \nso huge that no amount of projected return on investment, from an \ninvestment standpoint, ever justifies creating a vaccine. So the \nvaccine companies have essentially contracted in this country and the \nassets which were being used to develop vaccines historically are now \nbeing used to develop other types of pharmaceuticals.\n  The second reason there has been a contraction, at least in these \nareas, is there is no use for these vaccines unless an event occurs \nbecause there is no smallpox in this world right now, thank goodness, \nand vaccines against smallpox would not be necessary unless there were \na smallpox outbreak. And there could not be a smallpox outbreak unless \nthere were a terrorist event that uses smallpox as a weapon. It is a \nfact that you cannot have a smallpox outbreak in this world today \nunless there were an intentional decision to spread the smallpox by \nsomebody who had a terrorist intent. So for a company to go in and \ndevelop a vaccine for that means they would be developing a vaccine \nwhich has no market.\n  The BioShield theory was: Put a lot of money in the pipeline to \ncreate an economic incentive for companies and researchers and \nbiological groups to pursue creation of vaccines only in those areas \nwhere there is no vaccine today or there is limited vaccine \navailability today and where the threat is not a common threat that \nwould be spread in a way other than through terrorism.\n  We listed the top six threats, No. 1 being smallpox, No. 2 anthrax, \nfollowed by things such as botulism and plague spread by a terrorist \nevent, and said we would use this $5.6 billion to try to develop these \nvaccines.\n  We thought we had therefore moved the issue along and started to \nresolve the issue. It turns out we did not. It turns out the BioShield \nbill, even though it had $5.6 billion behind it, has not energized the \nmarket or research atmosphere we hoped for. It turns out that only $1 \nbillion has been spent on purchasing smallpox capability, the known \nmanufacturing process for which had already existed. So we have learned \na fairly significant lesson here which needs to be applied to the avian \nflu issue, and that is why it is important. The lesson is this: Even \nthough you put a lot of money in the pipeline, you are not going to \nresolve the problem--the problem being resolved, of course, by having \nscientists being willing to develop ways to address these types of \ndisease threats--unless you also put in place the mechanisms to create \nthe atmosphere for the production of the vaccine.\n  So last week or 2 weeks ago the HELP Committee passed a creative and \nstrong bill, which was authored primarily by the Senator from North \nCarolina, Mr. Burr, which attempted to address the entire issue in a \npackaged way of how you energize the American creative spirit to \nproduce responses and vaccines which will protect us from not only \nterrorist threats but things such as avian flu.\n  One of the key elements of that is money. But another key element of \nthat is the liability protection. So I came to the floor today to make \nit clear that even though it is correct that we need to put a \nsignificant amount of money in place, and put it in place soon--the \namendment offered by the Senator from Iowa relative to the Defense \nbill, I think is the right approach. This amendment as an emergency \nsupplemental, if it is put in place with the defense money being \nconsidered and in the context of what the administration is going to \nsend up here as a proposal, probably within the next week, also may \nwell be the right course. But all this money that is going to be put on \nthe table is not going to solve the problem unless we are also \nsensitive to the fact that there are other forces out there that are \nlimiting the willingness of the research community and the vaccine \ndevelopment community to pursue solutions. We have to take all those \nhurdles out of the way, not just one of them out of the way.\n  It is critical that we do a comprehensive approach to this. I \nunderstand within a week or so the White House is going to send us a \ncomprehensive approach. It is critical that we get that type of \nleadership on this. But we, as a\n\n[[Page S11968]]\n\nSenate, at least, have already proposed a comprehensive approach \nthrough the proposal of Senator Burr, and we should make sure any \nmovement in this area be tied to the proposal of Senator Burr and the \nHELP Committee, which was reported out, and the much more comprehensive \namendment of Senator Enzi.\n  This is a much more complex problem than putting money into it. We \nalready know from our personal experience through the BioShield that \nputting money into it is not going to get the type of response we need. \nIt has to be more than dollars; it has to be policy.\n  Some of the specific things we need to do, beyond reforming the \nliability structure so we have people willing to participate in the \nvaccines, is to purchase a vaccine where it is available. Some \nobviously are available now, but the vaccine for avian flu is limited. \nTamiflu has some serious limitations in its applicability, although \nthere are other things in development which may work a lot better.\n  We also have to have research capacity to handle an event like this \nin basic things such as surgical masks and hypodermic needles and bed \ncapacity.\n  All this has to be put together in a comprehensive structure, and \nthere has to be a clearer form of how we would execute were we to be \nhit with a pandemic, with the responsibility being allocated and people \nknowing who they would be reporting to and how we would get action \ntaken.\n  There are a lot of things in play here to effectively address the \navian flu issue, much of which is being addressed as a Congress, but \nmuch of which has to be addressed also by the administration and which \nwe expect to see in the next few weeks from the administration--and \ndollars are only part of it.\n  I wanted to put that caveat on the table. If we were to simply vote \nfor the proposal from Senator Harkin and say we have done our job, we \nneed to pass the Burr language. And we need to make sure the \nadministration is aggressively pursuing a comprehensive and orderly \napproach to how they will deal with it, should an outbreak occur. I \nknow they are. Every State is. My own State has already set up a very \nsophisticated approach of how they are going to deal with the necessity \nof potentially isolating people, and with the potential of having to \nration the vaccine. These are going to be very difficult questions of \nhow you deal with bed capacity and things such as that. There is a lot \nmore to do. I wanted to discuss this in the context of the BioShield \nbill and what we need to do. This is more than a dollars issue.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is a quote:\n\n       A flu pandemic is the most dangerous threat the United \n     States of America faces. It's a bigger threat than terrorism. \n     In fact, it's bigger than anything I dealt with when I was in \n     government.\n\n  This is not a quote from me or from the Presiding Officer. These are \nthe words of Richard Falkenrath, who until very recently served as \nPresident Bush's Deputy Homeland Security Adviser. He is not alone in \nthis assessment. Administration officials and public health experts \nhave warned the next flu pandemic is not a question of if but a matter \nof when. If we don't take action now, the consequences of a global flu \npandemic could be devastating. And perhaps that is even an \nunderstatement.\n  A respected U.S. health expert has concluded that 1.7 million \nAmericans could die in the first year alone of an outbreak. Remember, \nin 1918, the last flu pandemic, as many as 60 million people died in \nthe world. The world's population was one-third of what it is now.\n  In addition to the 1.7 million Americans who could die during the \nfirst year, according to health experts, the economic costs would be \nenormous.\n  Every week, the possibility of this threat grows closer. It is now in \nCroatia. Anyone who watches the news knows that the bird flu is \nsweeping much of the globe.\n  When we started debating a possible flu pandemic here in the Senate, \nthe bird flu was contained in parts of Asia. Now it has moved into \nTurkey, and even as far west as Great Britain. Anyone who watches the \nnews knows scientists recently determined that the last flu pandemic \noutbreak in 1918 started in birds, and it made its way into humans.\n  It has not been shown without any fault, any degree of being wrong, \nbecause it could be wrong--because the birds are dying from avian flu \ndoesn't mean it will get to us, but it did in 1918. Will the virus jump \nto humans? That is the question. Shouldn't we be prepared if in fact \nthat is the case?\n  I read one news account of a friend in Congress who said we don't \nwant to spend a lot of money for something that might not happen. We \nhave to be prepared. We have to be prepared. We should do everything we \ncan to make sure Americans are prepared and protected--and we are not \nprepared.\n  Despite repeated promises, this administration has yet to release the \nPresident's Pandemic Influenza Response and Preparedness Plan. We have \nwritten letters; no response. I don't know why.\n  The World Health Organization deems such a plan essential to proper \nreadiness. A draft of this plan was ready months ago, but no final plan \nhas been released. At least we were told it wasn't.\n  As a result, preparations for a pandemic have been needlessly delayed \nand the Federal Government is ill prepared to handle such a pandemic. \nWe don't have the capacity to rapidly manufacture vaccines in mass \nquantities. We lack an adequate stockpile in antiviral medications, and \nour health care infrastructure is woefully unprepared.\n  We are already behind nations such as Canada, Britain, and Australia, \nand we are falling further behind these nations each day we fail to \nact. Some nations finalized their avian flu plans months ago. They are \nimplementing the protections, and we are still waiting for this \nadministration to give us something as basic as a plan. America can do \nbetter. In fact, America must do better.\n\n  Senate Democrats have provided leadership on this issue. We have \nadded much needed resources for pandemic preparedness in the Senate \nappropriations bill we passed nearly a month ago. We have offered \nlegislation, the Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act. That would \nbuild on our commitment to preparing our Nation for the possibility of \na pandemic. Unfortunately, the funding remains tied up in a conference \nwith the House and the Senate, and we haven't acted on this \ncomprehensive legislation.\n  The recent spread of bird flu to Europe proves we can't afford to \ndrag our feet. The Senate must act immediately so we can limit the \nhuman and economic costs of a potential avian flu pandemic. That is why \nI am cosponsoring Senator Harkin's amendment to provide $7.9 billion \nfor a comprehensive national effort to prepare for an avian flu \npandemic. The amendment will allow us to take the following steps to \nprepare our Nation for a potential pandemic:\n  No. 1, quadruple our funding for global surveillance relating to \navian flu so we may rapidly detect the emergence of a new strain of \nflu; dedicate more than $3 billion to vaccine research and improving \nour domestic infrastructure.\n  We are woefully unprepared to do this.\n  We must increase our hospital surge capacity and funding for State \nand local health agencies so the American people can be assured there \nwill be an adequate supply of health care providers and institutions to \ncare for them in the event of a pandemic.\n  The legislation calls for conducting an outreach program to health \ncare providers and to the American public.\n  With this legislation, we must stockpile effective antivirals \nadequate to treat at least 50 percent of the population and other \nmedical supplies.\n  Finally, it calls for improving research and lab capacity related to \nan avian flu pandemic. This, to me, is the most important.\n  I congratulate the ranking member of this subcommittee, Senator \nHarkin of Iowa, for this legislation. It is badly needed. I hope there \nwill be a bipartisan vote to support this amendment.\n\n[[Page S11969]]\n\n  I understand there are efforts being made to weaken this so-called \nsecond-degree amendment to give the President the authority to do all \nof this, and he would be obligated to do it only if he saw it was \nnecessary. We are looking at that second-degree amendment now to see if \nthere is any way we can work with the majority, who are offering this \namendment.\n  The avian flu pandemic may be inevitable, but the devastating \nconsequences are not. We need to heed warnings and take action now. I \nhope my colleagues will join in supporting us by making the investments \nnecessary to make sure this Nation does everything possible to protect \nAmericans from the threat of the global flu pandemic.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Harriet Miers\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I respect Ms. Harriet Miers' decision to \nwithdraw from consideration for the Supreme Court. At the same time, I \ndo regret our constitutional process was not complete. Instead of a \nhearing before the Judiciary Committee and a debate on the Senate \nfloor, Ms. Miers' qualifications were subject to a one-sided debate in \nnews releases, press conferences, radio and TV talk shows, and the \neditorial pages.\n  I acknowledge the rights of everyone to express themselves as they \nsee fit, but that should not have precluded Ms. Miers from getting \nbasic due process. There was a decisive imbalance in the public forum, \nwith the case for Ms. Miers not heard because of the heavy decibel \nlevel against her.\n  I have repeatedly noted her excellent work in handling complex civil \ncases. Had the constitutional process been followed with a hearing, she \nwould have had an opportunity to establish that her intellect and \ncapabilities demonstrated in her 35-year professional career could be \ncarried over in the field of constitutional law and the work of the \nCourt. Whether she would have been confirmed remains an open question, \nbut at least she would have had the major voice in determining her own \nfate.\n  Ms. Miers did deliver late yesterday evening, on time, her responses \nto the committee request for supplemental information on her \nquestionnaire. Eight large boxes are in the committee's possession, but \nnow there is no reason to read or analyze those responses.\n  The Judiciary Committee carefully did not intrude on the President's \nexecutive privilege. The committee studiously avoided asking what \nadvice Ms. Miers gave to the President, and that limitation would have \nbeen continued in any hearing, with an adequate range of questions \navailable to enable the committee to decide on her qualifications for \nthe Court.\n  We must guard against having the Miers proceedings become a precedent \nfor the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of an op-ed piece which I had \nsubmitted to the Washington Post yesterday and the Washington Post \nagreed to publish be printed in the Record at the conclusion of these \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  I note Senator Byrd is here.\n\n                               Exhibit 1 \n\n         Washington Post-Accepted Op-Ed Referenced on the Floor\n\n       Just over three weeks ago, President Bush nominated White \n     House Counsel Harriet Miers to fill retiring Justice Sandra \n     Day O'Connor's seat on the Supreme Court. Since then, \n     political pundits and outside groups have loudly expressed \n     their opinions, one way or the other, on the nomination. \n     There has been a great eagerness in some quarters, outside \n     the Senate, to prejudge the nomination.\n       Fortunately, the Constitution does not leave the \n     disposition of Presidential nominations to pundits or outside \n     groups. The question whether to confirm a President's nominee \n     is left to the careful consideration of the Senate, where we \n     have an established process for examining a nominee's fitness \n     for the bench. That process will begin on November 7, when \n     the Judiciary Committee begins its hearings on Ms. Miers.\n       Confirmation hearings offer a nominee the opportunity to \n     introduce herself to the Senate and the American people. The \n     hearings allow Committee members to ask questions of the \n     nominee, to develop a record, and to present an informed \n     recommendation to the full Senate. In order to receive a \n     favorable vote in the Committee, Ms. Miers will have to \n     demonstrate her qualifications to serve on the bench. A \n     crucial qualification to serve on the Supreme Court is the \n     aptitude to decide difficult legal issues, including \n     important Constitutional questions, and to explain those \n     decisions in opinions.\n       It is true that Ms. Miers has not had deep experience in \n     Constitutional law, but that is far from a disqualification \n     for the bench. Few lawyers, aside from sitting federal judges \n     or a few Constitutional law practitioners, have such \n     experience.\n       Thus, while Ms. Miers needs a crash course in \n     constitutional law to prepare for the hearings, the same \n     could be said for virtually any nominee to come before the \n     Senate Judiciary as a Supreme Court nominee. In the past \n     century, we have had many justices without constitutional law \n     experience, who never the less brought the legal acumen and \n     intellectual abilities to tackle the vital and challenging \n     work of the Supreme Court. These include, for example, Sandra \n     Day O'Connor, who had never served on a federal court or \n     practiced Constitutional law. Similarly, Justice Hugo Black, \n     before his election to the Senate, specialized in labor and \n     personal injury law. Yet, he is regarded as one of the \n     greatest justices of the 20th century.\n       Moreover, the Supreme Court's docket is not limited \n     exclusively to Constitutional law issues. Roughly 40% of the \n     Court's docket tends to involve constitutional issues. \n     Business and commercial law issues, with which Ms. Miers is \n     well acquainted, make up another 20% of the Court's docket.\n       As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have known and \n     worked with Ms. Miers closely. As White House Counsel, she \n     plays an important role in advising the President on \n     complicated legal and policy issues.\n       Consequently, I work with Ms. Miers on nearly all the \n     matters that come through our committee, from nominations to \n     legislation, from the USA PATRIOT Act to asbestos liability \n     reform.\n       Based on my personal experience, there is much to recommend \n     her.\n       She is, as all acknowledge, a good and decent woman with \n     whom it is a pleasure to work. She has a logical, \n     disciplined, and sharp mind. She will bring to the bench, if \n     confirmed, the knowledge of a practicing trial attorney--a \n     perspective sorely lacking among the current Justices. As the \n     President has observed, Ms. Miers had a wealth of practical \n     experience as a lawyer in private practice. I have reviewed \n     her record and found that she has handled a wide range of \n     complex cases.\n       She is also a woman who fought up through the ranks. She \n     went to law school at a time when women were discouraged from \n     joining the field, yet she rose to manage a 450-person firm \n     and became head of the Texas Bar Association. Ms. Miers comes \n     to the Committee with many strengths and an accomplished \n     record.\n       This is not to say that it is all easy sailing for Ms. \n     Miers. I have not made up my mind. Nor have most of my \n     colleagues. Like every Supreme Court nominee in recent times, \n     Ms. Miers still has the burden of demonstrating the depth of \n     her substantive knowledge on constitutional issues, issues \n     such as the intersection of the First Amendment's guarantees \n     of free speech and freedom of religion, the scope of \n     Congress's powers to legislate under the Commerce Clause and \n     Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, the scope of executive \n     power, and the criminal defendant's protections found in the \n     Bill of Rights.\n       Like every Supreme Court nominee in recent times, Ms. Miers \n     bears burden of proving she has the aptitude to address the \n     complex issues that will come before the Court. She deserves, \n     and she will receive, a full and fair hearing at which she \n     will have the opportunity to demonstrate her fitness for the \n     bench.\n       Until then, I hope that the American people and my \n     colleagues will keep an open mind. \n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                          Sense of Foreboding\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the American people enter this fall season \nwith apprehension, trepidation, and a somber sense of foreboding. \nGasoline prices, which peaked above $3 per gallon in September, now \nseem stuck at levels once thought absurd. Gas prices in West Virginia \nhover around $2.57 per gallon and can vary significantly in some areas, \nrising precipitously at times.\n  Heating costs are projected to soar this winter, with many households \nexpected to pay an additional $350 to heat their homes with natural gas \nand heating oil. It makes one shiver, thinking of winter in those \nmountains of Appalachia.\n  People are already struggling with inadequate wages, are being forced \nto curtail everyday expenses simply to buy gasoline, to fill up their \ntanks. Senior citizens on fixed incomes are already forced to choose \nbetween prescription drugs and food. That is a tough choice. They must \nnow confront life-threatening heating costs. This winter is coming. I \ncan feel it in the air.\n\n[[Page S11970]]\n\n  This winter, with energy costs rising, the Federal safety net will be \nneeded to provide essential support for countless Americans. Many are \nwatching with incredulity the fraying of that safety net.\n  On the farms and in the cities, in rural and urban neighborhoods, \nAmericans have been shaken by the Government's inability to respond \neffectively to Hurricane Katrina while the Government focused on tax \ncuts for the wealthy and massive spending requests to rebuild Iraq--\nwhat a shame; we should never have gone there, no; it was no threat to \nour national security, and I said so at the time--massive spending \nrequests to rebuild Iraq. Our Nation's infrastructure was weakening \nfrom neglect at home while all this was happening. Katrina highlighted \nthat erosion, focused our attention on that erosion and the high cost \nof forgoing critical infrastructure repairs.\n  Just a few days ago, that erosion was further highlighted as \nAmericans watched the wooden 173-year-old Whittenton Dam threaten to \ngive way in Taunton, MA, forcing the evacuation of yet another American \ncity.\n  This winter, the country must confront the threat of an avian flu \npandemic as public health officials warn that our Nation's health \ninfrastructure remains woefully inadequate. Remember the influenza? \nRemember the flu of 1917 and 1918? I don't remember it exactly, but I \nhad it. My mother died in that pandemic. I was less than a year old. \nShe said to my father: Give ``the baby'' to the Byrds. One of my \nfather's sisters had married a Byrd, Titus Dalton Byrd. They did not \nhave any children. They had a child prior to my birth, but their child \nhad died--his name was Robert Madison--so they had no children left. My \nmother's wish that my father give me, the ``baby,'' to Mr. and Mrs. \nTitus Dalton Byrd, the ``Mrs.'' being my father's sister. Yes, that is \nwhy I am here today. It was their wish that my father give me, the \nbaby--there were three older brothers and a sister--give them all to \nsomebody, but give the baby to the Byrds. They took me in, changed my \nname, and brought me to West Virginia, away from North Carolina. And \nhere I am.\n\n  Earlier this week, Hurricane Wilma pummeled southern Florida, causing \nheavy flooding and power outages. The cleanup costs could be enormous.\n  Rather than addressing these weaknesses and providing the American \npeople with some reassurance, the Congress incredibly and inconceivably \nis looking for ways to further siphon funds away from our safety net \nand domestic investments. It is as if we have learned nothing--\nabsolutely nothing--from Hurricane Katrina.\n  A hope and belief seem to exist, and fingers are crossed all across \nthis town, that no one will connect how the budget cuts being \nconsidered will affect those hurting from high energy prices.\n  Eight Senate committees--eight Senate committees--have drafted \nreconciliation legislation to cut domestic investments in order to \nprefund $70 billion in additional tax cuts, many of which will not take \neffect for several years. They are backloaded. Now, get that: tax cuts. \nOh, it is so easy. Ah, how I love to vote for tax cuts. That is easy. \nIt does not take any courage to do that. Tax cuts. I have been in \npolitics now 60 years next year, in various and sundry legislative \nbranches, and the easiest vote I ever cast was for tax cuts.\n  Some of these spending cuts are coming from the very same programs \nthat are providing essential disaster relief to the victims of \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita, such as those used to provide temporary \nhealth services. They comprise much of the safety net for our Nation's \nmost vulnerable, as well as for Americans afflicted by disaster.\n  The reconciliation process has been touted as a means to contain the \nbudgetary costs of Katrina, but that is a specious, spurious argument. \nThe reconciliation process would worsen--worsen now; not improve--our \nfiscal position. With $70 billion in new tax cuts and an estimated $39 \nbillion in spending cuts, the result is a deficit that increases by $31 \nbillion--$31 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born; $31 for \nevery minute--oh, the clock is ticking; that clock is ticking--$31 for \nevery minute since Our Lord Jesus Christ was born. Under the process \nbeing considered, Katrina costs would continue to mount, without \noffsets, while the safety net is further worn away.\n  The argument for reconciliation makes even less sense when you \nconsider that Katrina costs are one-time, unforeseen emergency \nexpenditures. Meanwhile, no action, none, no action has been taken to \npay for trillions of dollars--trillions. How long would it take to \ncount a trillion dollars at the rate of $1 per second? How long would \nit take to count a trillion dollars at the rate of $1 per second? Man, \ncan you imagine that? How long would it take? Thirty-two thousand \nyears? These young pages who have quick minds can figure that out. \nThirty-two thousand, I am not sure about that figure. If it is not \n32,000, it is 34,000 or 36,000. Thirty-two thousand years--I will stick \nwith that figure for now--at a minimum, at the rate of a dollar per \nsecond. Can you believe it?\n  There are trillions of dollars of tax cuts. No action has been taken \nto pay for those trillions of dollars of tax cuts or the hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of costs for Iraq--a war that we should have never \nbeen in. We should never have gone. And they are still struggling to \nfind a reason why we went. Too late now. I said then I don't believe \nthere are weapons of mass destruction. I think there have been in some \nyears gone by but not now. And have they been found? No. And I and 22 \nothers--yes, 22 others; one Republican among the 23; one Senator who is \nnow dead and gone; he died in a plane crash--23 souls, including my \nown, said: No. No, we won't go. We are not going to vote to give this \npower to declare war to this President or any President. We are not \ngoing to do it. Twenty-three of us. But there we are. We are there.\n  So with the hundreds of billions of dollars of costs for Iraq, no \naction has been taken to pay for that, even though these costs are as \nplain and obvious as any in the Federal budget. I simply cannot fathom \nwhy the administration believes that reconstructing Baghdad does not \nhave to be paid for, while reconstructing Mississippi and Louisiana and \nAlabama requires offsets.\n  Can you imagine that? Reconstructing Baghdad does not have to be paid \nfor, while reconstructing Mississippi and Louisiana and Alabama \nrequires offsets. It does not make sense. It does not make good sense. \nIt does not make common sense.\n  Nor has any action been taken to find savings elsewhere in the \nbloated--bloated--Federal budget. The Defense Department's budget \ncomprises one-sixth of the Federal budget and surpasses the total \ndiscretionary budgets of every other agency and office of the Federal \nGovernment combined. The Pentagon is not even able to pass a standard \naudit. How about that. The Pentagon is not even able to pass a standard \naudit, and it has not been able to for some years. I will say that \nagain. The Pentagon is not even able to pass a standard audit or to \nconduct effective oversight of military expenditures in Iraq. May God \nhelp us.\n\n  Government auditors have found substantial sums of defense contractor \nwaste and fraud. Astonishingly, the Department of Defense pulled its \ninspector general out of Iraq last fall. Yet the Defense Department has \nnot been asked to examine its $450 billion annual budget.\n  All of the savings, all of the deficit reduction is supposed to come \nfrom the safety net for working families--people who work with their \nhands or at their desks--and from essential domestic investments that \nhave been dangerously--dangerously, dangerously--foolishly neglected \nfor too long. The sacrifice, too often, is being asked of working \nfamilies, while others remain blissfully exempt.\n  The budget reconciliation process at this point in the year and under \nthese circumstances is ill-conceived. We are missing an opportunity to \nferret out real waste in the Federal budget and to reform programs that \ncould yield real budgetary savings. And worse, we are opening the door \nto a dangerous process.\n  Yesterday, the House Ways and Means Committee--I believe it was \nyesterday--included in its reconciliation package language that would \nrepeal the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act. This is a \ncritically important law. It allows Customs to distribute to American \ncompanies and\n\n[[Page S11971]]\n\ntheir workers the duties that it collects on unfairly traded, meaning \n``dumped,'' imports. Yes. I am the daddy of that. Yes. I am the daddy \nof that child. It is called the Byrd Rule. There are several things \nthat are called the Byrd Rule, but that is the one we are talking \nabout.\n  It allows Customs to distribute to American companies and their \nworkers the duties that it collects on unfairly traded, meaning \n``dumped,'' imports. The funds go only to those--now listen; the \nfunds--I say the fines for these violations go only to those who have \nbeen injured by foreign producers who violate our trade laws.\n  The funds go to crawfish producers in Louisiana. Hear me now. They go \nto shrimp producers throughout the Gulf States. Hear me. They go to our \nlumber industry. That is a big industry. They go to raspberry growers. \nThey go to honey producers and beekeepers. They go to garlic growers in \nCalifornia, to makers of pasta, to makers of steel, to makers of steel \nbearings and other products manufactured all across our Nation.\n  Companies in nearly every State of the Union receive funds under this \nlaw, and the funds are essential. They enable our industries to invest \nin their facilities and in their workers, to upgrade their equipment \nand technology. What could be wrong with that? That is a good law. The \nWorld Trade Organization doesn't like this law, but the WTO is wrong. \nThe WTO doesn't like this law, but the WTO is wrong, wrong, wrong, I \nsay to the four corners, the four winds of the Earth--wrong. The WTO \nruling in this case was created out of whole cloth. Nothing in the WTO \nagreements prohibits us from reimbursing U.S. industry with duties \ncollected--how and from what--on unfairly traded imports. If the \ntrading partners didn't violate the law, they wouldn't have to pay \nthese fines. They violate the law, yes.\n\n  The administration was directed by Congress in both the fiscal year \n2004 and 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Acts to negotiate a solution to \nthis WTO dispute in ongoing trade talks. The Appropriations Acts \nexplicitly--plainly, clearly--state that U.S. negotiations shall be \nconducted within the World Trade Organization to recognize the right of \nWTO members to distribute moneys collected from antidumping and \ncountervailing duties as they deem appropriate. The WTO cannot infringe \non the sovereign right of the Congress to legislate. They can't do \nthat. The United States needs to keep this important trade law on the \nbooks. Keep it on the books.\n  I have talked to the President. I have talked with the administration \nabout that. I have talked with our Trade Representative. Keep it on the \nbooks. They first said they would fight for it. After Katrina, we send \na terrible message by continuing with this flawed reconciliation \nprocess. You watch how it works. I helped to write that law. The \nreconciliation process was never intended by those of us on both sides \nof the aisle--we are about all gone now, who created that process--to \nbe used as it is being used. We send a terrible message when the \nAmerican people call for deficit reduction and instead we lead them \nerroneously into more debt.\n  I hope the Congress will take the time to reconsider the flawed \nassumptions underlying this reconciliation process. It needs to do so \nbefore the process gets even further out of hand.\n  I thank all Senators. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Harriet Miers\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as the administration searches for a new \nnominee for the Supreme Court, I hope the White House will not retreat \nto a political corner and choose a nominee who will only serve to \ndivide the Nation and divide this Senate. I urge the President--hear me \nnow--to select a nominee cut from the same cloth as the new Chief \nJustice of the United States--moderate in approach, steeped in thought \nand experience, and committed to the protection of the U.S. \nConstitution, which I hold in my hand. In partnership, the President \nand the Senate must do all that they can to avoid rancor and extreme \npartisanship. That begins with real consultation and a nominee who can \nbridge the gap between political philosophies.\n  I found it noteworthy--I did--that questions about Harriet Miers' \nnomination came from Senators, organizations, and individuals from \ndiverse political philosophies. It does not matter who is asking the \nquestions about a nomination; these questions serve the long-term \ninterest of the Nation, those people out there, the American people who \nare watching us through those lenses.\n  Unfortunately, in this age of partisan politics dominating all else, \nquestions too often are labeled as obstructionism. You remember that? \nObstructionism. If you ask questions, you are an obstructionist. Get \nthat, I say to these fine young pages. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. No.\n  Republican Senators--yes, the Senators who sit over on that side of \nthe aisle--and Democratic Senators, who sit over here, had serious \nquestions concerning the judicial philosophy of this nominee. Asking \nquestions and insisting upon answers from judicial nominees helps to \nmake certain that the American people have faith in their courts. \nAsking questions is not something to be labeled as obstructionist. How \nmany times have I said that? Rather, it is patriotic to ask questions. \nAsking questions is part of my duty, part of your duty, Mr. President, \npart of each Senator's duty as citizens.\n  I think now would be a good time for the Senate to consider a \nproposal first put forward by Senator Specter in which I joined in the \n105th Congress. We introduced legislation to establish a formal \nadvisory mechanism for the Senate in the selection of Supreme Court \nJustices. Under that proposal, the Senate Judiciary Committee would \nestablish a pool of possible Supreme Court nominees for the President \nto consider based on suggestions from Federal and State judges, \ndistinguished lawyers, law professors, and others with a similar level \nof insight into the suitability of individuals for appointment to the \nSupreme Court. The President would, of course, be free to ignore the \npool if he chose to do so, but the advice required by the Constitution \nwould be formally available and the President would know that the \nindividuals in the pool had received a bipartisan nod from the Senate \ncommittee required to do the vetting.\n  Senator Specter and I have talked about reintroducing this \nlegislation in the coming days in an effort to guarantee that a broad \nspectrum of individuals are nominated for the Supreme Court and that \nthe Senate is able, more fully, to fulfill its constitutional role. I \nam glad there are 14 Senators, ladies and gentlemen, Republican and \nDemocrat, evenly divided, who joined together and who saved the Senate \nfrom a terrible blunder called the nuclear option. Some call it the \nconstitutional option. There is nothing constitutional about it. It is \nunconstitutional on its face, the so-called nuclear option. What a \nshame that would have been. But the 14 Senators, Republican and \nDemocrat, saved the Senate. That was a historic moment.\n  I say the President was right when he called Senators, when he sought \nthe advice of Senators, when he sent Judge Roberts' name up here. Yes, \nfor once he called me and asked what I thought. I complimented him on \ncalling Senators, seeking their advice. The phrase is advice and \nconsent, not just the word ``consent.'' It also has the word \n``advice.'' So I said, and the 14 said, we want to be in on the takeoff \nas well as on the landing. So seek our advice. Yes.\n  Mr. President, seek our advice. Say to us, Lend me your ears, and I \nwill lend you mine. He did that. The President did that. I complimented \nhim on it. I hope he will do that now. I hope he will not send up a \nlightning rod, somebody who will just polarize the country and attract \nbows and arrows.\n  Mr. President, listen to the advice and consent clause in this \nhallowed document, the Constitution of the United States. Read it. It \nsays ``advice.'' Hear me, Mr. President. Call Senators again. Don't \nsend up someone who will divide the Senate, who will cause a \nfilibuster, and then some would seek to cut off the freedom of Senators \nto speak. Be careful. Mr. President,\n\n[[Page S11972]]\n\nplease call. Please call me. If you don't call me, call somebody else. \nCall Senators. Ask them what they think. You can discard our viewpoint \nif you wish. You don't have to accept our advice. I don't have anybody \nparticularly in mind, but call me. Will you do it, Mr. President? I \nhope you will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Defense Authorization\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I certainly appreciate the words of the \nSenator from West Virginia. In that light, let me point out that last \nnight the Senate adopted a unanimous consent agreement to resume \nconsideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill. Under \nthe agreement, each side would be allowed to offer 12 amendments to the \nbill, all of which must relate to the bill or the jurisdiction of the \nArmed Services Committee.\n  Let me start by congratulating the Democratic leader for working \ntirelessly to bring this bill back before the Senate. Senator Reid \nrecognizes that Congress has a responsibility to the American people \nand to our brave men and women in uniform to debate and pass a \nresponsible Department of Defense authorization bill. I thank him for \nhis efforts.\n  Congress has an additional responsibility, and that is to put our \nIraq policy right and return the focus of our country to our top \nnational security goals. That policy, and particularly the failure of \nthe administration to offer a reasonable, flexible timetable for \nbringing home our troops, is making us weaker. It is making us less \nsafe, and it is making our enemies stronger. The perception of a \nmassive, indefinite American troop presence in Iraq is feeding the very \ninsurgency that we are trying to defeat. That is why I now call upon \nthe majority and minority leaders to agree that they will allow the \nSenate to debate and vote upon an amendment calling for a flexible \ntimetable for returning our troops home. This doesn't have to be \nexactly the resolution I introduced in June, or it doesn't have to \ninclude the December 31, 2006, target date for completion of the \nprimary military mission that I proposed back in August.\n  There are plenty of Members deeply concerned about Iraq whose \nleadership has been and will continue to be crucial, people such as \nSenators Levin, Kerry, and Dodd. Senators Byrd and Kennedy have also \nbeen vocal about their concerns. There are plenty of Members on the \nother side, also, with whom I have spoken and shared some of my \nconcerns about our Iraq policy. I welcome the opportunity to work with \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come up with a reasonable \namendment that will finally start the process of getting our Iraq \npolicy and our broader national security strategy on track.\n  Obviously, I do not have to remind anyone here that the United States \nsuffered its 2,000th casualty in Iraq this week, and there have been \nmore since then. Every one of our servicemembers in Iraq and their \nfamilies deserve clarity about the mission they are serving and the \ntimeframe for that mission. And the American people and the Iraqi \npeople, too, need to know that we have a plan to complete our military \nmission and draw down our troops in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, the Senate needs to do its job. When the Senate \nfinally resumes consideration of the Defense authorization bill, and I \nhope that will be very soon, we need to finally address and put our \nIraq policy right. The Senate will consider up to 24 amendments at that \ntime. Clearly, this should be one of them. I hope my colleagues agree \nwith me and that we can work together to ensure that we live up to our \nresponsibilities.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No 2279, as Modified\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Collins, to offer an amendment to fund the Automatic \nDefibrillation in Adam's Memory, the ADAM Act. But first I would like \nto thank the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa and \ntheir staffs for the hard work that obviously went into drafting this \nbill in the face of tight budget restraints.\n  Mr. President, in 2001, I learned about Adam Lemel, a 17-year-old \nhigh school student and a star athlete in southeastern Wisconsin. \nTragically, during a timeout while playing basketball at a neighboring \nMilwaukee high school, Adam suffered sudden cardiac arrest and died \nbefore the paramedics were able to arrive.\n  After his death, his friend, David Ellis, joined forces with the \nChildren's Hospital of Wisconsin to initiate Project ADAM to bring CPR \ntraining and public access defibrillation into schools, to educate \ncommunities about preventing sudden cardiac deaths, and to save lives. \nThe ADAM Act called for the establishment of a national Project ADAM \nclearinghouse. Such a clearinghouse would provide schools with the \n``how to'' and technical advice to set up public access defibrillation \nprograms. This clearinghouse responds to a growing number of schools \nthat have the desire to set up such a defibrillation program but often \ndo not know where to start.\n  The ADAM Act was signed into law in 2003--and we are very pleased \nwith that--but it has yet to be funded. The amendment Senator Collins \nand I offered would simply fund the ADAM Act clearinghouse with \n$800,000 for fiscal year 2006.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I would like to call up my amendment and \nask that it be modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2279), as modified, is as follows:\n\n         At the appropriate place in title II, insert the \n     following:\n         Sec. __. In addition to amounts appropriated under this \n     Act, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise \n     appropriated an additional $800,000 to carry out section 312 \n     of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 244). The amounts \n     on page 137, line 9 shall be further reduced by $800,000.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I understand that the amendment will be accepted, and I \nwant to thank the managers in advance for that as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2283\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise first to commend Senators Specter \nand Harkin for their diligence and hard work on what is an enormous \nbill, particularly given the tight budget they had to work with. I also \npersonally thank Senators Specter and Harkin for adopting an amendment \ninto the managers' bill relating to scholarships for low-income and \nminority students and for expansion of positive behavioral \ninterventions and support within schools to encourage better \ndiscipline. I thank them and their staffs for working with us on this \namendment.\n  In addition, it is my understanding that there has been a meeting of \nthe minds between the two sides of the aisle around what may end up \nbeing the most significant aspect of the Labor H appropriations bill.\n  Yesterday, I joined Senators Harkin, Kennedy, and a number of my \ncolleagues in introducing an avian flu amendment. I know we had been \nable to attach an amendment to the DOD appropriations bill that made \nsignificant headway in funding the work that needs to be done to \nprepare this nation for pandemic flu. Obviously, this Labor H bill was \nthe more appropriate vehicle to fund preparedness activities. The fact \nthat Senator Specter and Senator Harkin have agreed to work something \nout on this issue is extremely important.\n\n[[Page S11973]]\n\n  I will mention a couple of things that I believe make this avian flu \namendment so significant. A number of Senators have talked on the \nSenate floor very eloquently about the threat of avian flu and the lack \nof preparedness and relative inactivity in the United States compared \nto our European and Asian allies. In the United States, we do not have \na national preparedness plan for a pandemic. We do not have a stockpile \nof antivirals. Our public health system is weak, and the vaccine \ninfrastructure is fragile. All of these areas desperately need \nattention, and the amendment that I hope will be adopted unanimously \nwill provide the funding to do just that.\n  I am not going to rehash what was discussed earlier, but instead I \nwanted to spend a few minutes on the non-health aspects of avian flu, \nbecause it is important to fully understand the scope of the potential \nproblems that a pandemic might cause. Obviously, the health concerns \nshould be our immediate focus, and the Harkin amendment and the avian \nflu bill I introduced back in April do just that. However, we cannot \nignore the economic and social implications of the pandemic flu. They \ndeserve our urgent attention.\n\n  As Dr. Michael Osterholm has warned us, the arrival of a pandemic flu \nwould trigger a reaction that would change the world overnight. We know \nthat a vaccine would not be available for at least 6 months after the \npandemic started. We also know that we only have enough antivirals in \nour stockpile to treat 1 percent of the Nation's population. As such, \nif an avian flu pandemic hits, foreign trade and travel would be \nreduced or even suspended in a desperate but fruitless attempt to stop \nthe virus from entering new countries. This is not speculation. Some \nwill recall that Hong Kong's Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food has \nalready threatened to close the border with the Chinese mainland if the \nH5N1 strain of avian influenza moves into the human population.\n  Domestically, transportation would also be significantly curtailed as \nStates or communities seek to keep the disease contained, and \nunaffected areas try to keep infection out. Such efforts at self-\nprotection would have a devastating effect on the world economy, which \nrelies on the speedy distribution of products. There would be major \nshortages of food, medicines, light bulbs, gasoline, and spare parts \nfor military equipment. Potentially, we would have shutdowns in the \nproduction of microchips that fuel so much of our technology.\n  To use just one example, currently, two U.S.-based companies supply \nmost of the protective face masks for health care workers around the \nworld. Neither company would be able to meet increased demand during a \npandemic, in part because the companies depend on multiple suppliers in \nmultiple countries for the parts to make the masks.\n  Businesses today rely on the world's real time economy, and have not \nestablished alternative supply chains nor emergency plans for \nproduction and distribution. In a time of pandemic, the labor source \ncould be severely affected as well, compounding the supply chain \nproblem.\n  Our Government officials also have not yet addressed the social \nimplications of a pandemic. We had a taste of that in what tragically \nhappened with Hurricane Katrina. We witnessed desperation and confusion \nas people scrambled to survive and to find their loved ones. We are \ngoing to have to develop protocols and plans now so we can prepare the \npublic for whatever public health measures may be needed, including \npossible quarantine or isolation.\n  The closest the world has come to this scenario in modern times was \nthe SARS epidemic in 2003. Over a period of 5 months, about 8,000 \npeople were infected and about 10 percent of those infected died. Once \nSARS emerged in China, it spread to 5 countries within 24 hours, and to \n30 countries on 6 continents within several months. The economic \nconsequences of SARS were staggering. The 6-month epidemic costs to the \nAsian-Pacific region alone were estimated at over $40 billion.\n  As avian flu is significantly more contagious and more deadly, you \ncan only imagine the potential scope of economic devastation that we \nmight face. Senator Harkin has mentioned that the warning bell is \nringing and we need to heed its urgent call to action. Time is running \nout and this administration must act now if it is to prevent the severe \neconomic, security, and health consequences from pandemic flu.\n  Let me close with one last comment. I heard some colleagues in \ndiscussions, both in the media and on the floor of the Senate, suggest \nthat we should not succumb to panic. I know at one point an analogy was \ndrawn between what we are calling for with respect to investments in \npandemic flu preparedness and Y2K.\n  Let me just make two points. No. 1, we are absolutely certain that \nsome form of pandemic will occur in our lifetime. We do not know if it \nwill be caused by a H5N1 virus that mutates and spreads by human-to-\nhuman contact, similar to the 1918 pandemic. But unless history has \ncompletely taught us the wrong lessons, we can expect some form of \npandemic that has severe consequences, and right now, we do not have \nthe infrastructure to deal with it.\n  What that means is whatever investment we make now--for example, in \ndeveloping a cell-based technology rather than an egg-based technology \nto develop vaccines--that is a sound investment even if we are lucky \nand this H5N1 virus does not end up mutating in such a way that it can \ncause a pandemic, because we will now be prepared for whatever pandemic \noccurs. We will have the infrastructure to rapidly produce the sort of \nvaccines that are necessary. This is a smart investment for us to make \non the front end. The second point is one that, again, I think has been \nhighlighted by what happened in New Orleans and the gulf coast. \nSometimes the costs of doing nothing are so high that in the same way \nthat you or I buy catastrophic health insurance hoping that we never \nhave to use it, this is one of those situations where we have to devote \nthe dollars to prepare and develop a plan, hoping that we never have to \nuse it.\n  I am extraordinarily grateful that Senator Harkin, Senator Specter, \nand other leaders on this committee have been able to come to an \nagreement that should allow us to finally fund the preparedness and \nreadiness activities that are going to be necessary for us to meet the \nchallenge of avian flu.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2218, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification of \namendment 2218, and ask unanimous consent that it be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2218), as modified, is as follows:\n\n\n                    AMENDMENT NO. 2218, As Modified\n\n     (Purpose: To increase funding for advanced placement programs)\n\n       At the end of title III (before the short title), insert \n     the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act, there is appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, an additional \n     $7,000,000 to carry out part G of title I of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6531 et seq.).\n       (b) On page 183, line 15, strike ``$1,057,385,000'' and \n     insert ``$1,050,385,000'' and on line 21 strike \n     ``$417,924,000'' and insert ``$410,924,000''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that the Senator \nfrom Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, and myself are offering to add an \nadditional $7 million to the funding for advanced placement instruction \nin our schools. This is an issue she and I have pursued for many years.\n  It is my strong belief one of the clearest ways we can improve the \nquality of education in our school system is to encourage more students \nto take advanced placement courses, to encourage more teachers to get \nthe training necessary to teach those advanced placement courses. Those \nare courses the college board has identified as specified standards \nnationwide.\n  It is clear to anybody who is involved in secondary education in this \ncountry that a student is advantaged in their later education and in \ntheir career if\n\n[[Page S11974]]\n\nthey have the opportunity and take advantage of the opportunity to take \nthese advanced placement courses in high school. There are many high \nschools in my State of New Mexico that do not offer advanced placement \ncourses to their students. I think that is a shame in this day and \ntime. I think it is very unfortunate we do not make this opportunity \navailable nationwide to more students and encourage it.\n  A recent report which the Presiding Officer and I have requested from \nthe National Academy of Sciences talks very extensively about the \nimportance of developing the scientific and technical building blocks \nwe need for this country to strengthen our economy. They recommend in \nthat National Academy of Sciences report that we can do a variety of \nthings to improve the quality of education from kindergarten through \nthe 12th grade, in addition to doing various things at the university \nlevel and, of course, doing a variety of things with research and \ndevelopment as well.\n  One of their recommendations is directly applicable to this amendment \nwhich we sent to the desk. The recommendation is that we set out to \nquadruple the number of students in advanced placement math and science \ncourses by the year 2010. There are approximately 1.2 million students \nwho take those courses today. The suggestion is that in the next 4 or 5 \nyears we should increase that to 4.5 million students. That is an \nenormous undertaking. That is an easy thing to say but a very hard \nthing to do.\n  The recommendation in the appendix attached to the National Academy \nof Sciences report indicates that the estimate they have would cost \nsomething in the range of an additional $350 million per year for us to \nbe able to achieve this kind of improvement. We are not asking for that \n$350 million in this amendment. We are asking for $7 million. We are \nasking to get closer to what the President requested in the budget he \nsent to the Congress earlier this year. We are asking to go up to $40 \nmillion for advanced placement instruction.\n  That is a very modest request, but we are informed it is all that is \npossible, given the budgetary constraints under which this bill is \noperating.\n  I think it is an extremely good amendment. It is a very important \nfocus for us to have as we try to begin to focus on an agenda that will \nmake this country more competitive in world markets. I know the \nPresiding Officer feels this needs to be a very high priority for this \ncountry. I certainly do, as well as the Senator from Texas.\n  I hope our colleagues will support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor so Senator Hutchison can explain her views on the \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator \nBingaman. We have been working on increasing the amount put in the \nadvanced placement program for years. Together, we actually started the \nFederal funding for this program. It has been a phenomenal success.\n  In fact, in a recent study on the lack of emphasis in science in our \ncountry in high schools and colleges, one of the recommendations made \nby the commission, which I think the Presiding Officer of the Senate \nsitting in the chair today is familiar with, * * *\n  One of the recommendations is increasing the Advanced Placement \nProgram. That is exactly what we are doing with this amendment.\n  The Advanced Placement Program allows students to pursue college-\nlevel studies while still in high school. It is celebrating its 50th \nanniversary and it is now in 15,000 schools around the world, including \n60 percent of high schools in America. Through these programs, students \nexperience a rigorous college level curriculum and have the chance to \nearn college credit, advanced placement, or both.\n  According to a U.S. Department of Education study, participation in \nadvanced placement courses is a stronger predictor of success in \ncollege than test scores or grade point averages. A 2002 study by the \nUniversity of Texas at Austin showed that among students with the same \nSAT scores and class rank, advanced placement students scoring three or \nhigher on the exams performed better in advanced college courses than \nstudents who participated in concurrent enrollment or who did not skip \nany college courses at all.\n  Research has also shown that 61 percent of students who take two or \nmore advanced placement exams graduate from college on time. By \ncontrast, only 29 percent of other college students earn a degree \nwithin 4 years.\n  When you consider the average total charges at a 4-year public \ninstitution in the 2005 school year were more than $12,000 per year and \n$29,000 per year for private colleges, graduating within 4 years \nbecomes a very important objective.\n  While much growth has occurred in advanced placement participation, a \nvast gap still exists between the 57 percent of the class of 2004 who \nembarked on higher education last fall and the 13 percent of the class \nof 2004 who were prepared to succeed in college by having mastered an \nAP course in high school. Currently, 40 percent of students entering 4-\nyear colleges and universities are requiring some remedial education \nwhile 63 percent of students at 2-year institutions do. This is a \nsignificant concern. One or more remedial courses, particularly in math \nor reading, negatively influence the likelihood that a student will \nobtain that bachelor's degree.\n  Last year, a fellow Texan and current Assistant Secretary of \nEducation, Tom Luce, wrote a book entitled ``Do What Works: How Proven \nPractices Can Improve America's Public Schools.'' Among other programs, \nthe book highlighted the importance of advanced placement courses in \neducating today's students. In his book, Secretary Luce states:\n\n       Advanced Placement courses are increasingly viewed as a key \n     to driving higher educational achievement by all students, \n     particularly economically disadvantaged and minority \n     students.\n\n  Secretary Luce dedicated his book to Edith and Peter O'Donnell, two \ngreat Americans who know and understand the importance of educating our \nyoungsters. Peter O'Donnell recently sat on the Commission of National \nAcademies which published a report entitled ``Rising Above The \nGathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter \nEconomic Future.''\n  The report outlined a number of recommendations to strengthen \nAmerica's competitiveness with the ultimate goal of creating new, high-\nquality jobs. One of the recommendations was to train additional \nadvanced placement instructors to teach advanced courses in mathematics \nand science. Some ways we can do this are by subsidizing test fees for \nlow-income students who are enrolled in AP classes and plan to take an \nAP test, and by expanding teacher training and participation in online \ncourses.\n  President Bush requested $51 million in his budget for this program. \nThat would be an increase of $22 million from last year.\n  This amendment I am cosponsoring with Senator Bingaman would \naccomplish the President's funding goal by adding an additional $7 \nmillion. It is very important we do this. It does have offsets.\n  I particularly thank Senator Specter and Senator Harkin and their \nstaffs for helping find the offsets, realizing the importance of this \nprogram.\n  My friend Peter O'Donnell was certainly on the mark when he suggested \nadvanced placement would start our students in a higher echelon of \nacademic programs to better prepare them for college. These programs \nwill also help them get through college within a 4-year period, which \nis becoming more and more of an issue in public and private \nuniversities around our country.\n  I thank Senator Bingaman for being a partner with me on this. Since \n1998 we have worked on this together. If we can continue to increase \nthe program and, therefore, increase the number of participants, we \nwill see the college students who perform better having more \nopportunities for science and math careers, which is very important for \nthe future of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague very much for her \nstrong advocacy for this amendment and this program. I also say a word \nof commendation about Peter O'Donnell and the work he has done in this \narea.\n\n[[Page S11975]]\n\nHe was very generous in giving of his time to brief me and my staff on \nprogress that has been made in the State of Texas in expanding advanced \nplacement through the private foundation he has established there. It \nis a very impressive model the whole country needs to emulate. This \nmodest amendment will be a step toward helping more to happen around \nthe country.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Reid of Nevada, Senator Boxer, and \nSenator Feinstein be added as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. As I understand it, we are ready for a vote on this \namendment at this time unless the managers would like to postpone it.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. A voice vote would be fine with us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no debate, the question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2218) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n            Unanimous-Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent at 3 o'clock today the Senate \nproceed to executive session and to consecutive votes on the following \nnominations: No. 386, John Smoak, to be United States District Judge \nfor the Northern District of Florida; and No. 384, Susan Neilson, to be \nUnited States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit.\n  I further ask unanimous consent there be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to each vote; further, that following those votes the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate \nthen return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2244 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask consent to withdraw amendment \nnumbered 2244.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2262\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, last evening I called up for \nconsideration amendment 2262 and then had it laid aside. I call it up \nagain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that is very \nimportant. I hope we can get a vote before the afternoon is over. The \namendment would invest an additional $60 million in our Nation's future \nby strengthening 8 programs: the Migrant Education Program, the English \nLanguage Acquisition Program, the High School Equivalency Program, the \nCollege Assistance Migrant Program, the Dropout Prevention Program, the \nEnglish as a Second Language Program, the local family information \ncenters, and also the Hispanic-serving institutions.\n  The funding additions this amendment calls for add up to the total \n$60 million. This is an amendment that is strongly supported by the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus, by the National PTA, and by the Hispanic \nEducation Coalition, which is an ad hoc coalition of national \norganizations dedicated to improving educational opportunities for the \nmore than 40 million Hispanics who live in this country today.\n  The Migrant Education Program is the first item. The title I Migrant \nEducation Program was established to provide a compensatory education \nprogram designed to deal with the difficulties encountered by children \nof migrant families. Some of the children attend three or four schools \nin a single school year.\n  They have a great need for coordination of educational services among \nthe States and local districts where they live, often for short periods \nof time. The MEP builds the support structures for migrant students so \nthat they can achieve high levels of success both in and outside of \nschool.\n  The U.S. Department of Education reports that more than 750,000 \nstudents were identified as eligible for the program in Fiscal Year \n2001. Additional funds are necessary to ensure that these children are \nable to meet the challenges mandated by the No Child Left Behind Act. \nThis amendment will provide an additional $9.6 million in needed \nfunding.\n  This amendment would also increase funding to States and local school \ndistricts in order to ensure that as many of the 5.5 million children \nwith limited English skills as possible learn English, develop high \nlevels of academic attainment, and meet the same challenging State \nacademic standards as all children.\n  Title III is a formula grant program that distributes funding to all \n50 States based on the number of limited English proficient LEP and \nrecent immigrant students. The funds are used for developing effective \nlanguage acquisition programs; training for bilingual/ESL teachers and \nregular teachers and educational personnel; parent involvement; and \nproviding services for recently arrived immigrant students. This \namendment requests an additional $10.3 million for Language Acquisition \nGrants, which restores the program's funding to its Fiscal Year 2003 \nlevel.\n  This amendment would provide modest increases for the High School \nEquivalency Program HEP and the College Assistance Migrant Program \nCAMP. The HEP helps migrant students who have dropped out of high \nschool earn a GED. The CAMP assists migrant students in their first \nyear of college with both counseling and stipends. These programs \nprovide farmworker migrant students with education opportunities and \nsupport that will help them to become productive members of society.\n  Migrant students are among the most disadvantaged youth in this \nNation. Current estimates place the dropout rate for migrant youth at \nbetween 50 and 60 percent. Before CAMP, there was no record of a child \nof migrant farm workers ever having attended college. Both programs \nhave been very successful in helping migrant students become productive \nmembers of society.\n  According to the Department of Education, in 2003-2004, almost 10,000 \nstudents were served by HEP CAMP, and 63 percent of the HEP \nparticipants received a GED, and 84 percent of CAMP students completed \ntheir first year of college in good standing. This amendment provides \nan additional $5.7 million for these programs.\n  The Dropout Prevention program help States and school districts to \nimplement research-based, sustainable, and coordinated school dropout \nprevention and re-entry programs in order to raise student achievement. \nAt a time when schools are focused on narrowing achievement gaps \nbetween differing subgroups of students, it seems that Congress would \nwant to retain Dropout Prevention, a program specifically aimed at \nproviding schools with the tools to help students achieve a high school \ndegree.\n  Support for dropout prevention is even more significant when \nconsidering that the primary source of Federal funding for public \nschools, authorized through the No Child Left Behind Act NCLB, focuses \nmainly on elementary schools. More than 90 percent of title I funds--\nthe principal NCLB program--are directed to elementary schools. Such an \nemphasis on elementary education is necessary and appropriate, but \nequally important is continuing an investment of resources throughout \nthe education continum in order to meet the needs of middle level and \nhigh school students.\n  The Dropout Prevention Program is the only Federal program actively \nworking to reduce the Nation's dropout rates, and, as recent headlines \ntell us, it is a problem that is far more severe than previous data \nindicated.\n  A report by the Urban Institute finds that only 68 percent of all \nstudents in the public high school class of 2001 graduated. \nFurthermore, it states that only 5 of all black students and 50 percent \nof all Hispanic students grate. Nearly half of all black and Hispanic \nstudents do not graduate from high school. This is a problem that has \nreached enormous proportions. The Dropout Prevention Program was \neliminated in this legislation. This amendment restores $5 million to \nthis program.\n  The Local Family Information Centers Program was authorized under the \nNo Child Left Behind Act to provide parents of title I students, \nincluding\n\n[[Page S11976]]\n\nEnglish language learners, with information about their children's \nschools so that they can help their children to meet the high standards \nwe have set under NCLB.\n  The Local Family Information Centers also help parents to hold their \nlocal and State school officials accountable and become more involved \nin their children's education. This amendment would increase funding \nfor these centers by $13 million.\n  The need for increased funding for English as a Second Language ESL \nis evident by the growing demand for services and the lack of resources \nto meet that need.\n  Enrollment in Adult ESL has increased 105 percent over the past 10 \nyears, yet there is a lack of programs and funding to ensure that all \nwho desire to learn English have access to appropriate services.\n  Currently, community-based organizations must piece programs together \nwith volunteer labor and facilities. The need for more targeted \nservices is overwhelming. Demand for English-language instruction far \noutweighs supply, waiting lists for classes typically range from \nseveral months to years, and many States do not have the capacity to \nmeet the demand.\n  The current $70 million in funding is insufficient to meet the \nenormous demand for ESL services. As the labor market continues to \nrequire English-proficient labor, investing in ESL programs will \nstrengthen the labor pool and return a more versatile productive \nworkforce. This amendment provides an additional $6.5 million for ESL \nprograms.\n  Currently, 35 percent of Hispanics are under the age of 18. The \nEducational Testing Service has projected the U.S. higher education \nsystem will grow by 3.5 million additional students by 2015 and that \nnearly 40 percent of these new students will be Hispanic. HSIs serve \nthe largest concentrations of the Nation's youngest and largest ethnic \npopulation.\n  The impending emergence of more than 100 new HSIs mostly in CA, TX, \nFL, NM, IL, in the next few years and the rapid growth of the Hispanic \ncollege-age population underscore urgency for immediate, major, and \nsustained increases in title V funding.\n  At a time when the current labor force is reaching retirement age in \nsubstantial numbers, Hispanics already represent one of every three new \nworkers joining the U.S. labor force, according to the U.S. Bureau of \nLabor Statistics. By 2025, the Bureau projects that one of two new \nworkers joining the U.S. labor force will be Hispanic. This amendment \nwould provide an additional $9.9 million in assistance to these great \ninstitutions.\n  We must do everything possible to provide every child with the best \neducation we can. This amendment would provide small but much-needed \nincreases to programs that can make a difference in the lives of \nmillions of children. I urge my fellow Senators to support these \ngreatly needed programs by providing them with the proper resources.\n  This is a very worthwhile amendment. It puts resources to use where \nthey are most needed--not just in my State but throughout this country.\n  The fastest growing minority population in our country is the \nHispanic community. We need to ensure these young people growing up are \nwell educated, are prepared for the challenges for the 21st century. \nThis legislation helps greatly with that effort.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2259\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me briefly describe one other \namendment at this point. I called this amendment up yesterday, as well, \namendment 2259, dealing with the Drug Assistance Program, an amendment \nSenator Smith and I have worked together on to add additional funding \nfor the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, or ADAP.\n  We had an amendment voted on last night by Senator Coburn to shift \nfunding to this function by taking funding from the Centers for Disease \nControl. Our amendment does not do that. Our amendment provides $74 \nmillion in much-needed funding. It would be emergency funding for the \nAIDS Drug Assistance Program.\n  This is a very meritorious amendment. It is an amendment I hope all \ncolleagues will support. Some Members of this body voted against the \namendment of the Senator from Oklahoma in anticipation of supporting \nthis very important amendment I am talking about now.\n  The AIDS Drug Assistance Program provide life-saving assistance to \nover 136,000 uninsured or underinsured HIV-infected individuals each \nyear. As the number of people living with HIV/AIDS has increased, \nlargely due to advances in HIV treatment, the importance of and demand \nfor ADAP has grown so that, as of September 2005, a total of 2,187 \nindividuals were on ADAP waiting lists in nine States.\n  As the National ADAP Monitoring Project says:\n\n       When an individual is on a waiting list, they may not have \n     access to HIV-related medications.\n\n  We are talking about life-extending and life-saving medications. In \nfact, it has been reported that patients on ADAP waiting lists in West \nVirginia and Kentucky have passed away.\n  Furthermore, as of March 2005, due to funding shortfalls, 21 States \nhave some sort of cost containment measures in place, including waiting \nlists, that often impede access to care. This includes increased cost-\nsharing, reductions in eligibility income limits, and limitations on \ncovered treatments.\n  We as a Nation, are rightfully committed to providing billions of \ndollars of support for HIV/AIDS care and treatment services to those \nliving with HIV in nations across the world and we should be. However, \nhere at home, it is unforgivable that there are Americans with HIV \ndying because they are on waiting lists for life-saving drugs or having \nlife-saving medications rationed to them in various forms.\n  A story entitled ``Dying for AIDS Drugs'' documents some of the \nstories of those who have lost ADAP coverage or are on waiting lists. \nAs the story reads:\n\n       Margaret Nicholson, a Springfield, Oregon, homecare \n     attendant who survives with her mother and husband on less \n     than $20,000 a year, lost her ADAP coverage because she \n     couldn't afford the new co-pays; she has now gone 4 months \n     without seeing a doctor and is scraping by on pill samples. \n     In North Carolina, HIV doctor Aimee Wilkin says some of her \n     waiting list patients, forced to seek medicines through drug \n     company charity programs, have faced multiple treatment \n     interruptions, the result of bureaucratic delays, exposing \n     them to the risk of HIV drug resistance. In Kentucky, \n     caseworkers are so desperate they're asking churches to pass \n     the hat to sponsor someone's pills for a few weeks at a time.\n\n  In our great Nation, this is unacceptable and should end. This \namendment, sponsored by Senator Smith and myself, would go a long way \nto address the ADAP shortfall and I urge its passage.\n  I hope we can also have a rollcall vote on this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on Senate amendment 2262 at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 2 minutes to speak on behalf of the nominee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of Richard \nSmoak,\n\n[[Page S11977]]\n\nwho has been nominated by President Bush to fill a vacancy in the \nNorthern District of Florida as a Federal district court judge.\n  I would like to have the record reflect Mr. Smoak is a man of great \nintegrity, a person who will distinguish himself on the bench, as he \nhas in every other aspect of his life.\n  He is from Panama City, FL, where he has practiced law in a very \ndistinguished fashion for quite a number of years. He is one of those \npeople who folks speak about in superlative terms. And one can \nunderstand why.\n  Mr. Smoak graduated from the University of Florida in 1972, with a \nlaw degree; after having gone to the U.S. Military Academy at West \nPoint, graduating in 1965. From 1965 to 1970, Mr. Smoak was an infantry \nofficer, serving extensively in Vietnam, where he distinguished himself \nby receiving a Silver Star medal and a Bronze Star medal, among other \nmilitary awards he received for his distinguished service to his \nNation.\n  Mr. President, better than I, I think I should quote from among those \nwho have known him and have practiced law with him, and those who have \nbeen in the community with him.\n  I will quote from Mr. Paul Anderson of Panama City, who speaks of Mr. \nSmoak in this fashion:\n\n       Dick Smoak is simply one of the finest lawyers and finest \n     men I have ever had the privilege of knowing. Describing Dick \n     requires the use of words such as integrity, character and \n     professionalism. As a legal practitioner, Dick knows the law \n     and applies it logically to each case he handles.\n\n  Mr. President, in addition to that, one of those things I believe I \nlike about Mr. Smoak that speaks so highly of him is that Mr. Anderson \nspeaks about the fact that he does not compromise his principles.\n  With that, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote favorably on \nthis nomination of Mr. Richard Smoak to serve as a Federal district \ncourt judge for the Northern District of Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of John Richard Smoak for appointment to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Florida. Mr. Smoak has long \nserved his Nation, from his highly decorated service in Vietnam to his \nefforts to improve the judiciary system in Florida.\n  He has resided and has practiced civil law for over the last 30 years \nin Panama City, FL. During that time, he represented a wide variety of \nclients from doctors to small business owners to truckdrivers to \nnational corporations in many areas of the law. This broad experience \nwill serve him well as a Federal judge.\n  Mr. Smoak is a well-regarded and highly qualified attorney. I, along \nwith Senator Martinez, believe he will make a great addition to the \nFederal bench and urge our colleagues to vote in support of his \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is the amendment that a lot of us \ntalked about earlier that provides funding for a possible avian flu \npandemic. We have worked a lot on both sides of the aisle. I especially \nthank our chairman, Senator Specter, for his guidance and leadership on \nthis amendment, for working this out and, again, ensuring that we can \nmove ahead to make sure this country is ready with the funds we need to \nprovide for better global surveillance, to provide for stockpiling of \nantivirals and vaccines, for money that is going to be needed for \nbuilding flu vaccine manufacturing plants and for making sure our \npublic health infrastructure is adequate and that we have the surge \ncapacity in hospitals. That is all in this amendment.\n  Again, I thank Senator Specter for his leadership on this amendment \nin working it out so that we can move to a voice vote on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, very briefly, Senator Harkin is due great \ncredit for this very important amendment, having taken the lead in \nestablishing the fund. We have structured it, after consultation with a \nnumber of our colleagues, so that funds will be expended at the \ndiscretion of the President, after consultation with certain named \nMembers of both the House and the Senate. This is in anticipation of \nthe administration sending over a proposal in which we should have \nample time to give due consideration before the conference.\n  This is a very significant step forward so that we do not face a \ncrisis where the administration wants something done, but only the \nCongress, under the Constitution, has the authority to appropriate the \nfunds.\n  I salute my colleague, Senator Harkin, and all those who worked on \nthe amendment.\n  We jointly urge its adoption.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2283, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto congratulate Senator Specter and Senator Harkin and their staff on \nmoving the avian influenza amendment forward in a bipartisan manner. \nThey have done a tremendous job on coming to an agreement.\n  Senator Harkin and Senator Specter's amendment includes my proposal \nfor funding for migratory wild bird surveillance which I would like to \ntake a moment to outline more thoroughly.\n  As we all know, the potential for an influenza pandemic is increasing \nas the H5N1 virus has now moved swiftly across Asia, Russia, Turkey and \nnow the EU, killing millions of domesticated poultry and over 60 humans \nto date. History and science tell us that wild birds are the ones that \nspread deadly avian influenza viruses. It happened before during the \n1918 influenza epidemic that killed an estimated 40 million people \nworldwide. We must act now to ensure that this does not happen again. \nWe have the tools. We just need to increase and strengthen them.\n  My proposal seeks to provide funds supporting an early warning system \nfor global influenza that starts with wild birds. This is a major gap \nin our flu tracking system. The proposed warning system would track and \nmonitor avian viruses and their mutations carried by wild birds by \nexpanding the Centers of Disease Control's wild bird surveillance \nefforts which are currently not extensive. The CDC's efforts must be \ntied together with the network of global organizations, including \nnongovernmental organizations that have the capacity to expand and \ncomprehensively collect and disseminate these tracking data from around \nthe world.\n  Just as we track hurricanes as they begin as a tropical storm, we \nmust track wild birds and the viral storms they carry over oceans and \ncontinents and share that data with the world.\n  The purposes of my proposal are to support efforts: to more rapidly \nand efficiently detect, verify, and report on the presence of H5N1 and \nother highly pathogenic avian influenzas and infectious diseases in \nmigratory wild birds and waterfowl; to use information on viral strains \nfound in wild birds to better delineate any mutations in the virus; to \nuse information on when and where highly pathogenic avian influenza \nviruses and other infectious diseases are identified in migratory birds \nto better guide preparedness in the U.S. and around the world, to carry \nout a comprehensive migratory bird surveillance program that will \nprovide early warning to specific areas to enhance poultry biosecurity \nand surveillance, and other human protective measures as necessary; to \ncreate an open access database where information on highly pathogenic \navian influenza viruses and other infectious diseases identified in \nmigratory birds are shared in as close to real time as possible; to \nprotect the health and safety of U.S. citizens and officials traveling \nand living abroad; and to protect the economic interests of the U.S. \nand its partners from threats to health, agriculture, and natural \nresources.\n  It is the intent of my proposal that within 90 days of the \nappropriation, the Centers for Disease Control's influenza branch enter \ninto a contract with one or more nongovernmental organizations \nchartered in the U.S. with extensive global wildlife health experience \nin tracking disease in wild birds, including free-ranging, captive, and \nwild bird species, with a proven ability in identifying avian influenza \nin birds, and with accredited zoological facilities in the U.S.\n  The influenza branch and the contracting nongovernmental \norganization(s) will collaborate with appropriate Federal and State \nagency partners, including the Department of Agriculture acting through \nthe Agricultural Research Service and the Animal and Plant Health \nInspection Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service; various U.S. State wildlife agencies, multilateral \nagency partners, including the Food and Agriculture Organization, the \nWorld Health Organization, the Office International des Epizooties, and \nthe World Conservation Union; conservation organizations with expertise \nin international and domestic bird monitoring surveillance; accredited \ncolleges of veterinary medicine; and other national and international \npartners, as necessary.\n  The contracting nongovernmental organization, in coordination with \nthe influenza branch of the CDC, shall manage an international \nsurveillance program in which all partners named above are encouraged: \nto monitor and test for the presence or arrival of avian influenza and \nother significant avian pathogens at important bird areas around the \nworld and in marketplaces with intense trade in wild birds; to use \ntrained professionals to collect samples and other data and send \nsamples to appropriate diagnostic centers; to use the international \nsurveillance network to conduct disease surveillance activities on \nmigratory birds worldwide, domestic and international field \ninvestigations on migratory birds, training and\n\n[[Page S11979]]\n\ncapacity-building activities related to the relationships between human \nhealth, domestic and animal health, and wildlife health, and research \non methods and approaches for the detection and enhanced surveillance \nof highly pathogenic avian influenza and other infectious diseases in \nmigratory birds; and to send samples for avian influenza testing to \ncertified laboratories that meet internationally established \nmethods standards. These certified laboratories are located at the \ninfluenza branch of the CDC, the Office International des Epizooties, \nthe Food and Agriculture Organization, the National Veterinary Services \nLaboratory of the Department of Agriculture, and the Agricultural \nResearch Service. These findings should be reported back to the \ncontracting nongovernmental organization and the international \nsurveillance network partners.\n\n  The CDC's influenza branch and the eligible organization, in \ncoordination with the partners of the international surveillance \nnetwork, will use surveillance reports and other formal and informal \nsources of information to identify and investigate local disease \noutbreaks of avian influenza; will develop a long-term baseline of \nregional data related to highly pathogenic avian influenza and \npathogens in migratory birds for analysis between and across sites to \ncreate a system to identify when and where outbreaks might occur and \npaths of dispersal; will provide technical assistance for disease \nprevention and control programs based on a scientific understanding of \nthe relationships between wildlife health, animal health, and human \nhealth; will provide analytic disease findings regularly to the \ninfluenza branch of the CDC and other international network \nsurveillance partners to prevent and combat diseases; and will conduct \nother activities as necessary to support the international network and \nits partners. The surveillance network will be coordinated from the \nheadquarters of the contracting nongovernmental organization.\n  The CDC's influenza branch and the contracting nongovernmental \norganization, manage, map, and make available an online database \ncontaining all the results and information gathered through the \ninternational surveillance network. The database shall provide \ngeographic data on wild bird populations and the movements of the \npopulations. The laboratory test results will be available for viewing \nby any Federal agency, foreign country, multilateral institution, \norganization, or individual.\n  The CDC's influenza branch and the contracting nongovernmental \norganization, will request accredited colleges of veterinary medicine \nand other partners of the international surveillance network to monitor \nimportant bird areas around the world and to test for the presence or \narrival of avian influenza and other significant avian pathogens of \nzoonotic concern.\n  Expanding the CDC's efforts by supporting an international \nsurveillance network, allows us to focus limited resources and prepare \ncommunities in the infected wild birds' flight path. If we have this \ninformation, our menu of interventions can include: providing available \nantivirals or vaccines to those at-risk, protecting poultry farms, \npreparing hospitals to take on thousands of patients, and even keeping \npeople indoors. By tracking wild birds we may even be able to produce \nan avian flu vaccine faster by understanding which influenza virus is \nthe killer. The current H5N1 virus is not the one that could cause \nwidespread devastation to humans because it hasn't led to sustained \nhuman to human transfer, yet.\n  This amendment provides $10,000,000 in 2006 to the CDC to work with \nU.S. and international partners to strengthen a global wild bird \nsurveillance system. Ten million dollars is a small sum in comparison \nto the tens of billions of dollars for vaccine research and antiviral \nstockpiling. Vaccines and stockpiling are our current focus and we \nshould be thinking about them, but it is equally important to think \nabout being prepared for outbreaks and trying to keep a pandemic from \never hitting. This funding would enable the CDC's influenza branch to \ncontract with one or more expert organizations with the capacity to \nquickly put into place the tracking and analytical systems we need.\n  As we speak, some countries and organizations have started to collect \ninformation in the U.S. and the world. But while we are collecting \ndata, they are not being stored in any kind of organized manner to make \nit available for easy study and response.\n  To summarize, we have a major gap now in avian flu preparedness. We \nare not adequately tracking the wild birds that will be the flu \ntransfer agents. We need to have a stronger and much better tracking \nsystem right now. Second, we have to do a much better job collecting \nand analyzing the information we have and will get so we can prepare \nour communities.\n  I thank Senators Harkin and Specter and their staff for their work \npreparing our Nation for a possible pandemic. My proposal, which they \nhave incorporated into their amendment, is relatively small but \naddresses a big gap that no one is thinking about. It's the big bird in \nthe room.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss an important flu \namendment that Senator Harkin and I and several of our colleagues are \noffering to increase the amount of funding for the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention and their efforts to help our Nation prepare for \nboth pandemic and seasonal influenza.\n  Since December 2004, 77 cases of avian influenza have been confirmed \nin Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia, and 30 of these cases \nhave been fatal. In countries across Asia and Europe, farmers have been \nculling their poultry stocks because of fears of infection.\n  We need to prepare for the moment when--not if, but when--avian \ninfluenza hits our shores.\n  What is particularly worrisome to me, when thinking about our \nNation's ability to face the threat posed by pandemic or avian \ninfluenza, is the fact that we aren't even prepared to deal with the \nseasonal influenza epidemic that we face every year. Our efforts to \nprepare for pandemic influenza should be linked to efforts to reform \nand rebuild our Nation's seasonal flu vaccine infrastructure.\n  Approximately 36,000 Americans die of the flu each year, with another \n200,000 people requiring hospitalization because of the flu. These \ndeaths are largely preventable. We could stop them if we had a secure \nvaccine market, if we could improve our communications between the \nGovernment and our State and local public health partners, if we could \nbetter distribute and track vaccines, and if we made sure that everyone \nunderstood the importance of getting their annual flu shot.\n  Since 2000, our Nation has had three shortages of flu vaccine, which \nresulted in senior citizens lining up for hours to obtain flu vaccine, \nunscrupulous distributors attempting to sell scarce vaccine to the \nhighest bidder, and millions of Americans delaying or deferring \nnecessary flu shots.\n  In order to address these issues, we need to increase the resources \nthat we are committing to our public health infrastructure.\n  The amendment Senator Harkin is proposing will provide nearly $8 \nbillion to the CDC, allowing us to respond to the threat posed by avian \ninfluenza and our seasonal flu outbreaks.\n  It will increase funding for stockpiling of vaccine and antivirals, \nand improve our domestic production capacity to produce these items.\n  It will allow us to upgrade our public health infrastructure with \nadditional funding for hospital surge capacity and grants enabling \nState and local health departments to prepare for public health \nemergencies like vaccine shortages and pandemic outbreaks.\n  And it will provide funding so that we can increase our global and \ndomestic surveillance around pandemic and seasonal flu, including \nimprovements to our health information technology infrastructure.\n  Yet while this amendment provides the CDC with much needed resources \nfor our public health infrastructure, it does not diminish the need for \nlegislation to reform our Nation's vaccine production and delivery \ninfrastructure.\n  In response to the delays in distribution of this year's vaccine, CDC \ndirector Julie Gerberding has indicated that the agency is unable to \nobtain real-time data on vaccine shipments and delivery, citing \nconcerns over disclosure of proprietary information.\n  Having an adequate supply of vaccine does us no good if it can't get \nto the\n\n[[Page S11980]]\n\npeople who need it. In last season's epidemic, we had problems matching \nexisting stocks of vaccine to the high priority populations, like \nsenior citizens, who were in need of vaccine. It took weeks before we \ncould determine how much vaccine was actually in communities, and where \nit was needed. We wasted lots of time and resources, valuable public \nhealth resources, in trying to track this vaccine.\n  Earlier this month, Senator Roberts and I introduced the Influenza \nVaccine Security Act, legislation that contains many of the provisions \nthat would be funded through the Harkin amendment.\n  Complementing this amendment, the Influenza Vaccine Security Act \nwould further give the Department of Health and Human Services the \nauthority to track vaccine distribution in a manner that addresses \nconcerns about the protection of proprietary information, allowing \nproviders to vaccinate patients without the current uncertainties over \nsupply.\n  While there is no vaccine shortage expected this year, delays in \nproduction have resulted in diminished supplies for many providers, who \nare unable to carry out full vaccination of their high priority \npopulations, let alone any other patients who are in the habit of \nseeking an annual flu shot.\n  Because we have no tracking system, we can't tell the providers and \npatients who are looking for flu shots when vaccines might be available \nin their local area.\n  So it is clear that we need not only increased funding, provided \nthrough this amendment, for our public health infrastructure, but \nincreased authority for our public health officials to ensure that our \nsystem of vaccine outreach, delivery and distribution for both \npandemics and seasonal flu can operate as smoothly as possible.\n  There is a clear need to implement legislation like the Influenza \nVaccine Security Act that will allow our Government to plan for flu \noutbreaks, instead of scrambling to address shortages and epidemics \nonce they have already occurred. We have done too much of that already, \nin the three shortages we have faced since 2000.\n  I would urge my colleagues to not only pass the Harkin amendment \ntoday, but to work to bring legislation on seasonal and pandemic flu to \nthe floor as quickly as possible, so that we can make needed reforms \nbefore our next vaccine shortage.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the pandemic \nflu preparedness amendment that my colleague from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, has \noffered to the fiscal year 2006 Labor/Health and Human Services/\nEducation appropriation bill.\n  I thank Senator Harkin for taking the lead in addressing the \nimportant issue of pandemic flu on the floor of the Senate. Over the \npast few months, we have heard from leading public health experts such \nas Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and \nInfectious Diseases, at the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. \nJulie Gerberding, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention that it is no longer a question of if a pandemic flu will \noccur, but instead when the threat does occur will we be prepared as a \nnation. Public health experts have warned that an avian influenza \noutbreak could ignite a worldwide pandemic that would threaten the \nlives of millions of Americans. The consequences of a pandemic could be \nfar reaching, impacting every sector of our society and our economy.\n  Past influenza pandemics have led to high levels of illness, death, \nsocial disruption, and devastating economic losses; the 1918 ``Spanish \nFlu'', took the lives of more than 500,000 Americans, the 1957 ``Asian \nFlu'' caused more than 70,000 American deaths and the 1968 ``Hong Kong \nFlu'' is attributed to more than 34,000 American deaths.\n  Our Nation is facing a major health threat. Experts have told us that \nthe next pandemic has the potential to be every bit as devastating as \nwhat the world witnessed over 100 years ago. With the rapid travel \naround the globe compared to 1918, and the interdependence of our \neconomic markets compared to 1918, the potential human and economic \ncosts of the next pandemic are unimaginable.\n  We must take the necessary steps to adequately prepare for a \npotential pandemic. We must heed the warning we have been given. That \nis why I support Senator Harkin's pandemic flu amendment. Senator \nHarkin's amendment provides necessary funding that would be used to \nexpand and strengthen efforts at the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, as well as at the State and local level related to pandemic \nflu and public health preparedness. The amendment would provide \nadditional funding to expand CDC's global disease surveillance \ncapabilities, provide additional support for State and local public \nhealth facilities, increase hospital surge capacity and scale up \nvaccine manufacturing to make sure the American people are protected \nagainst pandemic threats.\n  First, the amendment provides additional funding to expand and \nsupport the strategic national stockpile to ensure antivirals, as well \nas necessary drugs, vaccines and other supplies are secured to respond \nto a pandemic flu and/or other pandemic threats.\n  Second, this amendment provides additional funding to build up and \nsupport one of the most important components to public health and \nthreat assessments, which is global disease surveillance. One of the \nbest first defenses to limiting the scope and consequences of any \noutbreak within a short turn around is to rapidly detect and contain \nthe spread of a new influenza strain.\n  Third, this amendment funds research efforts to discover new vaccine \ntreatments to deal with pandemic flu infections. Currently, there is no \nvaccine available to protect humans against a pandemic influenza. There \nis some vaccine development underway, but these efforts need to be \nstrengthened, sustained, and tested to protect our Nation against \npandemic flu.\n  Lastly, this amendment provides additional funding for State and \nlocal public health preparedness initiatives. If a pandemic were to \nspread in the United States, State and local health departments would \nbe on the front lines. However, State and local entities are woefully \nunprepared. Additional funds are needed for terrorism response \nplanning, training, strengthening epidemiology, and surveillance, \nupgrading lab capacity and communications systems and other related \nactivities. They must be given adequate resources. We must take the \nlessons learned from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. It was evident that \nour country's public health infrastructure was not adequately prepared \nto address the needs of the people affected by Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita. We cannot let that happen again. We can do better, and we must do \nbetter.\n  Our Nation's public health experts have done their jobs--they have \ntold us what needs to be done. We must heed their warning. Again, I \nthank Senator Harkin for his work on this important issue, and I \nsupport the amendment as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 2283, as further modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2283), as further modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are now in a position to move to a \nnumber of amendments on which there is agreement. As we review the \nbidding here, there are prospects for several more rollcall votes. It \nis, as usual, impossible to tell whether we will need the rollcall \nvotes. We are calling the Senators rather than identifying them on the \nfloor--identifying them on the floor is the next step--but Senators \nknow who they are, where they are on the prospect of rollcall votes, \nand they ought to come to the Chamber because we have had many \ninquiries as to when we are going to conclude this bill. We are getting \nvery close.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2324\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2324 on behalf of \nSenators Warner and Allen.

So I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the yeas and nays on \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to lend my support to amendment \nNo. 2262 to the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 2006. I am proud to be cosponsor of \nthis amendment, which was introduced by Senator Bingaman. The amendment \nadds $60 million to key education programs that are critical to \nimproving Hispanic educational opportunities. If approved, the money \nwill be put to good use by State and local entities to invest in our \ncountry's most precious resource: Our youth.\n  The Hispanic community is an integral component of our American \nworkforce. By ensuring that the 8.7 million Hispanic youth enrolled in \nour Nation's schools succeed in education, we make a down payment on \nour Nation's future economic security.\n  I note that the Hispanic Education Coalition, a group of diverse \nnational education, civil rights, and Hispanic organizations, supports \namendment No. 2262.\n  The amendment will restore $5 million in funding to the School \nDropout Prevention Program that was authorized by the No Child Left \nBehind Act, and long championed by my colleague Senator Bingaman. It \nincreases funding for civics and English as a Second Language, ESL, \nprograms by $6.5 million for parents, workers and citizens who want to \nlearn more about our country's history and enhance their language \nskills in English, the language of opportunity in America and \nthroughout the world.\n  In addition, funding for two small but incredibly effective programs, \nthe High School Equivalency Program, HEP, and the College Assistance \nMigrant Program, CAMP, would be reinstated to their Fiscal Year 2004 \nlevels. As a product of rural America, I have known and met many \nmigrant worker families. They work hard to provide the wonderful \ngrains, vegetables, and fruits we eat at our dinner table. In Colorado \nand other parts of the country, HEP-CAMP works to keep migrant students \nin high school through graduation, with the ultimate goal of sending \nthem off to college.\n  This amendment also provides an additional $13 million in funding for \nParent Assistance and Local Family Information Centers. The Colorado \nParent Information and Resource Center in Denver uses this funding to \nhelp low income parents understand and navigate the school system and \nencourages their involvement in the school community. Parental \ninvolvement is critical to children's success and I strongly support \nefforts that engage parents in their children's education.\n  Finally, there are modest increases for our Nation's Hispanic-Serving \nInstitutions and for bilingual and migrant education.\n  I urge the Senate's support of amendment No. 2262 because I believe \nwe will all reap the benefits of increasing Hispanic educational \nachievement.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to support an amendment \nintroduced by Senator Bingaman to increase funding for education \nprograms for Hispanic students. This important group of Americans has \nlong been underserved by our public schools, and the actions proposed \nin this amendment are an important remedy.\n  In America, the promise of a good education for all makes it possible \nfor any child to rise above the barriers of race or class or background \nand achieve his or her potential. We live in a world where the most \nvaluable skill you can sell is knowledge. Yet we are denying this skill \nto too many of our children.\n  This denial has grave consequences, with those consequences falling \ninequitably on children of color. Of every 100 white kindergartners, 93 \ngraduate from high school, and 33 earn at least a bachelor's degree. \nBut for every 100 Hispanic kindergartners, only 63 graduate from high \nschool, and only 11 obtain that college degree. The school age \npopulation of Hispanic students is growing five times faster than the \nstudent population at large. If we fail to do better in educating \ndeserving Hispanic youth, this failure will have grave consequences for \nus all, not just with increased unemployment but in missed \nopportunities for innovation and competitiveness.\n  This failure of our education system is not easy to address. There is \nno single, simple solution. This amendment recognizes this fact by \nproposing a variety of programs to help Hispanic students. Among these \nprograms, Support\n\n[[Page S11983]]\n\nfor Hispanic Serving Institutions will help those colleges that now \ngrant diplomas to over 50 percent of all Hispanic graduates. Language \nAcquisition Grants address those students who struggle to learn because \nthey do not yet have full fluency in English, a number which includes \nnearly half of the Hispanic students in our public schools. The School \nDropout Prevention Program addresses one of the most significant \nproblems for children of color. In Illinois, only 53 percent of \nHispanics graduate from high school, compared with 83 percent of \nwhites.\n  We must do better. We must not lower our standards. Instead, we must \nincrease our support for those students who are eager to succeed. In \nmany situations, it is clear that children of color, when provided \nappropriate support and effective teachers, can rise to meet our \nexpectations and fulfill their hopes and the dreams of their families. \nI am proud to support Senator Bingaman in this effort.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2262, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2262), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase funding for education programs serving Hispanic \n                               students)\n\n       At the end of title III (before the short title), insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. __. INCREASED FUNDING FOR EDUCATION PROGRAMS SERVING \n                   HISPANIC STUDENTS.\n\n       (a) Migrant Education.--In addition to amounts otherwise \n     appropriated under this Act, there are appropriated, out of \n     any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, an \n     additional $4,800,000 for the education of migratory children \n     under part C of title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6391 et seq.).\n       (b) English Language Acquisition.--In addition to amounts \n     otherwise appropriated under this Act, there are \n     appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise \n     appropriated, an additional $7,650,000 for English language \n     acquisition programs under part A of title III of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6811 et seq.).\n       (c) HEP/CAMP.--In addition to amounts otherwise \n     appropriated under this Act, there are appropriated, out of \n     any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, an \n     additional $2,850,000 for the High School Equivalency Program \n     and the College Assistance Migrant Program under section 418A \n     of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070d-2).\n       (d) ESL/CIVICS Programs.--In addition to amounts otherwise \n     appropriated under this Act, there are appropriated, out of \n     any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, an \n     additional $3,250,000 for English as a second language \n     programs and civics education programs under the Adult \n     Education Act (20 U.S.C. 9201 et seq.).\n       (e) Parent Assistance and Local Family Information \n     Centers.--In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated under \n     this Act, there are appropriated, out of any money in the \n     Treasury not otherwise appropriated, an additional $6,500,000 \n     for the Parent Assistance and Local Family Information \n     Centers under subpart 16 of part D of title V of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     7273 et seq.).\n       (f) Hispanic-Serving Institutions.--In addition to amounts \n     otherwise appropriated under this Act, there are \n     appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise \n     appropriated, $4,950,000 for Hispanic-serving institutions \n     under title V of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     1101 et seq.).\n       (g) Offset.--The first amount on page 123, line 15 and the \n     amount on line 21 are further reduced by $30,000,000.\n\n                           Amendment No. 2259\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to bring up \namendment No. 2259.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, amendment No. 2259 is an amendment that \nwas offered by Senator Bingaman and Senator Smith. This amendment funds \nmoney for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. It was mentioned earlier. I \nknow that Senator Bingaman and others wanted a rollcall vote on \namendment No. 2259. I believe all debate has transpired. I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have already been ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment provides for an additional \n$75 million from the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. The bill currently \ncontains $797,521,000. It has an increase of $10 million over last \nyear. As is the case with so many of the items, it is a very good \nprogram. We would like to have more money, but we simply do not have an \noffset.\n  If the sponsors of the amendment have some offset and want to talk \nabout priorities, we will be glad to listen, but on this state of the \nrecord, we are constrained to oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 2259. The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment offered \nby Senator Bingaman to provide $60 million to strengthen programs \ncritical to the success of Hispanic children and youth in our schools, \ncommunity colleges, and universities.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act laid a new foundation for our commitment \nto a quality education for all children. That landmark legislation, \nenacted 3 years ago, contained the formula for success for all \nstudents: well-qualified teachers, effective instruction, especially \nfor children with limited English skills, additional assistance for \nstudents who fall behind in school, and the accountability essential to \nensure that no child is in fact left behind. But none of those reforms \ncan succeed without the resources necessary to make them possible.\n  The bill before us falls far too short of delivering the educational \nopportunity promised to Hispanic students in the No Child Left Behind \nAct. We can clearly do more to enable Hispanic children to have access \nto the best possible education. The Bingaman amendment before us will \nadd urgently needed funds and restore the integrity of key Hispanic \nprograms that have been eliminated or underfunded in the bill.\n  Hispanic children are the Nation's fastest growing student \npopulation. The number of Hispanic students in America's classrooms has \ngrown by 61 percent since 1990. Despite this growth, too many of these \nchildren are being denied the support they need to succeed in school. \nIn fact, Hispanic students drop out of high school at an unacceptable \nrate of 52 percent.\n  The Bingaman amendment restores funding for the School Dropout \nPrevention Program, which helps States and school districts implement \nresearch-based, sustainable dropout prevention programs and re-entry \nprograms to help students who fall behind academically. At a time when \nwe are working to narrow achievement gaps, this important program is \nmore essential than ever, and is geared to ensure that all children \ngraduate with a high school diploma. By contrast, the underlying bill \neliminates this program entirely and is an insult to every Hispanic \nchild in America.\n  The amendment also invests an additional $10 million to restore title \nIII and expand its services to an additional 16,000 English-language-\nlearners throughout the Nation. This year, we are adequately serving \nonly 1 in every 5 of these students under title III. All English \nlanguage-learners deserve access to good bilingual programs, with well-\nqualified teachers to help them learn English and meet high academic \nstandards.\n  The Bingaman amendment also provides funds for another provision in \nthe No Child Left Behind Act, the Parent Information Resource Centers \nand Local Family Information Centers programs. The amendment adds $13 \nmillion for Parent Information Resource Centers, bringing total funding \nto $55 million. Because Local Family Information Centers can be funded \nonly if funds for the parent centers are over $50 million, the Bingaman \namendment enables the local centers to receive funding for the first \ntime ever. The $5 million that the amendment provides for the Local \nFamily Information Centers is an important step in involving parents in \ntheir children's education, and is especially important for parents of \nEnglish-language-learners who may need more assistance in navigating \nthe school system.\n  The amendment also benefits the 750,000 children of migrant \nfarmworkers, by providing an additional $9\n\n[[Page S11984]]\n\nmillion for the Migrant Education Program. These children face many \nobstacles to their education, including dire poverty, geographic and \ncultural isolation, and outright bigotry. The Migrant Education Program \nwas created in 1966 to reduce these obstacles, coordinate educational \nservices to migrant children, and lay the foundation for them to \nsucceed in school and in life. This amendment will provide a range of \nsupplemental support services to migrant students, including the \nassurance that their school records will follow them from school to \nschool as their families relocate to new areas of the region of the \nNation.\n  The Bingaman amendment will also help migrant students go to college \nand complete college, by investing an additional $5 million in the High \nSchool Equivalency Program and the College Assistance Migrant Program. \nThese two programs are lifelines of college opportunity for migrant \nstudents. They use proven strategies to help migrant students complete \nhigh school and graduate from college. They provide instruction and \ncounseling for those who have dropped out of school to get back on \ntrack, and they provide valuable guidance to migrant high school \ngraduates in their first year of college.\n  By contrast, the bill before us freezes funding for these two \nprograms at this year's levels of $18.7 million for the high school \nprogram and $15.5 million for the freshman college program. It carries \nforward a cut of $4.4 million from last year, which resulted in the \nelimination of five parts of the high school program. We need to do \nmore, not less, to help migrant students succeed in school and college. \nReductions in these valuable programs should be unacceptable to us all.\n  Finally, the Bingaman amendment provides an additional $9.9 million \nto support the nearly 250 colleges and universities across the country \ndesignated as Hispanic Serving Institutions. Over half of all Hispanic \nstudents enrolled in higher education are served by these colleges and \nuniversities. They enable tens of thousands of Hispanic students every \nyear to continue their education and obtain a college degree.\n  Investing in the education of Hispanic children is a vital part of \nassuring the future strength and well-being of our Nation. I strongly \nurge the Senate to support the Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nBingaman amendment. This amendment provides $74 million in much needed \nadditional support for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program.\n  Yesterday, the Senate overwhelmingly defeated an amendment by Senator \nCoburn that would have increased ADAP funding at the expense of the \nCenters for Disease Control construction and renovations account. CDC \nbuildings and labs haven't been updated in years, and in some cases \ndecades. Today, we are asking CDC to do more to protect public health \nthan ever before, especially in light of important priorities like \navian flu preparedness and combating bioterrorism. It doesn't make \nsense to cut the funds that would help them build the facilities to do \nit, which is why I could not support the Coburn amendment.\n  The Bingaman amendment will help provide additional funding for \nlifesaving medications to nearly 150,000 low-income, uninsured or \nunderinsured people in the United States. And it does not cut other \nimportant public health programs to do it. The CDC estimates that over \n212,000 people in the U.S. who have been diagnosed with HIV are not \nreceiving treatment, making this additional ADAP funding a critical \npriority. I urge my colleagues to help those not receiving treatment by \nsupporting this important amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I would like to talk briefly about the \nimportance of the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, or ADAP. ADAP is a \nvital resource for low-income individuals who are living with HIV/AIDS. \nIt helps get medications to those who most need them so that they can \nstay healthy and avoid more costly health care treatments that are \nrequired if their condition worsens. To date, ADAP has been a \nsuccessful partnership between Federal and State governments, but it is \nrapidly buckling under the strain of budget shortfalls and rising \ndemand for services.\n  Currently, there are over one million individuals living with HIV in \nthe United States, many of whom rely upon expensive medications to stay \nalive. While we have made significant strides in stabilizing the spread \nof HIV in recent years, it is the most vulnerable individuals who are \nunable to afford medications to treat their condition. These are the \npeople that ADAP helps. They are not eligible for Medicaid--as most \nState programs only cover those individuals who have been disabled by \nfull-blown AIDS. They are individuals who simply cannot afford to \npurchase all the medications required to keep them healthy and active \nmembers of the community and the workforce.\n  Each year, ADAP caseloads increase by 7,000 to 8,000 people. Yet \nfunding has not kept pace with that growth. It has been estimated that \nADAP would need an additional $100 million each year to keep pace with \nincreased demand. While increases in drug rebates or State funding \ncould contribute to part of that need, they will by no means cover the \nentire amount. The Federal Government must also step up its financial \ncommitment to ensure that all individuals, including those new to the \nprogram, get the care they need.\n  Unfortunately, we have not met the new demand. In the budget we are \ndebating today, ADAP has only received a $10 million increase over \namounts appropriated in 2005, the same amoun recommended by the House. \nIn 2004, funding for ADAP only increased by $34 million. Year after \nyear, ADAP goes underfunded, which means more and more low-income \nindividuals are unable to access medications that may keep them alive. \nIn my opinion, that is simply wrong.\n  In response to funding shortfalls, many states, struggling with their \nown budgetary difficulties, have been forced to create waiting lists, \nimplement additional cost sharing requirements or create restrictive \nformularies that create barriers for many individuals to access \ntreatment. Other states with lower than average eligibility guidelines \nhave been unable to extend coverage to individuals who live in poverty \nbecause they do not meet restrictive income and asset tests.\n  The State of Oregon has done its best to keep ADAP service levels \nconstant, with the support of organizations like Cascade AIDS. But it \nis becoming increasingly more difficult to meet the rowing need for \nassistance. Oregon's ADAP has been forced to implement priority service \nran kings and may have to consider additional cost-sharing requirements \nnext year. Our income eligibility guidelines have also been lowered, a \nchange which means more individuals are going to go without the \nmedications they need. Oregon is not alone.\n  Currently, 2,185 low-income individuals are on waiting lists for ADAP \nnationwide. Some of these individuals have been fortunate enough to \nreceive temporary assistance through an emergency initiative launched \nlast year by the President. However, that program expired in September \nand will be entirely phased out by the end of the year. Individuals on \nwaiting lists are sick and in most cases they only get sicker while \nthey wait for treatment.\n  Sadly, individuals on waiting lists in Kentucky and West Virginia \ndied while waiting for acceptance into their States drug assistance \nprograms. In a nation with wealth such as ours, it is unacceptable that \nindividuals face the threat of dying from AIDS because we do not \nadequately fund the programs such as ADAP. Now is the time for Congress \nto act so further tragedies like these do not occur again.\n  Apart from these unfortunate examples, others who are on waiting \nlists are only likely to see their conditions worsen, which means they \nmay one day require more costly health care treatment. It is not good \nfiscal policy to continually fail to invest in medical treatments that \ncould prevent HIV cases from progressing to full-blown AIDS. It is a \nfact that treating AIDS is much more expensive than treating HIV. The \nmore we can do to keep individuals healthier, longer, the better, not \nonly in terms of cost savings for the government, but in extending the \nchance that those living with HIV/AIDS can live to see a cure for their \nillness.\n\n  As a matter of fiscal and moral responsibility, Senator Bingaman and \nI\n\n[[Page S11985]]\n\nare offering an amendment today that would increase funding to ADAP \nprograms by $74 million in the 2006 budget. That amount, combined with \nthe new funding already in the bill, should just barely cover the costs \nassociated with new caseload growth in the coming year. I know it will \nnot be enough to address past funding inequities, but it is a start. We \nhave to act now to do something to address ADAP waiting lists and \nsupport those States--like Oregon--that have fought to keep their \nprograms whole, but often at the expense of imposing increased cost-\nsharing and additional access barriers.\n  I understand there are enormous demands on the Federal budget, but \nthis isn't an issue of increased spending, but of priorities. ADAP has \nthe potential to save lives and must be a priority of this Congress. \nFor too many years, appropriations have not kept pace with new case \ngrowth, and the situation is becoming unsustainable. We must act now to \nbetter support some of our most vulnerable citizens who live with HIV \nand that is why I am asking you to support my amendment.\n  I realize I do not have an offset for my request and I respect \nChairman Specter's position to keep the pending bill in balance. But at \nthe same time, there are some issues that are of such great importance \nthat they require us to commit new funding, regardless of whether it \nwas accounted for in our original spending plan. ADAP is one of them. \nIn a bill that appropriates almost $150 billion, I don't believe $74 \nmillion is too much to ask, especially if it could save someone's life.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I make a point of order under section \n302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act that the amendment provides \nspending in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation under the \nfiscal year 2005 concurrent resolution on the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from North Carolina (Mr. Burr).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nCorzine), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), and the Senator from \nWest Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee).

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts has an \namendment which Senator Harkin and I have discussed with him. I believe \nit is acceptable. I yield now to Senator Kerry so he can state his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2216\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask the pending amendment be set aside \nand amendment No. 2216 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2216.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n            (Purpose: To provide for a limitation on funds)\n\n       At the end of title II (before the short title), add the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to implement any strategic plan under section 3 of \n     Executive Order 13335 (regarding interoperable health \n     information technology) that lacks a provision that requires \n     the Department of Health and Human Services to give notice to \n     any patient whose information maintained by the Department \n     under the strategic plan is lost, stolen, or used for a \n     purpose other than the purpose for which the information was \n     collected.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, very quickly, this is an amendment that \nmakes clear as we gather this gigantic database of information, medical \ninformation, that we apply the same privacy rights to that information \nwe have applied with respect to banking information, so if indeed it \nwere either hacked or there were a theft or loss of that information, \nany individual whose information is contained therein would be notified \nso they would be aware of it and able to take any steps necessary to \nprotect themselves.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member for being \nwilling to accept this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2216) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again we are very close to finishing up \nthis appropriations bill. There may be one or two other amendments. I \nam hopeful. Please come. I have been deceived by people saying they \nhave a plane to catch, they have this or that. But those who have any \namendments, if they haven't been over here--otherwise, I defer to my \ndistinguished chairman.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have an amendment by the Senator from California, \nMrs. Boxer, who is on the floor and ready to go with her amendment. My \nsuggestion would be--we have culled the list, we have called everyone, \nwe know of no other rollcall votes--that we move to third reading when \nwe conclude the Boxer amendment.\n  We have had continuous requests, multiple requests. Senators want to \nknow when we are going to conclude. We are very close to concluding. \nLet us, if it is agreeable to my ranking member, take up the Boxer \namendment, and then have an interlude for anybody else who has an \namendment. Then we will go to third reading and final passage.\n  As previously announced, Senator Boxer is next. Then we have the \namendment of the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign. We will have two \nback-to-back rollcall votes on Senator Boxer's amendment and Senator \nEnsign's amendment. Then we will be in a position to have some \nadditional voice votes on about half a dozen amendments. Then we are in \na position to go\n\n[[Page S11986]]\n\nto final passage. Our colleagues can be informed that we are moving \nright along. That should conclude the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania and my \nfriend from Iowa for being courteous as we tried to work something out. \nIt appears we are going to have to vote on this amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to support afterschool programs.\n  I send a modification to amendment No. 2287 to the desk and ask for \nimmediate consideration of the modified amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2287), as modified, is as follows:\n\n\n                    AMENDMENT NO. 2287, as modified\n\n(Purpose: To increase appropriations for after-school programs through \n                21st century community learning centers)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. 21ST CENTURY COMMUNITY LEARNING CENTERS.\n\n       (a) Funding Increase.--In addition to amounts otherwise \n     appropriated under this Act, there is appropriated \n     $51,900,000 for 21st century community learning centers under \n     part B of title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7171 et seq.).\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will use a very short amount of time, \nknowing colleagues are anxious to get moving on this bill.\n  I feel heavy in my heart because this Senate is such a wonderful \ninstitution when we authorize afterschool programs in the United States \nof America. We did that, and we have had a very sad response in terms \nof the funding that does not match the authorization.\n  I think my colleagues know full well the FBI says there is no program \nthat does more to keep our kids out of trouble than afterschool \nprograms. That is why Senator Ensign and I teamed up originally to get \nthe first of afterschool programs authorized by this Congress. But it \nhas been very sad.\n  I know the Senator from Pennsylvania supports this program. I know \nthe Senator from Iowa, who heads this important subcommittee, supports \nthese programs. Most Senators support these programs. But right now is \na moment when we have to stand up for our kids.\n  Look at what has happened. Despite the fact we are supposed to be \ngoing toward $2.25 billion, we are actually now funding afterschool at \nless than $1 billion--less than we were in 2002 because the afterschool \nprograms have not been exempted from across-the-board cuts.\n  What we will do today with this amendment is add back--this is very \nimportant--$51.9 million, which will get it back to the $1 billion \narea. At least we will take it back to where it was in 2002.\n  This is a very sad day.\n  I want to say something to my friend from Pennsylvania, the chairman \nof the subcommittee and someone whom I admire greatly, Senator Specter. \nWhat we have here is a real sadness for our children. We have a \nsituation where we are actually cutting the funding of afterschool \nprograms year after year after year while our children cry out for \nattention after school. The FBI tells us this is the best.\n  The Bush administration's Drug Enforcement Agency takes taxpayer \nmoney and places ads all over America's televisions that say, It is 4 \no'clock in the afternoon. Do you know where your children are? It is 3 \no'clock, 5 o'clock. Make sure you know where your children are. They \nspend taxpayer dollars with one hand warning our families to take care \nof their kids after school and with the other hand we and they are \ncomplicit in cutting the afterschool programs.\n  We are covering 1.3 million children. There is another couple million \nto 3 million who need afterschool care. The least we can do is add \nroughly $51 million to protect this program from inflationary costs and \nat least get it back to where it was in 2002.\n  For the sake of our children, for the sake of our families--I am \ntalking here about our poor families, our working poor families, our \nmiddle-class families, and our upper middle-class families, and, yes, \nfrankly, even our wealthier families who also support these programs, I \nurge you to please vote aye on this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from California for \noffering this amendment on afterschool funding. I agree with her about \nthe importance of the program. It is a line of community support which \nI have recognized for several decades since I was district attorney for \nPhiladelphia, since I saw firsthand the high incidence of crime \ncommitted during the hours between the time students leave school and \nthe time they see their parents. Senator Harkin and I have been very \nsolicitous about this program and have made very substantial increases \ngoing back to 1998 when we added $39 million; in 1999, we added $160 \nmillion; in 2000, we added $253 million; in 2001, we added $392 \nmillion; in 2002, we added $154 million. We took a program which was \nfunded at $40 million in 1998 and we brought it right up to the billion \ndollar mark. It is a tremendous program.\n  One of the grave difficulties of managing this bill is to oppose so \nmany amendments which are good. We had to oppose Senator Byrd's $5 \nbillion for title II, Senator Kennedy's addition to Pell grants, \nSenator Dodd on daycare, Senator Clinton on special education, and so \nit goes. If you want to amass a terrible voting record, be chairman of \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation. It is a great place to do it.\n  I wish we had more of an allocation. I know how sincere the Senator \nfrom California is about this program. I very much regret being \nconstrained to oppose it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield briefly?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I know the Senator is a big supporter of the afterschool \nprogram because I remember when the President was looking to cut it in \nhalf. He and I were looking at this together, and we spoke. I think it \nwas teaming up with Members on both sides of the aisle to help. I want \nto point out to my dear friend that when Senator Ensign and I got \ntogether and wrote the authorization part which you have been so \nwonderful to fund, we were very clear in our authorization--and \neveryone supported it--that, my God, to actually reduce the funding of \nthis program is a big mistake.\n  I say to my friend, getting this program to $1 billion occurred \nbecause we all worked together on the authorization, and we were \nfortunate to have appropriators who agreed with us.\n  But in 2002, even with the best efforts of my friend, we haven't even \nprotected this program from inflation from 2002 to today and to 2006. \nWe actually have a cut in real dollars to the program below inflation. \nIt is tragic that we will lose children from this program which the FBI \nsays is so important.\n  I want to make one more plea to my friend. I am not asking for $1 \nbillion, which in fact we should have if we follow the authorization. \nAll I am asking for is enough funding--such a small sum that it is an \nasterisk in this budget--to please add $51.9 million. That is all. We \nwill at least bring it back up to $1 billion, because we haven't been \nprotected from across-the-board cuts.\n  I make a plea to my friend. I know everything around here is \nprecedent setting, to do this or that or the other. These are real \nkids. There is real stuff going on out there, and they need these \nafterschool programs.\n  I yield the floor and thank my friend very much for yielding to me.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We will keep a sharp eye on this program in conference. \nIf there is any way to increase the funding to any extent, Senator \nHarkin and I will be very sympathetic.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \noffering this amendment and for being, if she doesn't mind my term, the \nwatchdog. We all get wrapped up in a lot of things here. But I can't \nthink of anything more important than what Senator Boxer is talking \nabout right now. We know what is happening in this country. We know \nmore and more people are being squeezed by the fact that we can't raise \nthe minimum wage. They are being squeezed by the lack of adequate \nhousing. They are being squeezed by entry-level jobs that they cannot \nget. There are all kinds of pressures on families.\n  We passed a law 10 years ago, Welfare to Work, to get people off of \nwelfare to\n\n[[Page S11987]]\n\ngo to work. We always knew that the one big component we never answered \nwas, what do you do with the kids? It is both daycare and afterschool \nfunding because these parents get home right away--usually single \nparents. We need the funding for the afterschool programs. If we want \nto cut down on teen crime and teen drugs, teen pregnancies, this is the \nway to do it. Senator Boxer is absolutely right. It is a shame we do \nnot have the money for it. We should have.\n\n  I thank the Senator for offering this amendment. I hope, with the \nconcurrence of our chairman, we can somehow find the money for this. I \ndon't know where. It is tight. I know we have a tight situation. I \ncannot think of anything more worthy than this program.\n  I thank the Senator from California.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, with reluctance, I have to raise a point \nof order. This will push us over the brink. Under section 302(f) of the \nBudget Act, this amendment would create a situation where the authority \nand outlays would be in excess of the subcommittee 302(b) allocation \nfor the fiscal year 2006. I expect the Senator from California to move \nto waive.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I appreciate that my friend is reluctant \nto raise this. I look forward to the conference, where perhaps we can \nfind enough money to protect some of these kids.\n  Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I \nmove to waive the applicable sections of the act for purposes of the \npending amendment.\n  I ask again for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we will now proceed to the amendment of \nthe Senator from Nevada. It is the anticipation of the managers \nfollowing that amendment that we will have two rollcall votes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that after the yeas and nays have been \nordered, the first rollcall vote be 15 minutes plus 5 and the second a \n10-minute rollcall vote, 10 minutes plus 5.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2300\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2300.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, before I speak on my amendment, briefly I \nwill comment about Senator Boxer's amendment.\n  Senator Boxer and I have worked long and hard on afterschool \nprograms, something in which I passionately believe. We worked to try \nto have this program increased without adding to the deficit, so we had \nan offset. It was unfortunate the offset was not accepted. I will \ncontinue to work with Senator Boxer because it is a program in which I \nbelieve. However, I also believe in staying within the budget. So \nreluctantly, I will have to vote against Senator Boxer's amendment. I \nsay reluctantly. It pains me to do so. To be consistent with my voting \nrecord this year, I have voted consistently to stay within the budget. \nI will reluctantly oppose that amendment.\n  Getting to my amendment, this is a very simple amendment, and I will \nnot speak long because I know everyone needs to get home. I will keep \nit as simple as possible.\n  My amendment will stop the Department of Education from competing \nagainst private companies in the United States that are developing \nsoftware to teach Chinese students to speak the English language.\n  Normally, one would think that would be a good thing, for the \nDepartment of Education to be able to help the Chinese students learn \nEnglish--English is an international language--that would be a good \nthing, and we all applaud those efforts. The problem is, there are at \nleast five companies in the United States and probably many more that \nalready have invested their research dollars and created jobs in the \nUnited States to produce this very same software. This software exists \ntoday and these companies in the United States would like to sell to \nthe Chinese market.\n  I don't think our Government should be in the business of competing \nwith the private sector. We are all worried about jobs in the United \nStates, and here we have the Department of Education contracting to \ndevelop software that they can give to the Chinese so they can teach \ntheir kids English.\n  There are very effective programs out there that have been developed. \nWe have letter after letter after letter from these companies opposing \nwhat the Department of Education is doing. They have asked for help.\n  What this amendment is about is protecting jobs in the United States, \nprotecting those software engineers, those high-value, high-quality \njobs in the United States, and to help them be able to sell to other \ncountries--in this case, especially to the Chinese.\n  The Council for Citizens Against Government Waste is supporting my \namendment and is going to consider this vote in their ratings. If you \nbelieve in fiscally conservative principles, we hope you vote for the \nEnsign amendment.\n  I don't want to take up more time other than to reemphasize this \npoint: Protect jobs in America. We have all voted on trade issues here. \nWith trade issues, the premise behind those is we open markets in both \nplaces. We all know that the Chinese and low-cost labor have brought a \nlot of products into the United States. Here we have products that have \nbeen developed in the United States that could be sold in China. That \nis how trade is supposed to work. While we are doing free-trade \nagreements, we should not cut off the very jobs created in America to \nsell to the people in China.\n  I urge passage of our amendment and encourage all of my colleagues to \nprotect jobs in America and vote for this valuable amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I appreciate what the Senator from \nNevada is seeking to do, but let me see if I can put his amendment in a \nbroader perspective.\n  I agree, as a general rule, we ought to prevent the Government from \ndirectly competing with the private sector for a variety of reasons, \nbut the E-Language Learning System is a unique case, and we ought to \ntreat it as such. There are three reasons.\n  This is not just some program somebody cooked up and put in the \nbudget; this is a program that was initiated directly by President Bush \nas a result of a summit meeting with President Jiang Zemin in China in \nOctober of 2001. This was a President Bush and Jiang Zemin summit \nproposal from 2001.\n  The President announced the intent of our Government to implement \nthis program at the APEC summit in Shanghai after meeting with \nPresident Jiang. Secretary Powell reiterated the importance of the \nprogram at the APEC summit 1 year later.\n  We do a lot of talking around here about the importance of public \ndiplomacy, how do we do a better job getting the American image, the \nAmerican voice, the American culture and values seen around the world. \nThis is an important part of our public diplomacy since it will help \nChinese children learn English and learn more about the United States \nof America.\n  Of all of the foreign ``aid'' we have ever promoted since World War \nII, the most effective has been in education where their students study \nhere or our students study there. This can be utilized to help American \nchildren learn Chinese and other critical foreign languages in the \nfuture, something that is important to our national security, according \nto the Hart-Rudman Report and the 9/11 Commission Report.\n  This is the first and most important point, this agreement between \nthe President of the United States, George W. Bush, and the President \nof China. It is in our national interests.\n  The other two points, quickly. There has been some argument that the \ncontract awarded to implement this program that was agreed upon by the \nPresidents of our two nations is somehow unfair. It is important for my \ncolleagues to know that this contract was openly competed and conforms \nto the research and development requirement of the STAR schools \nlegislation following the same rules followed on similar programs for \nthe last 17 years. It\n\n[[Page S11988]]\n\nwas awarded in open competition to Northrop Grumman and subcontracted \nto a company called Little Planet, a company in Nashville, TN. That is \nhow I happened to know about it.\n  Some of the unhappy companies, I am told, met with the Department of \nEducation to talk about how to cooperate with the program and are now \ncomplaining. Mr. President, $2.5 million of the taxpayers' dollars have \nalready been spent in this program, more than one-third of the total \ncontract. So we will be pulling the plug and wasting $2.5 million of \ntaxpayers' dollars a third of the way through a program that was agreed \nto by the President of the United States and President Jiang Zemin of \nChina and flushing the money right down the drain.\n  Finally, this fairly awarded contract was the result of the agreement \nbetween the leaders of our country and China and is being managed so it \nwill help, not hurt, the private sector. In an effort to prevent unfair \ncompetition with the private sector, the Department of Education tells \nme it has agreed to share the results of its research to promote \nfurther development of the language software. In fact, the Department \nhopes the private sector will ``adopt [the program's] unique and \nadvanced feature that [the Department is] researching and carefully \ntesting, including authentic voice recognition, gaming, and research-\nbased learning environments delivered through low-cost web-based \ntechnology.'' So the goal is, in the long run, to help the private \nsector.\n  In conclusion, while the amendment is well-intentioned, and I \nunderstand the Senator's point, it is the wrong approach. It is wrong \nbecause it stops a program agreed to by the leaders of two countries, a \ncommitment that is in our national security interest, a commitment that \nis part of our public diplomacy. It was arrived at fairly. It was \ncompeted. A third of the money has already been spent. And the \nDepartment of Education has agreed to share the results of its research \nwith the private sector.\n  I hope my colleagues will oppose this amendment and support it \nbecause it is in the national security interest of our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Very briefly, I will clarify a couple of points.\n  One, that this was a bid process.\n  To use an example, say, for instance, that the Government, the \nDepartment of Education, wanted to give away printers to China, so they \nsent out several bids. They had an open bidding process and selected \none company. Even though it was fairly bid, would we want the Federal \nGovernment using taxpayer dollars to buy from one company so they could \ngive that product to the Chinese? I think not because that would be a \ndisadvantage for other companies in the United States who should be \nable to compete to sell their products in China.\n  On the second point the Senator from Tennessee raised, he said the \nDepartment of Education is willing to share research on some of the \ninnovations that are trying to develop. Looking through the details of \nwhat the Department of Education has asked for the software companies \nto develop, there are at least five software companies that already \nmeet those specifications. They already have developed the features the \nDepartment of Education is attempting to develop.\n  Once again, I urge agreement of the amendment.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. China is a pretty big country. There are several \nhundred million children there who might have an opportunity to learn \nEnglish.\n  If our President, George W. Bush, in a meeting with the leader of \nChina, thinks it is a good idea to bid out a $9 million contract to \nimprove the ways we help Chinese children learn English, if he believes \nthat is in our national security, I don't think we ought to pull the \nplug on it a third of the way through it. There is plenty of \nopportunity for the private sector in the United States to help \nhundreds of millions of Chinese children learn English, and I hope they \nwill do that.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at the request of Senator Ensign, I ask \nunanimous consent that his name be taken off as a cosponsor of the \nBoxer amendment because there was a change in the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, my comments will be very limited as to \nthe pending amendment.\n  Last year, in the conference report, there was a direction that the \nDepartment not fund any grant that will compete directly with the \nprivate sector, and further that the Department report to the \nCommittees on Appropriation of the House and the Senate on the \nactivities undertaken on this project. It is my understanding that no \nfunds were used on this project last year.\n  It is a little hard to evaluate the factual basis as I listen to the \narguments of the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from Nevada. \nHowever, my own judgment in looking at the record is that it is \nunlikely any funds are going to be spent which would--we will include \nthe same kind of conference language next year, this year, that we had, \nwhich should maintain and should respond to the concerns about any \ngrant which will compete with the private sector, and it leaves the \nDepartment of Education at their discretion to use this system if they \nconclude it will help Chinese students of any age to learn English.\n  On the basis of a very limited record, my vote will be cast with the \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  In the absence of further debate, can we proceed to two amendments?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the plan at this point, under the \nunanimous consent agreement already reached, is to have a 15-minute \nplus 5 rollcall vote on the Boxer amendment, a 10-minute rollcall vote \nplus 5 on the Ensign amendment, and then we will be very close to final \npassage.\n  The concern has been to submit the colloquies and have a few voice \nvotes now, but I want to be sure when our colleagues come to vote on \nthese two amendments we know the lay of the land, in case anybody has \nnot been notified and wants to have a further consideration. But it \nwould be the anticipation of the managers, following these two votes, \nthere would be a very brief period of time, and then we would go to \nfinal passage and conclude the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Vote on Amendment No. 2287, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act with respect to the Boxer amendment. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nCorzine), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), and the Senator from \nWest Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 41, nays 56, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 279 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--41\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--56\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n\n[[Page S11989]]\n\n\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Corzine\n     Inouye\n     Rockefeller\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2299\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of an amendment \nthat the Senate has agreed to, the amendment offered by Senator Cochran \nadding $12 million for health care for historically underserved \ncommunities, including $2 million to help fund the Sickle Cell \nTreatment Act that was passed last year.\n  I thank Senator Cochran for his concern and sensitivity on the issue \nof funding the Sickle Cell Treatment Act. I thank Senators Specter and \nHarkin for similarly showing sensitivity to the importance of funding \nthis bill and funding health care in historically underserved areas. \nWith this additional $2 million, we will be able to get the program off \nthe ground, begin designating sickle cell disease outreach centers, and \nprovide additional grants for medical treatment, education, and other \nhealth care services for sickle cell patients.\n  I can't emphasize enough how much the leadership of these Senators \nmeans to the community of people who are affected by this disease, not \njust the 70,000 Americans who have it, not just the 2.5 million \nAmericans who have the trait, but their families and friends who \nstruggle every day with this disease. I thank the bill managers for \naccepting the amendment and thank Senator Cochran for offering it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2300\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, Senator Levin's amendment No. 2282 \nprovides for the Secretary to undertake a family unification effort. No \nfunding is involved. It is language only. It has been cleared by \nSenator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for Mr. Levin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2282.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To create a national family reunification initiative)\n\n       On Page 165, before the period on line 5, insert the \n     following:\n\n     : Provided, That the Secretary shall undertake a family \n     reunification effort in concert with national non-profit \n     organizations engaged in similar efforts.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Promoting Safe and Stable Families \nprogram has successfully carried out activities and services that \nsupport family reunification, family preservation, community-based \nfamily support, and other services for children in need.\n  My amendment builds upon the success of this program, through an \nenhanced, coordinated effort to reunite children with their families, \nby directing the Secretary to undertake a family reunification \ninitiative in concert with national non-profit organizations engaged in \nsimilar efforts. The goal is to ensure that the most effective methods \nare utilized to achieve family reunification expeditiously. This can be \nachieved by collecting, tracking and coordinating information \nmaintained by national non-profit organizations that are also engaged \nin family reunification efforts.\n  It is quite evident why such a coordinated effort is needed. Over the \npast several months, we learned a lot about displacement. After nearly \n2 months have passed since Hurricane Katrina, thousands are still \nseeking family members. Of the 2,000 foster children who fled New \nOrleans due to Hurricane Katrina, 37 are still unaccounted for.\n  Overall, there have been 4,878 reports of missing children and over \n1,600 not yet resolved. There have been 12,754 adults reported as \nmissing. Of these cases, 6,562 remain unresolved. We have all witnessed \nrescues from the rooftops in New Orleans. It was the norm rather than \nthe exception in many instances for intact families to be separately \nrescued and subsequently sent to many different places, all across the \ncountry.\n  Some have miraculously reconnected with one another. Far too few. We \ncannot depend on miracles; we need a coordinated system that will help \nunite family members who seek one another. It is for the social good to \nbring families together, when possible. Family\n\n[[Page S11990]]\n\nmatters. The strength of the family is greater than its parts. The \nstress of losing your home, your job, your community, does not compare \nto losing your family.\n  I am pleased that the managers of the bill have agreed to support \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry. The amendment is No. 2282 or No. \n2280?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 2282.\n  Is there further debate? If not, the question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 2282.\n  The amendment (No. 2282) was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2289, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2289, as \nmodified, proposed by Senator Dayton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 178, after line 25, insert the following:\n       Sec. ___. (a) In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act, there are appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $15,121,000 for \n     activities authorized by the Help America Vote Act of 2002, \n     of which $13,500,000 shall be for payments to States to \n     promote access for voters with disabilities, and of which \n     $8,621,000 shall be for payments to States for protection and \n     advocacy systems for voters with disabilities.\n       On page 137, line 9, both amounts should be further reduced \n     by $7,000,000.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I Support Senator Dayton's amendment to \nincrease the funding for disability access grants mandated under the \nHelp America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA).\n  Senator Dayton's amendment to H.R. 3010, the fiscal year 06 Labor-HHS \nAppropriation bill, provides a $7 million dollar increase to the HHS \nprovisions. Specifically, Senator Dayton's amendment would increase the \nHHS appropriations by $7 million for disability access grants and \nprotection and advocacy services for voting purposes and ensuring full \nparticipation in the elections process by individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  I support the outstanding work of Senator Dayton. Congress has failed \nto fully fund HAVA disability grants. To date, with respect to the \ndisability access grants, Congress authorized a total of $100 million \nbut has appropriated only $33 million, roughly a third of the funding \nrequired to ensure our Americans with disabilities have equal access to \nthe franchise for voting purposes in the upcoming Federal elections in \n2006, a few months away. With respect to the protection and Advocacy \ngrants, Congress authorized a total of $40 million but has appropriated \nonly $12 million, roughly a fourth of the funding required to ensure \nour Americans with disability have equal access to voter registration \nand polling places in the 2006 Federal elections. As a result, the \ndisability grant programs have a combined total HAVA funding shortfall \nof $95 million in Federal funds for election administration \nrequirements.\n  Senator Dayton's amendment for $7 million is offset by administrative \nexpenses under ``other services'' which received a $599 million \nincrease over the fiscal year 05 level.\n  January 1, 2006 is the effective date for two of the most important \nFederal requirements mandated by HAVA: The voluntary voting system \nstandards and the state-wide computerized voter registration list. Both \nrequirements are designed to ensure that individuals with disabilities \ncan exercise their right to an accessible ballot.\n  In light of the above, it is essential that Congress does not fail to \nhonor our commitment to the disability communities. If we fail to \nprovide adequate funding, we may jeopardize the opportunity of States \nto implement the most historic election reforms in America and the \nopportunity to voters, including the disability communities, to fully \nexercise their franchise in the upcoming 2006 Federal elections. It is \ntime to fulfill our promise to the disabilities communities.\n  I thank Senator Dayton for his leadership on this HAVA issue and I \ncommend the Chairman, Senator Specter, and the ranking member, Senator \nHarkin, for accommodating this increase.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2289, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2289), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2295, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

(a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 permitted the \n     outsourcing or privatization by the Internal Revenue Service \n     of collection of unpaid and past due federal income taxes.\n       (2) The Internal Revenue Service is about to issue to \n     private-sector debt collection companies tax collection \n     contracts that will create up to 4,000 well paying private-\n     sector jobs.\n       (3) If the same tax collection activities were conducted by \n     Federal employees, Federal law would give preferences in \n     employment to disabled veterans in filling those federal \n     jobs.\n       (4) By enacting legislation to improve the Internal Revenue \n     Service's tax collection efforts and outsourcing or \n     privatizing those efforts, Congress did not intend to curtail \n     the Nation's long-standing commitment to creating meaningful \n     job opportunities for disabled veterans and other persons \n     with severe disabilities.\n       (5) The contracts the Internal Revenue Service will execute \n     with private-sector debt collection companies provide a \n     unique opportunity for the Federal government to stimulate \n     the creation of well paying jobs for disabled veterans and \n     other persons with disabilities.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Secretary of the Treasury should, to the maximum \n     extent practicable, ensure that existing Federal employment \n     preferences for disabled veterans and Federal policies \n     promoting opportunities for other disabled persons are \n     carried forward as a part of any tax collection contract \n     program carried out under section 6306 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986, as added by the American Jobs Creation \n     Act of 2004, and\n       (2) the criteria applied by the Internal Revenue Service in \n     awarding contracts to private-sector tax collection companies \n     under such program should incorporate a preference for \n     companies hiring disabled veterans and other disabled \n     persons.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I congratulate both the chairman and \nranking member for a tremendous job. This next vote is on passage of \nthe Labor-HHS appropriations bill, the very last of our series of \nappropriations bills that have come before the Senate. Again, \ncongratulations to Chairman Cochran and Senator Byrd and again the \nchairman and ranking member on this bill.\n  We will be in session tomorrow. However, we will have no rollcall \nvotes. On Monday, we will begin consideration of the deficit reduction \nbill, and we are working on a schedule of debate for that measure. I do \nnot expect to have votes on Monday. We will not have votes on Monday, \nbut Senators should be aware that next week will be a busy week on the \ndeficit reduction bill.\n  Senator Specter has set a high mark with rollcall votes, and people \nhave come to the floor on time. We are going to continue to encourage--\nin fact, require--that. I encourage Senators to be ready for quick \nrollcall votes throughout next week.\n  This is the last vote tonight. There are no votes tomorrow and no \nvotes on Monday.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as a final word, Senator Harkin and I \nthank our very devoted staff: Bettilou Taylor, Ellen Murray, Jim \nSourwine, Mark Laisch, Sudip Parikh, Lisa Bernhardt, Candice Rogers, \nRachel Jones, Erik Fatemi, and Adrienne Hallett.\n  I notice Senator Grassley is waving his arm. He is here 6 minutes \nearly. Let the record show it is 5:53.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, very quickly, this is a very big bill. It is \nvery important for millions of people in this country. The management \nof this bill has been spectacular. Senator Specter and Senator Harkin \nshould be congratulated. They did a very good job in a short timeframe. \nWe should all recognize the outstanding job the two of them did.\n\n\n                   mathematics and science education\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I rise today to discuss and bring to my colleague's \nattention an issue that I believe must become one of our Nation's top \neducation priorities. As the world's economy becomes more \ninterconnected, our Nation's economic edge will continue to depend on \nour ability to innovate. We cannot remain competitive without a \nworkforce full of educated and motivated young Americans.\n  We must invest in our children and enable them to fully develop their \nGod-given talents in order to compete in a knowledge-based, global \neconomy. This means we have to place more emphasis on careers in \nscience, engineering and math. Right now, we are not getting the job \ndone.\n  Globally, the United States ranks 17th in the proportion of the \ncollege-age population earning science and engineering degrees, down \nfrom 3rd place several decades ago.\n  While China graduated 600,000 engineers and India graduated 350,000 \nlast year, only 70,000 students earned degrees in engineering here in \nthe United States.\n  In fact, the percentage of 24-year-olds with science or engineering \ndegrees is now higher in many industrialized nations. Countries \nincluding England, South Korea, Germany, Australia, Singapore, Japan \nand Canada all produce a higher percentage of science and engineering \ngraduates than the United States.\n  Is the chairman aware of these startling statistics?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I say to my colleague that I am aware of these examples \nand I share his concern.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank the chairman for his attention to the issue \nand the opportunity to briefly discuss the importance of science and \nmath education today. I know there are other Senators, especially \nSenators Alexander and Bingaman, who care a great deal about this \nissue. In fact, as many of my colleagues know, Senator Alexander and \nBingaman asked the National Academy of Science to compile a report on \nthe top 10 actions the Federal Government can take to enhance our \nability to compete in our global economy. And while the academy \nprovided\n\n[[Page S11992]]\n\na variety of recommendations, from the crucial need for energy \nindependence and investment in research infrastructure--which are in \ntheir own right extremely important--a great deal of their \nrecommendations focus on the need to improve our Nation's math and \nscience coursework and establish a workforce of qualified teachers who \nwill prepare our students for futures in highly innovative careers.\n  Has the chairman seen this report?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have. And I say to the Senator that the bill before us \nprovides funding for a number of programs that are consistent with the \nacademy's report. One such program I know my colleague is familiar with \nis the Mathematics and Science Partnership, MSP, program that provides \ngrants to improve basic student performance in math and science through \na variety of programs and activities. Many of the program's allowable \nactivities, like summer institutes for teacher training, are specific \nactivities the National Academy recommends we pursue in order to \nenhance our children's development in science and math. The committee \nhas provided a total of $178.5 million for mathematics and science \nprograms in fiscal year 2006. The House-passed bill includes $190 \nmillion for this program.\n\n  We are, of course, working under a tight budget with this bill, but I \nwant my colleague to know that as we move to conference, I will work to \nensure this program, and other similar math and science programs \nreceive the highest possible amount of funding.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank the chairman. I have heard from my State's \nsuperintendent that MSP grants have gone a long way in Ohio to support \nprograms the Ohio Science Institute, which is a statewide professional \ndevelopment opportunity for science teachers of grades 3-10, and the \nOhio Mathematics Academy Program, which is a statewide professional \ndevelopment opportunity for mathematics teachers in similar grades.\n  As the chairman and many of my colleagues are aware, I am a fiscal \nconservative and understand the deficit and funding constraints we \nface.\n  Yet, in light of the National Academy's report and other studies that \npoint to our Nation's declining rank in science and math students, I \ndon't know of too many other programs that deserve our focus and \ninvestment more than those that will prepare our children to compete in \nthe global marketplace.\n  I thank the chairman for his commitment to science and math education \nprograms as we move to conference on this appropriations bill. I hope \nhis commitment to quality science and math education will extend even \nfurther down the road, as we prepare our budgets for the next fiscal \nyear.\n\n\n                        cdc's arthritis program\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman and Senator \nHarkin for all of their work on this bill. Mr. President, as you know, \narthritis is the Nation's leading cause of disability, and it impacts \nthe lives of 44 million Americans including 300,000 children. Very few \npeople know, however, that people with rheumatoid arthritis die 5 to 10 \nyears earlier than those without arthritis. In 2003, arthritis claimed \nthe lives of 9,500 Americans.\n  In response to this national epidemic, the CDC, and over 90 national \norganizations developed the Nation's first ever public health blueprint \nto fight arthritis--the National Arthritis Action Plan. Following \nrelease of the plan in 1998, the committee, under your leadership, \nestablished an arthritis program at the CDC and supported a cooperative \nrelationship between the agency and its partners. This partnership has \nsupported several significant elements of the NAAP and continues to \nplay an instrumental part in reducing the pain and disability of \narthritis for millions of Americans. It is my understanding that the \ncommittee has included sufficient funds in the fiscal year 2006 \nappropriation for the CDC to sustain this collaboration with its \npartners at the same level.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my good friend from Georgia for his remarks. I \nam very proud of the role the committee has played in establishing and \nexpanding the arthritis program at CDC. I believe deeply in the vital \nrole of the CDC and its partners in this important battle and, yes, the \ncommittee has provided funds to sustain this cooperative relationship.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to thank my friends, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia and the chairman, for their words and just take a moment \nto add my endorsement for this important program I am very proud of the \nrole this subcommittee has played in the reduction of the arthritic \npain and suffering experienced by so many Americans.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the chairman.\n\n\n                  COMMUNITY-BASED JOB TRAINING GRANTS\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I first want to thank Chairman Specter and \nRanking Member Harkin for their diligent work on the Labor-HHS \nAppropriations bill. Budgets are very tight these days and I appreciate \nhow well the chairman and the ranking member were able to address so \nmany of the important issues in this bill. With all of this in mind, I \nwant to enter into a colloquy to clarify a key issue concerning this \nmeasure.\n  Our Nation's community colleges are critical to our economy. So many \nmen and women across our country have lost their jobs, and our \ntraditional manufacturing industries have been hit especially hard. In \nthe midst of this economic transition, community colleges have been a \nreal beacon of hope. In North Carolina, for example, workforce \ndevelopment programs at Piedmont Tech and Forsyth Community College, \nare training former tobacco and textile workers for new, well-paying \njobs in health care and biotechnology. Community colleges are leading \nthe way training workers for the high growth, high demand jobs of the \n21st century.\n  I am so grateful, as I know the community colleges across the Nation \nare as well, for Chairman Specter's efforts to fully fund the \nPresident's request for Community-Based Job Training Grants in last \nyear's appropriations process. Unfortunately, having reviewed the \nprovisions contained in the House-passed Labor-HHS Appropriations bill, \nthe Department of Labor and I are very concerned about the future of \nthis program.\n  The House bill designates $125 million in funding for fiscal year \n2006 while at the same time rescinding $125 million of fiscal year 2005 \nfunding for the program. This cuts the program in half for both fiscal \nyears and dramatically reduces the number of dislocated workers our \ncommunity colleges can train. Achieving the greatest possible funding \namount for this program must be a top priority. I know that Senator \nCornyn is strongly supporting increased funding for this program and I \nthank him for his efforts to help community colleges.\n  The Community-Based Job Training Grant Program is providing much-\nneeded funding for community colleges across our country and in my home \nState of North Carolina. Just last week, the Labor Department announced \ngrants for 70 community colleges in 40 States, exhausting the $125 \nmillion pot of available money allocated for this program. Nationwide, \n388 colleges applied for this funding, and in North Carolina, just one \nof the 16 applicants, Haywood Community College, was selected to \nreceive this funding. We all know that grant programs are very \ncompetitive; still, this funding is clearly not coming close to meeting \nthe needs of our community colleges. They are on the front lines, \ntraining workers and helping grow our economy, and we can and should do \nbetter to assist them in this endeavor.\n  Can the chairman assure me of his commitment to the funding of this \nprogram for fiscal year 2006?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the senior Senator from North Carolina for her \ncontinued interest in this critical program. I want to assure her that \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee strongly opposes the House \nrescission to the Community-Based Job Training Grants, and we are \ncommitted to funding the program at the highest level possible within \nthe existing budgetary constraints. I thank the senior Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. I thank the chairman for his work on this critical issue.\n\n\n                         office of men's health\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. I want to express my appreciation for the chairman's \nefforts, and those of the subcommittee ranking member, Senator Harkin, \nin working to ensure the health and well-being of Americans everywhere. \nAs you know, a\n\n[[Page S11993]]\n\nsilent health crisis is currently affecting America's men. On average, \nAmerican men live shorter and less healthy lives than American women. \nMen lead in each of the 15 major of death in America except Alzheimer's \nand have a life span of almost 6 years shorter than their female \ncounterparts. While this health crisis is of particular concern to men, \nit is also a concern for women whose fathers, husbands, sons and \nbrothers feel the physical, financial and emotional effects of poor \nhealth. Men's health is also a concern for employers who pay the costs \nof medical care, and lose productive employees. In addition Federal, \nState and local governments must often absorb the enormous costs of \npremature death and disability, including the costs of caring for \ndependents left behind.\n  There are a number of ailments of particular concern to men. Prostate \ncancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in the United States \namong men, accounting for 33 percent of all cancer cases. An estimated \n230,000 men will be newly diagnosed with prostate cancer this year \nalone, and approximately 30,000 will die. Prostate cancer, \nunfortunately, is not the only health threat facing men. Over 8,000 \nmen, ages 15 to 40, will be diagnosed this year with testicular cancer, \nand 390 of these men will die of this disease in 2005.\n  Fortunately, many of these conditions are treatable if detected early \nenough. I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2001 and thanks to \nearly detection and treatment was able to beat the disease. I had \nprostate specific antigen, PSA, tests and other recommended tests every \n3 to 6 months after my surgery. Last year, my doctors detected a slight \nrise in PSA, and I underwent successful radiation treatment. Because I \ncaught and treated the onset of this disease early on, I was able to \nbeat it, again. Appropriate use of tests such as PSA exams and blood \npressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol screens, in conjunction with \nclinical exams and self-testing, can result in the early detection of \nmany problems and in increased survival rates.\n  Unfortunately, many men are not taking the steps necessary to protect \nthemselves and their families from these devastating conditions. \nStatistically, women visit the doctor far more often than men. Too \noften, men fail to get routine checkups or health counseling, and they \noften ignore symptoms or delay seeking medical attention when sick or \nin pain. In addition, when men do seek care, embarrassment can often \nprevent them from openly discussing health concerns with their \nphysicians.\n  To increase men's health awareness I have introduced legislation to \nestablish an Office of Men's Health under the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. This office would be based on the Office of Women's \nHealth, currently operating within HHS, which has done a fantastic job \nof assisting women in identifying and battling many conditions common \nto women. Educating men, their families, and health care providers \nabout the importance of early detection of male health problems can \nresult in reducing rates of mortality for male-specific diseases, as \nwell as improve the health of America's men and its overall economic \nwell-being. While an Office of Men's Health is not a cure-all, it will \nassist men to focus on many health problems that can be treated \nsuccessfully if diagnosed early. Prevention and early detection can \nonly happen with increased public awareness, something the proposed \noffice hopes to provide. I yield to the distinguished chairman to \nelaborate on this point.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I, too, recognize the importance of correct information, \nprevention, and early detection in health care. Clearly, efforts must \nbe made to encourage men to address their health problems in a \nconfident, timely, and meaningful manner. I encourage the \nadministration to work with my distinguished colleague to establish an \nOffice of Men's Health within the Department of Health and Human \nServices.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have filed an amendment at the desk which I had hoped \nthe Senate would vote on prior to passage of this bill. Unfortunately \ngiven the current parliamentary situation, the only way for a vote to \noccur on the important issue of fiscal responsibility is by suspending \nthe rules. My amendment would not be in order at this time and \ntherefore my option is to move to suspend rules XVI and XXII. Although \nclearly that motion is within my rights as an individual Senator, I do \nnot believe that is the best way for this body to proceed. Our rules \nand precedents govern how we operate on these appropriations, bills and \nI think that we should work within that framework. Therefore, I am not \ngoing to make that motion because it is not an appropriate way for the \nSenate to address this amendment. I will say, however, that the Senate \nwill vote on this issue. I will be back on this floor at the first \nopportunity available to this Senator and the Senate will work its will \non this language.\n  Mr. FRIST. I greatly appreciate the Senator's commitment to this \nissue. It is imperative that this Congress exercise fiscal discipline \nand I concur that an important step must be to control spending, while \nsecuring our Nation's defense. Next week, the Senate will do just that \nas we act on the first deficit reduction package in a decade. I am \ncertain that the Senator from Oklahoma will continue to pursue his \nefforts. There will be ample opportunities, including the deficit \nreduction bill, for him to exercise his rights to do so, in a manner \nthat does not violate the spirit of the Senate rules. I look forward to \nhim bringing this important issue before the Senate in the future.\n\n\n                  Radiation Exposure Compensation Act\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss with the \ndistinguished subcommittee chairman the need to amend the Radiation \nExposure Compensation Act, RECA.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. CRAPO. As my colleagues are aware, the National Academy of \nSciences, NAS, released a report on April 28 of this year calling on \nCongress to establish new scientific criteria for decisions about \nawarding Federal compensation to people who have developed specific \ndiseases, including certain cancers, as a result of exposure to \nradioactive fallout from U.S. nuclear weapons tests. I wholeheartedly \nagree with them.\n  When Congress passed RECA 15 years ago, an important first step was \ntaken to provide compassionate assistance to those directly affected by \nnuclear testing conducted by the United States. However, it soon became \nclear that a legislative remedy which was bound by geographic \nrestrictions, and not scientific evidence, was not sufficient to fully \nrectify the problem at hand. This was confirmed in 1999, when Senator \nHatch introduced his amendments to expand RECA and include affected \ncounties in Arizona.\n  Today, the NAS has determined that residents in counties and States \nfar from the original Nevada Test Site were not only exposed to \nradiation, but may even have been exposed to much higher levels than \nthose in currently eligible areas. In fact, there are areas in my \nnative Idaho that have demonstrably higher incidence of thyroid dosage \nof radiation than any other county currently covered by RECA. It seems \nunconscionable to me that people living in these areas are not \ncurrently eligible for compensation.\n  Those affected are not asking for special treatment, they are simply \nasking for fairness. As R. Julian Preston, director of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's Environmental Carcinogenesis \nDivision, stated, ``To be equitable, any compensation program needs to \nbe based on scientific criteria and similar cases must be treated \nalike. The current geographic limitations are not based on the latest \nscience.''\n  To rectify this inequity, I think it is of utmost importance that \nCongress take up my legislation, S. 998 to include the State of Idaho \nas an affected area under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act.\n  Additionally, it is incumbent upon Congress to address the long-term \nchallenges faced by the RECA program. The NAS report makes several \nspecific recommendations, chief among them that Congress should \nestablish a new process for reviewing individual claims, based on \nprobability of causation, or ``assigned share,'' a method which is used \nin the courts and other radiation compensation programs. It also \nrecommends that the RECA program be expanded to include workers \ninvolved in uranium milling and ore transportation. I urge you to join \nme in implementing these suggestions of the NAS into legislation.\n\n[[Page S11994]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I appreciate the Senator's interest in this issue and \nrecognize that he has legislation pending in Congress to address the \nneeds of affected Idahoans. I say to my friend and colleague that I \nwill work with him to identify necessary improvements and to respond to \nfindings contained in the NAS report. I also urge the administration to \nwork diligently to help those still in need.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank the distinguished chairman.\n\n\n                               THIMEROSAL\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Addressing my distinguished colleagues from \nPennsylvania and Iowa, the subcommittee Chairman and ranking member, I \nwanted to talk with you about the need to study further the issue of \nthimerosal in vaccines and whether there is any association with autism \nand other autism spectrum disorders. As you know, autism is a neuro-\ndevelopmental disorder characterized by severe impairments in language \ndevelopment and socialization. The American Academy of Pediatrics, AAP, \nsays that currently 1 in 166 children has autism or an autism spectrum \ndisorder. Some in the autism community attribute this rise to changes \nin the vaccine schedule which began in 1990. Three of the four vaccines \nbetween 1990 and 2000 given to American children at the 2,4, and 6 \nmonth doctor visit contained thimerosal which is a vaccine preservative \nthat is 50 percent mercury by weight. Mercury of course is a known \nneurotoxin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am aware of this issue.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am aware of this issue too. I note that thimerosal has \nbeen out of childhood vaccines since 2001. I understand that the AAP \ndoesn't think there is a link between thimerosal and autism and that an \nInstitute of Medicine, IOM, report indicated that the committee didn't \nbelieve thimerosal caused autism. Of course, this does not mean there \nisn't an association. We should recognize that few diseases have direct \ncauses attributed to them.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I believe that we must at least consider an \nassociation between thimerosal exposure and autism. I understand the \nrate of autism has risen perhaps 800 percent since 1990 and although \nthere could be a number of reasons including better diagnostics, this \ncoincided with an increased exposure to thimerosal in vaccines, which \nagain is 50 percent mercury by weight.\n  I have talked to Director Gerberding at the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, CDC, which is our Nation's premier public \nhealth organization. She said that there is room for further study. I \nnote that thimerosal is still in our influenza vaccine. And we want \npeople to get that vaccine.\n  Mr. HARKIN. What does the Senator propose?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Under the Senator's distinguished leadership, the \ncommittee has increased the NIH budget to 29.4 billion dollars, an \nincrease of over $1 billion from last year. I applaud those efforts. \nAccordingly, under his leadership the budget of the National Institute \nof Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, has increased from $644 to \n$667 million.\n  I would ask that the NIEHS lend its expertise in heavy metal toxicity \nand to work in cooperation with the CDC to study, using respected \nexpert independent researchers, whether there is any association \nbetween thimerosal and autism.\n  I note that we now have a Vaccine Safety Datalink, VSD, a \ncomputerized CDC database that has followed 7 million vaccinated \nchildren in 7 managed care organizations throughout the United States \nfrom 1990 on to see if they develop diseases of any type, including \nneuro-developmental disorders. Some experts suggest this database could \nprovide answers regarding the thimerosal-autism link. The Institute of \nMedicine, IOM, regards the VSD as a unique data base with which the \npublic should become familiar. I would expect that the VSD would be \nused in further studies.\n  My staff and I have talked with two former NIEHS directors. They \nsupport additional effort to study the association between thimerosal \nand autism. They assure me that NIEHS would be able to administer a \ngrant for carefully selected expert independent researchers to join in \nthe study of the VSD with the CDC. And because transparency of research \nhas been an issue in this debate, NIEHS cooperating with CDC would be \nable to put together a panel of toxicologists, doctors, expert \nrepresentatives from the autism community, and public health advocates \nto advise the study. They did this with the NIEHS' Breast Cancer \nResearch Centers Program. That is, they involved the affected \ncommunity.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree we should make an additional effort to resolve \nthis issue.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I also agree we need to make progress through a \nstudy on this issue. It certainly is not going away.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. If this issue is resolved it will be because all sides \nare comfortable with the science and epidemiology of thimerosal and \nautism. The science and epidemiology of thimerosal and autism is not \nclear up to this point.\n  Can I have assurance that the chairman and ranking member will work \nto insert report language in conference that urges NIEHS to fund \ncollaborative studies on the VSD between outside researchers and the \nCDC?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will work hard to make this happen.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I too will work hard to make this happen since this is an \nissue important to the Senator and the Nation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senators.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of final passage of \nthe Senate version of the fiscal year 2006 Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education appropriations bill. This legislation is an \nimprovement over the House-passed bill and over the President's request \nin many areas. However, it still vastly underfunds a number of crucial \nprograms. I commend the chairman and the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee for their work to produce this bill under tight fiscal \nconstraints. However, we can and should do better for the many \nAmericans who depend on the programs that are funded by this important \nappropriations bill.\n  I am pleased that the Senate adopted two amendments I worked on. One \nwas an amendment I cosponsored that the Senator from Maine, Ms. \nCollins, offered, to provide much-needed funding to improve access to \ndental health in rural and underserved areas, and the other was an \namendment I offered to increase public access to automatic external \ndefibrillators in schools. I have worked with my colleague from Maine, \nMs. Collins, for a number of years to secure funding for these \nimportant programs, and I hope to see these provisions carry through to \nthe conference report.\n  I regret that the Senate missed a number of opportunities to improve \nthis bill, including by rejecting amendments that would have increased \nfunding for a number of elementary and secondary education programs, \nincluding title I, after-school programs, and special education. Year \nafter year, Congress and the President fail to provide the promised \nfunding for these and other education programs as local school \ndistricts continue to struggle to make ends meet under shrinking State \nand local education budgets. The President's budget requests for each \nof the fiscal years since the No Child Left Behind Act was enacted have \nfallen far short of what was authorized by this law. And while Congress \nhas improved upon these budget requests and provided funding for a \nnumber of the programs that the President proposed to cut, NCLB \nprograms are still funded at far less than their authorized levels.\n  Yet despite our broken promises to these school districts, we still \nrequire them to comply with a variety of Federal mandates. And during \nthis school year, the stakes have been raised even further because the \n2005-2006 school year is the first under which schools are required to \nimplement the NCLB mandate to test students in grades three through \neight in reading and math. It is past time that we hold up our end of \nthe equation and give States and school districts the resources they \nneed to ensure that every child has the opportunity to succeed.\n  With regard to higher education, I was proud to support the amendment \noffered by Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts that would have increased \nthe Pell Grant maximum by $200 to $4,250 per year. This would have been \na good down payment on the ultimate\n\n[[Page S11995]]\n\ngoal of increasing the maximum to $9,000 by the 2010-2011 school year, \nas I proposed with Senator Collins earlier this year. While Senator \nKennedy's amendment was not successful, I will continue to work toward \nthis goal of increasing grant aid and reducing the burden of debt to \nkeep the doors of higher education open to as many Americans as \npossible.\n  While funding for other higher education programs were not as \ngenerous as I would have hoped, I was encouraged that the \nAppropriations Committee rejected the harmful cuts proposed in the \nPresident's budget. The President had proposed eliminating or cutting \nimportant programs that prepare disadvantaged students for college, \nsupport their successful completion of college, and provide financial \nassistance to help them afford higher education, such as the Leveraging \nEducational Assistance Partnership, LEAP, program; TRIO programs; the \nGaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, GEAR \nUP; the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education program; and \nPerkins loans. I consistently opposed these reductions during both the \nbudget and appropriations processes, and I am pleased that this bill \npreserves funding for all of these programs.\n  Another reservation I have about this bill is its failure to \nadequately provide a much needed increase in funding for the Low Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP--an increase that would simply \nbring the funding level up to the fully authorized amount. Despite \npredictions that home energy costs this winter will increase between 30 \nand almost 70 percent, for the third time in a month, the Senate failed \nto help working families and seniors afford skyrocketing home energy \ncosts when it defeated Senator Reed's efforts to increase LIHEAP \nfunding. The lack of higher LIHEAP funding is greatly troubling and I \nwill continue pursuing opportunities to help people in Wisconsin and \nacross the country receive the assistance they need to stay safe and \nwarm this winter.\n  While this bill is far from perfect, I will support it, and I very \nmuch hope that the final version of this bill will provide adequate \nfunding for the many important programs contained in it.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, today the Senate accepted two modified \namendments that I authored.\n  Amendment 2230, as modified, will reduce the amount appropriated for \ntravel, conference programs and related expenses at the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, HHS, by $15 million. Currently $68 million \nis available for these activities.\n  The $15 million saved by this revised amendment would ensure \nsufficient funding for travel and conference expenses that may be \nnecessary while recognizing that the current amount spent on these \nactivities by HHS is excessive and can be reduced.\n  In 2005 alone, HHS spent $68.5 million on conferences. This is a 50 \npercent increase in conference spending during a 5-year period. At a \ntime when our Nation is fighting a global war against terrorism, \nrecovering from the most expensive natural disaster in our history, and \nfacing an ever growing debt that now surpasses $8 trillion, we must be \nmore frugal with the taxpayers' dollars we have been entrusted and \nprioritize how they are spent.\n  This amendment ensures that a greater amount of Federal health \ndollars will actually be spent on health care, which should be the goal \nof HHS.\n  In the context of the $2.5 trillion Federal budget, $15 million may \nnot seem like much until you put it into a real world perspective.\n  According to the American Institute of Preventative Medicine, the \naverage doctor visit costs $55. The $15 million saved by this amendment \ncould be made available to pay for nearly 273,000 doctors visits in the \nnext year.\n  The 2004 Census Bureau report on Income, Poverty, and Health \nInsurance in the United States shows that 45 million Americans are \nwithout health insurance.\n  The annual premium that a health insurer charges an employer for a \nhealth plan covering a family of four averaged $9,950 in 2004. For \nsingle coverage is $3,695 annual average premium.\n  The $15 million saved by this amendment could provide 1,500 American \nfamilies of four or 4,060 single Americans with health insurance for a \nyear.\n  HHS spends significantly more on conferences than any other Federal \ndepartment. In fact, the total spent on conferences by HHS in 2005 is \ncomparable to the amount spent by the Energy Department, Education \nDepartment, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Housing and \nUrban Development, Labor Department and Transportation Department \ncombined.\n  In 2002, HHS spent $3.6 million on a single conference, the \nInternational AIDS Conference, held in Barcelona, Spain, to which 236 \nHHS employees traveled to attend. Then-Secretary Tommy Thompson was \namong the HHS employees who traveled across the globe for this \nconference and was scheduled to speak. Yet he was prevented from doing \nso by activists that turned what was intended to be a scientific \ngathering into a political statement.\n  Members of Congress rightfully were outraged that the Secretary was \ntreated so rudely at a conference that cost the U.S. taxpayer millions \nof dollars.\n  In a May, 2003, letter to members of Congress, Secretary Thompson \nreassured that HHS ``will work to further reduce our costs associated \nwith that event, while continuing to assure essential scientific \npersonnel can attend this meeting.'' He went on to note that ``the \nDepartment is currently revising the HHS travel manual, which will \nformalize international and domestic travel policies to ensure frugal \nuse of taxpayer money. My staff is taking unprecedented steps to ensure \nAmerican taxpayers will no longer be asked to foot the bill for \nwasteful HHS spending, including in the area of travel. . . . Every \ntrip proposal is . . . evaluated on an individual basis by a member of \nmy staff to guarantee that taxpayer money is not wasted.''\n  Despite this pledge, HHS has continued to spend more and more on \nconferences and to send hundreds of employees to participate in the \nsame conferences.\n  In 2004, HHS sent 100 or more employees to at least 59 conferences, \nincluding 1,036 to a conference in Orlando, Florida.\n  Just this past August, HHS was listed as a primary sponsor of the \n2005 conference of the Harm Reduction Project, an organization that \nsupports tacit legalization of drugs. Among the sessions at this \nfederally supported conference was ``We Don't Need a `War' on \nMethamphetamine'' and the discussion groups include ``Tweaking Tips for \nParty Boys.'' ``Tweaking'' is the most dangerous stage of meth abuse. A \ntweaker is a meth addict who probably has not slept in days, or weeks, \nand is irritable and paranoid.\n  HHS officials later denied ``sponsoring'' the conference, although \nthe Department provided taxpayer dollars for it and sent six employees \nto participate.\n  As a practicing physician, I believe that Federal funds expended to \nsupport this conference would have been far better spent providing \ntreatment to those suffering from addiction.\n  This is just one example of taxpayer dollars that have been misspent \non conferences.\n  The bottom line remains that at a time when important health care \nprograms are faced with financial difficulties, we do not have the \nluxury for excessive spending on conferences. While Congress is trying \nto control the growth of spending on important health programs like \nMedicaid and Medicare, we should first impose restraints on \nnonessential spending at HHS including conferences.\n  Conferences may provide interesting opportunities for bureaucrats and \nothers to network and exchange information in person, but they do not \nmake people well or provide life saving health care.\n  Furthermore, in the modern telecommunications era, it is unnecessary \nto spend time and resources to finance so many conferences. \nTeleconferences and video conferencing, for example, can save money \nwhile allowing the same type of interaction and information sharing at \na mere fraction of the cost.\n  The second amendment, No. 2336 as modified, directs the Secretary of \nHHS and the Secretary of Education to estimate improper payments as \nrequired by the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 and report to \nCongress on specific actions taken to estimate improper payments within \n60 days of this bill being signed into law.\n\n[[Page S11996]]\n\n  The Improper Payment Information Act was enacted in November 2002 for \nthe purpose of finding and eliminating payments that should not have \nbeen made, or were made for incorrect amounts, by government agencies.\n  This law requires that all agencies, at the very least, perform a \nrisk assessment of all programs and activities to determine whether or \nnot a program is at risk of making ``significant'' improper payments.\n  ``Significant'' as defined by the Office of Management and Budget \nmeans at least 2.5 percent of all payments made are improper, and the \nabsolute dollar figure associated with that 2.5 percent or more, totals \nat least $10 million.\n  Federal programs and activities deemed to be at ``significant'' risk \nof making improper payments their respective agencies are required \nunder the Improper Payments Information Act to first, develop a \nstatistically valid estimate of improper payments; and second, develop \na corrective action plan for all programs where the improper payment \nestimate exceeds $10 million annually. This corrective action plan must \nalso contain annual targets for reducing improper payment levels.\n  At the end of each fiscal year, agencies are to report the results of \nthe Improper Payments Information Act activities in their Performance \nand Accountability Report PAR; and submit them to Congress. The \nImproper Payments Information Act exempts no agency from compliance.\n  Improper payments--which include inadvertent, fraudulent, and \nirresponsible payments--are costing the taxpayers at the very least, \nover $45 billion each year. Even worse, this $45 billion represents \nonly 17 of 70 agencies that are currently reporting improper payment \ninformation as required under law.\n  The Medicare program, which is already reporting, makes up nearly \nhalf--$21.7 billion--of the government's $45.4 billion reported \nimproper payments for fiscal year 2004.\n  The magnitude of the Government's improper payment problem is not yet \nknown because some of the largest programs are not reporting, as \nrequired by law.\n  Medicaid, with outlays that exceed $175 billion annually, is one of \nthe programs that is not reporting. The Medicaid program has been \nrequired to report improper payments under the Office of Management and \nBudgets, OMB, A-11 Circular requirements since 2001; and under the \nImproper Payments Information Act since 2002, yet it still has made no \nestimate of its improper payments.\n  In its November 2002 Performance and Accountability Report, Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that it would be able to \nreport improper payments for the Medicaid program by 2006; however, \nthey have pushed that date back to 2008--six years after the date by \nwhich they were to have begun reporting improper payments.\n  Similarly, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF, program \nhas not even been able to estimate when it will be able to report \nimproper payments for a law that has existed since 2002.\n  TANF spent over $17 billion in fiscal year 2005 ($18.6 in outlays).\n  Foster Care spent $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2005.\n  State Children's Insurance Program spent $5.129 billion in fiscal \nyear 2005.\n  Child Care Development Fund spent $4.9 billion in fiscal year 2005.\n  Title I, within the Department of Education, spent $22.916 billion in \nfiscal year 2005, fiscal year 2005 outlays: $21.18 billion.\n  This amendment does not debate the merits of any of these programs, \nit simply demands compliance with transparency and accountability \nmeasurements for expenditures already in existing law.\n  After all, eliminating improper payments ensures more funds actually \nreach those who are intended to benefit from these programs while \nprotecting the taxpayer. However, we must first understand the \nmagnitude and source of the problem to correct it. We can only do this \nif all agencies are monitoring and reporting their improper payment \ninformation.\n  Together these amendments make small, yet important steps, towards \nmaking federal agencies more fiscally responsible and accountable.\n  I thank Chairman Specter for accepting these amendments and his \ncommitment to fight for inclusion of these provisions in conference \nwith the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my extreme \ndisappointment at the acceptance of amendment 2315 to the Labor and HHS \nAppropriation yesterday. My disappointment stems from the fact that I \nobjected to considering amendment 2315 both verbally and by letter. And \nmy objection was ignored.\n  Senator Specter, the manager of the bill, acknowledged the mistake \nand promised to respect the Finance Committee's jurisdiction. However, \na Member on the other side refused to allow the mistake to be \nrectified, an unfortunate and unfair action.\n  For the past several Congresses, I attempted to work with the \nappropriators and other Senators to ensure that they do not encroach \nupon the jurisdiction of the Finance committee.\n  Unfortunately, the practice continues as it did yesterday.\n  These provisions are not without consequence. They are often written \nwithout clear knowledge of all the relevant facts. As a result, \nproblems often occur as they are implemented.\n  I really appreciate the fact that Senator Specter is willing to work \nwith me on this issue and I fully expect that the provision will be \ntaken out during conference.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, yesterday, a majority of Senators, 54 in \nfact, voted for an increase in funding for the Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, or LIHEAP, to bring the funding to the authorized \nlevel of $5.1 billion we approved in the 2005 Energy bill. But because \nit was a procedural vote requiring 60 votes, this very important \namendment failed.\n  I want to thank my colleagues who voted with me as the days are \nrelentlessly marching toward winter . . . the clock is ticking as the \nthermometer edges ever downward . . . snow and cold have already come \nto my State or Maine, raising the stakes for those who may have to \nchoose between heating their homes and the other necessities of life. \nIt would be unconscionable for Congress to adjourn for the year without \nproviding critical, additional assistance for LIHEAP at a time of \nskyrocketing fuel because of the disruption of a vast amount of our \nenergy infrastructure caused by disastrous hurricanes in the Gulf. I \nwill continue to work with the White House to secure funding in the \nnext supplemental appropriations bill.\n  There should be no mistake--this is an emergency and a crisis we know \nis coming, and it would be an abrogation of our responsibility to stand \nby and allow it to occur. It does not take a crystal ball to predict \nthe dire consequences when home heating oil in Maine is $2.52 per \ngallon, up 59 cents from a year ago . . . and kerosene prices average \n$2.95 a gallon, 75 cents higher than this time last year. Some \nprojections have a gallon of heating oil reaching $3.00! And we are now \ninformed that even rolling blackouts on very cold days this winter may \nbe a possibility because of a high demand for electricity.\n  So, understandably, we are already hearing the mounting concern--\n``how will I pay for home heating oil when it's 30 percent more than \nlast year, and I struggled to make ends meet then?'' ``How will I \nafford to pay half again as much for natural gas?'' People need to know \nnow that they can count on us for assistance.\n  This is a necessity of life--so much so that 73 percent of households \nin a recent survey reported they would cut back on, and even go \nwithout, other necessities such as food, prescription drugs, and \nmortgage and rent payments. Churches, food pantries, local service \norganizations--they are all hearing the cry, and the leaves have barely \nfallen from the trees. The fact is, countless Americans, many on fixed \nincomes, don't have room in their budget for this sudden surge in home \nheating oil and natural gas prices but, surely, in looking at our \nnational priorities, we can find room in our budget to help Americans \nstay warm this winter.\n  Because of the supply disruptions caused by the hurricanes at a time \nwhen prices were already spiraling up, prices have been driven even \nhigher\n\n[[Page S11997]]\n\nand are directly affecting low income Mainers and how they will be able \nto pay for their home heating oil, natural gas, propane and kerosene \nthis winter. A recent Wall Street Journal quoted Jo-Ann Choate, who \nheads up Maine's LIHEAP program. Ms. Choate said, ``This year we've got \na very good chance of running out.''\n  Mr. President, 84 percent of the applicants for the LIHEAP program in \nmy State use oil heat. Over 46,000 applied for and received State \nLIHEAP funds last winter. Each household received $480, which covered \nthe cost of 275 gallons of heating oil. The problem this winter is that \nthe same $480 will buy only 172 gallons, which a household will use up \nin the first 3 to 4 weeks. What will these people do to stay warm for \nthe 4 or 5 months left of winter? The water pipes will freeze and then \nbreak, damaging homes. People will start using their stoves to get \nheat. The Mortgage Bankers Association e1ects that the steep energy \ncosts could increase the number of missed payments and lost homes \nbeginning later this winter. My State is expecting at least 48,000 \napplicants this winter season, so there will be less money distributed \nto each household unless we can obtain higher funding for the LIHEAP \nprogram.\n  Ms. Choate says that Maine plans to focus on the elderly, disabled, \nand families with small children, and is studying how to move others to \nheated shelters. This is why our efforts are so very important. And it \nisn't just Maine, it is going to happen in all of the Nation's cold \nweather States. Quite simply, without increased funding, we are forcing \nthe managers of State LIHEAP programs to make a Solomon's choice.\n  The Federal Department of Energy has predicted that homeowners who \nuse oil for heat and propane will spend 30 percent more this year than \nlast, and natural gas users will spend 48 percent more. According to \nthe National Energy Assistance Directors Association, heating costs for \nthe average family using heating oil are projected to hit $1,666 for \nthe upcoming winter. This represents an increase of $403 over last \nwinter's prices and $714 over the winter heating season of 2003-2004.\n  For families using natural gas, prices are projected to hit $1,568, \nwhich is an increase of $611 over last year's price and $643 over 2003-\n2004. This is the largest increase in home heating prices in over 30 \nyears. This is why passing our amendment was so very important.\n  Congress recently passed an Energy bill which is now law. In that \nbill, we authorized $5.1 billion for the LIHEAP program. My goal is to \nsee that this is totally funded. We simply have to show that we meant \nwhat we asked for--and totally fund the LIHEAP program.\n  The facts are that LIHEAP is projected to help 5 million households \nnationwide this winter. But that's only about one-sixth of households \nacross the country that qualify for the assistance. So this is a \nperennial fight we wage even when prices aren't as high as today. And \nnow, that battle becomes all the more pivotal. The cold weather won't \nwait--and neither should we when it comes to helping citizens survive \nthrough the winter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Appropriations bill is the last of the regular fiscal year \n2006 appropriations bills to come before the Senate for consideration.\n  Last year, seven of the regular appropriations bills, including the \nLabor, Health and Human Services bill, were not debated individually by \nthis body but rather they were inserted into one large, unamendable \nomnibus package. As I have said on many occasions, the processing of \nregular appropriations bills in such a manner is not the way the Senate \nis supposed to operate. I am always very disappointed when the Senate \nresorts to appropriating by omnibus bills. We are the Senate. This is \nthe Senate. A deliberative body it is supposed to be.\n  Last year, the Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations bill was \nincluded in the omnibus package. This is a different year now. This \nyear, the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nAppropriations bill was fully debated here on the floor and amended as \na stand-alone bill. What a difference.\n  This bill has been on the floor all week, and Senators have enjoyed \ntheir right to debate and amend such important language.\n  I thank the distinguished manager of the bill, and the distinguished \nSenator who acts on this side of the aisle to help manage this bill, \nSenator Specter and the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Senator \nHarkin.\n  This is such a comprehensive bill. It covers a lot of programs and \nactivities of the Government--three Departments, and the Social \nSecurity Administration. When you include mandatory spending, this bill \nfunds nearly 25 percent of the Federal budget. This bill impacts every \ncitizen in this country in one way or another. Just think about it: \nlabor issues, health issues, human services issues that provides basic \nhumanitarian services for the neediest of our citizens, as well as \neducation issues.\n  As we complete our debate on the Labor, HHS, and Education \nAppropriations bill, I want to extend my appreciation to the \nsubcommittee chairman, Senator Specter, and the ranking member, Senator \nHarkin. They are a good team on this bill. They have been working \ntogether on this subcommittee for so long that they seem to sometimes \ncomplete each other's sentences. They hold numerous hearings throughout \nthe year. They gather knowledge from a wide array of experts throughout \nthe country. That is what they do. This subcommittee pours over the \ntestimony, over the reports, the studies, and other related data \nthroughout the year, and its recommendations are reflective of that \ncareful and thorough review.\n  I have never seen a chairman of a committee more fair than Senator \nSpecter has been. Every Senator who wanted to call up an amendment had \nan opportunity to do so. Senator Specter did not seek to cut off any \namendments. No. He was very fair, very considerate, very courteous. And \nlook what a wonderful job he and Senator Harkin have done on this \ncommittee. My thanks, my congratulations to both of them.\n  I also extend my thanks to their fine staff. Those staffers worked \nhard. I appreciate their dedicated service to the Appropriations \nCommittee and to the Senate.\n  I will take 1 minute, or maybe a little longer, to comment briefly \nabout the upcoming supplemental request which I understand the White \nHouse will be transmitting to the Congress tomorrow. This will be the \nthird disaster relief supplemental related to Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita. This request is expected to include $17 billion for various \nprograms and agencies on top of the $62 billion Congress has already \napproved.\n  In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the Congress \napproved both of the President's supplemental requests. In each case, \nCongress approved the bill within 1 day of receiving the request, with \nno debate and no amendment. Of course, disastrous emergency situations \nsuch as that which occurred in the gulf coast region require immediate \naction by the Congress. However, the White House has waited 7 weeks to \nsend up its third request. The White House should not assume that the \nCongress will simply rubberstamp their request.\n  I hope the Senate leadership will commit to the Senate that we will \nhave an opportunity to debate and amend the third disaster relief \nsupplemental bill. A $17 billion supplemental should not simply be \nshoved into an unamendable conference report. There should be an \nopportunity to debate such issues as whether low-income energy \nassistance should be provided to all States impacted by increased fuel \nprices, prices that continue to grow as a result of Hurricane Katrina. \nThe Senate should also have an opportunity to debate how the Katrina \nsupplemental will be paid for. I hope Senators will be afforded this \nopportunity.\n  I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, my very good \nfriend from the State of Mississippi, Thad Cochran. What a decent man, \nwhat a decent chairman he is. What a good job he has done this year \nprocessing these appropriations bills. All 11 of the fiscal year 2006 \nappropriations bills have been debated individually and separately by \nthe Senate. Why is this? This is due in large part to the steadfast \ndetermination of the chairman, Senator Cochran. He is a very determined \nman. He did not give up. He\n\n[[Page S11998]]\n\ndid not give in. He kept on pushing ahead.\n  That reminds me of two frogs that fell over the rim of the crock in \nwhich there was milk. The milk was in the crock. Two frogs fell off \ninto that. One immediately kicked a couple of times, turned over on his \nback with his belly up, gave up, that was all. That frog was gone. But \nthe other, what did it do? It began kicking, kicking, and he kicked and \nkicked and kicked until there was a little ball of butter. And he \nkicked a little more, and the ball grew bigger, larger. So the frog \nthen climbed upon the ball of butter and jumped out. It jumped out.\n  That goes to show that if you keep on kicking, you will churn the \nbutter. How about that?\n  Chairman Cochran didn't give up. He just kept on kicking, and he \nchurned the butter. He just kept on pushing forward.\n  That determination of his paid off. I congratulate Senator Cochran \nfor his success in getting all of the regular appropriations bills \nprocessed through to the floor, individually and separately.\n  So let me say it again.\n  What a job Chairman Cochran has done this year.\n  I also thank the joint leadership of the Senate, Senator Frist and \nSenator Reid, for working with Chairman Cochran and with me in \nscheduling the necessary floor time which enabled us to get on with \nthese bills and debate them.\n  Chairman Cochran has worked with the House Appropriations Committee \nchairman in determining a schedule for completion of all the \nconferences on our regular appropriations bills by November 18. I think \nthat is a realistic schedule. I am encouraged that we will be able to \nreach that goal.\n  While I am not pleased that the appropriations bills significantly \nunderfund critical domestic programs for education, for homeland \nsecurity, for health care, and for our crumbling infrastructure, I am \npleased that the Senate at least had the opportunity to fully debate \nthese issues.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator who sits in the Chair this evening, \npresiding over the Senate with a degree of dignity and aplomb that is \nso reminiscent of a day in June when the distinguished Senator's father \nsat in this Chamber also. I liked him. I like him, too.\n  So I say to the Senator from Rhode Island who presides over the \nSenate this evening, keep on doing good work, Excelsior, ever up. I \nthank the Senator. He is a good Presiding Officer. He is a good \nSenator. He used to be my neighbor. He is a good neighbor, too.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nCorzine), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), and the Senator from \nWest Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 94, nays 3, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 281 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--94\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Isakson\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--3\n\n     Conrad\n     Ensign\n     Inhofe\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Corzine\n     Inouye\n     Rockefeller\n  The bill (H.R. 3010), as amended, was passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I know the distinguished Senator Byrd \nwants to speak for a while. I want to take a couple of minutes again to \nthank the staff, both Senator Specter's staff and my staff. They have \nworked together. I know Senator Specter mentioned them earlier, but I \nwill mention them by name again because they should be mentioned: \nBettilou Taylor, Jim Sourwine, Sudip Parikh, Mark Laiseh, Lisa \nBernhardt, Candice Rogers, and Rachel Jones on the minority side. On \nthe majority side: Ellen Murray, Erik Fatemi, and Adrienne Hallett.\n  They do a wonderful job, and they have done so this year, putting \nthis bill together, I know staying up long nights and weekends, working \nthis out.\n  Someone once remarked that Senators were a constitutional impediment \nto the smooth functioning of staff. Our staffs function very smoothly. \nThey do a great job, and I hope we have not impeded them too much.\n  Last, I want, again, to pay my respects to our chairman, Senator \nSpecter, who has done a magnificent job of putting a lot of competing \ninterests together. This is a big bill. This covers the Department of \nLabor, the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of \nEducation, and a lot of independent agencies--the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health.\n  By the way, I especially want to thank Senator Specter for bringing \nus up on the National Institutes of Health by $1 billion more than what \nwas in the President's budget. I think we met our obligations there.\n  I say to my friend and my chairman, it has been an honor and \nprivilege to work with him all these years. We go back, I think, about \n15 years now, working together. I could not ask for a better chairman \nof this committee. I could not ask for a better working relationship. \nSenator Specter has always been open and aboveboard to make sure we all \nknow what is going on. It has been a real pleasure, a real joy to work \nwith Senator Specter. I thank him for that and look forward to many \nmore fruitful years of working together on issues that really matter.\n  Someone once said the Defense Appropriations Committee is the \ncommittee that defends America. The committee that funds Health and \nHuman Services and Education and Labor is the committee that defines \nAmerica. I happen to believe that this committee does define America, \ndefines who we are, and what we are about as a people.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. The Senator is right about that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Under the able chairmanship of the Senator from \nPennsylvania, we have defined, once again, that we are going to meet \nour obligations in those areas that make us a caring and compassionate \nand decent people. That is what is in this bill. Again, I thank Senator \nSpecter for his great leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I very much appreciate those very \ngenerous remarks by Senator Harkin, and I appreciate even more his \ncooperation and leadership on this important subcommittee, working with \nhealth and education, the two major capital assets of Americans, and \nlabor and related agencies. It is an important bill, and I think we \nhave crafted it about as well as you can, given the limitations of the \nresources.\n  There is a lot more I could say, but Senator Byrd is waiting to \nspeak, so I will just reference the appointment of conferees.\n\n[[Page S11999]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate insist on its amendments to \nH.R. 3010, request a conference with the House of Representatives on \nthe disagreeing votes thereon, and that the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the Presiding Officer appointed Mr. \nSpecter, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Craig, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \nStevens, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Inouye, \nMr. Reid, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Byrd \nconferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does the distinguished Senator from Michigan wish to speak?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, if I might ask, before my very \ndistinguished colleague and friend from West Virginia speaks, I wonder \nif I might simply make a statement for just a moment about a unanimous \nconsent request that I had intended to offer. I understand there will \nbe an objection to it, but with my colleague's consent, I appreciate \nhaving 2 minutes to be able to make a comment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator, if I \nmay, for up to 5 minutes, if she so desires, without losing my right to \nthe floor.\n\n\n                   Rosa Parks Federal Office Building\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to go on record this evening with \nmy great disappointment at not being able to bring up under unanimous \nconsent a version of the bill that would name a Federal office building \nin Detroit for Rosa Parks. This had originally been offered by my \ncolleague, Congresswoman Carolyn C. Kilpatrick of Detroit, a longtime \nfriend and colleague of Rosa Parks.\n  Originally, last evening, we passed my version of the bill along with \nan amendment, agreed to, of Senator Warner. This evening it is my \ndesire to pass the House version of that with Senator Warner's \namendment, the very same amendment that we have already passed last \nevening, but to place it into the House bill so we could then send it \nback to the House. It would be like the Senate bill that we passed.\n  To my understanding, there is an objection on the other side of the \naisle to doing that. If not, I would proceed to do that. It is the very \nsame thing we did last evening, but it would put it into the House \nbill.\n  My House colleague, who is the originator of the proposal on the \nFederal office building, would like very much to have us pass the House \nbill and have that be the bill that is sent on to the President. That \nis the bill that I was hoping we would pass here in the same form with \nthe Warner amendment that we passed last evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am not fully conversant with all of the \ndetails on the issues raised by the Senator from Michigan. I have been \nasked by staff to lodge an objection.\n  I was present yesterday when we took up that issue. I have not seen \nthe level of confusion in this Chamber in the 25 years I have been here \nthat was present when the Senator from Michigan asked unanimous \nconsent, the Senator from Virginia asked to add on, and then the \nSenator from New Mexico ultimately spoke about holds. It was utter \nconfusion in the midst of rollcall votes, trying to move this bill \nalong.\n  I respect the standing of the Senator from Michigan to make this \nunanimous consent request, but I suggest she defer it until next week \nwhen the Senators are on the floor who understand what the issues are. \nYou have jurisdiction on the Committee on Environment and Public Works, \nI believe, and Senator Inhofe and I were talking about it today. I do \nnot want to stop whatever the Senator from Michigan wants to \naccomplish, but the proper Senators ought to be here to address the \nissue.\n  I am the last Mohican around here for Republicans, although they \ncould have gotten the Chair, Senator Chafee, to raise an objection. The \nPresiding Officer could suggest the absence of a quorum and raise the \nobjection. In fact, I might just refer to him to raise the objection.\n  However, having said what I said, I do object, and it is my hope the \nSenator from Michigan will give notice to the Senators who are involved \nand know what is going on, give them notice and a chance to hear what \nyou have to say and then the matter can be resolved.\n  But I do object.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, if I might just respond to my \ndistinguished colleague, notice was given. That is how I know there is \nan objection. So I am not rising to make the unanimous consent request. \nI understand there is an objection on the other side of the aisle. I am \nsimply standing this evening to indicate my disappointment that we have \nnot been able to resolve this here and be able to, in fact, include \nSenator Warner's amendment and be able to send it back to the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Hopefully, we are going to be able to resolve it another way and be \nable to accomplish what we all wish to accomplish.\n  I support Senator Warner's desire and the gentleman he is wishing to \nhonor with the naming of a building. Also, certainly it is my goal and \nthe goal of my colleague in the House to be able, in fact, to pass a \nbill to send to the President, giving the great civil rights champion \nof our country and the world, Rosa Parks, the respect and honor she \ndeserves. It is our hope to have that done prior to her funeral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am somewhat troubled. Not more than 10 \nminutes ago, I say to my colleague, you sat right here and I sat right \nthere. We struck an understanding that tomorrow we would rejoin on the \nfloor to explain the situation. I said, by that time, as it was my \nunderstanding that the House would likely have acted upon the measure \nwhich was passed by the Senate last night, sponsored by the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan, who accepted my amendment. I am \nnot sure why we are here at this time discussing this matter. My \nunderstanding was very clearly we would take it up tomorrow morning. \nJust by chance I caught the screen when I walked back to my office.\n  Would you kindly advise the Senator from Virginia what took place in \nthe 10-minute interval since we left here?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I will be happy to. This has been a confusing \nsituation, I say through the Chair to the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia. After speaking with you, I spoke with the Congresswoman who \nwas concerned about which bill would be going to the President's desk. \nSo I was simply rising, not to offer a motion but just to express my \nconcern about the dilemma that we are in at the moment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, but we solved, basically, the procedure. \nWhat troubles me is that the Senate took considerable time last night \nto resolve this issue--in favor of the Senator from Michigan and in \nfavor of the Senator from Virginia.\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. There is a perfectly adequate bill sitting on the desk at \nthe House of Representatives. It can be passed in 5 minutes if not \nless.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time that the Senator from West Virginia \nhas allotted has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. If my distinguished colleague will kindly grant me a few \nmore minutes?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I repeat, there is a bill that has been acted upon \nunanimously by the Senate. It is at the House desk.\n  This morning was the first time I ever heard that the Congresswoman, \nin whose district this courthouse is, desires to have her bill--not \nyour bill. Is that my understanding?\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Why can't the Congressional Record of the debate, the \ntraditional report language that accompanies the bill, explain, give \nher full credit or whatever she desires? But to continually come back \nand forth and raise the specter that people are trying to interfere \nwith this important legislation in this Chamber, it seems to me, is not \nfair.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, if I might, in no way was this meant to \nshow disrespect for the Senator from Virginia. We have worked very \nproperly together. I was simply rising this evening to indicate that \nthe original way to resolve this by including the Senator's amendment \nin the House bill is not something that is acceptable to\n\n[[Page S12000]]\n\nother colleagues. That was the desire of the Congresswoman whose idea \nit was to name the building in her district. She feels very strongly \nabout this, and I was indicating that for the Record. I don't wish to \nhave more confusion.\n  I very much appreciate the Senator from West Virginia allowing me a \nmoment. But in no way was this meant to show disrespect for my \ncolleague. We have worked very well together.\n  Mr. WARNER. This is a matter that is being followed with great \ninterest because of the magnificent Rosa Parks, and the outpouring of \nempathy and sympathy, and so forth. I don't wish to have the \ninstitution of the Senate appear that it has not acted promptly. It did \nso last night. There is a perfectly legitimate bill at the House desk \nwhich could be passed in a matter of 5 minutes and be sent to the \nPresident for signature to honor both Mrs. Parks and Judge Bryant. In \nreport language the Senator from Michigan and the good Congresswoman \ncan solve it in any way they may wish as to allocate the credit.\n  I think to keep coming back to the Senate implying that we can't use \nthe bill this body passed yesterday evening is, in a way, diminishing \nthe previous action of this institution. It is my understanding that \ntomorrow the House of Representatives will take up and pass the Senator \nfrom Michigan's bill, as passed by the Senate, to name a federal \nbuilding in Michigan for Rosa Parks and name the new courthouse annex \nhere in Washington for Judge William Bryant.\n  I must tell you, I have been very patient about this matter. But I \nhope that we understand the agreement between the two bodies to proceed \nin this manner. It has been cleared by both the House and the Senate \nand, as such, is the appropriate course of action.\n  For the past three years I have been working with my colleagues, \nCongresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton and Senator Leahy to name the new \nannex to the Prettyman Courthouse here in Washington, DC for Judge \nWilliam Bryant. As I have stated numerous times before, there are rules \nin the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee that prohibit \nmoving through that Committee naming bills for individuals that are \nstill living. Prior to the current Chairman of the Committee, the rule \nwas waived in certain instances and I certainly feel that the case of \nJudge Bryant warrants such discretion. The Senate spoke yesterday that \nboth Rosa Parks and William Bryant are deserving of this great honor.\n  I wish to share with the Senate again the story of this distinguished \njurist, Judge William Bryant.\n  A product of Washington, DC public schools, William B. Bryant \ngraduated from Howard University in 1936, a classmate of Thurgood \nMarshall and Appellate Judge Spotswood Robinson. He graduated from \nHoward Law School first in his class and then, with no real \nopportunities for African-American attorneys in the District of \nColumbia, served as chief research assistant to Ralph Bunche, who later \nwon the Nobel Prize. From 1943 to 1947, he was in the Army and rose to \nthe rank of lieutenant colonel during World War II. He was a criminal \ndefense attorney, Assistant U.S. Attorney, the first African American \never to be an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Nation's Capital. I was \nprivileged to be in the U.S. Attorney's Office during some of his \ntenure there and worked with him. He was a teacher to me and many \nothers. He was appointed to the U.S. District Court in 1965. In 1977, \nhe was appointed the first African American to be chief judge of the \nU.S. District Court.\n  Now at the age of 94, Judge Bryant is serving as a Senior Judge on \nthe United States District Court for the District of Columbia. This \nman, like Rosa Parks, suffered from discriminatory practices and \npersevered, therefore breaking new ground for African-Americans to \ncome. When he first began trying cases as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in \n1951, the Bar Association of D.C. did not allow African-American \nmembers. William Bryant, while trying cases in District Court was \nunable to access the law library at the Courthouse like his white \ncolleagues. Despite the obstacles, William Bryant succeeded.\n  Over the years this man has been a fixture at that courthouse, first \ntrying cases, and for the past 40 years, hearing them as a judge. The \nD.C. Bar and his colleagues have unanimously endorsed the legislation I \noffer today as a tribute to this man's truly extraordinary life, \nlegendary career, and service to this nation's judicial system. I wish \nat this point to print into the Record a September 2004 article from \nthe Washington Post about Judge Bryant and our efforts to name this new \nannex in his honor:\n\n       A Lifetime of Faith in the Law; At 93, Senior Judge William \n     Bryant Still Wins Plaudits for Dedication to Justice, Carol \n     Leonnig, Washington Post Staff Writer--September 16, 2004\n       A few days after the new U.S. District Courthouse opened on \n     Constitution Avenue in the fall of 1952, Bill Bryant walked \n     in to start work as a recently hired federal prosecutor.\n       More than a half-century has passed, and Bryant's life \n     remains centered on that stately granite building in the \n     shadow of the U.S. Capitol. It's in those halls that he \n     became a groundbreaking criminal defense attorney, a federal \n     judge, and then the court's chief judge--the first African \n     American in that position.\n       Today, at the age of 93, U.S. District Court Senior Judge \n     William Bryant still drives himself to work at the courthouse \n     four days a week and pushes his walker to his courtroom.\n       At a recent birthday party for Bryant hosted by Vernon \n     Jordan, fellow Senior U.S. District Court Judge Louis \n     Oberdorfer remarked that there were ``only two people in the \n     world who really understood the Constitution'' and how it \n     touched the lives of real people.\n       ``That's Hugo Black and Bill Bryant,'' said Oberdorfer. He \n     had clerked for Justice Hugo L. Black, who retired as an \n     associate justice in 1971 after serving on the Supreme \n     Court for 34 years.\n       To honor Bryant's life's work, his fellow judges this past \n     spring unanimously recommended that a nearly completed \n     courthouse annex be named for him. The $110 million, 351,000-\n     square-foot addition will add nine state-of-the-art \n     courtrooms and judges' offices to the courthouse and is \n     designed to meet the court's expansion needs for the next 30 \n     years. It is slated to open next spring.\n       In urging that the building be named for Bryant, his \n     supporters cite his devotion to the Constitution and his \n     belief that the law will produce a just result.\n       During a rare interview in his sixth-floor office in the \n     federal courthouse, Bryant reached out for a pocket version \n     of the Constitution covered in torn green plastic lying on \n     the top of his desk. Holding it aloft in his right hand, he \n     told stories of his struggling former clients and made legal \n     phrases--``due process'' and ``equal protection''--seem like \n     life-saving staples.\n       Though he needs his law clerk's arm to get up the steps to \n     the bench, he is a fairly busy senior jurist. He handled more \n     criminal trials than any other senior judge last year and \n     still surprises new lawyers with his sharp retorts.\n       ``I feel like I'm part of the woodwork,'' Bryant said. ``I \n     have to think hard to think of a time when I wasn't in this \n     courthouse.''\n       He started down his career path inspired by a Howard \n     University law professor who believed that lawyers could make \n     a difference in that time of racial segregation and \n     discrimination. Bryant said he remains convinced today that \n     lawyers can stop injustice whenever it arises.\n       ``Without lawyers, this is just a piece of paper,'' Judge \n     Bryant said, gesturing with the well-worn Constitution. ``If \n     it weren't for lawyers, I'd still be three-fifths of a man. \n     If it weren't for lawyers, we'd still have signs directing \n     people this way and that, based on the color of their skin. \n     If it weren't for lawyers, you still wouldn't be able to \n     vote.\n       The most important professions are lawyer and teacher, in \n     my opinion,'' he said.\n       Some lawyers complain that Bryant is so rooted in his \n     criminal defense training that he shows some distrust of the \n     prosecution. And his practice of presiding over trials, but \n     asking other judges to sentence the people convicted, has \n     spurred some curiosity. He won't elaborate on the reason, but \n     his friends say he found the new federal sentencing \n     guidelines inflexible and harsh.\n       A 1993 study found Bryant was reversed 17 percent of the \n     time by appellate judges--the average reversal rate for the \n     trial court.\n       Chief Judge Thomas F. Hogan presented the proposal to name \n     the annex after Bryant to Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton and Sen. \n     Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) earlier this year, and they are now \n     trying to get Congress to approve the naming this fall. One \n     member, Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), has tried to block \n     it, with his staff pointing to a D.C. policy that buildings \n     not be named after living people.\n       Norton said numerous courts around the country have been \n     named in honor of living judges, and she said she looks \n     forward to meeting with Inhofe in person to convince him of \n     the wisdom of naming this building, designed by renowned \n     architect Michael Graves, after a barrier-breaking judge.\n       ``This is no ordinary naming,'' she said. ``This is a truly \n     great African American judge whose accomplishments are \n     singular. First African American assistant U.S. attorney. \n     First African American chief judge.''\n       E. Barrett Prettyman Jr., the son of the jurist for whom \n     the federal courthouse in\n\n[[Page S12001]]\n\n     Washington is named, also applauds the proposed annex naming. \n     He said his father ``admired Judge Bryant tremendously'' and \n     would have endorsed it, too.\n       ``Whenever it's discussed, people brighten right up and \n     think it's a great idea,'' said Prettyman, himself a former \n     president of the D.C. Bar Association. ``I'm sorry it's hit \n     this snag. . . . If you were going to have an exception, my \n     personal opinion is you could not have a better exception \n     than for Judge Bryant.''\n       William Benson Bryant is hailed as a true product of \n     Washington. Though he was born in a rural town in Alabama, he \n     moved to the city soon after turning 1. His grandfather, \n     fleeing a white lynch mob, relocated the extended family \n     here, including Bryant's father, a railroad porter, and his \n     mother, a housewife. They all made their first home on \n     Benning Road, which was then a dirt path hugging the eastern \n     shore of the Anacostia River.\n       Bryant attended D.C. public schools when the city's black \n     children were taught in separate and grossly substandard \n     facilities. Still he flourished, studying politics at the \n     city's premier black high school, Dunbar, then going on to \n     Howard University. While working at night as an elevator \n     operator, he studied law and met his future wife, Astaire. \n     They were married for 60 years, until her death in 1997.\n       He and his law classmates--the future civil rights \n     movement's intellectual warriors--worked at their dreams in \n     the basement office of their law professor, Charles Houston. \n     Houston promised the group, which included the future Supreme \n     Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and appellate judge \n     Spottswood Robinson, that lawyers armed with quick minds and \n     the Constitution could end segregated schools and unjust \n     convictions of innocent black men.\n       ``I kind of got fascinated by that,'' he said. ``We all \n     did.''\n       But when Bryant graduated first in his class from Howard's \n     law school, there were no jobs for a black lawyer. He became \n     a chief research assistant to Ralph Bunche, an African \n     American diplomat who later was awarded the Nobel Peace \n     Prize, on a landmark study of American race relations; he \n     then fought in World War II and was discharged from the Army \n     as a lieutenant colonel in 1947.\n       His first step was to take the bar exam, then hang out a \n     shingle as a criminal defense lawyer in 1948. His skills soon \n     drew the attention of prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's \n     Office, who liked him even though they kept losing cases to \n     him, and they recommended that their boss hire him. During a \n     job interview, Bryant made a request of George Fay, then the \n     U.S. attorney: ``Mr. Fay, if I cut the mustard in municipal \n     court, can I go over to the big court like the other guys?''\n       No black prosecutor had ever practiced in the federal \n     court--or ``big court,'' as it was called--but Fay agreed. \n     Bryant signed on in 1951 and was handling grand jury \n     indictments in the new federal courthouse the next year.\n       Bryant vividly recalls a case from that time involving an \n     apartment building caretaker who was on trial on charges of \n     raping the babysitter of one tenant's family.\n       ``I went for him as hard as I could,'' Bryant said, \n     squaring his shoulders. ``I didn't like him, and I didn't \n     like what he did to that girl.''\n       So the young prosecutor sought the death penalty, an option \n     then for first-degree murder and rape. He left the courtroom \n     after closing arguments ``feeling pretty good about my case'' \n     and awaited the jury's verdict in his third-floor court \n     office. But when a marshal later called out, ``Bryant, jury's \n     back,'' the judge said, ``I broke out in a sweat.''\n       He peeked anxiously into the court, saw the jury foreman \n     mouth only the word ``guilty.'' Bryant learned seconds later \n     that the jurors had spared the man's life.\n       ``I was so relieved,'' he said. ``When you're young, you \n     don't know anything. . . . Now I think, murder is murder, no \n     matter who is doing it.''\n       He left the prosecutor's office in 1954 and returned to \n     criminal defense with fellow classmate William Gardner in an \n     F Street law office later bulldozed for the MCI Center. They \n     were partners in Houston, Bryant and Gardner, a legendarily \n     powerful African American firm. Ten judges would eventually \n     come from its ranks.\n       In those days, Bryant chuckled, he didn't feel so powerful. \n     Judges who remembered his prosecution work kept appointing \n     him to represent defendants who had no money. That was before \n     the 1963 Supreme Court's Gideon decision requiring that \n     indigent defendants be represented by a lawyer--at public \n     expense, if necessary.\n       The judge would say, ``Mr. So and So, you say you don't \n     have any money to hire an attorney?'' Bryant recalled. \n     ``Well, then, the court appoints Mr. Bryant to represent \n     you.''\n       Some paid $25 or $50. Some paid nothing.\n       ``There were weeks we paid the help and split the little \n     bit left over for our groceries,'' he said.\n       Bill Schultz, Bryant's former law clerk, said Bryant took \n     the cases ``out of this sense of obligation to the court and \n     legal system. He was very aware of discrimination, and he \n     always fought for the criminal defendants.''\n       At the time, blacks were barred from the D.C. Bar \n     Association and its law library. Bryant went in anyway, and \n     the black librarian let him.\n       One of his pro bono clients was Andrew Roosevelt Mallory, a \n     19-year-old who confessed to a rape after an eight-hour \n     interrogation in a police station. Mallory was convicted and \n     sent to death row. Defending Mallory's rights, a case Bryant \n     took all the way to the Supreme Court in 1957, made him both \n     nervous and famous.\n       He said he fretted constantly about his client facing the \n     electric chair during the two years the case dragged on. \n     ``You talk about worried,'' he said. ``It's something I can't \n     forget.''\n       But the Supreme Court agreed with Bryant that a man accused \n     of a crime is entitled to be taken promptly before a \n     magistrate to hear the charges against him. The court \n     overturned Mallory's conviction and handed down a landmark \n     decision on defendants' rights.\n       U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman, a longtime fan of \n     Bryant's, said Bryant's legal talents are on display every \n     day in his courtroom, but lawyers are still taken aback by \n     his factual resolve and clear logic when hearing an audiotape \n     recording of his Supreme Court argument in the Mallory case.\n       ``He's clearly a terrific lawyer, but he's mostly a \n     terrific human being,'' Friedman said. ``He sees the best in \n     people, and he really cares about what happens to people.''\n       Bryant remembers that when President Lyndon B. Johnson \n     nominated him to be a judge, he felt elated, confident he had \n     earned his opportunity. But Bryant said a different feeling \n     came over him the day he donned the robes.\n       ``I was sworn in in the morning that day, and Oliver Gasch \n     was sworn in that afternoon,'' Bryant recalled. ``I told \n     Oliver, `You know, I've been a lawyer for many years, but \n     putting on this robe, I don't feel so sure. This is a serious \n     responsibility.' ''\n       Gasch smiled: ``Bill, I don't think it's going to be that \n     hard for you. You know right from wrong.''\n       Bryant oversaw some famous cases, and he freely shared his \n     thoughts when he thought something was wrong.\n       After presiding over the 1981 trial of Richard Kelly, a \n     Republican congressman caught on videotape taking money from \n     federal agents in a sting operation, Bryant complained that \n     the FBI had set an ``outrageous'' trap for the Florida \n     representative by stuffing cash in his pocket after he'd \n     refused the bribe several times. He set aside Kelly's \n     conviction.\n       ``The investigation . . . has an odor to it that is \n     absolutely repulsive,'' Bryant said then. ``It stinks.''\n       In handling the longest-running case in the court's \n     history, a 25-year-old case about inhumane and filthy \n     conditions in the D.C. jail, the judge chastised city leaders \n     in 1995. He said he had been listening to their broken \n     promises to fix the problems ``since the Big Dipper was a \n     thimble.''\n       In weighing the case of a group of black farmers with \n     similar discrimination complaints against the U.S. Department \n     of Agriculture in 2000, Bryant warned a government lawyer \n     that his argument against a class-action discrimination suit \n     wasn't working: ``Either you're dense or I'm dense,'' he \n     said.\n       Schultz said the judge simply trusted the combination of \n     facts and the law.\n       ``He always said, `Don't fight the facts,' '' Schultz said. \n     ``He thought most of the time the law would end up in the \n     right place.''\n       Bryant acknowledges it's hard sometimes to see lawyers \n     struggle to make their arguments when they have the law and \n     the facts on their side.\n       ``A judge has a stationary gun, and he's looking through \n     the sights,'' he said. ``Unless the lawyer brings the case \n     into the bull's-eye, the judge can't pull the trigger. Good \n     lawyers bring the case into the sights.''\n       Bryant said he was preceded by many great lawyers, which is \n     why the new plan to put his name on a piece of the courthouse \n     gives him conflicting feelings.\n       ``I was flattered, but I thought they shouldn't have done \n     it,'' Bryant said. ``There are so many people who were really \n     giants. I stand on their shoulders.''\n\n  I hope that henceforth there is senatorial courtesy--when we decide \nto proceed in a specific manner as we discussed, we would do it in the \nmorning, I relied on that, and was about to go handle another matter \nwhen I noticed that the Senator was on the floor. I am somewhat \nconcerned about that.\n  I wish to thank the Senator from Michigan for her courtesy in \ncombining these two tributes and look forward to the action of the \nHouse tomorrow. It is truly a wonderful opportunity for the Congress to \nhonor two American pioneers. Rosa Parks and Judge William Bryant both \ndeserve to be recognized for their lives and contributions our nation's \nheritage. I have no objection to this bill moving forward as amended \nand look forward with great pride to both buildings being named shortly \nfor these two pillars of the civil rights movement that brought so much \nto our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, thank you for the courtesy. I am sure we \nwill be able to move forward in a prompt way.\n  Mr. BYRD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns).

Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 757, the \nBreast Cancer and Environmental Research Act of 2005.\n  This month marks the 21st year of National Breast Cancer Awareness \nMonth, a campaign that provides a special opportunity to offer \neducation about the important association between early detection and \nsurvival. National Breast Cancer Awareness month also salutes the more \nthan 2,000,000 breast cancer survivors in the United States and the \nefforts of victims, volunteers, and professionals who combat breast \ncancer each day.\n  According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer is the \nleading cause of death among women between the ages of 40 and 55; and \none out of every eight women who live to the age of 85 will develop \nbreast cancer in her lifetime. But the disease is not limited by \ngender. In 2005, approximately 1,700 new cases of invasive breast \ncancer will be diagnosed among men in the United States. In my home \nState of Utah, as indicated by the Utah Cancer Registry, breast cancer \nhas the highest incidence rate of the ten leading cancer types. This \ndisease has an impact on nearly every American's life.\n  Breast cancer death rates have been dropping steadily since 1991; \nhowever, challenges still remain. The bottom line is that we still do \nnot know what causes this disease, or how to prevent it. Less than 30 \npercent of breast cancers are explained by known risk factors. There is \ngeneral belief within the scientific community that the environment \nplays a role in the development of breast cancer, but the extent of \nthat role has been less-examined.\n  Research has investigated the effect of isolated environmental \nfactors such as diet, pesticides, and electromagnetic fields; but, in \nmost cases, there has been no conclusive evidence. In-depth study of \nthese potential risks could provide invaluable information in \nunderstanding the causes of breast cancer, and could lead to new \nprevention strategies. Clearly, more research needs to be done to \ndetermine the impact of environmental factors on breast cancer.\n  Along with Senators Chafee, Reid, Clinton, and Talent, I have \nintroduced S. 757, the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act of \n2005, to address this palpable need for research. Specifically, the \nbill would authorize the National Institute of Environmental Health \nSciences, NIEHS, to award grants for the development and operation of \nup to eight centers for the purpose of conducting research on \nenvironmental factors that may be related to breast cancer. This \nlegislation is modeled after the highly successful and promising \nDepartment of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program, DOD BCRP, which \noperates under a competitive, peer-reviewed grant-making process that \ninvolves consumers.\n  Isolated studies have been conducted to look at suspected \nenvironmental links to breast cancer; but these studies are only a \nsmall step toward the broad strategic research that is required. What \nis needed is a collaborative, comprehensive, nationally focused \nstrategy to address this oversight, a strategy like the one outlined in \nS. 757.\n  As this year's National Breast Cancer Awareness Month comes to a \nclose, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill. This \nFederal commitment is critical for the overall, national strategy and \nthe long-term investments required to discover the environmental causes \nof breast cancer so that we can prevent it, treat it more effectively, \nand, ultimately, cure it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/27/senate-section/article/S12002-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate passed S. Res. 282, \nwhich recognizes October as Domestic Violence Awareness Month and \nestablishes a sense of the Senate that the Congress should raise \nawareness of domestic violence in the United States and its impact on \nour Nation's families. I am thankful to the 32 co-sponsors of this \nresolution and to my colleagues for its unanimous passage.\n  We have made substantial progress in combating domestic violence \nsince 1994 when we passed the Violence Against Women Act. Since the \nAct's passage, domestic violence has dropped by almost 50 percent. \nIncidents of rape are down by 60 percent. The number of women killed by \nan abusive husband or boyfriend is down by 22 percent and more than \nhalf of all rape victims are stepping forward to report the crime.\n  Despite this record of success, we still have so much more to do. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, more than three women are \nmurdered by their husbands or boyfriends every day. More than 2.5 \nmillion women are victims of violence each year and nearly one in three \nwomen experiences at least one physical assault by a partner during \nadulthood. Reports also indicate that up to ten million children \nexperience domestic violence in their homes each year, and nearly \n8,800,000 children in the United States witness domestic violence each \nyear.\n  This is unacceptable. The impact this has on our Nation's families \nand on the fabric of our society as a whole is clear. What is lesser \nknown is the impact that domestic violence has on our Nation's \npocketbook. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently \nfound that violence against women costs our country in excess of $5.8 \nbillion each year; $4.1 billion of this is spent on direct medical and \nmental health care services. Since 1994, we have invested $15.50 per \nwoman to implement the Violence Against Women Act, but it is estimated \nthat this investment has saved $159 per woman, with a net overall \nsavings of $14.8 billion. I bring this up to remind my colleagues that \neven in this time of budget deficits, investing in programs to halt \ndomestic violence is not only the right thing to do, but it ultimately \nsaves money.\n  It is fitting that this year's National Domestic Violence Awareness \nMonth is the month that the Senate passed the Violence Against Women \nAct of 2005. This bill will reauthorize critical components of the \noriginal act, and it will establish further protections for battered \nimmigrants and victims of human trafficking in order to additionally \ncombat domestic violence and sexual assault. The legislation takes the \ncritical next steps to helping victims become safe, secure, and self-\nsufficient. I would like to point out that this bill had 57 co-sponsors \nand passed unanimously. This is in stark contrast to the original Act, \nwhich took many, many years to get passed. We have changed the paradigm \non this issue and we have come a long way. But, we need to do more. The \nViolence Against Women Act of 2005 will help do this, and I look \nforward to the House-Senate conference on this bill and getting the \nbill passed into law.\n  In addition to the work that we are doing in the Senate, National \nDomestic Violence Awareness Month gives us a chance to acknowledge the \nhard work of so many individuals and groups that have tackled this \nissue head-on. These advocates talk the talk and they walk the walk. \nThey help ensure a better life for so many battered women and children, \nand they remind Congress what is at stake and what remains to be done. \nWe all owe a debt of gratitude to the advocates, lawyers, service \nproviders, judges, police, nurses, shelter directors, and the many \nothers who have dedicated their lives to this cause.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for acting on this important resolution, \nand I look forward to working with them in the coming months and years \nto address the problem of domestic violence in our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/27/senate-section/article/S12002-4", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12002-S12003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate\n\n[[Page S12003]]\n\ncrimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate \ncrimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes \nlaw, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our \nsociety. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight \na separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On July, 17, 2004, a 32-year-old gay man left a local Austin, TX, bar \nwith two men, and walked home. The two men, Donald Bockman and Darren \nGay, returned to the victim's home later that evening where they \nproceed to beat him and sexually assault him. Police say the two men \ndragged, tied-up, beat, cut, then sexually assaulted the victim. \nAccording to police, this attack was motivated by the victim's sexual \norientation.\n  I believe that our Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nin all circumstances, from threats to them at home. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a major step forward in achieving that \ngoal. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current \nlaw, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/27/senate-section/article/S12003-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     YOUNG PEOPLE AND GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last Thursday, in the midst of National \nSafe Schools Week, a student was nearly shot to death inside a Michigan \nhigh school. This tragic incident further underscores the need to do \nmore to combat youth violence, especially gun violence.\n  According to published newspaper reports of the shooting, around noon \nlast Thursday, a tenth grade student fired as many as three shots at \nanother student in a crowded high school hallway. The 15-year-old \nvictim was struck once in the chest by a .380 caliber bullet, which \nmissed his heart by less than an inch. Fortunately, he is expected to \nlive.\n  The suspect, who is also 15 years old, allegedly used a stolen .380 \ncaliber pistol in the shooting and now faces life in prison after being \ncharged as an adult. Reportedly, the suspect also has a previous \nconviction involving a firearm violation. The shooting last Thursday \ncame less than a month after two other students were injured in a \ndrive-by shooting outside the same high school. Unfortunately, youth \ngun violence continues to threaten communities, destroy families, and \nchange the lives of too many young people forever.\n  Only a day before last Thursday's shooting, thousands of young people \nacross the country observed a Day of National Concern About Young \nPeople and Gun Violence, which was designed to empower children and \nteenagers to do what they can to eliminate gun violence in their \ncommunities. In many communities, students were given the opportunity \nto sign a voluntary pledge against gun violence. Since the first Day of \nNational Concern About Young People and Gun Violence in 1996, more than \n7 million students have signed the pledge. Here is what the pledge \nsays:\n\n       I will never bring a gun to school; I will never use a gun \n     to settle a dispute; I will use my influence with my friends \n     to keep them from using guns to settle disputes. My \n     individual choices and actions, when multiplied by those of \n     young people throughout the country, will make a difference. \n     Together, by honoring this pledge, we can reverse the \n     violence and grow up in safety.\n\n  I applaud the organizers and students who participated in this year's \nDay of National Concern About Young People and Gun Violence for their \nefforts to reduce gun violence. The thousands of students who signed \nthe pledge this year, and the millions before them, have promised to do \nwhat they can to prevent tragedies like last week's school shooting in \nMichigan. Congress should do its part by adequately funding important \nlaw enforcement programs and by passing commonsense gun safety \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/27/senate-section/article/S12003-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BREAST CANCER ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH ACT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, October is National Breast Cancer Awareness \nMonth and 2005 marks more than 20 years that National Breast Cancer \nAwareness Month has educated women about early breast cancer detection, \ndiagnosis, and treatment.\n  Yet, more than three million women currently live with breast cancer \nand the causes of this disease are still mostly unknown. While we have \nmade significant advances in treatment, so much more needs to be done \nwhen it comes to prevention of this often fatal disease.\n  The Breast Cancer Environmental Research Act, S. 757, would enhance \nbreast cancer environmental research across the country. This bill \nwhich is modeled after the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research \nProgram, would over 5 years, invest $30 million through a peer-reviewed \ngrant process to establish a multi-disciplinary approach.\n  At this time, four research centers study prenatal-adult \nenvironmental exposures that may cause breast cancer. And while this is \na good start, we need a nationally focused, collaborative and \ncomprehensive strategy to approach this and the Breast Cancer \nEnvironmental Research Act would do just that.\n  This country has great resources when it comes to medical and \nscientific research. I believe this bill would provide an efficient and \neffective strategy for developing research in the environmental causes \nof this tragic disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/27/senate-section/article/S12003-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12003-S12004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             RECOGNIZING SIXTY-FIVE YEARS OF FACTS ON FILE\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it doesn't seem all that long ago \nthat one of our most popular television shows featured a detective with \na catch phrase that soon became part of our national vocabulary. When \nquestioning someone who was offering more opinions than observations he \nwould often interrupt and say, ``Just the facts.'' Those few words sum \nup the history of a publication that has grown from an in-depth look at \nWorld War II to an incredible collection of all forms of data that \ncovers just about everything from the beginnings of recorded history to \nthe exploration of the furthest ranges of our universe.\n  Sixty-five years ago, Facts on File World News Digest was founded in \n1940 by three emigrants from Hitler's Europe who knew there would be a \nneed for a publication devoted to the issues of World War II. They had \nwitnessed the rise of Nazism in the 1930s and recognized the need for a \nU.S.-based publication that focused on both world and domestic news \nevents in the years leading up to World War II. Their first issue dealt \nwith the presidential race between Roosevelt and Wilkie and their first \nbound volume of the events of the day was written, as described in the \nforward, as an effort to provide a clear and concise guide to help the \nreader navigate through a ``hopeless maze of thousands of facts.''\n  Nowadays, by comparison, we are deluged by tens of millions of facts \nand other pieces of data from around the world almost every day. \nThrough it all, Facts on File has continued to sift the trivial from \nthe significant and put together volume after volume of written \ninformation placing the facts about a myriad of subjects online and at \nour fingertips.\n  Facts on File World News Digest was originally conceived as a source \nof information for radio and news journalists. Today, it serves an ever \nwidening group of people who need quick and easy access to the basic \nfacts about an endless list of items. Teachers rely on the publications \nfor their lesson plans. Students rely on the easy access their database \nprovides them for help with their homework, background for their \npapers, or just to encourage a genuine curiosity about the history of \nthe world around them and how things work.\n  Weekly Reader, which is now a part of the Facts on File family, took \na poll of its readers recently. They discovered that almost 70 percent \nof today's students reported that they look for and find most of the \nfacts they need for their homework on the Internet. Their use of the \nlatest technology was the good news. The bad news was they often do not \nquestion the material they find or use another source to double check \nit. They just assume what they have found is correct.\n  That is why it is so vitally important that we make sure our \nchildren, students and researchers have access to online materials on \nthe web that put a premium on facts--not opinions. For that reason and \nso many more, Facts\n\n[[Page S12004]]\n\non File World News Digest will continue to be a priceless treasure \ntrove of information, providing access to its databases and the wealth \nof knowledge they store with students, teachers, and government \nentities across the country.\n  As the old adage says so well, we're entitled to our own opinions, \nwe're just not entitled to our own facts. Facts on File has been \nworking for 65 years to make sure the record is clear so that those who \nuse their publications as a source get it right the first time.\n  As the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions, I like to say that education is our middle name. Facts on \nFile, and the family of publications it includes, has been a very \nvaluable component of our education system for some time. I appreciate \nand congratulate them on a remarkable record of success. It's good to \nknow that a resource exists that can provide our children with the data \nthey need to supplement their studies, a resource that does its best, \nlike the detective I referred to earlier, to provide ``just the \nfacts.''\n  (At the request of Mr. Sarbanes, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, in Greek communities around the \nworld, Oxi Day celebrates the fateful day, October 28, 1940, when \nGreece said ``NO'' to Mussolini's demand for immediate free passage of \nItalian army troops through Greece, and thereby changed the course of \nWorld War II. When Greece refused, Mussolini invaded, expecting no \nserious resistance to his much larger and better-equipped army. In \nfact, the outnumbered Greek forces offered such stiff resistance that \nMussolini was soon thrown on the defensive and the Italians retreated \ninto Albania. The Greeks held the Axis forces at bay for months, \nforcing Hitler to divert to Greece, forces that had been intended for \nthe invasion of the Soviet Union, which in turn caused a delay in the \ninvasion. Within months, the German armies were bogged down in the \nharsh winter conditions from which they were never able to recover.\n  In the brutal campaign that Hitler's armies waged in Greece, nearly \n16,000 Greeks were killed and more than 300,000 taken prisoner, but \nfrom that campaign emerged the determined and courageous Greek \nresistance. In World War II, Greece and the United States were partners \nin the struggle against fascism as today they are partners in the \neffort to build a free, democratic and prosperous world.\n  In Greek communities everywhere, Oxi Day is a time to celebrate \nGreece's stunning defeat of Mussolini's armies and the Greek role in \nassuring the Allied victory in World War II. It is also a time to \nreflect on the democratic spirit that inspired that victory, a spirit \nGreece gave to the world more than two millennia ago. Today, I join our \nGreek American friends in recognizing a momentous day in which we are \nreminded that tyranny will always be defeated by the enduring light of \nfreedom. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/27/senate-section/article/S12004-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/27/senate-section/article/S12004-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination and two treaties which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/27/senate-section/article/S12004-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:48 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Croatt, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 172.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 1927. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \nthe Federal income tax system simpler, fairer, and more fiscally \nresponsible, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am proposing a Fair Flat Tax Act \nthat will finally provide real tax relief to America's hurting middle \nclass. It will do so by making the tax system simpler, flatter and \nfairer. And at the same time, it will begin to reduce the deficit that \nis destabilizing our economy, our security and our future.\n  This tax reform proposal is simpler because it's easier to understand \nand use. My legislation will include a new, simplified 1040 form that \nis one page, 30 lines, for every individual taxpayer.\n  This plan is flatter because it collapses the current system of six \nindividual tax brackets down to three--15, 25 and 35 percent--and \ncreates a flat corporate rate of 35 percent.\n  Ultimately, this plan is fairer because it changes the laws that \ndisproportionately favor the most affluent Americans and corporations \nat the expense of the middle class. Instead, it provides a major \nmiddle-class tax cut--paid for by the elimination of scores of tax \nbreaks in the individual and corporate income tax breaks, and by \nrepealing the Bush tax cuts that favored the most fortunate few at the \nexpense of the many.\n  This plan is fairer for American taxpayers because it treats work and \nwealth equally.\n  This is a radical statement about tax law: America can do better than \na two-tier system which forces a policeman to pay a higher effective \ntax rate than an investor who makes his income on capital gains and \ndividends.\n  Under the current Federal Tax Code, all income is not created equal \nin this country. Americans who work for wages, in effect, subsidize the \ntax cuts and credits and deferrals of those who make money through \nunearned income--the dividends from investments. It's time to treat all \ntaxpayers the same.\n  Let me be clear: I am not interested in soaking investors. I am a \nDemocrat who believes in markets, and creating wealth. But what our \ncountry is all about is equality, and our Tax Code should treat \neveryone's income more equally too.\n  My legislation, The Fair Flat Tax Act of 2005, adapts the flat tax \nidea to help reduce the deficit instead, through fewer exclusions, \nexemptions, deductions, deferrals, credits and special rates for \ncertain businesses and activities, and through the setting of a single, \nflat corporate rate of 35 percent. On the individual side, it ends \nfavoritism for itemizers while improving deductions across the board: \nThe standard deduction would be tripled for single filers from $5,000 \nto $15,000 and raised from $10,000 to $30,000 for married couples. Six \nindividual rates are collapsed into three progressive rates of 15 \npercent, 25 percent and 35 percent, and income from all sources is \ntaxed the same.\n  Several deductions used most frequently by individuals, those for \nhome mortgage interest and charitable contributions, and the credits \nfor children, education and earned income are retained. No one would \nhave to calculate their taxes twice: this proposal eliminates the \nindividual Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), which could snare as many as \n21 million American taxpayers in 2006.\n  This proposal would eliminate an estimated $20 billion each year in \nspecial breaks for corporations, and direct the Treasury Secretary to \nidentify and report to Congress an additional $10 billion in savings \nfrom tax expenditures that subsidize inefficiencies in the health care \nsystem. Eliminating these breaks would sustain current benefits for our \nmen and women in uniform, our veterans and the elderly and disabled--as \nwell as breaks that promote savings and help families pay for health \ncare and education.\n  What makes the Fair Flat Tax Act truly unique is that it corrects one \nof the most glaring inequities in the current tax system: regressive \nState and local taxes. Under current law, low and middle income \ntaxpayers get hit with a double whammy: compared to wealthy Americans, \nthey pay more of their income in State and local taxes. Poor families \npay more than 11 percent and middle income families pay about 10 \npercent of their income in State and local taxes, while wealthier \ntaxpayers only pay five percent. And because many low and middle income \ntaxpayers don't itemize, they get no credit on their Federal form for \npaying State and local taxes. In fact, two-thirds of the Federal \ndeduction for State and local taxes goes to those with incomes above \n$100,000. Under the Fair Flat Tax Act for the first time the Federal \ncode would look at the entire picture, at an individual's combined \nFederal, State and local tax burden, and give credit to low and middle \nincome individuals to correct for regressive State and local taxes.\n\n[[Page S12010]]\n\n  Repealing some individual tax credits, deductions and exclusions from \nincome--along with some serious changes to the corporate Tax Code--\nenables larger standard deductions and broader middle-class tax relief.\n  The deductions most important to most Americans remain in place: the \nhome mortgage deduction stays, as do child credits and charitable \ncontributions, higher education and health savings.\n  What all this means for American taxpayers is--the vast majority of \ntaxpayers will see a cut, particularly the middle class. Congressional \nResearch Service experts tell us that middle class families and \nfamilies with wage and salary incomes up to $150,000 will see tax \nrelief.\n  On the corporate side--this plan does something that may not be \npopular, but it's right.\n  Each of us, including America's corporations, need to pay our fair \nshare. Corporations that have used tax loopholes to avoid paying their \nfair share of taxes are going to see those loopholes close and they're \ngoing to contribute.\n  This legislation makes concrete progress toward deficit reduction. \nThere's a long way to go to stop the hemorrhaging in the Federal \nbudget, but this legislation makes a real start by whittling the \ndeficit down approximately $100 billion over five years.\n  Some may wonder if what I am proposing today is a response to the \nPresident's Tax Reform Advisory Panel. To date, the Panel hasn't \nofficially released its recommendations. I can't respond to something \nthat hasn't been introduced yet. But I am troubled by the fact that the \nrecommendations trickling out from the Panel would continue to twist \nthe Tax Code away from equal treatment of all income, widening the \nchasm between people who get wages and people who collect dividends.\n  I am introducing The Fair Flat Tax Act of 2005 today to provide \nAmericans a plan based on common-sense principles that can make the Tax \nCode work better.\n  Making the Tax Code simpler and flatter is going to make it fairer. \nMy legislation is going to provide real relief to the middle class. It \nwill treat work and wealth equally. It will make a start at reducing \nthe deficit. I am ready to get to work with my colleagues and move it \nforward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1927\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand the research, prevention, and awareness \nactivities of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and \nKidney Diseases and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with \nrespect to inflammatory bowel disease; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nfocused on a devastating condition known as inflammatory bowel disease \n(IBD). I am pleased that Senator Cochran has once again joined me in \nthe fight against this painful and debilitating disease.\n  Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, collectively known as \ninflammatory bowel disease, are chronic disorders of the \ngastrointestinal tract which afflict approximately 1.4 million \nAmericans, 30 percent whom are diagnosed in their childhood years. IBD \ncan cause severe abdominal pain, fever, and intestinal bleeding. \nComplications related to the disease include; arthritis, osteoporosis, \nanemia, liver disease, growth and developmental challenges, and \ncolorectal cancer. Inflammatory bowel disease represents a major cause \nof morbidity from digestive illness and has a devastating impact on \npatients and families.\n  In the 108th Congress I was proud to sponsor bipartisan legislation \nfocused on IBD that attracted 36 co-sponsors. Several important \nprovisions of that bill were incorporated into legislation known as the \n``Research Review Act'' which was signed into law by the President last \nNovember. Specifically, the ``Research Review Act'' called on the \nGovernment Accountability Office and the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention to submit reports to Congress on three issues of \ncritical importance to the IBD community, 1. Social Security \nDisability, 2. Medicare and Medicaid coverage, and 3. the epidemiology \nof the disease in the United States.\n  The legislation I am introducing today builds upon the progress made \nlast year by calling for an increased Federal investment in biomedical \nresearch on IBD. The hope for a better quality of life patients and \nfamilies depends on basic and clinical research sponsored by the \nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases at the \nNational Institutes of Health (NIDDK). The ``Inflammatory Bowel Disease \nResearch Act'' calls for an expansion of NIDDK's research portfolio on \nCrohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in order to capitalize on \nseveral exciting discoveries that have broadened our understanding of \nIBD in recent years. By increasing our investment in this area, we will \nmaximize the possibility that we will be able to offer hope to millions \nof Americans who suffer from this debilitating disease. At the same \ntime, progress in this area could also mean we would save millions of \ndollars in net health care expenditures through reduced \nhospitalizations and surgeries.\n  In addition to biomedical research, this legislation also calls on \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop a ``National \nInflammatory Bowel Disease Action Plan.'' This plan will provide a \ncomprehensive approach to addressing the burden of IBD in the United \nStates, including strategies for raising awareness of the disease among \nthe general public and health care community, expanding epidemiological \nresearch focused on the prevalence of IBD, and preventing the \nprogression of the disease and its complications.\n  The Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America, an organization that \nhas been a leader in the battle against IBD, has strongly endorsed this \nlegislation. In addition to CCFA, the following organizations have \nendorsed this bill: The North American Society for Pediatric \nGastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, the American \nGastroenterological Association, the American Society for \nGastrointestinal Endoscopy, the Digestive Disease National Coalition, \nthe Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates, and the \nPennsylvania Society of Gastroenterology.\n  I urge all Senators to join Senator Cochran and me in this important \ncause by co-sponsoring the ``Inflammatory Bowel Disease Research Act.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1930\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Inflammatory Bowel Disease \n     Research Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are serious \n     inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.\n       (2) Crohn's disease may occur in any section of the \n     gastrointestinal tract but is predominately found in the \n     lower part of the small intestine and the large intestine. \n     Ulcerative colitis is characterized by inflammation and \n     ulceration of the innermost lining of the colon. Complete \n     removal of the colon in patients with ulcerative colitis can \n     potentially alleviate and cure symptoms.\n       (3) Because Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis behave \n     similarly, they are collectively known as inflammatory bowel \n     disease. Both diseases present a variety of symptoms, \n     including severe diarrhea; abdominal pain with cramps; fever; \n     and rectal bleeding.

A bill to reauthorize the grant program of the Department of \nJustice for reentry of offenders into the community, to establish a \ntask force on Federal programs and activities relating to the reentry \nof offenders into the community, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce, \nalong with Senators Biden and Brownback, the Second Chance Act of 2005: \nCommunity Safety through Recidivism Prevention. This legislation is \ndesigned to reduce recidivism among adult and juvenile ex-offenders. \nNever before in our history have so many individuals been released from \nprison and never before in our history have so many ex-offenders been \nis prepared to reenter their communities. Each year, more than 650,000 \nindividuals are released, which roughly equates to about 1,700 \nindividuals returning communities each day. This number is expected to \ngrow in the near future as more inmates complete their prison terms. \nFor most offenders, the transition back into their communities is \ndifficult because many lack the necessary skill to ensure a successful \nreentry. Many suffer from serious substance abuse addictions and mental \nhealth issues. Many have difficulty securing a job or adequate housing \nand often find themselves lured back to a life of crime. A study \nconducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that over two-\nthirds of released prisoners were rearrested within three years and \none-half of those rearrested were convicted and re-incarcerated. This \nhigh rate of recidivism devastates our towns and communities and puts \nan enormous strain on state and local budgets.\n  The Second Chance Act reauthorizes the Adult and Juvenile Offender \nReentry Demonstration projects, authorizing the Attorney General to \nmake grants to States and local governments to establish offender \nreentry projects, with an enhanced focus on job training, housing, \nsubstance abuse and mental health treatment, and working with children \nand families. It also creates a new grant program available to \nnonprofit organizations for the purpose of providing mentoring and \nother transitional services essential to reintegrating ex-offenders. \nThe Second Chance Act encourages new community partnerships to help \neducate, train, and employ these individuals who might otherwise return \nto a life of crime.\n  Many ex-offenders are often stigmatized by their incarceration, and \nmust face the reality that many employers are reluctant to hire them. A \nNational Adult Literacy Study determined that a majority of prisoners \nare either illiterate or have marginal reading, writing, and math \nskills. Following the repeal of Pell Grant eligibility for incarcerated \nindividuals, I worked to create the Grants to States for Workplace and \nCommunity Transition Training for Incarcerated Youth Offenders program. \nThis program is aimed at providing post-secondary education, employment \ncounseling, and workplace and community transition training for \nincarcerated youth offenders while in prison, which continue for up to \none year after the individual is released. The current program limits \nexpenditures per youth offender to $1,500 for tuition and books, and \nonly allows an additional $300 for other related services. The Second \nChance Act builds upon my earlier efforts by increasing State's \nflexibility and accountability within the grant program. It removes the \ncap and raises the allowable expenditure permitted for each youth \noffender to the maximum level of Pell Grants. One of the keys to \npreventing recidivism is access to education an in recognizing the \nimpact that education an job training can have on incarcerated \noffenders. It is my sincere hope that this legislation will encourage \nincarcerated individuals to achieve their independence and to gain the \nnecessary skills to become productive members of society.\n  Another crisis that well face is the growing populations of prisoners \nwho are parents. More than half of those currently incarcerated are \nparents of minor children. Female incarceration rates are increasing \nfaster than those men, totaling 7 percent of the prison population. Of \nthose incarcerated, 80 percent are mothers with, on average two \ndependent children. What is most troubling is that two-thirds of their \nchildren are younger the the age of 10. The incarceration of a parent \ncan have a tremendous impact on childhood development. Prison presents \na unique opportunity to improve a prisoner's ability to become a better \npart once they are released. Unfortunately, many of our prisons do not \nemploy such programs, due to fiscal constraints as well as a shift in \npriorities. The Second Chance Act of 2005 encourages the creating of \nprograms that facilitate visitation, if it is in the best interest of \nthe child. It also directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto establish services to help preserve family units, with special \nattention paid to the impact on the child of an incarcerated parent.\n  There is ample evident that well-designed reentry programs reduce \nrecidivism. Programs such as aftercare for substance abusers and adult \nvocational education have shown to reduce recidivism up to 15 percent. \nThese programs pay for themselves by reducing future correction costs \nassociated with re-housing these individuals upon their return back \ninto the institution. The revolving door of prisons not only hurts \nthose who are caught up in the process, but hurts their families and \nour communities. If we fail to address this problem, 1e are burdening \nour communities not only with greater expenditures, but in the risk of \nincreased crime and unsafe neighborhoods. The more we can do to prepare \nthese individuals when they return home, the better off we will all be. \nI urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation, and \nurge its swift adoption.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Senator Specter, Senator Brownback, and I \nintroduce today the Second Chance Act of 2005, which takes direct aim \nat reducing recidivism rates for our nation's ex-offenders and \nimproving the transition for these offenders from prison back into the \ncommunity.\n  All too often we think about today, but not tomorrow. We look to \nshort-\n\n[[Page S12015]]\n\nterm solutions for long-term problems. We need to have a change in \nthinking and approach. It's time we face the dire situation of \nprisoners reentering our communities with insufficient monitoring, \nlittle nor no job skills, inadequate drug treatment, insufficient \nhousing, lack of positive influences, a pap city of basic physical and \nmental health services, and deficient basic life skills.\n  The bill we introduce today is about providing a second chance for \nthese ex-offenders, and the children and families that depend on them. \nIt's about strengthening communities and ensuring safe neighborhoods.\n  Since my 1994 Crime Bill passed, we've had great success in cutting \ndown on crime rates in this country. Under the Community Oriented \nPolicing Services, COPS, program, we've funded over 100,000 officers \nall across the country. And our crime rate has plummeted.\n  But there's a record number of people currently serving time in our \ncountry--over 2 million in our federal and state prisons; with millions \nmore in local jails. And 95 percent of all prisoners we lock up today \nwill eventually get out. That equals nearly 650,000 being released from \nfederal or state prisons to communities each year.\n  If we are going to continue the downward trend of crime rates, we \nsimply have to make strong, concerted, and common-sense efforts now to \nhelp ex-prisoners successfully reenter and reintegrate to their \ncommunities.\n  And right now, we're not doing a good enough job. A staggering two-\nthirds of released State prisoners are expected to be rearrested for a \nfelony or serious misdemeanor within 3 years of release. Two out of \nevery three. You're talking about hundreds of thousands of reoffending, \nex-offenders each year and hundreds of thousands of serious crimes \nbeing committed by people who have already served time in jail.\n  And, unfortunately, it's too difficult to see why such a huge portion \nof our released prisoners recommit serious crimes. Up to 60 percent of \nformer inmates are not employed; 15-27 percent of prisoners expect to \ngo to homeless shelters upon release; and 57 percent of federal and 70 \npercent of state inmates used drugs regularly before prison, with some \nestim1tes of involvement with drugs or alcohol around the time of the \noffense as high as 84 percent.\n  These huge numbers or released prisoners each year and the out-of-\ncontrol recidivism rates are a recipe for diaster--leading to untold \ndamage, hardship, and death for victims; ruined futures and lost \npotential for re-offenders; and a huge drain on society at large. One \nparticularly vulnerable group is the children of these offenders. We \nsimply cannot be resigned to allowing generation after generation \nentering and reentering our prisons. This pernicious cycle must come to \nan end.\n  My 1994 Crime Bill recognized these extraordinarily high rates of \nrecidivism as a real problem. My bill, for example, created innovative \ndrug treatment programs for State and Federal inmates to help them kick \ntheir habit.\n  But this is only one piece of the puzzle. I introduced a bill in 2000 \nthat would have built on my 1994 Crime Bill--the ``Offender Reentry and \nCommunity Safety Act of 2000'' (S. 2908). This bill would have created \ndemonstration reentry programs for Federal, State, and local prisoners. \nThese programs were designed to assist high-risk, high-need offenders \nwho served their prison sentences, but who posed the greatest risk of \nreoffending upon release because they lacked the education, job skills, \nstable family or living arrangements, and the health services they \nneeded to successfully reintegrate into society.\n  While we have made some progress on offender reentry efforts since \n1994, much more needs to be done. In the current session of Congress, I \nam pleased that colleagues of mine--from both sides of Capitol Hill and \nfrom both sides of the aisle--are also focusing their attention and \nthis vital issue.\n  Senators Specter and Brownback have been dedicated and tireless \nleaders on crime and public safety issues throughout their careers, and \nI am proud to join efforts with them today. Other Senators have also \ntaken a leadership role on these issues, including Senators Leahy, \nKennedy, Brownback, Hatch, Specter, Grassley, Feinstein, DeWine, \nSantorum, Landrieu, Bingaman, Coburn, Durbin, and Obama.\n  The Second Chance Act of 2005 provides a competitive grant program to \npromote innovative programs to this out a variety of methods aimed at \nreducing recidivism rates. Efforts would be focus on post-release \nhousing, education and job training, substance abuse and mental health \nservices, and mentoring programs, just to name a few.\n  Because the scope of the problem is so large--with 650,000 prisoners \nbeing released from state and federal prisons each year--our bill \nprovides $100 million per year in competitive grant funding . This \nisn't being wasteful with our scarce federal resources, it's just an \nacknowledgement of the scope of the problem we're faced with.\n  A relatively modest investment in offender reentry efforts compares \nvery well with the alternative, building more and more prisons for \nthese ex-offenders to return to if they are unable to successfully \nreenter their communities and instead are rearrested and reconvicted of \nmore cries. We must remember that the average cost of incarcerating \neach prisoner exceeds 20,000 per year, with expenditures on corrections \nalone having increased from $9 billion in 1982 to $60 billion in 2002. \nWe simply can't be penny-wise but pound-foolish.\n  The Second Chance Act of 2005 also requires that federal departments \nwith a role in offender reentry efforts coordinate and work together; \nto make sure there aren't duplicative efforts or funding gaps; and to \ncoordinate reentry research. Our bill would raise the profile of this \nissue within the executive branch and secure the sustained and \ncoordinated federal attention offender reentry efforts deserve.\n  We also need to examine existing Federal and State reentry barriers--\nlaws, regulations, rules, and practices that make it more difficult for \nformer inmates to successfully reintegrate back into their communities; \nlaws that confine ex-offenders to society's margins, making it even \nmore likely that they will recommit serious crimes and return to \nprison.\n  Turning over a new leaf and going from a life of crime to becoming a \nproductive member of society is tough enough. We shouldn't have Federal \nand State laws on the books that make this even more challenging. \nThat's not say that we don't want to restrict former drug addicts from \nworking in pharmacies, for example, or to bar sex offenders from \nworking it day care centers. But many communities across the country \ncurrently exclude ex-prisoners from virtually every occupation \nrequiring a state license, like chiropractic care, engineering, and \nreal estate. Lifting these senselessly punitive bans would make it \neasier for ex-offenders to stay out of prison.\n  Our bill provides for a roust analysis of these federal and state \nbarriers with recommendations on what next steps we need to take. And \nthese reviews are mandated to take place out in the open under public \nscrutiny.\n  The Second Chance Act also spurs state-of-the-art research and study \non offender reentry issues. We need to know who is most likely to \nrecommit crimes when they are released, to better target our limited \nresources where they can do the most good. We need to study why some \nex-offenders who seem to have the entire deck stacked against them are \nable to become successful and productive members of our society. We \nneed to know what, works and how we can replicate what works for \nothers.\n  Our bill also provides a whole slew of common-sense proposals in the \nareas of job training, employment, education, post-release housing, \nsubstance abuse, and prisoner mentoring--efforts and changes in law \nthat we can do now.\n  Our Second Chance Act is a next, natural step in our campaign against \ncrime. Making a dent in recidivism rate is an enormous undertaking; one \nthat requires action now and continued focus in the future. I commit to \nvigorously pushing this legislation as well as keeping an eye on what \nsteps we need to take in the future. We need to realize that the \nproblems facing ex-offenders are enormous and will need sustained \nfocus. The safety of our neighbors, our children, and our communities \ndepends on it.\n  I am proud today to join with Senator Specter and Senator Brownback \nin introducing the Second Chance Act and ask our colleagues to join \nwith us in this vital effort.\n\n[[Page S12016]]\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am please to join with Chairman \nSpecter and Senator Biden today as we introduce a bill that will have a \ndramatic and positive effect in the lives of individuals re-entering \nsociety after incarceration. The Second Chance Act: Community Safety \nThrough Recidivism Prevention is a bill that will not only protect our \nNation's citizens but will more importantly help to reduce recidivism \nin our Nation.\n  A hallmark of any just society lies in its ability to protect the \ninterest of all its citizens and I am proud that the United States is a \nleader in this regard. Yet, while we continue to strive toward this \nlofty goal, we must realize that there are areas in which we, as a \nsociety and as government, must do more to improve. No where is that \nmore apparent than in our Nation's pension system.\n  Today, we have challenges within the prison system that range from \nhigh recidivism rates to budgetary and safety concerns. With this bill, \nwe will be able to address this pressing problem within our society. \nAlready we have seen innovative and model programs within the states \nand the faith community, and I am proud to say that Kansas is a leader \nin this regard, as well a such faith organizations as Prison Fellowship \nMinistries, Catholic Charities U.S.A., and the Salvation Army. However, \nwe must stimulate innovation in this area on a national level and that \nis what this bill will accomplish. It is paramount that we ensure the \nsafety of our communities and ensure that those incarcerated have the \ntools necessary to succeed after they rejoin society.\n  With this bill, we wil1 be able to combat the extremely high \nrecidivism rates plaguing the prison system, currently as high as 70 \npercent, as well as address the financial burdens that hinder many of \nour state penitentiaries. State prison operating expenditures totaled \n$28.4 billion in fiscal year 2001, or a nationwide average annual \noperating cost of $22,650 per inmate. Today, it is more likely than \never that a person released from prison will be rearrested--two-thirds \nof state prisoners are rearrested within 3 years of release. Depending \nof the expert consulted, between one-third and two-thirds of all prison \nre-admissions are related to probation or parole violations and at \nleast half of those violations are technical.\n  We must stop subsiding programs that do not work and that lead, in \nturn, to negative behavior.\n  I am confident that the bill we are putting forward today will indeed \ntake the much needed steps to reduce the recidivism rate in this \nNation, which will in turn help those incarcerated make positive \nchanges within their lives so that when they do rejoin society, they \nwill be able to do so with the confidence of knowing that they can \ncontribute to society in a positive manner. As an added incentive to \nrecidivism reduction, each grant application submitted under this \nprogram must have as its strategic plan a goal to reduce recidivism by \n50 percent in 5 years and in order to receive continued funding under \nthis program, each granted must show a reduction in the recidivism rate \nof participants by 10 percent over 2 years.\n  Specifically, this bill facilitates change within our current \ncorrectional system, and promotes coordination with the Federal \nGovernment to better assist those returning to our communities after \nincarceration their children. The bill reauthorizes the Re-Entry \nDemonstration Project with an enhanced focus on jobs, housing, \nsubstance abuse treatment, mental health, and the children and families \nof those incarcerated. The bill authorizes $200 million over a period \nof two years to fund these demonstration programs and creates \nperformance outcome standards and deliverables. It will also encourage \nstates to enhance their re-entry services and systems with grants to \nfund the creation or enhancement of state re-entry councils for \nstrategic planning and review the state barriers and resources that \nexit.\n  Additionally, the bill creates a Federal interagency taskforce to \nfacilitate collaboration and identify innovative programs initiatives. \nThe taskforce will review and report to Congress on the Federal \nbarriers that exist to successful re-entry.\n  Furthermore, the bill create a $50 million 2 year mentoring program \ngeared toward reducing recidivism and the societal costs of recidivism. \nThis mentoring program will help ex-offenders re-integrate into their \ncommunities. This initiative will specifically harness the resources \nand experience of community-based organizations in helping returning \nex-offender.\n  Finally, the bill amends the Workplace and Community Transition \nTraining for Incarcerated Youth Offenders Act by improving the existing \ngrants to States under this program and provides $60 million for the \nadministration of the program. This youth program calls for expanding \nthe eligibility age from 25 to 35 years, increases accountability by \nrequiring State correctional education agencies to track specific and \nquantified student outcomes referenced to non-program participants, and \nincreases the allowable expenditure per youth offender up to the level \nof the maximum Federal Pell Grant award for tuition, books and \nessential materials; and related services, such as career development.\n  We have an incredible opportunity to re-shape the way in which this \nnation's prison systems operate.

Res. 289\n\n       Whereas Joseph Jefferson ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson, a native \n     of Greenville, South Carolina, and a local legend, began his \n     professional career and received his nickname while playing \n     baseball for the Greenville Spinners in 1908;\n       Whereas ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson moved to the Philadelphia \n     Athletics for his major league debut in 1908, to the \n     Cleveland Naps in 1910, and to the Chicago White Sox in 1915;\n       Whereas ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson's accomplishments \n     throughout his 13-year career in professional baseball were \n     outstanding--he was 1 of only 7 Major League Baseball players \n     to ever top the coveted mark of a .400 batting average for a \n     season, and he earned a lifetime batting average of .356, the \n     third highest of all time;\n       Whereas ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson's career record makes him \n     one of our Nation's top baseball players of all time;\n       Whereas in 1919, the infamous ``Black Sox'' scandal erupted \n     when an employee of a New York gambler allegedly bribed 8 \n     players of the Chicago White Sox, including Joseph Jefferson \n     ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson, to lose the first and second games \n     of the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds;\n       Whereas in September 1920, a criminal court acquitted \n     ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson of the charge that he conspired to \n     lose the 1919 World Series;\n       Whereas despite the acquittal, Judge Kenesaw Mountain \n     Landis, baseball's first commissioner, banned ``Shoeless \n     Joe'' Jackson from playing Major League Baseball for life \n     without conducting any investigation of Jackson's alleged \n     activities, issuing a summary punishment that fell far short \n     of due process standards;\n       Whereas the evidence shows that Jackson did not \n     deliberately misplay during the 1919 World Series in an \n     attempt to make his team lose the World Series;\n       Whereas during the 1919 World Series, Jackson's play was \n     outstanding--his batting average was .375 (the highest of any \n     player from either team), he set a World Series record with \n     12 hits, he committed no errors, and he hit the only home run \n     of the series;\n       Whereas because of his lifetime ban from Major League \n     Baseball, ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson has been excluded from \n     consideration for admission to the Major League Baseball Hall \n     of Fame;\n       Whereas ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson died in 1951, after fully \n     serving his lifetime ban from baseball, and 85 years have \n     elapsed since the 1919 World Series scandal erupted;\n       Whereas Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig took \n     an important first step toward restoring the reputation of \n     ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson by agreeing to investigate whether \n     he was involved in a conspiracy to alter the outcome of the \n     1919 World Series and whether he should be eligible for \n     inclusion in the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame;\n       Whereas it has been 6 years since Commissioner Selig \n     initiated his investigation of\n\n[[Page S12017]]\n\n     ``Shoeless Joe'', but there has been no resolution;\n       Whereas the Chicago White Sox are the 2005 American League \n     Champions, and will compete in the World Series for the first \n     time since 1959;\n       Whereas ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson helped lead the Chicago \n     White Sox to their last World Series Championship in 1917; \n     and\n       Whereas it is appropriate for Major League Baseball to \n     remove the taint upon the memory of ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson \n     and honor his outstanding baseball accomplishments: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that Joseph \n     Jefferson ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson should be appropriately \n     honored for his outstanding baseball accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/27/senate-section/article/S12017-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 290--HONORING THE LIFE AND EXPRESSING THE DEEPEST \nCONDOLENCES OF CONGRESS ON THE PASSING OF EDWARD ROYBAL, FORMER UNITED \n                           STATES CONGRESSMAN\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Feinstein, \nMr. Kerry, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Obama, Mr. Reid, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Pryor, \nMr. Durbin, and Mr. Reed) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

and\n       (7) calls upon the Government of Kazakhstan to meet all of \n     its freely accepted OSCE commitments on democracy, human \n     rights, and the rule of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/27/senate-section/article/S12018-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 61--AUTHORIZING THE REMAINS OF ROSA PARKS \n             TO LIE IN HONOR IN THE ROTUNDA OF THE CAPITOL\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Dodd, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Levin, \nMr. Brownback, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Obama, Mr. Talent, Mrs. \nClinton, Mr. Allen, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Biden, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \nPryor, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nCorzine, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \nLeahy, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Akaka) submitted the following concurrent \nresolution;

In particular, the hearing presented \nevidence detailing how Saddam rewarded foreign officials with lucrative \noil allocations that could be converted to money. The hearing also \nexamined the illegal surcharges paid on Iraqi oil sales, using examples \ninvolving the recently indicted U.S. company, Bayoil. In addition, more \ndetailed information was provided on the nature and extent of the 2003 \nKhor al-Amaya incident in which oil tankers loaded a large amount of \nIraqi oil circumventing U.N. sanctions.\n  The Subcommittee's October 31 hearing will address: 1.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The messages of the President are as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith for the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification a Convention Between the Government of the United States \nof America and the Government of Bangladesh for the Avoidance of Double \nTaxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on \nIncome signed at Dhaka on September 26, 2004 (the ``Convention''). An \nexchange of notes is enclosed, and the report of the Department of \nState with respect to the Convention is transmitted for the information \nof the Senate.\n  This Convention, which is similar to tax treaties between the United \nStates and other developing nations, provides maximum rates of tax to \nbe applied to various types of income and protection from double \ntaxation of income. The Convention also provides for the resolution of \ndisputes and sets forth rules making its benefits unavailable to those \nwho are engaged in treaty forum shopping.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthis Convention and that the Senate give its advice and consent to \nratification.\n                                                      George W.

I also transmit, \nfor the information of the Senate, the report of the Secretary of State \nwith respect to the Corruption Convention, with an enclosure.\n  The international fight against corruption is an important foreign \npolicy priority for the United States. Corruption hinders sustainable \ndevelopment, erodes confidence in democratic institutions, and \nfacilitates transnational crime and terrorism. The Convention will be \nan effective tool to assist in the growing global effort to combat \ncorruption.\n  The U.N. Corruption Convention is the first global multilateral \ntreaty to comprehensively address the problems relating to corruption. \nIt provides for a broad range of cooperation, including extradition and \nmutual legal assistance, and commits governments to take measures that \nwill prevent corruption from happening in the first place. The \nCorruption Convention includes provisions to criminalize and prevent \ncorruption and provides procedures for governments to recover assets \nthat have been illicitly acquired by corrupt officials.\n  The provisions of the Corruption Convention are explained in the \naccompanying report of the Department of State. The report also sets \nforth proposed reservations that would be deposited by the United \nStates with its instrument of ratification. With these reservations, \nthe Convention will not require implementing and consent to its \nratification, subject to the reservations, understandings, and \ndeclarations described in the accompanying report of the Department of \nState.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Corruption Convention and give its advice and consent to its \nratification, subject to the reservations, understandings, and \ndeclarations described in the accompanying report of the Department of \nState.\n                                                      George W.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 61, submitted \nearly today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 61) authorizing the \n     remains of Rosa Parks to lie in honor in the rotunda of the \n     Capitol.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on Monday, this Nation lost a great American \nhumanitarian, public servant, and true modern day civil rights hero, \nMrs. Rosa Parks. The powerful and nonviolent act of defiance of this \nsingle, extraordinary lady changed the course of human history in this \nNation, and around the world. By her respectful refusal to give up her \nseat to a white man and move to a seat in the back of a Montgomery, AL, \ncity bus 50 years ago, Rosa Parks spoke to the fundamental truth of our \ndemocracy: that all men are created equal. None of us living today, nor \nthe future generations of an eternity of tomorrows, will ever be the \nsame because of the act of this brave woman. By her solitary action, \nRosa Parks proved that one person can make a difference. And she did.\n  Rosa Parks is not just a national hero, she is the embodiment of our \nsocial and human conscience and the spark that lit the flame of liberty \nand equality for African Americans and minority groups in this country \nand around the globe. Nelson Mandela, the former President of South \nAfrica, once called her ``the David who challenged Goliath'' and his \ninspiration during his long imprisonment prior to taking office.\n  It is altogether fitting and proper that this Nation honor the memory \nand gentle spirit of this great American and her legacy by providing an \nopportunity for the ordinary citizens of this Nation to pay their last \nrespects to Mrs. Rosa Parks.\n  Therefore, I proposed to the Senate leadership that we adopt a \nresolution authorizing such, and I am grateful to them for sponsoring \nthe resolution that I authored to authorize the use of the Capitol \nRotunda for the remains of Mrs. Rosa Parks to lie in honor beginning on \nSunday, October 30.\n  It has been the longstanding tradition of the Congress to authorize \nthis honor for not just Members of Congress and Presidents, but \nordinary citizens whose extraordinary efforts and service distinguished \nthem in the history of this Nation. Other great Americans who have been \nsimilarly honored date back to 1909 when Pierre Charles L'Enfant, \nplanner of the Capital City of Washington, lay in state in the Rotunda. \nOthers include Admiral George Dewey in 1917; General John Joseph \nPershing in 1948; General Douglas MacArthur in 1964; Director of the \nFBI, J. Edgar Hoover in 1972; and most recently, Capitol Police \nOfficers Jacob Joseph Chestnut and John Michael Gibson in 1998.\n  Congress recognized the need for the Nation to pay its respects to \nthese honorable men and Congress should permit the Nation to pay its \nlast respects to this honorable woman, Mrs. Rosa Louise Parks, as well.\n  I thank my colleagues for their assistance and support and urge the \nHouse to adopt this measure expeditiously so that America may properly \nhonor this courageous lady and great America.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconcurrent resolution be agreed to, the\n\n[[Page S12027]]\n\nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating thereto be printed in the Record, without intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 289\n\n       Whereas Joseph Jefferson ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson, a native \n     of Greenville, South Carolina, and a local legend, began his \n     professional career and received his nickname while playing \n     baseball for the Greenville Spinners in 1908;\n       Whereas ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson moved to the Philadelphia \n     Athletics for his major league debut in 1908, to the \n     Cleveland Naps in 1910, and to the Chicago White Sox in 1915;\n       Whereas ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson's accomplishments \n     throughout his 13-year career in professional baseball were \n     outstanding--he was 1 of only 7 Major League Baseball players \n     to ever top the coveted mark of a .400 batting average for a \n     season, and he earned a lifetime batting average of .356, the \n     third highest of all time;\n       Whereas ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson's career record makes him \n     one of our Nation's top baseball players of all time;\n       Whereas in 1919, the infamous ``Black Sox'' scandal erupted \n     when an employee of a New York gambler allegedly bribed 8 \n     players of the Chicago White Sox, including Joseph Jefferson \n     ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson, to lose the first and second games \n     of the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds;\n       Whereas in September 1920, a criminal court acquitted \n     ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson of the charge that he conspired to \n     lose the 1919 World Series;\n       Whereas despite the acquittal, Judge Kenesaw Mountain \n     Landis, baseball's first commissioner, banned ``Shoeless \n     Joe'' Jackson from playing Major League Baseball for life \n     without conducting any investigation of Jackson's alleged \n     activities, issuing a summary punishment that fell far short \n     of due process standards;\n       Whereas the evidence shows that Jackson did not \n     deliberately misplay during the 1919 World Series in an \n     attempt to make his team lose the World Series;\n       Whereas during the 1919 World Series, Jackson's play was \n     outstanding--his batting average was .375 (the highest of any \n     player from either team), he set a World Series record with \n     12 hits, he committed no errors, and he hit the only home run \n     of the series;\n       Whereas because of his lifetime ban from Major League \n     Baseball, ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson has been excluded from \n     consideration for admission to the Major League Baseball Hall \n     of Fame;\n       Whereas ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson died in 1951, after fully \n     serving his lifetime ban from baseball, and 85 years have \n     elapsed since the 1919 World Series scandal erupted;\n       Whereas Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig took \n     an important first step toward restoring the reputation of \n     ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson by agreeing to investigate whether \n     he was involved in a conspiracy to alter the outcome of the \n     1919 World Series and whether he should be eligible for \n     inclusion in the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame;\n       Whereas it has been 6 years since Commissioner Selig \n     initiated his investigation of ``Shoeless Joe'', but there \n     has been no resolution;\n       Whereas the Chicago White Sox are the 2005 American League \n     Champions, and will compete in the World Series for the first \n     time since 1959;\n       Whereas ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson helped lead the Chicago \n     White Sox to their last World Series Championship in 1917; \n     and\n       Whereas it is appropriate for Major League Baseball to \n     remove the taint upon the memory of ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson \n     and honor his outstanding baseball accomplishments: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that Joseph \n     Jefferson ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson should be appropriately \n     honored for his outstanding baseball accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/27/senate-section/article/S12027-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12027-S12028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING THE LIFE OF EDWARD ROYBAL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 290, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 290) honoring the life and expressing \n     the deepest condolences of Congress on the passing of Edward \n     Roybal, former United States Congressman.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute to a \ntrailblazing American and former Member of Congress, the Honorable \nEdward R. Roybal. It is an honor to speak about this incredible man, \nwho on Monday passed away at the age of 89 and was an inspiration to me \nand to millions of Hispanics across our Nation.\n  First, I must offer my heartfelt condolences to the Honorable \nRoybal's wife, Lucile; his daughter, Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-\nAllard, who is in her seventh term representing California's 34th \nDistrict; his other daughter, Lillian Roybal-Rose; and his son, Edward \nR. Roybal, Jr.\n  When elected to the House of Representatives in 1962, Congressman \nRoybal became the first Hispanic to serve in Congress in nearly 100 \nyears.\n  He represented the people of California's 30th Congressional District \nand served on behalf of the public interest during a very difficult and \ntumultuous time in our Nation's history.\n  As a 5th generation product of rural Colorado, my childhood at Los \nRincones, my family's ranch in the San Luis Valley, was a far cry from \nCongressman Roybal's on the streets of East Los Angeles.\n  Our family's house was small--in fact, my five of the eight siblings \nshared a small room and two beds. We did not have running water or \nelectricity until 1981.\n  However, even though we did not have electricity, I, like many other \nLatinos across this Nation, knew who the Honorable Ed Roybal was.\n  It was people like Congressman Roybal, and Cesar Chavez who inspired \nme to dream of serving our country as Colorado's Attorney General and \nlater here in the United States Senate.\n  As a Hispanic American, he provided a shining example of just what I \ncould accomplish if I heeded my parent's advice to get my education and \nwork hard in all my endeavors. Today, as I speak as one of 100 in the \nSenate, I firmly believe that I am standing on the shoulders of many \ngiants, in particular, Congressman Roybal.\n  Congressman Roybal lived by the fundamental values that make this \ncountry the greatest country in the world and the place I am privileged \nto call home. He fought social injustice on the streets, in our \nclassrooms, and in the halls of Congress.\n  Like my parents, he was a part of the American generation who grew up \nduring the Great Depression and came of age during World War II. He \nserved our country in the U.S. Army and defended our rights and \nprivileges afforded under the Constitution in battle. I am certain that \nthis experience served him well when he served on the House's Veteran \nAffairs Committee.\n\n  Throughout his life, he gave voice to the disenfranchised and offered \nhope to\n\n[[Page S12028]]\n\nthe sick. When the tragic HIV/AIDS epidemic began to sweep our Nation, \nCongressman Roybal answered the call to duty and worked to provide \nfunding for research and health services.\n  During a time when many of our Nation's laws and several in out \nNation's leadership tolerated and enabled political disenfranchisement \nand unequal educational and employment opportunities, the Honorable Ed \nRoybal organized and inspired his community to insist on equality and \nto embrace their ganas to change society.\n  Mr. President, ``ganas'' means ``to have a will to achieve.'' The \nHonorable Roybal had the ganas to right injustices in America because \nhe believed that he had the obligation to make this country a better \nplace for his children and my children when he left it.\n  I believe that he did accomplish his great goal. He did this by the \nwork he did in Congress as well as the work he did when he was away \nfrom Washington, DC.\n  In 1976, Congressman Roybal joined with his colleagues Congressman \n``Kika'' de la Garza and Congressman Baltasar Corrada, in establishing \nthe Congressional Hispanic Caucus. The purpose of the CHC was and is to \nadvocate on behalf of and represent the interests of Hispanic across \nthe nation and in Puerto Rico. Representative Roybal was the Caucus's \nfirst chairman, and his the continued work of the Caucus, the first \nforum in the United States Congress for Latino elected Members to \nformulate a common collective legislative agenda, is a part of his \nlegacy.\n  In addition to the Caucus, Congressman Roybal was instrumental in the \nfounding of non-profit organizations like the Congressional Hispanic \nCaucus Institute and the National Association of Latino Elected and \nAppointed Officials. Through these organizations, the fruits of his \nefforts can still be felt throughout the country today.\n  As I reflect on the life and work of the late Representative Roybal, \nI am reminded of a prayer written by another civil and human rights \nleader, Cesar Chavez:\n\n     Show me the suffering of the most miserable;\n     So I will know my people's plight.\n     Free me to pray for others;\n     For you are present in every person.\n     Help me take responsibility for my own life;\n     So that I can be free at last.\n     Grant me courage to serve others;\n     For in service there is true life.\n     Give me honesty and patience;\n     So that the Spirit will be alive among us.\n     Let the Spirit flourish and grow;\n     So that we will never tire of the struggle.\n     Let us remember those who have died for justice;\n     For they have given us life.\n     Help us love even those who hate us;\n     So we can change the world.\n\n  I join with the thousands of Americans in mourning the loss of this \ntrailblazing leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and \npreamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to immediate consideration of S. Res. 291 submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 291) to congratulate the Chicago \n     White Sox on winning the 2005 World Series Championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today as a Senator, as an \nIllinoisan, and as a proud resident of the South Side of Chicago to \ncongratulate the Chicago White Sox for winning the 2005 World Series. \nAs my fellow South Siders know, it has been a long time coming.\n  A little bit of history: Founded in 1900 as the Chicago White \nStockings, this year's team reached the World Series for the first time \nsince 1959, and this is a '59-style cap that I have here with me. Over \na century of White Sox fans have cheered for superstars such as Luke \nAppling, Nellie Fox, Carlton Fisk, Luis Aparicio, Harold Baines, and, \nof course, Big Frank Thomas. But we haven't savored the sweet taste of \na World Series championship since 1917--until now.\n  Back in 1917, Woodrow Wilson was President, and the Great War was \nraging in Europe. The White Sox were a bright spot in tough times.\n  The Sox won last night the way they have won all season--by playing \naggressively, scrapping for every base and every run. When Juan Uribe \nthrew to Paul Konerko for the final out, it was\n\n[[Page S12029]]\n\nfitting that the ball beat the runner by only half a step. The four \ngames against the Astros were decided by a total of six runs. Winning \nby the skin of your teeth has been our style. Win or die trying, that \nis our motto this year.\n  I congratulate my colleague from Texas. The Houston Astros were an \noutstanding team. But it just so happened that this year they ran into \nthe buzz saw of the Chicago White Sox.\n  I congratulate Jermaine Dye, who is the World Series MVP. But I am \nsure he will be the first to say that everyone on this year's team \ndeserves a part of that award. This is a team with so many great \nplayers but no undisputed leader on the field. I don't claim to be a \nbaseball expert or particularly unbiased on this matter, but this is \none of the most balanced and selfless teams any of us have seen. A team \nof unlikely heroes.\n  Scott Podsednik, who hadn't hit a home run all season, stepped up and \nhit two in the playoffs, including the walk-off winner in game two on \nSunday. Willie Harris, who barely played in the playoffs, got a pinch \nhit to get on base and bring home the only run last night. Geoff Blum, \na former Astro, who got a pinch hit homer in the 14th inning to give us \nthe margin of victory in game three. And the pitching--four complete \ngames to close out the American League Championship Series. An 11 and 1 \nrecord in the playoffs. 15 scoreless innings to finish the World \nSeries.\n  Before the season started, the Sox were a consensus .500 team. Even \nas we built and maintained the best record in the American League all \nseason, there were many doubters. Towards the end of the season, we hit \na rough patch, and the doubters grew louder. They said Cleveland had \nmore playoff experience. They said even if we held on to make the \nplayoffs, we would get embarrassed in the first round. But during the \nstretch run, manager Ozzie Guillen and his ``kids,'' as he calls them, \nwere calm and relaxed. Even as Cleveland came on strong and our lead in \nthe Central Division dwindled, Ozzie's kids continued to play pranks on \neach other in the clubhouse, and continued to run hard on the \nbasepaths.\n  Once the playoffs started, there was no looking back. That difficult \nSeptember was gone in an instant. We silenced the doubters by sweeping \nthe World Champion Boston Red Sox. We silenced the Angels during the \nALCS in five games. And we swept the Astros in four games.\n  I had the privilege of attending game one of the World Series on \nSaturday, and the fans in and around the park were a cross-section of \nthe city. There were plenty of folks old enough to remember the `59 \nteam. Almost everyone remembered the 2000 team that made the playoffs. \nA few were even alive in 1917.\n  I don't want to belabor this issue. I know those of you who had to \nlisten to Red Sox fans last year may have gotten a little weary of \nthose of us who have all this pent-up energy when we finally win the \nchampionship.\n  But I do want to say that the entire city of Chicago and the entire \nState of Illinois are extraordinarily proud.\n  I congratulate the entire White Sox organization, in particular Jerry \nReinsdorf, Kenny Williams, and Ozzie Guillen. We will be celebrating \nthis victory for a long time on the South Side, around the city of \nChicago, and around the entire State of Illinois.\n  Let me make one last point. While we were watching the game the other \nnight, in the drenching rain Sunday evening there was a sign held up by \nan elderly woman 92 years old. She said: I've been waiting for this for \n88 years.\n  I think it gave you some sense of how much this means to the city of \nChicago and to those blue-collar neighborhoods made up of Black, White, \nand Hispanic who were represented so ably by their team. It spoke to \nthe diversity of this country and the fact that we work together in \nways that make us all proud.\n  Senator Durbin and myself will be introducing a resolution later \ntoday.\n  I want to turn it over to my senior colleague from the great State of \nIllinois to maybe add a few other remarks regarding this outstanding \nteam.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from the State of \nIllinois who is truly a White Sox fan from the South Side of Chicago. \nWe have town meetings every Thursday morning, and from the beginning of \nthis baseball season, he has been rooting for his White Sox. As his \nfellow Senator from Illinois, I want to congratulate him and the White \nSox organization.\n  Say it is so, Joe.\n  Eighty-six years after the 1919 Black Sox scandal, and 88 years after \nthey beat the New York Giants in the 1917 World Series, the Chicago \nWhite Sox are bringing the World Series crown home to Chicago. It is \namazing. The ghost of Sholeless Joe Jackson can finally rest in peace.\n  Last night, the White Sox completed their magical World Series quest \nwith a 1-0 win to complete a four-game sweep over the Houston Astros. \nBut as Senator Obama has said, they were close games. Some of them \nbroke records for their length and the hard battle that they brought to \nthe mound and to the field.\n  White Sox fans from my home State of Illinois and all around the \nworld are rejoicing as the White Sox nation will cherish this victory \nfor decades to come.\n  The South Side of Chicago is the gladdest part of town. If you go \ndown there, you better be aware that the White Sox won the World Series \ncrown.\n  I congratulate the White Sox players, their manager, the valiant \nVenezuelan, Ozzie Guillen, pitching coach Don Cooper. What an amazing \nperformance by the pitching staff, and so many White Sox stars turned \ncoaches such as Tim Raines, Greg Walker, Harold Baines, and Joey Cora; \ngeneral manager Kenny Williams for putting together this magical team, \nhimself a former Sox player who made key moves not only in the off \nseason but during the season, such as adding closer Bobby Jenks, just \n24 years old, pitching in double A's just a few months ago. And there \nhe stood on the mound last night pitching those 99- and 100-mile-an-\nhour fast balls. But during the season, general manager Kenny Williams \nalso added game 3 hero Geoff Blum. To the owners and my friends, Eddie \nEinhorn and Jerry Reinsdorf, congratulations for 25 years of dedication \nto their great moment of victory. Everyone in the White Sox \norganization richly deserves this World Series victory.\n  The Sox organization has made citizens of Chicago and the State of \nIllinois proud by bringing home this crown. And to those generations of \nWhite Sox fans who stayed faithful to their team even in the darkest \ndays, I say rejoice. The Chicago White Sox are world champions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 292 which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 292) calling on the President to \n     condemn the anti-Israel sentiments expressed by the President \n     of Iran on October 26, 2005.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, yesterday, Iranian President Mahmoud \nAhmadinejad, citing the words of the founder of Iran's Islamic \nrevolution, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, said ``Israel must be \nwiped off the map.''\n  He then went on to call Israel a ``disgraceful blot.''\n  He rejected the two-state solution to the Middle East crisis as a \ndefeat for the Islamic world, adding that the ``roadmap'' would be \nshort-lived. He said ``If we put it behind us successfully, God \nwilling, it will pave the way for the destruction and the downfall of \nthe Zionist regime.''\n  The Iranian President also criticized his neighbors by warning \n``Anybody who recognizes Israel will burn in the fire of the Islamic \nnations' fury.''\n  He made these despicable comments to 4,000 students attending a \n``World without Zionism'' conference.\n  This was just hours before a Palestinian suicide bomber from Islamic \nJihad blew himself up in the small Israeli town of Hadera, killing 5 \npeople and wounding more than 30.\n  It's important to note that Islamic Jihad's murderers are supported \nand trained by Iran.\n  Given the seriousness of President Ahmadinejad's hateful comments, I \nam submitting a resolution with Senator Smith asking that this body \nrepudiate them.\n  The resolution also calls on President Bush, on behalf of the United \nStates, to condemn the remarks in the strongest terms possible.\n  This kind of incendiary rhetoric is what we have come to expect from \nIran.\n  The Iranian President has been quite open about his views on Israel. \nHe has been clear and consistent, echoing Iranian leader Ayatollah \nKhomeini, who called frequently for the destruction of Israel through \nthe 1980s.\n  The words and ideas of the President of Iran are offensive to \ncivilized people around the world. We will not tolerate anti-Israel or \nanti- Semitic rhetoric.\n  The Iranian President has spoken words that are certain to incite \nviolence against the state of Israel. Too often, that translates into \nviolence against Jews worldwide.\n  But what makes the comments especially chilling is the fact that \nIranian officials announced earlier this year that they had completed \ndevelopment of solid fuel technology for missiles, a huge breakthrough \nthat increases missile accuracy.\n  Iran has the Shahab-3 missile, which has a range of 810 miles to more \nthan 1,200 miles. Jerusalem is 970 miles from Tehran.\n  The Shahab-3 is capable of deliverinq a nuclear warhead to Israel and \nto U.S. forces in the Middle East.\n  So when the Iranian President threatens to ``wipe Israel off the \nmap,'' we can't afford to take such a threat lightly. We have to take \nnote of it and repudiate it.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this resolution and go on record \ncondemning the hateful words of the Iranian President. And I hope that \nPresident Bush himself will speak to this issue. It's that important.\n  I want to thank Senator Smith for co-sponsoring this resolution with \nme. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 292) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 292\n\n       Whereas, on October 26, 2005, the President of Iran, \n     Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said that Israel must be ``wiped off the \n     map'' and that ``[a]nybody who recognizes Israel will burn in \n     the fire of the Islamic nations' fury'';\n       Whereas the Department of State has designated Iran as a \n     state sponsor of terrorism that has repeatedly provided \n     support for acts of international terror;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran sponsors terrorist \n     organizations such as Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the \n     al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, and PFLP-GC by providing funding, \n     training, weapons, and safe haven to such organizations; and\n       Whereas the outrageous statements of Mr. Ahmadinejad are \n     not in accord with the expressions of the Palestinian \n     leadership in the peace process: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) thoroughly repudiates the anti-Israel sentiments \n     expressed by the President of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, on \n     October 26, 2005; and\n       (2) calls on the President, on behalf of the United States, \n     to thoroughly repudiate, in the strongest terms possible, the \n     statement by Mr. Ahmadinejad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/27/senate-section/article/S12030-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12030-S12036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Today, the Senate completed action on the Labor-HHS-\nEducation appropriations bill, a splendid job by Senator Specter and \nSenator Harkin in moving the bill along. That is the fastest I can \nrecall that measure clearing the Senate, certainly in recent years.\n  As the majority leader announced earlier today, we will be in session \ntomorrow, but there will not be any votes. We will not have any votes \nduring Monday's session. So Senators should expect a busy week as we \nconsider the deficit reduction omnibus reconciliation bill.\n  In that regard, I ask unanimous consent that at 4 p.m. on Monday, \nOctober 31, the Senate proceed to S. 1932, the 2005 deficit reduction \nbill, and it be considered under the following statutory time \nagreement, with time divided as follows: The first hour on Monday under \nthe control of the chairman of the Budget Committee; provided further \nthat the Senate then resume the bill on Tuesday, November 1, at 9 a.m., \nwith the time until 8 divided between the chairman and ranking member, \nwith 4\\1/2\\ hours under the control of the chairman and 5\\1/2\\ hours \nunder the control of the ranking member; provided further that the \nSenate recess from 12:30 to 2 for the weekly policy luncheons; provided \nthat any votes ordered on Tuesday be postponed to occur at a time \ndetermined by the leader after consultation with the Democratic leader.\n  I further ask consent that the Senate then resume the bill on \nWednesday, November 2, with the time from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. equally \ndivided between the chairman and ranking member; provided further that \nat 6 p.m. on Wednesday all time be considered expired.\n  Before the Chair rules, it is my understanding that Senators Gregg \nand Conrad have agreed that we will have 1 hour of debate on Monday. We \nwill then resume the deficit reduction measure on Tuesday, with debate \nuntil 8. Any votes ordered on Tuesday would be stacked to occur at a \nlater time. We would then resume the bill on Wednesday, with all time \nexpired at 6 p.m.\n  The Budget Act allows for amendments to be offered and voted on \nbeyond the statutory time limit, the so-called vote-arama that we look \nforward to every year. I would hope that we would not have a vote-\narama, but understanding that Members will offer amendments after the \nexpiration of time, we would begin those sequenced votes on Thursday.\n  We will proceed until complete, and we all hope that will be a short \ntime thereafter.\n  In any event, we would stop in the late afternoon on Thursday and \nresume on Friday if, and only if, that becomes necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/27/senate-section/article/S12037-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
