Mr. President, this morning we will start a series of \nvotes on motions to instruct conferees with respect to the tax relief \nbill. There could be up to as many as 16 votes on these motions and, \ntherefore, votes will be kept to 10 minutes in length. I hope there \nwill be fewer votes, and we will be working this morning to see if \nthere is any way to lessen that number. Voting will begin momentarily, \nand thus Members should stay close to the Chamber today during these \nstacked votes so that we can move expeditiously. We will be recessing \nfor lunch to accommodate the party luncheons, and we will lock in the \ntime for that recess later in the morning. I would expect that we would \ncontinue the voting sequence around 2:15 after the luncheons today.\n  Following the appointment of conferees to the tax relief bill, we \nwill be returning to the asbestos bill. As Members know, we filed \ncloture on the asbestos bill last night and that vote is scheduled to \noccur Wednesday morning.\n\n\n                          Filing of Amendments\n\n  Under the rule, first-degree amendments need to be filed by 1 p.m. \ntoday to be considered in order postcloture. We will likely be in \nrecess at that time, so I ask unanimous consent that the deadline be \nuntil 2:30 today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, when we return to the asbestos bill later \ntoday, we have the motion to waive pending, and we will be talking to \nthe two managers this morning to determine the best time for that vote \nto occur today. Having said that, we are going to have a very busy day \nwith votes, and Senators should not stray far from the Chamber in order \nto not miss any votes so that we can accomplish all that we have set \nout to do over the course of the day.\n  We are ready to start with the motions and voting. Chairman Grassley \nis on his way. We can have the Senator from Massachusetts start, if he \nis ready. Senator Grassley should be here within the next couple of \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/14/senate-section/article/S1135-7", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand that in the order that has \nbeen printed, the first instruction is by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nGrassley, which includes both the alternative minimum tax relief and \nthe tax cuts for dividends and capital gains. I understand that he has \n2 minutes to speak in favor of that and there are 2 minutes in \nopposition to it. I, at this time, will use part of the 2 minutes in \nopposition.\n  I see the ranking member and I would suggest a brief quorum call so \nhe may speak in opposition to the Grassley motion. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to give a list of pending \nmotions, and I ask unanimous consent that the time not be charged \nagainst the 2 minutes allocated to explaining the motion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the list of motions to instruct that we \nhave thus far are in this order: No. 1 is the Grassley motion regarding \nAMT asking for both AMT relief and tax cuts. No. 2 is the Kennedy \ncapital gains motion, which is in opposition to the former. No. 3 is \nthe Lott motion on AMT. No. 4 is Senator Menendez's AMT capital gains. \nNo. 5 is Senator Santorum with respect to tuition deduction. No. 6 is \nSenator Schumer with respect to tuition deduction. No. 7 is Senator \nHatch's motion with respect to R No. 8 is Senator Stabenow's motion \nwith respect to R and capital gains. That is where we are at this \npoint. That is eight. There are a total of 16 on my list, and it is my \nhope that by the time we get through the eight maybe Senators will be a \nlittle less inclined to insist on recorded votes. But those are the \nfirst 8, with a total of 16 motions to instruct, which I understand \nwill all be in order this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Motions to Instruct Conferees\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, would it be in order to call up my \nmotion on the AMT and the capital gains dividend?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's motion is now \npending.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have 1 minute?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Two minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, 16 million additional American families \ncould find themselves subject to the alternative minimum tax if we do \nnot act quickly. Failure to pass a minimum level of alternative minimum \ntax relief, as was provided in the Senate-passed reconciliation bill, \nis not an option. In fact, I support full AMT repeal. Some of my \ncolleagues are creating a false choice when they suggest that in order \nto provide AMT relief we need to remove incentives that encourage \neconomic growth. We can design a tax package which will include \ndividends, capital gains, AMT, and a 1-year extension for all expiring \ntax relief, all within that $70 billion limit. I encourage my \ncolleagues to vote for this motion which provides relief for \nalternative minimum tax and capital gains and dividends as well.\n  I yield.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \nmotion. Why is that? Essentially, we must choose between extending \nprotection from the AMT tax increase this year for 17 million working \nfamilies or extending $50 billion in investor tax breaks which do not \nexpire until 3 years from now, after the next Presidential election. \nThat is the choice.\n  This motion says you can have it all. This motion says there is no \ndeficit problem. This motion says: Don't worry, be happy. Our Senate \nbill, supported by 66 Senators, chose to protect millions of working \nfamilies from the 2006 AMT hit rather than extending 2009 tax breaks \nfor investors. The truth is, we cannot have it all. There is a deficit \nproblem. Something will have to give, and I wish we could realistically \nhope the House will be willing to agree to a significant amount of \noffsets, crackdowns on tax shelters, so we could do more on this tax \nbill, but I am not optimistic. I have deep experience with the House, \nand they will not do so, and that is forcing us to choose. That is why \nwe must choose. Is it the R credit? Is it incentives for businesses \nto hire the hard-to-employ? Is it a true AMT hold-harmless?\n\n[[Page S1137]]\n\n  Those are our choices. The House made their choice. They chose not to \nprotect 17 million families threatened by the AMT. Some items can wait \nuntil 2007, 2008, or even 2009. Capital gains can wait. AMT cannot \nwait. Protection from that tax increase--that is, the AMT--which \nexpires now, must be extended this year, not capital gains. That AMT \nprotection expired in December, and 17 million working families are \nwaiting to hear our choice.\n  I urge my colleagues not to embark on this dangerous course. I urge \nthem to reject this motion. We have to choose. We cannot have it all. I \nurge my colleagues to be responsible.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if I have 10 seconds----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am only going to use 10 seconds. I hope my friend \nfrom Montana will agree with me on this, that we do have differences on \nthis one part, the capital gains part of this bill, but I think we \nagree on everything else in the bill. I hope people listening to \nSenator Baucus and I maybe differing on this one point will remember \nthat on most everything that goes on in our committee, we agree. I do \nnot want them to get a distorted view of our friendship and our working \ntogether on this legislation.\n  I yield back my time, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nis a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Grassley motion to instruct \nconferees. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand, the pending instruction \nis mine.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct. There is 4 \nminutes evenly divided.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this Senate is not going to have a \nclearer opportunity in terms of the Nation's priorities than on this \nnext vote. Under the current proposal before the Senate, it provides \nthe dividends and capital gains of $50 billion. The President's \nproposal which was submitted is $50 billion in Medicare and Medicaid \nbudget cuts.\n  We have the choice of $50 billion for the further tax reductions for \nthe wealthiest individuals or we are going to stand up on Medicare and \nMedicaid. If we care about the culture of life, we will vote for this \namendment since one-third of all the children born are born under \nMedicaid and receive well-baby treatment and mothers are treated.\n  If Members care about our seniors and disabled and those mentally \nchallenged and disabled, they will vote for this motion because it \nprotects Medicare.\n  If Members are talking about children, nursing homes, and the frail \nand elderly, Members will vote for this motion because it will preserve \nMedicaid.\n  If Members care about research and NIH and believe this is the life \nscience century, Members will not tolerate the extraordinary cuts in \nthe NIH budget in cancer and Alzheimer's research, the whole range of \nresearch, and will vote for this motion.\n  If Members care about fairness for America's families, vote for this \nmotion over giveaways to the very wealthy.\n  It is as plain and simple as that. I hope our colleagues will support \nit.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this vote has nothing to do with \nMedicare or Medicaid. This motion by Senator Kennedy calls for a tax \nincrease in 2008 on millions of Americans. Critics of lower rates \nalways want to persecute millionaires and at the same time punish \neveryone else trying to save money. The lower rates on capital gains \nhave benefited low- and middle-income families in a very meaningful way \nand reduced the tax burden on citizens. They have contributed to our \neconomic recovery and continue to help our economy grow. They have made \ncapital investment in America more competitive so we can be competitive \nwith global competition. They have helped impose transparency and \ndiscipline on corporate managers which is critical to protecting \ninvestors and workers. Business investors need certainty.\n  We need to act now. For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to \nvote against this motion.\n  I point out something that directly involves the State of \nMassachusetts. We have heard the same old charge, that capital gains \nand dividends are only for rich folks. These charts behind me assert \nthe opposite. According to Internal Revenue Service statistics on \nincome for the State of Massachusetts, there are 589,000 individuals \nand families who benefit from the reduced tax on dividends, and 212,000 \nindividuals and families benefit from the reduced tax on capital gains. \nThere are not that many millionaires in that State regardless of how \nrich that State is. Not all of these folks are superrich. They are \npeople like the average American benefiting from this.

The question is now on agreeing to \nthe motion of the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed. There are 2 \nminutes, evenly divided, of debate on this motion.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, my motion to instruct conferees is simple. \nOur Army and Marine Corps have been engaged in combat operations for \nseveral years now. Their equipment is in a very difficult situation. It \nis estimated this year alone that the Army will need about $13.7 \nbillion simply to repair the equipment, not to buy new equipment, that \nhas been used in combat. The Marine Corps will need approximately $7.5 \nbillion.\n  My instruction would simply say allocate $50 billion and pay for it \nby taking the capital gains and dividend preferences being awarded in \nthis tax reconciliation bill. I think it makes a great deal more sense \nto give our troops the best equipment we can have rather than to give \nupper income Americans another tax break.\n  It is very simple: Are we going to give our troops a dividend in good \nfunctioning equipment or are we going to give the dividend to the \nwealthiest Americans?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired. The \nSenator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Reed's attention to \nthe issue of funding for our military. Proper funding for those serving \nour country should not be controversial. The method of providing this \nfunding should not be made into a controversial issue, and that is \nwhere the controversy is.\n  My colleague suggests that in order to provide funding for our \nmilitary, we need to eliminate a tax benefit that doesn't even arise \nuntil 2009. Look at how ridiculous this motion is. How can you provide \nfunds that are so badly needed today to ensure that we meet the \noperational needs of our courageous military service personnel when it \nwon't be funded until 2009? I remind you that last night all of us \nvoted for my amendment to support the operational needs of our military \nthat provides the same benefits but doesn't raise taxes.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Reed motion. In addition, I \nremind my friend from Rhode Island that there are 79,000 families in \nhis State that benefit from not having the tax on dividends at 15 \npercent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I certainly hope our colleagues will vote to instruct conferees \non a basic issue of fairness.\n  Today, there are eight States that have sales taxes but not a State \nincome tax. Until 2 years ago, they were disadvantaged by not being \nable to deduct their sales taxes from their Federal income taxes, \nwhereas an income-tax State would allow their payers to do that.\n  It is very important in this country that we have tax equity. In \nfact, the motion to instruct would give equity to all. It creates jobs \nbecause there is more economic activity when we treat all people in our \nStates the same and allow them to deduct the State taxes they pay. It \nis a matter of fairness.\n  The States of Washington, Nevada, Wyoming, South Dakota, Texas, \nAlaska, Florida, and Tennessee all have this situation in which their \ntaxpayers will be disadvantaged if we do not instruct the conferees.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield the 1 minute on our side to the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n1 minute.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the motion clearly says that taxpayers \nwould have to choose between deducting their sales tax costs or their \nincome tax costs. If a taxpayer lives in a State that chooses to have \nboth a sales tax and an income tax, why should they be penalized? This \nmotion is not fair for the people in my State or many States such as \nmine that have both sales and income taxes.\n\n[[Page S1139]]\n\n  The Federal Government should not be micromanaging State tax systems. \nIf we have the expense, we ought to allow the deduction. If we are \ngoing to allow the deduction of State sales taxes, we should allow it \nno matter where the taxpayers live.\n  I hope we will oppose this management from the Federal Government of \nhow a State ought to conduct its tax system.\n  I yield the floor and urge opposition to the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

So if you vote against this, you are saying it is OK \nto increase the national debt. Lord knows what we have by way of debt. \nIt is drowning us and will be paid for by our children and our \ngrandchildren. It is reckless to charge $50 billion on our Nation's \ncredit card when we have another option. We can pay for these tax cuts \nby closing the egregious tax loopholes such as the $6 billion for oil \ncompanies with record earnings--on the front page of the paper this \nmorning.\n  Whether you voted for or against the bill, we should all agree that \nwe should not stick future generations with the bill.\n  That is what my motion says. It is very simple.\n  On Valentines Day, vote against increasing the national debt.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to inform the Senator from \nNew Jersey that his motion would increase taxes on people in New Jersey \nthrough dividends of $838,000 and capital gains of $270,000.\n  If we don't do something about AMT, 600,000 people from New Jersey \nsuffer; if we don't have the college tuition tax deduction, 121,000; \nand teacher deduction, 127,000.\n  I don't know how anybody would want to increase taxes on people in \ntheir States by that amount of money. If you take the approach of the \nSenator from New Jersey and have to offset all of these things, there \nare not enough offsets to go around to take care of the 100 ideas we \nhave of where taxes ought to be reduced.\n  We now have taxes of 18 percent coming into the country into the \nGross National Product for a 60-year high.\n  How high do taxes have to be to satisfy the Senator from New Jersey \nthat taxes are high enough?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the pending business is the motion to \nwaive the budget point of order, is it not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. H.R. 4297 is still the pending question.\n  Under the previous order, the Chair appoints Mr. Grassley, Mr. Kyl, \nand Mr. Baucus conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President I am very pleased that the Senate is \ntaking the necessary steps today to move forward with a reasonable tax \nrelief package. In the coming days, conferees from the Senate and the \nHouse will work together to craft a final bill for the President to \nsign. Yesterday and today, I supported a number of motions offered by \nmy colleagues to instruct our conferees to maintain the Senate's \nposition because, indeed, the Senate package enjoys bipartisan support.\n  I am very proud that the Senate legislation also includes a \nbipartisan amendment that I worked hard to develop that will stimulate \ninvestment in mine safety. Our amendment has two key components. The \nfirst provision allows accelerated depreciation to encourage mines to \ninvest in new telecommunications technology, tracking devices, improved \nbreathing apparatus, and other critical safety equipment. The second \nmajor initiative provides incentives for the creation of additional \nmine safety rescue teams. While a miner is trapped, he or she should \nnot have to wait for hours for a rescue team to arrive from far away.\n  West Virginia, Appalachia, and our entire Nation have been stunned \nand saddened by the recent mine tragedies in West Virginia, Kentucky, \nand Utah that took the lives of 18 miners and devastated families, \nfriends, and communities. I have visited our West Virginia communities \nand spoken with families and officials. In the memory of these brave \nminers, we must take bold and swift action to promote mine safety. We \nowe it to coal miners who continue to work in mines to do all we can to \nimprove their safety.\n  Coal mining is hard, dangerous work. But coal is the fuel for more \nthan 50\n\n[[Page S1140]]\n\npercent of the electricity that powers our country and enables economic \ngrowth. The miners who produce the coal deserve the best technology to \nmake our mines as safe as possible. But we must acknowledge that there \nwill be future accidents in our coal mines because of the nature of the \nindustry, and so we must also invest in additional mine rescue teams.\n  This tax package presented an immediate opportunity to promote mine \nsafety. I deeply appreciate the work and support of West Virginia's \nsenior Senator, Robert C. Byrd. We are a team when it comes to mine \nsafety and coal issues, and we are working together on additional \nlegislation that will impose strict new safety standards on the mining \nindustry.\n  I am very pleased that the mine safety tax incentives have been \nincluded in this legislation. Indeed, I believe that the bill before \nthe Senate includes many important tax provisions that we ought to \nenact without delay. Most of these tax cuts are longstanding, broadly \nsupported policies that were unfortunately allowed to expire at the end \nof last year.\n  Among the tax provisions that the Senate is acting to extend here is \nrelief from the alternate minimum tax for upper middle class families \nwho are about to be hit with a tax only ever intended for the very \nwealthy. This bill would extend AMT relief for 2006 in order to be sure \nthat families are able to benefit from the income tax cuts the Congress \nhas enacted since 2001. I support this relief, and indeed, I believe \nCongress needs to act quickly to address fundamental AMT reform. I have \ncosponsored legislation to permanently repeal the individual AMT \nbecause this so-called millionaires' tax is no longer serving its \noriginal purpose. As part of overall tax reform that is fiscally \nresponsible, Congress ought to permanently eliminate the specter of \nthis parallel tax system. For now, I am pleased to at least be able to \nsupport a bill that will protect families for this year.\n\n  This bill also extends important tax incentives for the business \ncommunity. For example, the bill extends the research and development \ntax credit to provide more than $20 billion to companies that do \ninnovative research to keep America at the forefront of the competitive \nworld economy. I have cosponsored legislation that would make the R \ntax credit permanent, but again, I am pleased to be able to at least \nsupport this bill which provides a 2-year extension of this valuable \ntax incentive.\n  I have also supported legislation to make permanent the welfare-to-\nwork tax credits. The legislation before us today improves and extends \nthese credits for 2 years. I know that many companies in West Virginia \nhave used these credits to provide work opportunities to individuals \nwho previously have been marginalized in our economy. There are many \nother provisions in this bill that enjoy my support, including an \nextension of the new markets tax credit, the creation of incentives for \nadditional charitable giving, and tax breaks for our dedicated teachers \nwho spend their own money improving the educational experiences of \ntheir students.\n  Having said that I support many of the provisions of this bill, I \nwould like to take just a few moments to discuss some reservations I \nhave with the process under which Congress is considering it. This bill \nis a tax reconciliation bill, meaning that it will enjoy some \nprocedural protections in the Senate--the costs to the Treasury need \nnot be offset and the final package can pass the Senate with a mere 51 \nvotes.\n  I fear that the reconciliation procedure being used here has put us \non a very dangerous course. As this legislation is conferenced with the \nHouse of Representatives, the reasonable, bipartisan tax relief that we \nhave passed may be replaced with partisan priorities that do not serve \nthe best interests of average Americans. The House-passed bill does not \nprovide any relief from the alternative minimum tax but instead extends \nthe capital gains and dividend tax cuts beyond 2008. In my own State of \nWest Virginia, fewer than 17 percent of taxpayers reported any taxable \ndividend income, and fewer than 11 percent of taxpayers had any taxable \ncapital gains. Indeed, nationwide, more than half of the benefits of \nthese investor tax breaks goes to people with more than $1 million in \nincome. The Senate must insist that AMT relief now is a higher priority \nthan investor tax breaks 3 years down the road.\n  The impact on the deficit, facilitated by the reconciliation process, \nis also a serious concern. I supported a substitute amendment offered \nby my colleague, Senator Conrad, which would provide all of the same \ntax relief but would have taken the fiscally responsible step of \noffsetting the losses to the Treasury. The cost of this bill could be \ncovered by closing tax loopholes and insisting that corporations and \nindividuals are not able to avoid taxes by gaming the system, including \nin some cases by simply abandoning their U.S. citizenship. I was \ndisappointed that my colleagues did not support this fiscally \nresponsible course at a time when the Treasury Secretary has informed \nus that the Congress already needs to increase the national debt limit \nto $9 trillion.\n\n  These reservations, and indeed the declared intention of some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to add investor tax breaks \nduring conference, prevented me from supporting this legislation when \nthe Senate first considered it last November. As I said at the time, \nand I would still prefer, the reasonable tax relief contained in this \nSenate bill could be passed using the normal legislative process, \ngarnering well more than 60 votes.\n  However, earlier this month, I supported this Senate bill after two \nimportant improvements. First and foremost, the mine safety tax \nincentives were added to this bill. As a representative of so many coal \nminers and their families, I will do all I can to advance measures that \nencourage additional investment in mine safety. I was also encouraged \nthat during consideration in early February, the Senate passed an \namendment offered by Senator Menendez, by a vote of 73 to 24. That \namendment expresses the sense of the Senate that relief from the \nalternative minimum tax should take precedence over any additional tax \ncuts for capital gains and dividend income.\n  I hope to work with my colleagues as differences between the House \nand Senate bills are resolved. I hope that we can work together to \nenact reasonable tax relief that enjoys broad bipartisan support. And I \nwill fight to be sure that the tax incentives for investment in mine \nsafety are maintained in the final legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/14/senate-section/article/S1140-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1140-S1169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FAIRNESS IN ASBESTOS INJURY RESOLUTION ACT OF 2005--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 852) to create a fair and efficient system to \n     resolve claims of victims for bodily injury caused by \n     asbestos exposure, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Frist (for Specter/Leahy) amendment No. 2746, in the nature \n     of a substitute.\n       Specter modified amendment No. 2747 (to amendment No. \n     2746), to provide guidelines in determining which defendant \n     participants may receive inequity adjustments the \n     Administrator shall give preference.\n       Kyl amendment No. 2754 (to amendment No. 2746), to reduce \n     the impact of the trust fund on smaller companies and to \n     expand hardship adjustments.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to waive the point of order is the \npending question.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the point of order which has been raised \nhas no substance on the merits. The point of order has no substance on \nthe merits because there is no Federal funding involved in the \nlegislation which creates a $140 billion trust fund. All of the money \ncomes from private sources, from manufacturers, and from the insurance \ncompanies under the agreement reached by Senator Frist, the Republican \nmajority leader, and then-Senator Daschle, the Democratic minority \nleader, establishing this trust fund.\n  The Congressional Budget Office filed a letter yesterday, February \n13, on the substitute which was offered. Instead of having a managers' \npackage of some 47 amendments, which could have been considered one by \none, they were added to the original text of S. 852 as a substitute \nbill.\n  The Congressional Budget Office letter made the essential conclusion \nthat the substitute is budget neutral. The key paragraph reads as \nfollows:\n\n\n[[Page S1141]]\n\n\n       CBO also estimates that, so long as the fund's \n     administrator does not borrow amounts beyond the means of the \n     fund to repay (as the bill would require), the government's \n     general funds would not be used to pay asbestos claims. \n     Furthermore, section 406 of the bill states that the \n     legislation would not obligate the federal government to pay \n     any part of an award under the bill if the amounts in the \n     asbestos fund are inadequate.\n\n  This is the crucial line:\n\n       Thus, CBO concludes that the legislation would be deficit-\n     neutral over the life of the fund.\n\n  So as a matter of the merits, the point of order has no substance \nbecause there is no Federal funding involved.\n  The argument which was made last Thursday by the Senator from Nevada, \nMr. Ensign, was that some future Congress might obligate the Government \nto pay money. The obvious response to that, which I made on Thursday \nand repeat now, is that this Congress should not try to bind what some \nfuture Congress may do. It is difficult enough for us to decide what is \nthe appropriate course of action in the year 2006, without trying to \nlook ahead, as this budget point of order contemplates, for a 10-year \nperiod, from the year 2016 to the year 2055, on payments in excess of \nsome $5 billion over a 10-year period.\n  The underlying merits of the bill, I think, have been established. \nYou have a chaotic situation today where litigation costs on asbestos \nclaims eat up 58 cents on the dollar, so that claimants only get 42 \ncents on the dollar. This has resulted in some 77 companies going \nbankrupt. Some $70 billion has been expended. The courts are \noverburdened, leading the Supreme Court of the United States to ask the \nCongress, on several occasions, to deal with this problem.\n  This legislation has been drafted and analyzed and amended and \nmodified, I think, more than any bill in the history of legislative \naction. I know that is a grandiose statement. I made it last week, and \nI repeat it today. I would challenge anybody who knows of any bill \nwhich is as complicated to step forward.\n  Shortly after the bill was reported out of the Judiciary Committee in \nJuly of 2003, I asked a distinguished senior Federal judge, Edward R. \nBecker, who had been chief judge of the Third Circuit, to undertake the \nmediation of the great many complex issues involved. For 2 days in \nAugust of 2003, Judge Becker and I met with about 20 so-called \nstakeholders in his chambers in Philadelphia, the stakeholders being \nthe manufacturers, the insurers, the trial lawyers, and the AFL-CIO, to \ntry to work through the problems.\n  Since that time, there have been some 36 meetings held in my office. \nWe reported a bill out of the Judiciary Committee last May 26. We have \naccepted a great many amendments and are here today to move ahead with \nthe amendment process.\n  I have urged my colleagues and have talked to most of the Senators on \nan individual basis, and visited many of my colleagues in their \noffices, talked to many more on the floor when we have had a break in \nbetween votes. When I have talked to people and explained to them the \nintricacies of this complex legislation, the responses have been good. \nThere is a proposal for a medical criteria bill. I think that is not a \npreferable solution because it would not provide a fund for the \nemployees of companies which have gone bankrupt, nor would it provide \nfunds for the veterans who have sustained their damages at shipyards or \nin military service. But that is something which could be debated and \nvoted upon before cloture is invoked, or perhaps a germane amendment \ncan be drafted which would survive cloture, which is scheduled for \ntomorrow.\n\n  But, in any event, it is my expectation that we ought to be ready to \nvote some time this afternoon. So I urge any of my colleagues who have \nanything to say about this budget point of order to come to the floor \nso we may debate the issue and be prepared to vote.\n  In the absence of any Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from California \nis preparing to take the floor.\n  I wish to present a chart. I am not big on charts, but I think this \nis one which has some special significance; and that is, there were \nsome projections which were made by the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nConrad, last week about asbestos claims going up, which is simply not \nfactual. The fact is--as this chart shows--these are findings from the \nCongressional Budget Office, which show the projection of asbestos \nclaims in a sharp decline. This is based upon the fact that the latency \nperiod for asbestos to produce damage is some 30 years. They are going \nto be on a sharp decline, which is one of the reasons the Congressional \nBudget Office has estimated that $140 billion is more than sufficient.\n  The other chart I want to put up is the key paragraph which comes \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office report. This is the critical \nparagraph in which CBO concludes definitively that the FAIR Act is \ndeficit neutral:\n\n       CBO also estimates that, so long as the fund's \n     administrator does not borrow amounts beyond the means of the \n     fund to repay (as the bill would require), the government's \n     general funds would not be used to pay asbestos claims. \n     Furthermore, section 406 of the bill states that the \n     legislation would not obligate the federal government to pay \n     any part of an award under the bill if the amounts in the \n     asbestos fund are inadequate. Thus, CBO concludes that the \n     legislation would be deficit-neutral over the life of the \n     fund.\n\n  The line in red is the conclusion, which is the most emphatic: \n``Thus, CBO concludes that the legislation would be deficit-neutral \nover the life of the fund.''\n  So what you have here is a private trust fund taking care of people \nwho have asbestos-related injuries, where the companies have gone \nbankrupt and they have no one to collect from, where you would be \nstopping the tremendous clogging of the Federal courts, where the \nSupreme Court has asked Congress to act, and where you have a situation \nwhere people can collect for their damages.\n  I note the Senator from California is on the floor of the Senate. So \nat this time, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee. \nI note that the ranking member is here also. If he would like to go \nahead of me, I have no problem with that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from California has been a \nstrong and consistent voice on this issue. I will follow her. Thank \nyou.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator very much for that.\n  Mr. President, let me give you at least my bottom line of this bill. \nUp to 2004, 74 American companies had been bankrupted. Salaries have \nbeen diminished for a large number of people. More people are thrown \ninto the unemployment market as a product of bankruptcy. Victims \nreceive less than 50 percent on the settlement dollar. Those are facts. \nIt is deeply disturbing to me. I deeply believe that a no-fault fund, \nwhich has a medical board that evaluates the medical condition of an \nindividual and automatically grants that individual an amount of money, \nis a much sounder way to go.\n  Now, clearly, this is complicated legislation and there are difficult \nand technical issues involved. But a lot of misinformation has plagued \nthe asbestos debate, and it continues to be repeated. I cannot say we \nhave a perfect bill, but we have tried, and tried very hard. This has \nnot been a take-it-or-leave-it bill. The chairman and the ranking \nmember have been open to suggestions. They have been open to requests \nfor amendments. There will be a substitute amendment that further \nrefines the bill.\n  Today, I want to discuss the concerns raised by those who oppose the \nbill and provide what I hope are important points.\n  On Thursday, one Senator argued:\n\n       It really comes down to a very basic question--the question \n     of whether or not this bill has been carefully crafted, \n     whether or not it contains enough money in the trust fund to \n     compensate the hundreds of thousands of asbestos victims that \n     will have to count on it.\n\n  Let me address the beginning of that statement, Mr. President. I \ncannot think of any other bill where more\n\n[[Page S1142]]\n\ntime, more effort, and more man-hours have been committed to thoroughly \nunderstanding and trying to address all of the complex issues, and even \nto respond to the hypothetical issues that might potentially come up. \nThe drafters of this legislation have worked for literally thousands of \nhours through the process of dozens of meetings over the past six \nyears. The Judiciary Committee has held at least 8 hearings on the \nasbestos bill--4 just in the past year--and has heard testimony from 57 \nwitnesses. We have met with experts from all sides who currently \nevaluate asbestos claims and make statistical projections for \ncompanies, for victims, and the courts. We met with doctors, victims, \ncorporate CEOs, and general counsels. We met with trial lawyers, \ninsurance representatives, and individuals who work for asbestos \nbankruptcy trusts.\n  I recognize that there are real concerns from the opponents of the \nbill. Some people are unsatisfied with some of the compromises that \nhave been incorporated. But to assert that the legislation was not \ncarefully drafted is one argument that has no basis in reality.\n  Now for the second part of the argument. Again, it is important to \nremember the history. Through this extensive consultation process, it \nbecame clear that there was an expected range of claims that could come \ninto the fund. From this, several different experts, including Goldman \nSachs, calculated the amount of funding necessary to cover the claims' \nvalues that the bill provided and the number of claims that the fund \nwould pay based on the range of claims.\n  We learned that the amount necessary to create a national trust was \nbetween $90 billion and $155 billion. The legislation now on the floor \nhas funding of $140 billion--clearly, on the high side of the range of \nwhat the technical experts expect.\n  I also think it is important to remember that previous versions of \nthe asbestos bill had significantly less guaranteed contributions. S. \n1125 provided $108 billion, with a $45 billion contingent fund. S. 2290 \nprovided $104 billion, with a $10 billion contingent fund. However, \neach of these bills assumed that part of the money to pay claims would \nbe collected through interest on savings. They did not meet the full \nfunding through guaranteed contributions by businesses and insurers as \nthis bill does. That is a significant difference.\n  The underlying assumption of the prior two bills was that the amount \nof money being paid into the trust would be more than sufficient to pay \nclaims and, instead, there would be an excess that the administrator \ncould invest to help build the trust fund's assets. So the amount of \nmoney being paid into the fund was much less than $108 billion and $104 \nbillion. In addition, neither of those bills contained provisions to \nguarantee that the remaining companies would be required to make up any \npotential shortfall. Yet the bill on the floor of the Senate today is \nover $30 billion above S. 1125 and S. 2290 in guaranteed contributions, \nwith no contingency funding.\n  In addition, when the CBO was asked to evaluate how much money the \nfund would need to pay claims, it projected that ``the proposed fund \nwould be presented with valid claims worth $120 billion to $150 \nbillion.'' This is the CBO language:\n\n       CBO expects that the value of valid claims likely to be \n     submitted to the fund over the next 50 years could be between \n     $120 billion and $150 billion, not including possible \n     financing (debt service costs) costs and administrative \n     expenses.\n\n  Again, $140 billion is well within the expected range. I think it is \nalso important to note that throughout the process, the medical \ncriteria has been tightened. I don't believe anybody really speaks to \nthis. One category of claims--individuals who had lung cancer but no \nunderlying asbestos markers--has been eliminated from the bill. An \nInstitute of Medicine study has been added to the legislation that \nrequires an evaluation of the link between asbestos exposure and \ncancer, other than lung cancer. If that link cannot be established by \nthe IOM, then those claims will not receive compensation. With these \nmodifications, the number of claims coming into the trust will be \nsubstantially reduced.\n  Finally, many protections have been put in place that ensure that if, \nin the long run, the trust does not have sufficient funding to cover \nall claims, individuals will be returned to the tort system--the very \nsolution opponents are advocating now. So if the trust were to run out \nof money, the individual would go back to the tort system.\n\n  Some opponents also argue that passage of this act would lead to \nfederalizing the responsibility for asbestos claims. We just heard this \nin the Democratic Caucus. It is this argument that is being used to \nmake the case for a budget point of order against the bill. Some \nopponents have argued that the trust creates a new, albeit capped, \nentitlement for claimants. However, this statement is very misleading.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, entitlement programs \nare a form of mandatory spending which require the payment of benefits \nto persons if specific criteria established in the authorized law are \nmet. If one only looked at the first part of the definition of \nentitlement, this concern may be understood. However, CRS further \nstates that entitlements are not subject to discretionary appropriation \nfrom Congress. Instead, they are subject to mandatory appropriations. \nEntitlement payments are legal obligations of the Federal Government, \nand beneficiaries can sue to compel full payment. This is not the case \nhere.\n  Let me state that again. This is not the case here. The trust fund \ncreated by this legislation will be privately funded. The money \ncollected for the trust comes from businesses and insurance companies. \nIt does not come from the U.S. Treasury. While some opponents \nacknowledge that the Federal Government must play a role in the trust \nfund for it to be classified as an entitlement, they inaccurately \nconclude that if an individual satisfies the medical criteria and \nfiling deadlines, then he or she is entitled to compensation from the \nFederal Government. This is not true.\n  Although the program will be housed in the Department of Labor, the \nbill ensures that all expenses, including administrative expenses, are \npaid by the moneys collected from businesses and insurers. In addition, \nas an extra protection, it is expressly stated several times throughout \nthe bill that the United States, or the U.S. Treasury, will in no way \nbe required to satisfy any claim or any costs if the amount in the \ntrust is inadequate.\n  This bill expressly provides:\n\n       Repayment of moneys borrowed by the administrator is \n     limited solely to amounts available in the fund.\n\n  It also states that nothing in this act shall be construed to create \nany obligation of funding from the U.S. Government, including any \nborrowing authorized. Read section 406(b). This is what the opponents \nsay is not there. This is the face of the bill. It is there:\n\n       Nothing in this act shall be construed to create an \n     obligation of funding from the United States Government . . . \n     or obligate the United States Government to pay any award or \n     part of an award, if amounts in the fund are inadequate.\n\n  I don't know what better guarantee there can be. If someone can \nsuggest one, I am sure the chairman and the ranking member, and \ncertainly myself, would agree to add it to the bill. With these \nexplicit statements throughout the bill, it is abundantly clear that \nthis legislation will not be a burden on the U.S. Treasury.\n  While Congress can obviously pass any law it so chooses in the \nfuture, this bill specifically states multiple times in the text that \ntaxpayers and the U.S. Treasury will in no way be required to cover any \nshortfall, any administrative costs, any debt or interest costs, or any \ncosts incurred by the trust fund. Therefore, the only way taxpayers \nwill be called upon to subsidize this legislation is if a future \nCongress chooses to pass, and the President signs, new legislation \nwhich would create such an obligation. This seems to me very \nunrealistic and highly unlikely. But even if it were to come to pass, \nwe should not defeat this bill because of what some other Congress and \nsome other President may or may not do at some time in the future.\n  Opponents also argue that the Federal Government's liability is \nlikely to arise through the debt service. They argue that the \nadministrator could borrow beyond the fund's ability to repay the \nTreasury.\n  I wish to respond to that. This statement ignores the plain text of \nthe bill.\n\n[[Page S1143]]\n\nThe administrator's ability to borrow funds from the Federal Financing \nBank is only available for the first 5 years. Section 221 states:\n\n       The administrator may borrow from the Federal Financing \n     Bank in accordance with section 6 of the Federal Financing \n     Bank Act of 1973 as needed for performance of the \n     Administrator's duties under this Act for the first 5 years.\n\n  So for the first 5 years, there can be some borrowing. How is that \nborrowing limited and how is the loan paid back? This same section \nspecifically limits the borrowing capacity of the administrator so that \nhe or she may not overextend the fund's assets by borrowing beyond what \nthe trust fund will be able to repay.\n  Again, section 221 states:\n\n       The maximum amount that may be borrowed under this \n     subsection at any given time is the amount that, taking into \n     account all payment obligations related to all previous \n     amounts borrowed in accordance with this subsection and all \n     committed obligations to the fund at the time of borrowing, \n     can be repaid in full with interest in a timely fashion from \n     the available assets of the fund as of the time of borrowing, \n     and all amounts expected to be paid by participants during \n     the subsequent 10 years.\n\n  So it requires the administrator to look at what he or she could \npotentially repay and what contributions are still outstanding. It is \nhard to believe that any private lending institution would risk lending \nmoney to the trust fund which it could not clearly repay in the future. \nHowever, even if some private institution decided to take that risk, \nthe bill specifically prohibits the administrator from entering into \nsuch a financially risky transaction.\n  As I just read, the explicit language in the bill limits the \nadministrator's borrowing capacity to an amount that can be repaid in \nfull with interest from the available assets of the fund as of the time \nof borrowing and all amounts expected to be paid by participants during \nthe subsequent 10 years.\n  Finally, those who support the budget point of order argue that \ncollection of the contributions by the businesses and insurers could \nfail to materialize, leaving the U.S. taxpayer on the hook to cover the \ncosts, and we should look at that. We should look at it very carefully. \nBut this ignores explicit provisions contained in the legislation.\n  Senator Leahy and I fought hard to ensure that the payment \nobligations included in the bill were enforceable and guaranteed.\n  First, the bill gives the administrator enforcement authority to \ncompel payment by the companies, both defendant businesses and insurers \nalike.\n  Let me quote section 223. It provides:\n\n       If any participant fails to make any payment in the amount \n     of, and according to, the schedule under this Act or as \n     prescribed by the Administrator after demand and a 30-day \n     opportunity to cure the default, there shall be a lien--\n\n  Not there may be a lien; there shall be a lien, mandatory language--\n\n     for the amount of the delinquent payment (including interest) \n     upon all property and rights to property, whether real or \n     personal, belonging to such participant.\n\n  The participants of the fund are liable for the maintenance of the \nfund. I don't see how it could be any clearer.\n  The chairman of the committee who is the author of this bill is in \nthe Chamber. If someone has an amendment and comes to the chairman and \nsays: Look, we think there is an oversight here or there, it could be \ntightened up by doing X or Y, I am sure this chairman will listen. But \nthe language is very specific: If any participant fails to make any \npayment in the amount in the schedule under this act or as prescribed \nby the administrator after a demand and 30 days to pony up to cure the \ndefault, there shall be a lien for the amount of the payment, including \ninterest, upon all property and rights to property. That includes every \nbig business, every big insurance company, everyone that is in this \nfund, and it is only within that initial period that the administrator \ncan, in fact, borrow. So how people come to the conclusion that the \nGovernment is on the hook for $40 billion I will never understand. If \nthe company refuses to pay or fails to pay, the administrator must get \na lien from a court on the company's assets in order to compel payment.\n  Secondly, the bill ensures that if any one company cannot pay its \nobligation under the trust fund--and this is important--if any one \ncompany can't pay its obligation under the trust fund, the other \ncompanies must shoulder the cost.\n  Specifically, section 204(h)--please read it, opposition--Guaranteed \nPayment Surcharge, states that if the required contribution does not \ncome in,\n\n       The administrator shall assess a guaranteed payment \n     surcharge.\n\n  Here it is, section 204(h)(3):\n\n       To the extent it is insufficient to satisfy the required \n     minimum aggregate annual payment, the administrator--\n\n  Not may--\n\n     shall assess a guaranteed payment surcharge.\n\n  So the administrator shall collect any shortfall in contributions \nfrom other defendant companies. This legislation contains specific \nlanguage to require that companies pay and that if the enforcement \nmechanism should fail for any reason, the the money still comes into \nthe trust through payments from other companies.\n\n  With explicit language protecting the American taxpayer and the U.S. \nTreasury from ever having to contribute to the fund, with explicit \nlanguage limiting the administrator's borrowing authority, and with \nexplicit language ensuring that the anticipated contributions are made, \nthis legislation makes it abundantly clear that in no way, shape, or \nform can the trust harm the Federal budget.\n  Opponents of the bill argue that those of us who support the bill \nhave ``significantly distort[ed] CBO's conclusions'' and, at the same \ntime, they assert that CBO ``likely understates'' the amount of money \nneeded for the trust. They argue that because CBO uses qualifiers in \ntheir estimates such as acknowledging uncertainties in calculating the \nnumber of claims and the amounts to be paid, that one must draw the \nconclusion that CBO actually believes the cost to be much higher than \nthat which is contained in their paper. Yet time and time again, when \nCBO has been asked to review their estimate and make changes based on \nnew information, including the rather notorious Bates White study, they \nhave declined to make changes. I was in that hearing; I heard the \nDirector of CBO decline to make changes directly after the Bates White \ntestimony. With each request, CBO has refused to alter its estimate of \nthe projected costs. This is what they said in a letter to Chairman \nSpecter dated December 19, 2005:\n\n       The Bates White Report contains no new information that \n     would cause CBO to revise its cost estimate.\n\n  The size of the fund is based on the strongest statistical data and \neconomic models available. Now, that is the best that is out there. \nThat is the state of the art. Some can say it isn't enough. I can't \ncounter that. All I know is that the committee sought the best, the \ncommittee sought the most responsible.\n  As I said on the floor previously, a leading actuary with \nTillinghast-Towers Perrin, an actuarial firm for the Manville Trust, \ntestified before the committee that ``$108 billion appears to be more \nthan adequate,'' and the RAND Institute estimates the future remaining \ncosts of asbestos-related loss and expense at $130 billion. In \naddition, the new projections calculated by Tillinghast also confirm \nthat the contributions to the asbestos trust fund should be sufficient.\n  While opponents argue that the latest Tillinghast studies support \ntheir argument that there is inadequate funding, a closer analysis \nreveals that the new Tillinghast projections are actually in line with \nthe projections used to calculate the money necessary to pay claims \nunder the bill. Let me tell you how that happens.\n  The new Tillinghast claims projections include claims for foreign \nexposures as well as Manville's level VI cancers. Both of these \ncategories of claimants are ineligible for compensation under this \nbill's medical criteria. When these changes are accounted for and the \nTillinghast numbers are adjusted, their new projections fall squarely \nwithin the range that the asbestos trust fund is based on, and the \nadjusted Tillinghast numbers are actually less than CBO's projections.\n  In addition, by using a no-fault administrative system, the fund will \nsignificantly reduce the substantial transaction costs of the current \ntort system, costs which almost all experts agree consume more than \nhalf of the total amount paid out for asbestos claims.\n\n[[Page S1144]]\n\n  Remember at the beginning I said that one of the most startling \nthings to me was to realize what happens with settlements, what happens \nto the dollars of settlements. The fact is that 61 percent of all of \nthe settlement monies go for defendant costs, go for plaintiff costs, \ngo for court costs, go for legal fees. Sixty-one percent. Sixty-one \npercent, then, of any tort court sum goes not to the victim but to \nlawyers and to tort costs.\n  In addition, by using a no-fault administrative system, the fund \nsignificantly reduces the substantial transaction costs of the current \ntort system: (A) you don't need a lawyer; and (B) if you want to come \nin with a lawyer, that lawyer is limited to a 5-percent fee--not 30, \n40, 50, 60, or 70 percent of a recovery, but 5 percent.\n  According to the RAND Institute, 58 percent of the money spent on \nasbestos claims goes toward attorney's fees--31 percent to defense \nattorneys, and 27 percent to plaintiff attorneys.\n  I urge everyone to read the RAND Institute's recent study. It is 168 \npages. It describes what is happening in the tort system, and it is an \nindependent, very good analysis.\n  The bottom line: The asbestos bill needs less money to pay victims \nfair compensation since it eliminates these transaction costs which \ndrain money away from the individual.\n  This bill as amended obligates defendant and insurer participants to \ncontribute $136 billion--that is a lot of money--$136 billion to the \nfund, and at least $4 billion more would be contributed from confirmed \nbankruptcy and other asbestos compensation trust funds. In fact, CBO \nrecently estimated that the amount to be contributed by bankruptcy \ntrusts will likely be around $8 billion. Here is what CBO said:\n\n       The value of cash and financial assets of the asbestos \n     bankruptcy trust funds would be $7.5 billion in 2006 and $8.1 \n     billion when liquidated.\n\n  As I stated previously, if the projections are wrong and the amount \nof money available proves to be insufficient in the long run, victims \nwill be allowed to return to the courts. With this safety net, the \nlegislation ensures that no one is left without an avenue of recourse.\n  Some people have said there is a lack of certainty. A lack of \ncertainty is not unusual when projecting what might occur in the future \nfor the Federal budget or for future programs. I do not believe that \nuncertainty or ambiguity necessarily leads to the conclusion that the \ntrust fund will require more funding. But I would hope opponents would \nview the ambiguities for what they are--an acknowledgment that no one \ncan predict the future with 100 percent certainty, and the best anyone \ncan do is make projections using sound statistical analyses, which this \ncommittee's bill has attempted to do.\n  We don't know how many people have been exposed to asbestos and, of \ncourse, who will develop a disease--nor can we possibly know. However, \nthat should not mean that we do nothing, that we let the present \nsystem, which we know is not good, prevail. That does not mean that the \nanalyses and projections that have been done are useless, not valuable, \nor inaccurate. Instead, we have to find the best projections available, \nthe most sound, the ones that are based on sound calculation and real-\nworld experience of other trusts. That is what this legislation does.\n  Another argument made by opponents is that there will be additional \ncosts related to the debt service that could overwhelm the trust. Some \nhave declared:\n\n       Debt service contributes greatly to the trust fund's \n     insolvency, underlining the severe mismatch between the \n     timing of payments into the fund.\n\n  Opponents have said that this conclusion is based on the argument \nthat there will be a flood of claims at the start of the trust. \nHowever, this concern has also been examined and addressed through the \nprocess of drafting this bill. The so-called upfront funding has been \nsignificantly increased to the point where the trust fund now will have \n$42 billion in the first 5 years to pay claims. Under S. 2290--the old \nbill--the administrator would have collected up to $19 billion during \nthe first 3 years and only $29 billion in the first 5 years. The \ndifference is $15 billion has been added to the upfront funding of this \nbill. That is a 30-percent increase in the startup funding from what \nwas provided in the bill last Congress.\n  In addition, the Judiciary Committee adopted an amendment to speed up \nthe initial contributions by insurers, defendant companies, and \nbankruptcy trusts so that the administrator can pay claims quickly.\n  Section 204 requires the defendant companies to pay their initial \npayment within 90 days from the date of the enactment, and we are very \nserious about that. Section 212 requires the insurers to make their \nfirst payment within the same time line. And Section 402 requires the \nbankruptcy trusts to also make their first payment within the first 90 \ndays.\n  Here is what the bill says:\n\n       Each defendant participant shall file, not later than 90 \n     days; insurer participants, not later than 90 days.\n\n  This is bill language.\n\n       The assets in any trust established to provide compensation \n     shall be transferred to the fund not later than 90 days after \n     enactment.\n\n  So everything is done in this bill to move a fast start forward. \nWithin 3 months, the administrator will have collected initial payments \nfrom all the participants and will have almost $9 billion.\n  Next, the bill includes a streamlined process to settle claims of \nterminally ill individuals immediately--immediately--upon enactment of \nthis legislation. That is what is so attractive to me. Someone who has \na very short time to live, someone with mesothelioma, has a chance of \ngetting paid upfront, right away--much more than a chance, a \ncommitment. This provision ensures the terminally ill individuals will \nhave their claims processed quickly, and it should resolve some of the \nmost pressing and most expensive claims before the trust is up and \nrunning so that there will not be an overwhelming flood of claims filed \nwith the trust on day one.\n  Senator Specter included language in the statute of limitations to \ngive individuals sufficient time to file their claims--5 years--so \nthere will not be a need to rush to the fund for fear of being cut off \nand the administrator and the medical board can concentrate on the \nsickest people first.\n  Finally, as I mentioned previously, there are tight restrictions on \nhow much the administrator may borrow for the express purpose of \nensuring that the trust does not face a shortfall simply because of a \ndebt service problem.\n  I would like to address the Bates White study in a little more depth. \nWhen opponents argue that the projections are too low, many of the \narguments made to support this conclusion appear to be based on the \nBates White study.\n  During consideration of this legislation, the Committee held a \nhearing on the Bates White study and asked CBO to review its \nconclusions. I was present and listened carefully to the testimony. \nSeveral criticisms and concerns were raised about the Bates White \nstudy, its assumptions, and its methodology. Witnesses before the \nCommittee made several points that significantly undermined the \ncredibility of the Bates White study.\n\n  First, witnesses argued that the Bates White study overestimated \noccupational exposure. In determining the overall number of individuals \nwho could recover from the bill the Bates White study appears to have \ncounted every employee who ever worked in an industry where there was \nasbestos exposure. This conclusion was reached by comparing the Bates \nWhite study to the Nicholson study.\n  The Nicholson, Perkel and Selikoff study, conducted in 1982, set the \nstandard on this subject and is considered the most comprehensive \nasbestos study. It provides a good foundation for estimating the future \ncases of asbestos disease, and has been utilized in many of the models \nto develop future asbestos disease claims projections, including claims \nprojections made for the Manville Trust. Yet, Bates White's conclusions \nare almost triple Nicholson's.\n  Navigant is a consulting firm that has worked on asbestos claims \nsince the 1980s doing evaluations of claims projections and costs to \ncompanies. During the hearing, Navigant's witness explained that this \ndiscrepancy seemed to occur because Bates White simply used a straight \npercentage of the total U.S. workforce, whereas Nicholson conducted an \nextensive analysis of the industry and occupational exposure to \nasbestos.\n\n[[Page S1145]]\n\n  Next, Bates White did not make a distinction in its calculations \nbetween exposed populations and eligible populations. This means that \nin the Bates White study it appears that every person who was ever \nexposed to asbestos was counted as eligible under the trust fund. \nHowever, not all individuals who are exposed to asbestos will become \nsick, nor will all individuals who are exposed to asbestos be able to \nmeet the medical criteria and the exposure requirements necessary to \nreceive compensation.\n  While considering asbestos legislation, several witnesses have \npointed out that just because someone may have been exposed to asbestos \nat some point in their lifetime, it does not follow that they will \nbecome sick or will qualify for payment. I think this is an important \npoint and is feeding some of the misperceptions around this bill. The \nscience has not determined that every person who is exposed to asbestos \nwill get sick.\n  This is true not just because each individual is different from one \nanother and has differences in their immune systems, but because \ndeveloping an asbestos-related disease usually requires prolonged and \nsustained exposure. Asbestos is a naturally-occurring mineral and most \nof us have been exposed to asbestos dust simply by walking outdoors. \nHowever, the current science concludes that casual contact is rarely \nsufficient to develop an asbestos disease.\n  Dr. James Crapo is Professor of Medicine at the National Jewish \nMedical and Research Center. He has more than 25 years of experience \nwith asbestos-related issues, including medical research and clinical \ntreatment of patients suffering from asbestos-related diseases and has \npublished in the field of environmental toxicology, including the basis \nof asbestos-induced lung injury.\n  He testified that:\n\n       All of us are exposed to asbestos from the environment and \n     consequently have asbestos in our lungs. This background \n     level of exposure does not cause any asbestos-related \n     disease. Those diseases normally require substantial \n     occupational exposures or the equivalent.\n\n  In addition, the Navigant and the labor witnesses pointed out that \nthe Bates White study did not seem to take into account that exposure \nrates within certain occupations decreased over time. This means that \nthe Bates White study did not account for the fact that as companies \nbecame more aware of the dangers of asbestos they often did more to \nprotect their workers.\n  The committee also heard from Dr. Laura Stewart Welch, a board-\ncertified physician in internal medicine and occupational medicine. She \nhas an active medical practice and treated many workers with asbestos-\nrelated disorders. She is currently medical director for The Center to \nProtect Workers Rights, a research institute affiliated with the \nBuilding and Construction Trades department of the AFL-CIO, and has \nauthored over 50 peer-reviewed publications and technical reports in \nthe field of occupational and environmental medicine, including papers \ndescribing the findings of asbestos-related disease in this group of \nconstruction workers.\n  She pointed out that the overall number from which Dr. Bates \ncalculated the claims that will go into the trust is at least ten times \ntoo big. She explained that Dr. Bates extrapolated from a study that \nuses 2-3 fiber years as the basis for what constitutes significant \nexposure. The reference to fiber years is a way to calculate how much \nasbestos an individual has been exposed to. However, the legislation \nrequires at least 25-40 fiber years to constitute significant exposure. \nSo the legislation requires a much higher level of exposure to qualify.\n  Witnesses concluded that by failing to adequately consider each of \nthese factors, the Bates White study provided a significant \noverestimation of claims.\n  Next, the committee heard testimony that argued the estimates made by \nthe Bates White study do not reflect current experiences. The Bates \nWhite study asserts that by creating a no-fault system there will be a \nhuge increase in filing of other cancer claims because it is no-fault \nrather than the adversarial system in the courts. However, the Manville \nTrust has similar, and in some cases exactly the same, medical criteria \nas the criteria in the FAIR Act, and it does not have litigation costs \nnor the deterrent of the adversarial system.\n  The Manville Trust was formed in 1988, and is the first and largest \nasbestos trust. In fact, it is not just the largest asbestos trust, but \nit is the largest toxic tort or personal injury trust of any kind. As \nof mid-2005 the trust had paid about $3.3 billion to settle 655,096 \nclaims. The Manville Trust has gained so much experience in the field \nof asbestos claims settlements that it plans to begin offering claims-\nresolution services to other companies. Therefore, the experience of \nthe Manville Trust should be considered a fair starting point for \nprojections.\n\n  When comparing the Bates White study to Manville, witnesses from the \ncommittee hearing asserted Bates White projections are four times \nhigher for other cancers than Manville. This was viewed as well outside \na reasonable difference.\n  In addition, witnesses pointed out that there are several evidentiary \nrequirements that do not seem to be adequately accounted for. In the \ntwo areas where the Bates White study predicts significant growth in \nclaims, it does not account for the role of the physicians panel which \nis made up of three doctors who will personally review claims.\n  Lastly, the committee heard from experts who stated that the Bates \nWhite study used a methodology that has not been accepted by the \nunions, businesses, insurers, trial lawyers, CBO, the current \nbankruptcy trusts, or the courts now hearing asbestos cases.\n  For all these reasons, many of us concluded that the Bates White \nanalysis fell far outside acceptable ranges for projections. To be \nclear, throughout this process both the AFL-CIO witness as well as \nbusiness witnesses disputed the assumptions underlying the Bates White \nstudy and rejected its conclusion.\n  The next argument used by opponents is that the asbestos trust fund \nis going to fail because other trust funds have failed. This is not a \nnew concern. In fact, throughout the process we looked at previous \ntrust funds and attempted to evaluate the problems that arose.\n  The Black Lung Disability Fund was established by the Black Lung \nBenefits Revenue Act to pay black lung benefits to eligible miners \nwhose mine employment ended before 1970 or whose employers were no \nlonger in existence and therefore could not be assigned liability for \ntheir benefits. It was funded by excise taxes levied on coal sold by \nmine operators, but the Act includes language for repayable advances to \nthe fund from the U.S. Treasury. This meant that when the Black Lung \nTrust Fund's resources were inadequate to meet its obligations the U.S. \nTreasury could advance the fund money to cover the costs. This \nprovision is intentionally not included in the asbestos bill and \ninstead language stating the opposite is included.\n  It is true that the number of black lung benefit claims were vastly \nunderestimated and the costs of the black lung program were also \nunderestimated. However, while the Black Lung Fund's costs were to be \npaid by industry, by 1977, 7 years after enactment, industry had made \nvery few payments to the fund. The fund then sustained a deficit and \nthe U.S. Treasury had to pay claims because of this default by mining \ncompanies. We did not ignore the problems created by the Black Lung \nFund, rather we included several provisions in the asbestos bill to \nprevent this situation from taking place.\n  They are: explicit language prohibiting the Administrator from \nrequiring any costs to be paid by U.S. Treasury; limits on borrowing \nauthority and capacity; strong enforcement provisions if businesses \ndefault; requirements that other companies cover any potential \nshortfall; and reversion to the tort system if the trust runs out of \nmoney. I have already discussed the language in the asbestos bill to \nensure that the business and insurer contributions are made and \nenforced, and to limit how much the administrator may borrow.\n  Finally, I would like to address an overarching concern that has been \nrepeated throughout the debate. Interestingly, opponents keep arguing \nfor 100-percent certainty. I don't know when we are ever provided 100-\npercent certainty. Congress is supposed to look at all the information \navailable, hold\n\n[[Page S1146]]\n\nhearings, raise questions, draft legislation, offer amendments and then \ntry to pass a statute. That is exactly what has been done here.\n  Senators Specter and Leahy have gone well beyond what is normally \ndone around here to address problems. Every time an issue has been \nraised, they have tried to address the problem and find a solution. \nThis stands in sharp contrast to the take-it-or-leave-it process that \noften describes legislative craftsmanship.\n  To now hear my colleagues express such an intense level of outrage \nthat the bipartisan bill before the Senate does not contain adequate \ncertainty or enough compromises is hard to swallow. To argue that a \nbill should not move forward because there might be unintended \nconsequences would mean we would almost never pass legislation. And if \nwe can't pass legislation unless we can guarantee there will never be \nan unintended outcome, then we might as well pack up and go home.\n  I should say I think this is a very important bill. Let me end with \nwhat I started. People who think the tort system is the way to go, who \nthink it is OK that 61 percent of the settlement dollars go to \ntransaction costs, who think that the victims who do not get this money \nare best served by the tort system--they are going to vote to sustain \nthe point of order against the bill.\n  For those of us who believe it is the sickest victims who are going \nto be best taken care of in this trust, that this trust sets up an \norderly and medically oriented protocol for a no-fault trust system and \nthat victims are going to benefit from it and businesses will cease \ngoing into bankruptcy because of it, if you think that is a worthy \nthing, then you will vote for us.\n  I thank the Chair. I particularly thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the committee. This has not been an easy bill. I truly \nbelieve they have both done a wonderful job, in the finest interests of \nthe Senate, by working together across the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Are we operating \nunder controlled time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, first, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom California. She has talked about the daunting hours the senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania has put in on this legislation, as well as \nthose of us who have been concerned with it.\n  I note the Senator from California has spent those hours with us. She \nhas been there, her staff has been there--I don't know how many times I \nhave received calls that start with: Patrick, I have been thinking \nabout this--and off we go. Usually, that is about points to which I \nshould be paying more attention. All of that has gone toward a better \nbill.\n  The senior Senator from Pennsylvania is not on the floor looking for \npraise, but I am going to take a moment to praise him from this side of \nthe aisle. I do not know a single Senator, Republican or Democrat, who \ncame to him and said: I want to talk to you about this, who was not \ngiven a fair, thorough hearing. If they had a better way of doing it, \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania would say: Let's consider it. He and I \nwould talk about it, and if we were convinced it was a better way, it \nbecame part of the bill.\n  I have been here 31 years, as I am sometimes wont to say. My children \nremind me they had forgotten I was that old. But I have been here 31 \nyears, and I very rarely have seen a chairman of either party take that \nmuch time and effort to accommodate every single Senator. I applaud my \nfriend from Pennsylvania for doing that.\n  But the proof comes in the pudding. Because he did do that, we have \nan even better bill than when we started. We spent several years on \nthis. I recall conducting one of the first hearings on this several \nyears ago. We have done this through two different Congresses. We have \nhad numerous markups, and we have come out with a better bill. It is on \nthe floor now because it is the aggregate of great ideas.\n  This is why the point of order is so frustrating, the point of order \nthat the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said they would not \nexpect this legislation to add to the Federal debt. Yet we still have \nto face this point of order because the point of order has become for \nmany a backdoor way of killing this bill. If it is done to kill the \nbill, Senators should ask themselves what they are then faced with? I \nwill tell you what they are faced with. They are faced with thousands \nupon thousands of victims--and we are all for the victims. Lord knows \neverybody said that. But if you vote to sustain this point of order \nwhat you are telling thousands upon thousands of victims is: You are on \nyour own. You probably have no chance of getting the recovery you would \nhave here.\n  Certainly, you tell all those veterans who have no place of recovery \nthat they are gone. That is why every single veterans group I can think \nof has endorsed the legislation, the Specter-Leahy legislation. They \nhave endorsed it. That is why all those veterans organizations said: \nDon't vote to sustain this point of order.\n  I have a great deal of respect for the Senate Budget Committee. \nCertainly, I do for my friend, the ranking member, and my friend the \nchairman. But I disagree with any position that says this legislation \nwould add to our deficit. If you fully read the text of our legislation \nand the testimony of the Congressional Budget Office and the recent \nanalysis of the fiscal impact of this legislation, it does not support \nthe point of order. We have heard people who are opposed to this say \nthat somehow a privately funded trust will add to the Federal debt. \nThis week, the Congressional Budget Office made it very clear that the \ntrust fund set up under this bill does not add to the Federal debt. CBO \nstated in its letter that ``the legislation would be deficit neutral \nover the life of the fund.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that that letter from CBO be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: At the request of the Committee on the \n     Budget, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has reviewed \n     Senate Amendment No. 2746 to S. 852, the Fairness in Asbestos \n     Injury Resolution (FAIR) Act of 2005, a substitute amendment \n     that was printed in the Congressional Record on February 9, \n     2006. This review addresses the amendment's year-by-year \n     budgetary impact over the first 10 years, its aggregate \n     impact in succeeding 10-year periods, and its cumulative \n     budgetary impact over the life of the proposed Asbestos \n     Injury Claims Resolution Fund (Asbestos Fund). It also \n     addresses the potential costs of intergovernmental and \n     private-sector mandates in the legislation.\n\n\n                            Budgetary Impact\n\n       Assuming that the bill as amended is enacted before the end \n     of 2006, and based on the assumptions underlying our August \n     2005 cost estimate for S. 852, CBO estimates that payments to \n     eligible claimants, start-up costs, investment transactions, \n     and administrative expenses of the Asbestos Fund would total \n     about $64 billion over the 2006-2015 period (excluding debt-\n     service costs). Those sums would appear in the federal budget \n     as direct spending (see the table below). Over the same 10-\n     year period, we estimate that the fund would collect about \n     $58 billion from firms and insurance companies with past \n     asbestos liability and from certain private asbestos trust \n     funds. CBO expects that those sums would be treated in the \n     budget as federal revenues. In addition, the Joint Committee \n     on Taxation (JCT) estimates that enactment of the legislation \n     would lead to a reduction of about $1.1 billion in receipts \n     from corporate income taxes over the 2007-2015 period; this \n     would affect the budget totals but would not affect the \n     balances of the Asbestos Fund. Thus, CBO estimates federal \n     revenues would increase by about $57 billion over the next 10 \n     years under the bill.\n\n[[Page S1147]]\n\n\n\n                                         ESTIMATED BUDGETARY IMPACT OF S. 852, IF AMENDED BY AMENDMENT NO. 2746\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                              By fiscal year, in billions of dollars--\n                                           -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               2006       2007       2008       2009       2010       2011       2012       2013       2014       2015\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nEstimated Budget Authority................          *        8.7       23.1       11.1        5.3        4.0        5.1        5.0        4.9        4.7\nEstimated Outlays.........................          *        8.7        6.7        8.2        9.3        9.4        6.6        5.2        5.1        5.0\n \n                                                                   CHANGES IN REVENUES\n \nAsbestos Fund Revenues....................          0        8.7        7.0        8.2        9.3        9.1        4.0        4.0        4.0        4.0\nCorporate Income Taxes....................          0       -0.1       -0.2       -0.2       -0.2       -0.1       -0.1       -0.1          *          *\n                                           -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total Revenues........................          0        8.6        6.8        8.0        9.1        9.0        3.9        3.9        4.0        4.0\n \n                                                                 CHANGES IN THE DEFICIT\n \nEstimated Net Increase or Decrease (-) in           *        0.1       -0.1        0.2        0.2        0.4        2.7        1.3        1.2       1.0\n the Budget Deficit.......................\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: *= Between $50 million and -$50 million.\n\n       CBO's estimate of spending from the Asbestos Fund over the \n     2006-2015 period differs from that in CBO's August 2005 cost \n     estimate for S. 852 because we now assume a later enactment \n     date for the legislation.

CBO estimates that other provisions of the \n     amendment would not significantly affect spending or receipts \n     over the 10-year period, relative to the amounts shown in \n     CBO's earlier estimate.\n       The revenue effects shown in the table also incorporate a \n     change in CBO's cost estimate unrelated to the amendment. \n     That change involves effects of the legislation on the \n     amounts that insurers and defendant firms would deduct to \n     arrive at taxable corporate income. In CBO's earlier \n     estimate, it was judged that the amounts deducted as payments \n     made over the life of the trust fund were approximately the \n     same as would be deducted to cover claims under the current \n     tort compensation system, producing no net effects on \n     corporate income tax collections over the life of the fund.\n       This assessment has not changed. But while total deductions \n     over the life of the trust fund would not change, their \n     distribution over those years could. Larger deductions up \n     front, as a result of S. 852, could produce less revenue from \n     corporate income taxes in the earlier years, which would be \n     offset by a revenue gain in later years. Lacking any basis \n     for estimating this timing effect, CBO elected not to \n     incorporate it into its cost estimate. Recently, the Joint \n     Committee on Taxation produced an estimate of this timing \n     effect. In its estimation, receipts from corporate income \n     taxes would be reduced by about $1.1 billion over the 2007-\n     2015 period. CBO has elected to incorporate JCT's estimate of \n     this effect in its projections. That adjustment does not \n     affect spending or receipts of the proposed Asbestos Fund.\n       CBO also estimates that, so long as the fund's \n     administrator does not borrow amounts beyond the means of the \n     fund to repay (as the bill would require), the government's \n     general funds would not be used to pay asbestos claims. \n     Furthermore, section 406 of the bill states that the \n     legislation would not obligate the federal government to pay \n     any part of an award under the bill if amounts in the \n     asbestos fund are inadequate. Thus, CBO concludes that the \n     legislation would be deficit-neutral over the life of the \n     fund.\n       Substantial payments from the fund would continue well \n     after 2015. Consequently, pursuant to section 407 of H. Con. \n     Res. 95 (the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget, Fiscal Year \n     2006), CBO estimates that enacting the bill as amended would \n     cause an increase in net direct spending greater than $5 \n     billion in at least one of the 10-year periods from 2016 to \n     2055.\n\n\n                                Mandates\n\n       The proposed amendment contains the same intergovernmental \n     and private-sector mandates as the reported bill. It would \n     preempt state laws relating to asbestos claims and prevent \n     state courts from ruling on those cases. It also would \n     require state governments to comply with requests for \n     information from the Asbestos Insurers Commission. CBO \n     estimates that any cost associated with those \n     intergovernmental mandates would be insignificant and well \n     below the threshold--$64 million in 2006, adjusted annually \n     for inflation--established in the Unfunded Mandates Reform \n     Act (UMRA).\n       The proposed amendment would also impose mandates on \n     certain individuals filing claims for compensation for \n     injuries caused by exposure to asbestos; certain companies \n     with prior expenditures related to asbestos personal injury \n     claims; certain insurance companies; trusts established to \n     provide compensation for asbestos claims; health insurers; \n     and persons involved in manufacturing, processing, or selling \n     certain products containing asbestos. Based on information \n     from academic, industry, government, and other sources, CBO \n     concludes that the aggregate direct cost to the private \n     sector of complying with all of the mandates in the bill \n     would well exceed the annual threshold established by UMRA \n     ($128 million in 2006, adjusted annually for inflation).\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we would be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Mike \n     Waters, who may be reached at 226-2860.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Donald B. Marron,\n                                                  Acting Director.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Former Senator Don Nickles, with whom many of us served, \nraised this concern. The Government Accountability Office responded:\n\n       [T]o ensure the Government incurs no liability for \n     repayment of borrowing under this act, Congress may wish to \n     explicitly state repayment of borrowing is limited solely to \n     balances available in the fund.\n\n  That is precisely what we did in the FAIR Act.\n  A simple reading of the text of the bill shows that defendants and \ntheir insurers are obligated to pay $136 billion to the fund, and \nadditionally another $4 billion of the assets from existing bankruptcy \ntrusts. If this level of funding proves to be insufficient--most doubt \nit will not, but if it does--then we revert back to the tort system \nwhich we have now.\n  If we pass this legislation, thousands of people who had their health \nseverely impacted through no fault of their own because of asbestos \nwill have a chance to recover. Will some recover as much as some of the \nlucky few who were able to get through the whole tort system? No, nor \nwill their attorneys even begin to recover the huge amounts some of the \nattorneys did.\n  The private companies are required under this legislation to continue \nmaking payments to the fund even after sunset until all of the fund's \nobligations are satisfied under section 405. Even the administrative \nexpenses are paid from this private fund.\n  Finally, the bill clearly states:\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to create any \n     obligation of funding from the United States Government, \n     including any borrowing authorized . . .\n\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania and I have this as a touchstone all the \nway through, that we are not passing a piece of legislation for the \ntaxpayers to fund. We are seeking help for those who have been injured.\n  Senator Specter and I have been working on this issue for years. We \nhave carefully considered the design of the compensation program for \nasbestos victims and ways to avoid the pitfalls of other Federal \ncompensation programs that have been enacted by Congress. Many of the \ncompensation programs cited by the opponents of S. 852 were created by \nCongress with mandatory Federal spending and did not contain a \nprovision to sunset the program if it went under-funded. We rejected \nsuch proposals for asbestos legislation.\n  Many opponents of our trust fund wanted the claims processing to be \nin a private corporation. Labor groups and victims testified that \noperating this trust fund in a new, private entity would delay \ncompensation to sick victims and would entail significant \nadministrative costs. Accordingly, we agreed to house the asbestos \ntrust fund within the Department of Labor because it has expertise with \ncompensation programs. It has existing staff with relevant experience \nand critical infrastructure and contracting capabilities to ensure an \naccelerated pace to pay the sickest victims within months of enactment.\n  Members of the financial services community recently contacted my \noffice to rebut the conclusions made in the recent ``white paper'' \ndistributed by the minority staff of the Senate Budget Committee. The \ninvestment community indicates that this minority staff report \ncirculated last week dramatically overstates the financing expenses to \nbe expected under this legislation.\n\n[[Page S1148]]\n\n  This document alleges that $125 billion will be spent by the fund on \nborrowing because it vastly overstates claims projections and interest \nrates. The minority staff document ignores the fact that section 221 of \nthe legislation provides that borrowing by the trust fund will be \nwithin a 10-year time frame. The document alleges that the FAIR Act \nwill pay borrowing at an interest rate of a whopping 25 percent. This \nassumes an interest rate six times higher than the current 10-year \nTreasury bond rate.\n  In fact, the financial community opines that due to the structural \naspects of the legislative language, it is ``overwhelmingly likely that \nfinancial markets will treat the trust fund as an investment grade \ncredit'' and therefore it would have access to highly favorable \nborrowing rates.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the FIAR \nletter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Financial Institutions for\n\n\n                                              Asbestos Reform,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 10, 2006.\n     Re Senate Budget Committee Democratic Staff White Paper.\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Senators: As members of the investing community we \n     must take issue with the recent report prepared by the \n     Democratic staff of the Senate Budget Committee. This staff \n     paper flunks ``Finance 101''. The analysis by Democratic \n     staff of S. 852 displays a basic misunderstanding of the \n     financing that will occur in the proposed asbestos claims \n     trust fund. It suggests that the trust fund's obligations \n     will exceed designed contributions by a hair-raising total of \n     $150 billion in nominal terms. This suggestion lacks any \n     credible basis.\n       The Democratic staff report attributes $117 billion of this \n     $150 billion to increased financing expenses. The report \n     estimate of $125 billion in financing costs contrasts with a \n     Congressional Budget Office estimate that net financing \n     expenses for the trust will be $8 billion. This huge \n     discrepancy is the result of flawed and unrealistic \n     assumptions in the staff report.\n       The staff study projects that the trust fund will make $160 \n     billion in claims payments, vs. $130 billion estimated by the \n     CBO. In a worst case scenario where the incremental $30 \n     billion of claims would be financed by borrowing in the trust \n     fund's initial years of operation, the trust would need to \n     borrow $50 billion as opposed to the $20 billion estimated by \n     CBO.\n       Section 221 of the FAIR Act provides that borrowing by the \n     trust fund will be within a ten year time frame. Doing the \n     math, the trust fund would be borrowing $50 billion at an \n     unheard of interest rate of 25% in order to generate $125 \n     billion of net financing expenses over the ten-year borrowing \n     period. It should be noted that ten-year Treasury bonds \n     currently yield 4.54%.\n       There is not even a remote possibility that the trust fund \n     administrator will have to borrow at rates even approaching \n     25%. Structural aspects of the proposed trust, including a \n     super priority lien securing obligations of the payers, make \n     it overwhelmingly likely that financial markets will treat \n     the trust fund as an investment grade credit.\n       If the trust gets even the lowest investment grade rating \n     (BBB) and pays market rates, which are under 6%, its total \n     borrowing costs under the staffs draconian scenario would be \n     under $30 billion; a far cry from $125 billion.\n           Sincerely,\n       Financial Institutions for Asbestos Reform.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at the heart of most arguments against the \nfunding structure provided under the FAIR Act are allegations that \npredictions about the number of claims expected to come to the fund \nhave been underestimated. Over the past 5 years, the Judiciary \nCommittee received extensive testimony from a variety of auditing \ncompanies, economic analysts and existing asbestos trusts about claims \nprojections. Three years ago, a leading actuary with Tillinghast-Towers \nPerrin testified that ``$108 billion appears to be more than adequate'' \nwhile other firms estimated that $130 billion would be sufficient to \ncover the trust fund expenses.\n  It is not surprising that projections about future behavior vary from \nfirm to firm because the assumptions are different. Some professional \nanalysts have estimated that we will experience significantly less than \n$140 billion in claims and others have estimated that we will \nexperience more.\n  Last week's document produced by some staff on the Budget Committee \nassumes that $160 billion will be paid out in claims based on a worst \ncase scenario of one projection of claims activity.\n  The minority staff document circulated last week adopted claims \nprojections plainly at odds with the experience of the Manville trust \nand without consideration for the medical criteria in S. 852. The \noverwhelming majority of nonmalignant claims paid by the Manville trust \ngo to unimpaired claimants. The fund created by the FAIR Act would not \ncompensate these claims, so this significant disparity must be taken \ninto account.\n  The minority staff document also fails to account for the different \nmedical criteria for malignant claims paid by the Manville trust. \nThankfully, the CBO's estimate takes the FAIR Act's specific medical \ncriteria into account when it considered its claims projections.\n  The CBO considered all relevant estimates and met with scores of \nstake-holders, financial experts, economists and auditors in \ndetermining whether the compensation provided for victims under S. 852 \nwould be adequate. After years of analysis, they found that while \nvictim compensation could range from $120 to $150 billion, its middle \nrange estimate using its chosen claims projections would yield \napproximately $130 billion in claimant compensation, and that $140 \nbillion, plus investment income, would be sufficient to cover all \nclaims payments, administrative costs, and borrowing costs.\n  Of course opponents can seize upon worst case scenarios in an 11th \nhour attempt to scuttle this bipartisan legislation, but $130 billion \nin expected claims is the CBO's middle range and is provided for under \nour legislation.\n  Finally, opponents of this legislation contend that the fund will not \nactually receive $140 billion from the private companies obligated to \ncontribute based on their previous asbestos expenditures. In his \ntestimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Fall, then-CBO \nDirector Douglas Holtz-Eakin clearly stated that: ``CBO projects that \ntotal receipts to the fund over its lifetime would amount to about $140 \nbillion, including a small amount of interest earnings on its \nbalances.''\n  The FAIR Act contains several provisions to ensure that the \ncontributions will be collected through numerous enforcement provisions \nwhich provide the administrator with subpoena power and the ability to \npursue punitive damages for nonpayment. In addition, our legislation \ncontains a funding guarantee so that other companies will make up the \ndifference if some companies are unable to pay their own contribution.\n  Even if the fund sunsets and victims are allowed to return to the \ntort system, the private companies are nonetheless required to continue \nto pay into the fund until all of the fund's obligations from borrowing \ncosts and resolving victim claims are satisfied.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues have raised this budget point \nof order to sink the FAIR Act, but I urge them to consider the purpose \nof such budgetary mechanisms in light of the simple fact that we have \ncreated a privately financed structure that the Congressional Budget \nOffice has estimated will not add to the Federal debt.\n  This point of order is a procedural mechanism intended to promote \nfiscal discipline. In light of CBO's explicit statement that ``CBO \nconcludes that the legislation would be deficit-neutral over the life \nof the fund,'' no point of order should prevent such important, \ncompletely privately funded legislation as the FAIR Act.\n  This latest analysis from CBO reinforces the fact that the asbestos \ntrust fund legislation would not add to the Government's Federal debt. \nThe bottom line from CBO is that this bill is ``deficit-neutral.'' \nThere is no reason to sustain the budget point of order. The FAIR Act \nis the right solution for victims and businesses. This bipartisan bill \noffers fair and efficient relief to long-suffering victims of asbestos \nexposure while providing business with financial certainty and an \nalternative to bankruptcy.\n  I recently received a letter from the International Association of \nHeat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers. The workers represented \nby this union know first hand the devastation caused by asbestos, and I \nknow they would hate to see the unique opportunity we have before us be \ndestroyed by a technicality.\n\n[[Page S1149]]\n\n  They wrote:\n\n       We believe S. 852 offers the best hope of providing fair \n     and equitable compensation on a national basis for those who \n     have suffered or will suffer from the devastating effects of \n     asbestos exposure in decades to come.\n       For these reasons, we urge you to reject the budget point \n     of order, which holds the potential to kill this legislation \n     that is so important to our members.\n\n  Let us not let down the very people we are seeking to help. I ask \nunanimous consent that the letter from the International Association of \nHeat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers of February 13, 2006 be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         International Association of Heat & Frost Insulators & \n           Asbestos Workers,\n                                    Lanham, MD, February 13, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: We write you to express our concern regarding \n     the budget point of order that is currently being considered \n     with respect to the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution \n     (FAIR) Act, S. 852. It is frankly very troubling to see \n     critical legislation that impacts our members be imperiled by \n     a mere technical procedural motion.\n       The Fund at the heart of S. 852 is financed by private \n     dollars and it does not make sense to us that the legislation \n     could have any real impact in the U.S. budget. We urge you to \n     support waiving this false point of order so the Senate can \n     work on this important legislation.\n       We represent tens of thousands of members and retirees who \n     have been exposed to asbestos in the workplace.\n       We believe the current system is broken and must be fixed \n     for the current victims and the victims of the future. More \n     than seventy-five companies have gone into bankruptcy. What \n     is most disturbing to us is the fact that only 42 cents of \n     every do1lar spent goes to the victims, their widows, and \n     children.\n       We believe S. 852 offers the best hope of providing fair \n     and equitable compensation on a national basis for those who \n     have suffered or will suffer from the devastating effects of \n     asbestos exposure in decades to come.\n       We strongly support the FAIR Act. For these reasons, we \n     urge you to reject the budget point of order, which holds the \n     potential to kill this legislation that is so important to \n     our members. We believe to kill the FAIR Act on a \n     disingenuous technicality would be wrong and, as appalling as \n     the current system itself. Our members and their families \n     know the horrors of asbestos-induced disease and the \n     heartache associated with it. We also know that the problem \n     is not going away soon.\n       Senators Specter and Leahy along with many others have \n     worked extremely hard over the past three years to address \n     what almost everyone concedes is a national crisis.\n       Senators who oppose this Bill may vote against it in the \n     end, but the members of our Union (International Association \n     of Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers Union) \n     deserve to see this bill put to a final vote.\n           Sincerely,\n     James A. Grogan,\n                                                General President.\n     James P. McCourt,\n                                      General Secretary-Treasurer.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to consider all the \nwork that has gone into the crafting of this legislation including the \nspecific provisions I have highlighted in this statement making it \nabsolutely clear that the Federal Government is simply not liable under \nthis legislation.\n  The Judiciary Committee received extensive testimony from economists \nand experts in claims projections. All of this process and expertise \nwas considered as part of the Congressional Budget Office official \nestimate.\n  The CBO has testified that the FAIR Act is not predicted to add to \nthe Federal debt; therefore, it should not suffer from the budget point \nof order raised against it. I urge my colleagues to waive the point of \norder. The victims of asbestos exposure will not benefit from this \nlatest tactic to stop this legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, discussions have proceeded since this \nmorning on the point of order and the motion to waive the point of \norder, and we have come to an agreement whereby we will have a vote \nsometime around 6 o'clock tonight.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there now be 3 hours for debate in \nrelation to the motion to waive prior to a vote on the motion, with the \ntime divided as follows: 40 minutes for Senator Specter, 40 minutes for \nSenator Leahy, 40 minutes for Senator Ensign, 40 minutes for Senator \nDurbin; provided further that if the point of order is sustained, the \ntwo filed cloture motions are vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would be \nthe last to put forward my proficiency in math, but I do think that \nmath is wrong.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I modify my unanimous consent request, that \nthere now be 3 hours minus 20 minutes--2 hours 40 minutes--for debate \nwith the times as designated.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this point of \norder which has been raised is a difficult vote for Democrats and \nRepublicans. I express to my friend, the Senator from Vermont, that I \nhope my advocacy here on this issue has not offended anyone. I know \nthere was a time when it did offend my friend from Pennsylvania. I have \nalready apologized in that regard, if in fact I offended him. But \nSenator Specter, Senator Leahy, and I have been in courtrooms long \nhours, and you have to put all of this stuff behind you, no matter the \nfeeling at the time. Senator Frist has been in the operating room \ninvolved in very critical stuff. He looks at this a little differently \nthan I do, but our intent is the same. We need to have this vote, find \nout what happens there, and move on to this legislation, or whatever \nelse comes up.\n  Again, if I have offended Democrats or Republicans because of my \nadvocacy on this issue, I apologize.\n  I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, to clarify, given my math being incorrect, \nthat vote would be a little bit after 6 o'clock tonight on the motion \nto waive the point of order.\n  Mr. REID. Although people do not have to use all time.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct. It could be earlier than that. Then we \nwould not have any more rollcall votes after that vote tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am advised that Senator Hatch, Senator \nDomenici, and Senator Alexander would like time, and they are welcome \nto it if they would come to the floor. I have already spoken on this \nissue at some length and reserve my time for rebuttal.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter from the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, \ndated February 14, and a letter from the International Union, United \nAutomobile, Aerospace & Agricultural Implement Workers of America, \ndated February 13, objecting to the point of order.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, AFL-\n           CIO, CLC,\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2006.\n     Subject: FAIR Act of 2005 (S. 852).\n\n       Dear Senator: This week, the Senate continues consideration \n     of the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution (FAIR) Act of \n     2005 (S. 852), sponsored by Senators Specter and Leahy. The \n     International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT) \n     strongly supports this legislation and urges all Senators to \n     reject the technical budget point of order that has been \n     raised against the bill.\n       The asbestos trust fund that would be established by the \n     passage of this bill will be entirely financed by \n     contributions from defendant companies and insurers and will \n     have no impact on the federal budget, thereby invalidating \n     the point of order against the bill. While all of the funding \n     will be provided from private sources, the actual \n     administration of the fund will be housed within the \n     Department of Labor, causing this technical point of order to \n     be raised. The IUPAT strongly feels that housing this fund \n     within the Department of Labor will ensure that this newly \n     established trust fund is administered in an orderly and \n     professional manner that will be fair to victims. Therefore, \n     we urge all Senators to defeat this budget point of order and \n     any attempt to remove the administration of this fund from \n     the Department of Labor at this stage in the process.\n       As this process moves forward, the IUPAT strongly believes \n     that the FAIR Act represents the best opportunity to provide \n     timely, equitable compensation to the victims of\n\n[[Page S1150]]\n\n     asbestos related diseases. We urge you to reject the budget \n     points of order and any other obvious attempts that seek to \n     derail the bill or weaken any of its core provisions.\n       Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                James A. Williams,\n     General President.\n                                  ____\n\n         International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & \n           Agricultural Implement Workers of America--UAW,\n                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: This week the Senate is expected to continue \n     consideration of the Specter-Leahy asbestos compensation \n     legislation, the FAIR Act (S. 852). The UAW strongly supports \n     this critically important legislation.\n       We are pleased that Senators Specter and Leahy have offered \n     a manager's amendment that substantially addresses various \n     concerns that have been raised by some unions. Specifically, \n     this amendment will:\n       Clarify that binding settlements between victims and \n     defendants will be preserved, not canceled by the bill;\n       Expressly state that civil rights and disability claims are \n     not pre-empted by the bill;\n       Establish a paralegal program to help asbestos victims \n     process claims before the trust fund, and allow lawyers to \n     collect additional attorneys fees beyond the 5% cap for work \n     on administrative appeals;\n       Ensure that individuals with both asbestos and silica \n     disease who are sufficiently impaired to satisfy medical \n     criteria for levels III, IV and V will in fact receive \n     compensation under these higher award levels, and will not be \n     required to rule out silica exposure as a ``more likely \n     cause'' of their impairment;\n       Allow increased awards for mesothelioma victims with \n     dependent children;\n       Improve the start up provisions so that non-exigent \n     claimants may continue to receive payments from existing \n     bankruptcy trusts, and thus will not have to wait for lengthy \n     periods of time to begin receiving compensation; and\n       Improve the sunset provisions, both by requiring an \n     independent audit of the status of the asbestos compensation \n     trust fund, and by requiring the administrator's annual \n     reports to be more comprehensive.\n       The UAW commends Senators Specter and Leahy for proposing \n     these improvements to S. 852. We urge Senators to approve the \n     manager's amendment.\n       At the same time, the UAW strongly urges Senators to vote \n     against the technical budget point of order that has been \n     raised against the bill. Because the asbestos compensation \n     trust fund is financed entirely by contributions from \n     corporations and insurers, there should not be any valid \n     point of order against the bill. The only reason a technical \n     point of order exists is because the asbestos compensation \n     program would be administered by the Department of Labor. \n     This is something the entire labor movement has supported, to \n     ensure that the program is administered in a competent manner \n     that is fair to victims. The UAW urges Senators to reject the \n     technical budget point of order, both because it could \n     threaten the provisions that involve the Labor Department in \n     the administration of the program, and because it represents \n     an obvious attempt to kill the entire legislation.\n       The UAW firmly believes that the FAIR Act is the best \n     opportunity to establish a program that will provide prompt, \n     equitable compensation to the victims of asbestos related \n     diseases. We urge you to reject amendments that seek to \n     undermine this legislation, to support cloture to cut off \n     debate on this measure, and to support passage of the overall \n     bill.\n       Thank you for considering our views on this measure.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alan Reuther,\n                                             Legislative Director.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nappropriate time the Senator from Montana gain the floor and that he be \ngranted 10 minutes of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to you again about a \nspecial place in my state, Libby, MT.\n\n  It is important for my colleagues to know that the vote on the budget \npoint of order affects the lives of Libby residents dramatically.\n  It affects the thousands of people who are sick and the hundreds more \nwho will die.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote on the merits of this bill. Budget points \nof order should not be misused. They should not impede consideration of \nthis important legislation.\n  The budget point of order should not be used to hurt the folks in \nLibby. They have suffered enough.\n  The situation in Libby is unique. The asbestos in Libby is different. \nIt is a much different asbestos than other parts of the country. It is \nmuch more pernicious. It is wicked, awful stuff.\n  Libby is different because we are talking about community exposure to \nasbestos--not a few workers.\n  The entire Libby community was exposed to asbestos because of the \nvermiculite mine and mill.\n  Until the mid-1970s in Libby, W.R. Grace milled vermiculite from a \nmountain in Libby. W.R. Grace exposed the entire community to this \ndeadly disease.\n  I have been up there. I have been at that site. It is an unbelievably \ndusty mess.\n  This asbestos bill will make W.R. Grace pay Libby residents for the \nintentional harm this company caused these people.\n  I do not use the word ``intentional'' loosely because it was \nintentional. Documents show it was intentional. Documents show the \ncompany knew it was harmful, that it was sending this stuff out to the \npeople in Libby, and that many of them would become very ill and would \ndie.\n  Not only were mine workers employed by W.R. Grace exposed to high \nlevels of asbestos, but the mill's ventilation stack released 5,000 \npounds of asbestos every day. Mill workers swept dust outside. Often, \nthey could not even see their broom handles because it was so dirty \nwith asbestos.\n  They dumped it down the mountainside. White dust covered the entire \ntown.\n  The layers of rock where people found the vermiculite contained \nharmful asbestos and this vermiculite in Libby is laced with a \nparticularly dangerous type of asbestos, called tremolite.\n  Asbestos in Libby is tremolite asbestos rather than the more common, \nchrysotile asbestos. Tremolite asbestos is a significantly more toxic \nthan chrysotile asbestos.\n  The Libby tremolite disease process is different. It's far more \ndisabling and deadly than ordinary asbestos, as bad as ordinary \nasbestos is and 76 percent of diagnosed patients progress to serious \ndisease or death in Libby, MT.\n  Just compare this to chrysotile asbestos, where 25 percent of \ndiagnosed patients progress to serious disease or death.\n  People in Libby are uniquely affected by asbestos related disease. \nThey are sick. They suffer from asbestos-related disease at a rate 40-\nto-60 times the national average.\n  And people from Libby suffer from the asbestos cancer, mesothelioma, \nat a rate 100 times the national average.\n  The asbestos has contaminated the whole town. In addition to the \nmines and the mill, extensive asbestos contamination is found in homes, \nin ball fields, and in schools. It's found in the playgrounds and in \nthe gardens. A recent study even found asbestos contamination in the \ntree bark.\n  I have worked very hard with the Judiciary Committee and my \ncolleagues, the chairman of committee, Senator Specter, and Senator \nLeahy, ranking member, to tailor a solution that addresses the unique \nproblems in Libby. We are extremely grateful to Chairman Specter and \nSenator Leahy for all their work to protect Libby. They have worked \nvery hard. They have sent staffers to Libby, MT. They have seen it. I \nam thankful for the staff they have sent to Libby to see how bad this \nstuff is.\n\n  I urge my colleagues not to use this point of order to kill the bill \nand to kill all this hard work. Many Senators have worked very hard for \nyears to try to find a solution, a way to get compensation to people \nwho otherwise will not get compensation and who desperately deserve it. \nThe people who suffer from asbestos-related diseases need our help. \nLet's stand up for the people of Libby, MT. Let's not turn our backs on \nthem. If this bill goes down, this Senate will be turning its back on \nthe people of Libby, MT.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the point of order and vote on the \nmerits of this bill. Senators can always decide later to oppose this \nbill. There are many opportunities for Senators to reexamine their \npositions on this bill and offer amendments.\n  We should not kill this bill simply on a technical point of order. It \nwill undermine months and months of very hard work of well-meaning \npeople to try to find justice for people who are suffering from \nasbestos. Let's stand up for the people of Libby and not turn our backs \non them.\n\n[[Page S1151]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the budget point of order and vote on \nthe merits of the bill. The people of Libby have been through enough. \nThey need our help. They need it now. If you do not support the bill, \nsay so, but do not hold the people of Libby and the community of Libby \nhostage. We cannot do that. That would be grossly unfair.\n  I will do whatever it takes to continue fighting for the people of \nLibby and fighting for the justice they deserve.\n  I wish all Members of this Senate were able to sit in the living room \nof Gayla Benefield--when I first learned how bad things are in Libby--\nand look in the eyes of Les Skramstad. He is a great guy. He is dying \nfrom asbestos. He worked on the mine. He is not old. He is not an old \nman at all. He is a middle-age guy. He would go home, embrace his wife, \nthe kids would jump in his lap. They now all have asbestos-related \ndiseases. That is common.\n  I ask my colleagues, please, vote to waive this point of order so we \ncan stay on the bill, work on it, and help the people of Libby. Let's \nwork our will so these folks in Libby can get justice. W.R. Grace is \nbankrupt. People in Libby cannot get justice from them. W.R. Grace has \nturned its back on these people.\n  Let's say yes to the people of Libby and find a way for this to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous \nconsent the time be equally charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time? The time is controlled by the Senator from \nPennsylvania and the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield myself time from the time of the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, every couple of years, this august chamber \nis given a chance to make good on its billing as the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world, to set aside the predictable \npartisanship that today passes for deliberation and, instead, work \ntogether to solve a real problem besetting our Nation.\n  We face such a moment today. Later this afternoon, each of us will \nhave a choice. Either we will vote to address a litigation crisis that \nhas made a mockery of our judicial system--and demonstrate that we, as \na body, can still function when absolutely necessary--or we will use a \nclever, parliamentary maneuver to avoid having to face a problem that \nis too inconvenient and confounding to fix without political cost.\n  We have been here before, and we have failed miserably. Why? Because, \nunfortunately, the most effective legislative solution is also the most \npolitically impracticable. To solve the asbestos crisis, conservatives \nare being asked to turn a deaf ear to many of our traditional \nsupporters and endorse the very kind of Federal structure against which \nwe battle daily--a cumbersome, unwieldy program that seems to teeter on \nthe brink of obsolescence before it even begins.\n  And liberals are being asked to say enough is enough to one of their \nmost important and influential constituencies and to set aside the one \ngovernmental institution over which they feel they can still exert some \ncontrol--the courts. It is a legislative formula that seems designed \nfor failure.\n  And then there is the greed. Oh, yes, the greed. For years, Members \nfrom both sides have waxed eloquent condemning the pecuniary gluttony \nof one side or the other but, in truth, there is so much greed among so \nmany that it has obliterated any chance for an accurate debate of the \nrealities we should be confronting.\n  What are those realities? Let us be honest. By this time, we all \nunderstand that asbestos litigation has swallowed companies whole, \ndriving them into bankruptcy, wiping out jobs, careers, pensions, \nhealth care, and hope. All of us know that those who mined asbestos and \nused it to manufacture products are long gone, demolished in the first \nwave of lawsuits. All of us appreciate that today, far too many \nbusinesses are being targeted more because of their perceived wealth \nthan their presumed culpability.\n  All of us realize that under the current system, tens of thousands of \nAmericans who are the most sick, the most deserving, have no place to \nseek compensation. Veterans exposed by their government and hard \nworking men and women left sick by their now bankrupt employers have \nbecome the jetsam of this litigation--cast aside by the new potentates \nof asbestos--a small, infamous gaggle of personal injury lawyers who \nhave manipulated victims, companies, and the courts to divert billions \nand billions of dollars to their own pockets. Amazingly, not even such \na massive transfer of wealth from so many to so few is enough. Even as \nwe speak today, their lobbyists stand literally feet away, pandering \nadvice, counsel, and contributions to those who will prevent their \ndespicable avarice from being stopped.\n  But the greed can not be laid just at the feet of some lawyers. There \nare also companies who have grown weary of paying, not just the wrong \npeople, but paying for their real and technical complicity. There are \ncorporations who want to be free of mistakes they made during the \nmerger and acquisition madness of the late 1990's. And there are \nbusinesses that believe they can game the current system, relying upon \ninsurance and the inherent lethargy of litigation to delay paying what \nthey owe.\n\n  Then there are insurance companies, some of which fear having to make \ngood on the policies they sold. Even after nearly a decade of debate on \nthis issue, no one is certain exactly who is responsible, especially \nwith the tangled web of insurance and reinsurance and domestic \ninsurance and foreign reinsurance.\n  Of course, all of us know there is also an unacknowledged giant in \nthe room. For nearly half a century, the Federal Government of the \nUnited States was one of the biggest consumers and promoters of \nasbestos. Today, people are dying from mesothelioma, not because of \ncorporate misdeed but because they worked in the boiler room of a naval \nship or in a military shipyard or in the furnace room of an Army base. \nThe Government required asbestos to be used in buildings and \nworkplaces, in factories, homes, and schools. Yet today, as we discuss \nhow best to solve the asbestos epidemic, the Government's own \nresponsibility is not to be mentioned.\n  Finally, all of us know the current tragedy will not abate on its \nown. Over the last 6 years, we have proven conclusively, beyond any \nshadow of doubt, that while we have stood frozen, incapable of any, \neven the slightest remedial act, the avarice of asbestos has become an \nindustry unto itself.\n  These are the realities we face today. What are our options? Some on \nmy side of the aisle have suggested the adoption of a medical criteria \nbill, legislation that would make changes in the applicable litigation \nrules in State courts. I understand their motivation, but they have to \nappreciate that it falls short with respect to the most compelling \nplayers in this tragic tale--veterans and employees of bankrupt \ncompanies who have no place to seek relief. It does nothing to address \nthe manipulation of liability and responsibility which has become \ncommonplace at the State court level. Such a solution was inadequate 4 \nyears ago, it is inadequate today, and it will still be inadequate 2 \nyears from now.\n  Then again, at least it represents an attempt to solve this crisis. \nFor the past decade, there has been a thundering silence from too many \non the other side of the aisle. They are quick to criticize what has \nbeen suggested, but not once in more than a decade have they proposed \ntheir own solution. Not once have they come up with one idea that might \npossibly help solve this crisis, for a very good reason: their top \nhard-money contributors happen to be the people who bring these suits.\n  This year, they have raised the canard of lost days in court. They \nare like people who, when they find a man dying of thirst in the \ndesert, give him an empty glass. Now, if by some miracle you find \nwater, they proclaim, you can quench your thirst with the dignity and \ndecorum you deserve. As the man slowly dies from dehydration, they \nmarvel at their own benevolence.\n\n[[Page S1152]]\n\n  They know that a day in court is meaningless to a veteran who cannot \nsue his government or an employee who cannot sue a bankrupt company. \nThey know a day in court is worthless to those who currently are being \npaid only pennies for every dollar of their settlements. For nearly a \ndecade, their objections have been endless and their solutions \nnonexistent.\n  So, Mr. President, we arrive today at a critical juncture. We have \nrejected the suggestion of a medical criteria bill. Our choice is \nsimple: We can act or we can hide. We can vote to keep working on the \nSpecter-Leahy legislation, or we can vote for the budget point of order \nand stop the legislation dead in its tracks. It is a clever tactic, \nusing the mantle of fiscal responsibility as an excuse not to \nlegislate. Of course, leaving the asbestos crisis unresolved is the \nultimate act of fiscal irresponsibility. And, since the Specter-Leahy \nbill does not require 1 cent of Federal money--this budget point of \norder is a sham. And we all know it.\n  Or we can hide behind a cloture vote, knowing that without cloture, \nthe bill will be pulled from the floor and the status quo--the \nridiculous and irresponsible status quo--will be preserved. In today's \nworld of relentless stalemate and partisanship, it is a vote easy to \nexplain and justify. But each of us also knows these measures are \nnothing more than procedural subterfuges--some parliamentary arcanum \ndesigned to confuse the public about what is really happening. The \nSenate has failed the country on this issue before. The time really has \ncome to act.\n  The Specter-Leahy bill before us is by no means without flaws. All of \nus admit that. All of us understand that the legislation is--like major \npieces of legislation at a similar juncture--a work in progress, the \ninevitable product of a political process that to date has been as \ndysfunctional as it has been prolonged. Yet even with its shortcomings, \nthe legislation represents the best hope, the most salient chance for \nan effective legislative solution. And we will not even have a chance \nto get that far if we do not pass it on the floor of the Senate.\n  We know this is step one--actually step two in at least a four-act \nplay. The committee passed it out of the committee. If we can succeed \nin passing it out of the Senate, the House has to pass its bill, and \nthen we have to go to conference, and then the final play will be a \nvote in both Houses of Congress. In all of those steps, I have seen our \nchairman and ranking member willing to compromise and resolve problems \nas they come up, as colleagues have brought them up. They cannot blame \nthe distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania or the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont in this matter.\n  I beseech my colleagues, do not let this bill die today. Do not end \nwhat could very well be the last chance we have to solve a crisis we \nall have universally condemned. Let's stop the debilitating games and \ntactics. For once, let's give to the bill the same energy and \ncreativity that to date have been invested in its downfall and \ndestruction.\n\n  There are thousands of veterans throughout our Nation who are \nwatching us today. When the Nation asked for their service, their \nblood, they gave it willingly, without complaint. They did their part. \nNow it is time for us to do ours.\n  There are thousands and thousands of sick working men and women with \nno place to turn but us. They, too, are watching. They ask for our \nassistance, not excuses. They have asked for candor, not cold \ncalculation. They ask for compassion, not clever procedural ploys.\n  If there is any justice, we will be remembered long after we have \nleft elected office, not for the unfulfilled promises we have made or \nthe good intentions we have so readily proclaimed but for the votes \nlike the ones we will soon cast. For, in truth, this vote is about more \nthan asbestos. It may well signal the last chance this body will have \nto be productive, to break free from our respective orthodoxies and \nlegislate for the public good. Did any of us really seek public office \nso that in the face of a crisis, we could hide behind a budget point of \norder or a cloture vote?\n  The time has come to reveal who we are, who we have become. Can the \nSenate legislate in an area in which the Supreme Court has said we need \nlegislation--three times? The real frustration with this institution is \nnot a lack of ethics or the unseemly tangle of lobbyists, Members, and \ncampaigns. No. Our real failing is our collective trepidation, our fear \nof stepping free of the pack to work together to solve real problems \nwithout concern for political advantage or personal benefit.\n  If we cannot find a common will to address something as pernicious as \nthe asbestos litigation crisis, then one has to ask what real purpose \nthis legislature serves. Too often, we find it convenient to act like \nmice. Today, our country needs lions. Let us not give it mice. Vote \nagainst the budget point of order. Vote to invoke cloture. And, for \nonce, let us consider fixing the asbestos crisis with the honesty, \ncandor, and ingenuity the American people deserve.\n  Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania and the ranking member from Vermont. This has been a \nmonumentally difficult bill to bring to the floor. As I say, this is \nstep one in probably a five- or six-act play. We do not have to make it \nperfect here; we just have to do the best we can. The House then, if we \npass this bill, will have to do its work. Then conference committees \nwill have to meet together, and we will have to do the final work on \nthis bill after listening, during all of that time, to complaints, \nsuggestions, good ideas, bad ideas, but at least--at least--we will be \ndoing the people's business, the people's work in helping people who \nreally have no other place to turn.\n  Above all, we will help our country because we all know what has been \ngoing on in asbestos litigation around the country has been \nhorrendously wrong. I would like to see us do what is right today. So I \nhope we will vote against this budget point of order. And I hope we \nwill vote to invoke cloture, so we can proceed with this bill and \nhopefully get it into conference. Ultimately, that is where we will \ncontinue to work on it and see if we can make it more perfect and \nresolve some of the conflicts and problems people feel they have with \nthis bill today. I have every confidence in the chairman and ranking \nmember that they will work to do exactly that. They have been doing it \nevery day I have worked with them, and I am very proud of both of them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 10 minutes of \nSenator Leahy's time be yielded to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, in the next several hours, I expect we are \ngoing to have a critically important vote, a vote with respect to how \nwe are going to proceed or not proceed with respect to the asbestos \nlitigation reform. There is more at stake than a parliamentary \nsquabble. This is a question to say whether we are going to continue to \nhave a system where the people who are sick and dying from asbestos \nexposure are going to be quickly compensated for the harm that has been \ndone to their bodies. And there is a question as to whether companies \nwill be bankrupted by the dozens, and you continue to see that sort of \nthing happen. There is a question of whether we are going to continue \nto see a situation where a majority of the moneys that are paid out for \ndamages end up not in the pockets of those who have been harmed or \ntheir families but in the pockets of others.\n  The status quo, in my judgment, is not acceptable. We have an \nopportunity today to take an important step toward improving that \nsituation. The legislation before us today has evolved over the time \nthat I have served in the Senate. A question that has been raised again \nand again, as it should be, is: Is the money that is going to be set \naside in a trust fund that we propose to create adequate?\n  Earlier in our deliberations, the committee of jurisdiction, as they \nwrestled with this problem, trying to figure out\n\n[[Page S1153]]\n\nhow much money to ask of the defendant companies, how much to ask of \ntheir insurers--initially, I think thought was given that a $90 billion \ntrust fund would be adequate to compensate people whose breathing has \nbeen impaired by exposure to asbestos. Over time, we have seen that \nnumber raised from $90 billion to $100 billion, to $110 billion, to \n$120 billion, to $130 billion, and now to $140 billion. Still the \nquestion is asked, as it should be: Is even $140 billion adequate?\n  CBO has been asked to be the arbiter in this debate. They have come \nand testified a couple of times before the Judiciary Committee, and I \nguess they have provided letters as recently as yesterday and today to \nattempt to deal with this issue and this question: What do we do if we \nrun out of money, if the $140 billion is not enough--with the moneys \ncoming in over the next 30, 40 years, if it is not sufficient to meet \nthe demands of the claims that ought to be paid? Concerns have been \nraised, sort of leading to this budget point of order, that in the end \nthe responsibility may fall back on the taxpayers. It is a question \nthat ought to be raised and a question that ought to be answered.\n  There is nothing in this bill that is before us today that stipulates \nthat taxpayers should pay for any shortfall that may occur if the \nlegitimate demand on funds exceeds the amount of funds paid into this \ntrust fund that we propose to establish. There is nothing that \nstipulates that taxpayers would have an obligation or should have an \nobligation. In fact, the opposite is the case. The legislation clearly \nstipulates that any obligation to people who are harmed that exceeds \nthe amount of money in the trust fund would not be borne by the \ntaxpayers. CBO is not absolutely sure that $140 billion is the right \nnumber or $130 billion or $120 billion or maybe even $150 billion. But \nin reading the different letters they have submitted, and reading their \ntestimony, they believe $140 billion is in the ballpark.\n  What if they should be wrong? What if more money needs to be funneled \ninto the trust fund to meet legitimate claims? What does the trust fund \ndo? The only reason this is a budgetary issue at all is because the \nmoneys paid for by insurers and by defendants are going to go into a \ntrust fund established and administered by the Department of Labor. \nThat is why it is considered even remotely a Federal obligation--\nbecause of the desire on the part of some, including those representing \nfolks who have been injured, that the Department of Labor, that has \nbeen able to do this sort of thing and has experience in dealing with \nthese kinds of issues, should play a role. It is because the Department \nof Labor is playing a role as a conduit through which moneys are paid \nfrom the private sector, through which moneys are paid to those who are \nharmed, that there is even a question of whether a budget point of \norder can be raised against the flow of funds or against this bill.\n  What if the moneys are not enough? What if $140 billion is not \nenough? What do we do? Some have suggested that we are going to go \nright into the taxpayers and ask them to pick up the tab. That is not \nthe case. What will we do? First of all, there is a recognition that \nduring the first 5 years of the trust fund, when there is going to be a \nlot of demand on the funds and moneys are going to be paid in by \ninsurers and defendants, there is going to be a shortfall. That is \nfreely acknowledged, I think, by everyone.\n  With that expectation, there is an opportunity spelled out in the \nbill for the fund administrator to go to the Federal Finance Bank to \nborrow moneys against future revenues of the fund--payments by \ndefendants, payments by insurers--to seek those from the Federal \nFinance Bank. I might add that the cost of Federal funds probably \navailable through that funding mechanism is probably 5 percent in \ntoday's environment, maybe even less than that. Some have said that we \nare so short, so far off target that we are looking for a shortfall of \n$150 billion or $200 billion or $300 billion over the life of this \nfund.\n\n  Let's say, in the first 5 years, there is a shortfall, and say it is \n$10 billion a year. I don't know if that is right; it may be high or \nlow. So if there is a $10 billion shortfall and the fund administrator \nhas to go to the Federal Finance Bank and borrow the money--$10 billion \nfor year one and $10 billion for year two and up through year five, at \na rate of 5 percent a year for 5 years; how much money would that \namount to with respect to the debt service? Well, 5 percent of $10 \nbillion is about a half-billion dollars through year two. So it is \nroughly $2.5 billion at the end of the 5-year period. That is not a \ndebt service cost of $50 billion or $100 billion or $150 billion. That \nis a debt service cost of about $2.5 billion. That is a reasonable \namount of money that may be needed to borrow from the Federal Finance \nBank.\n  Who has to pay that back? The folks who are paying into the trust \nfund have to pay it back. The insurers and the defendants have an \nobligation to repay the money, through the fund administrator, back to \nthe Federal Finance Bank. They have that responsibility.\n  What if the amount of money that is coming into the trust fund is not \nrepaid--and each year there is an obligation, I think, of $3 billion a \nyear for the defendant companies that had an obligation and have been \npaying these claims in the past--cumulatively and in the aggregate they \nhave to pay something like $3 billion a year into the fund. What if \nthey are not paying enough and they have an obligation of $90 billion \nover 30 years? Maybe they are only paying $2.5 billion a year. What can \nbe done about that?\n  Under this bill, the fund administrator has the discretion to impose \na surcharge on the defendant companies to make sure their $3 billion-a-\nyear obligation is being met. What happens, though, if, despite that \ndiscretion that might be used and the ability to borrow money for short \nperiods of time from the Federal Finance Bank--what if it becomes clear \nthat there is not enough money coming into this trust fund to pay the \nclaims that are going to be needed? Do we leave people, the victims, \nthe folks who are suffering from an impairment of their breathing who \nhave been exposed to asbestos--do we hang them out to dry? No.\n  Under the language of the bill--and this is in large part due to the \nwork of Senator Dianne Feinstein--if it becomes clear that people are \nnot going to have a chance to be made whole by the trust fund because \nit runs out of money, we revert back to the tort system. And folks who \nhave a claim, if they are not going to get satisfied through the fund \nitself, will go back into the tort system. They can go back into the \nState where they live, and they can go back to the tort system in the \nState where they were harmed or they can go back into Federal Court.\n  There is no obligation that falls on the taxpayers. I believe the \ncommittee has done a good job of trying to make sure that at the end of \nthe day the money needed to pay these benefits is adequate. And if, for \nsome reason, it is not, they provide a number of steps along the way \nthat could be taken to provide the funding that is needed, either in \nthe first 5 years or in the years subsequent to that.\n  If, in the end, it is recognized that this dog is not going to hunt \nor this fund we are creating is not up to doing the job of meeting the \nneed to pay the claims, we go back into the tort system, and folks will \nhave the opportunity, in their State and their courts or in the State \nwhere they were damaged or in a Federal court, to be made whole. Is \nthis perfect? No, it is not. I will tell you this. From the day we \nstarted this bill about 2 years ago, 3 years ago, it has sure gotten a \nlot better. My guess is that it is going to get better still.\n  I thank Senators Specter and Leahy for their willingness to listen to \nus and work with us and develop amendments. If you look at the \nmanagers' amendment, they have tried to accommodate the concerns that \nlot of us have raised. Are there more amendments that could be offered? \nYou bet there are. My hope is to be able to support some of those, and \nI suspect some of my colleagues will as well.\n  I will tell you what is not acceptable. A system is not acceptable \nwhere we have people who are harmed, where their breathing is impaired \nand they are sick and dying, and for them not to be able to get the \nmoney they deserve and their family deserves quickly. What is not \nacceptable is a system that exists--and for years it has existed--where \npeople who have been exposed to\n\n[[Page S1154]]\n\nasbestos, whose breathing is not impaired, and who may never be \nimpaired, for them to be receiving payments and siphoning off money \nthat ought to be going to people who are sick and, in many cases, dying \nfrom asbestos-related illnesses. What is not acceptable is a situation \nwhere, in a day and age when we are losing manufacturing jobs not by \nthe tens of thousands or by the hundreds of thousands but by the \nmillions, for us to turn our backs on what is a hard-fought and, I \nthink, well-crafted, much-improved proposal to get us to where we need \nto go.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back whatever time I have not \nconsumed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the rule? Can I speak for up to 15 \nminutes or 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can take time from one of the two \nSenators who hold time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be yielded 10 \nminutes of Senator Durbin's time with the hope that I can finish in \nthat time. If not, I will ask for another 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to support the budget point of \norder on S. 852. I want to explain why I am doing this. First, I want \nto say if anybody has listened to Senator Kent Conrad talk about what \nis going to happen in the outyears with this bill, the trust fund, if \nanyone listened to him, it seems very difficult to me to vote against \nthis budget point of order.\n\n  We are on the edge of passing a bill that is masquerading as a \nsolution to a deadly problem, and asbestos victims need to know the \ntruth. Frankly, they were lied to once when companies exposed their \nworkers to asbestos without telling them of the danger, and I don't \nwant to lie to these victims again. The simple truth is there are not \nsufficient funds in the trust fund to compensate all the current and \nfuture asbestos victims. We should not compound the problem of the past \nby offering false promises and cutting victims off from help.\n  I know there are many who don't agree with what I have just said, but \nI think if, again, you listen to Senator Conrad, and you go back to see \nwhat has happened to other trust funds, I think it is very clear there \nare not enough funds in this trust fund. Some estimates are it is \nperhaps 50 percent of what it ought to be.\n  Some say that people will go back to court if there are not enough \nfunds. I know that is a very well meaning part of this bill, but it \nisn't as easy as all that. It is going to be very difficult for people \nin the future years. I think we are going to see more companies claim \nthey are bankrupt. There will be a lot of lawsuits.\n  That is not to say there is no problem for asbestos victims today. \nProviding them with just compensation is something they deserve. If we \nwere able to increase the size of the fund and include all of the \nvictims who deserve to be compensated, that would be a good solution. I \nknow this is what many honorable and hard-working Senators on both \nsides have tried to do, but the current legislation doesn't get us \nthere.\n  Asbestos kills 10,000 Americans every year. Such a large number of \ndeaths is hard to comprehend, so let me tell my colleagues about just a \nfew of the victims in California and why this bill will hurt them, not \nhelp them.\n  Here is a picture of Rebecca Martinez. Rebecca is the wife of \nMargarito who lived in Baldwin Park, CA, and she is pictured here on \nthe right. Margarito worked as a plasterer and Rebecca would clean his \nasbestos-covered clothes when he came home, breathing in the dust as \nshe shook them out and did the laundry. They were never warned about \nthe dangers of asbestos.\n  Rebecca was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2002, as we all know, a \ndeadly cancer caused only by asbestos. She died 4 months later, leaving \nbehind her husband and three children.\n  Her husband has spent more than $50,000 on a pending wrongful death \nsuit. However, if this bill is passed, he will never get to go to court \nand face the people who are responsible for his wife's death. This bill \nwill force him back to square one, and he will face, potentially, years \nof delay. And here he is, a widower having to raise his kids.\n  For those who are about to resolve their court cases, I see no reason \nto force them into a trust fund process. It is wrong. People have \ninvested time in the court system, and this bill will rip them out of \nthe court system just as they are about to get justice.\n  This is a picture of Georgina Bryson. She lived in Riverside, CA, \nwhen she died of mesothelioma. From 1962 until 1980, Georgina lived \ndowntown from two cement companies that used asbestos to manufacture \ntheir products. Georgina was also exposed to asbestos when she lived \nwith her dad who worked with gaskets that contained asbestos.\n\n       Georgina was only 40 years old when she died from \n     mesothelioma. Her family filed a wrongful death action and, \n     to the credit of the California court system--to the credit \n     of the California court system--the suit settled. The cement \n     plants agreed to pay 90 percent of the award, recognizing \n     that they were primarily responsible for the death.\n\n  The problem with the legislation before us is, if Georgina's family \ndidn't have access to the courts, and they filed the claim with the \nasbestos fund, they could receive possibly no compensation. Because \nGeorgina's asbestos exposure was not work related, she lived downwind \nfrom the cement manufacturers, she would not meet the occupational \nrequirements of the bill.\n  There are many people in California and elsewhere who never worked \nwith asbestos but were exposed to it because they lived near factories, \nmines, and processing plants with asbestos. This certainly was the case \nin Libby, MT, and residents of that town are taken care of in the bill. \nThat is a wonderful thing for them. Lord knows there is suffering \nthere. The exposure requirements for anyone who lived or worked for at \nleast 12 months within 20 miles of the mining or milling facility in \nLibby are waived, so the people in Libby are taken care of, and I am \nhappy for them. But the bill fails to provide the same relief to people \nin at least 41 other communities across the country who live near a \nplant that processed vermiculite from Libby. How is that equal justice \nunder the law? It also fails to protect people who lived near other \nmines or plants that released asbestos into the air.\n  For example, Santa Ana is one of roughly 23 cities in California that \nreceived more than 1 million tons of Libby's vermiculite. Yet this bill \nwould compound the injuries to affected community members by largely \nbarring nonoccupational exposures. As I said, no one can call this \njustice.\n  The bill also fails to adequately address another problem important \nto my State, as well as the Nation--naturally occurring asbestos. I am \ngoing to show you a map of California where we show the counties \ncontaining naturally occurring asbestos. Forty-four of California's 58 \ncounties are known to have naturally occurring asbestos. The problem, \nhowever, is not California specific. Twenty-nine States are known to \nhave naturally occurring asbestos.\n  This asbestos can threaten public health. This shows in red where the \nStates have this problem with naturally occurring asbestos. In 2005, a \nUniversity of California-Davis study found that the risk of \nmesothelioma decreased by 6.4 percent for every 6 miles further away a \nperson lived from a naturally occurring asbestos source.\n  Under the bill, people who get a terminal illness from naturally \noccurring asbestos may take their case to the medical exceptions panel, \nbut there are three problems.\n  First, I want to thank my colleague, Senator Feinstein, for getting \nthat into the bill. At least they can go to this special panel. But \nthere are problems. First, the level of funding established by the bill \nfor the trust fund, as I said before, is insufficient to pay for the \nclaims expected to be filed with the exceptional medical claims panel. \nIt is insufficient. There wouldn't be funding left.\n  The CBO stated in a letter on February 1 to Senator Specter that:\n\n       There is a significant likelihood that the fund's revenues \n     would fall short of the amount needed to pay valid claims, \n     debt service, and administrative costs.\n\n  This is, in part, because the CBO explicitly stated that it did not \ninclude ``the costs of any exceptional medical claims'' in its \nestimate. What kind of chance do my people have for being exposed to \nnaturally occurring asbestos\n\n[[Page S1155]]\n\nand the people who live in all of these States?\n  This isn't justice. If we want to do justice, we need a bill that is \nsufficiently funded through the trust fund to take care of all of our \npeople, not just some of our people.\n  The Democratic staff of the Budget Committee predicts a shortfall in \nthe trust fund of $150 billion or more. That is $150 billion that \ntaxpayers may have to pay to bail out the trust fund. It is easy to \nsay: Oh, you will just go back to the courts. But that is a time period \nin which we don't know what the situation will look like, more \ncompanies will claim bankruptcy, and people will then have to move from \nthe trust fund over to the courts. It is a giant nightmare.\n  Second, it is not clear that the companies paying into the fund \nshould be the ones responsible for compensating people who become sick \nfrom naturally occurring asbestos. Construction companies disturbing \nnaturally occurring asbestos may expose residents to fibers, but those \ncompanies are generally not the ones paying into the fund. So this \nmakes no sense at all for people who live in areas with naturally \noccurring asbestos. They are different defendants that need to step up \nand pay compensation.\n  Third, there is no deadline by which the medical exceptions panel \nmust act on a claim. Given the number of people who may file claims \nwith the panel, it could be years before the panel makes a decision on \na particular case. Is this better than the current court system?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for just 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I don't think it is better than the \ncurrent court system, certainly not in my State. In California, we have \nan expedited processing of suits for sick plaintiffs. Roughly 22 States \nhave procedures that ensure mesothelioma victims and those with other \nvery serious cancers have their cases heard in a year or less. In \nCalifornia the courts can hear such cases within 120 days. There are \nStates where the courts work, and they should be allowed to continue \ntheir good work without getting taxpayers involved in this trust fund. \nWhere it is working, do no harm. Let it proceed.\n  Most, if not all, of us could support an asbestos trust fund that is \nfair to victims, but this proposal is not. I have gone through the ways \nthat it is not. I have shown my colleagues the faces of those who would \nbe harmed or would have been harmed if this trust fund were in place.\n  We can fix this. We can make the trust fund bigger, that is one \nsolution, or we can say in the 22 States that are dealing with this, \nlet them deal with it. Let's grandfather in the cases that are already \nin the system.\n  I am very fearful--very fearful--that a lot of people who are going \nto depend on this trust fund are going to find out that it isn't what \nit is cracked up to be. The bill promises the Moon, and I don't even \nknow if it will deliver a sliver of the Moon.\n  I just want to say to those who are following this debate who are \nsuffering, I honestly believe that everybody thinks, everybody thinks \nthey are working for you, but what I say is this: If the system is \nalready working for you, let it work for you. Let's not promise you the \nMoon and not be able to deliver it. Let's make sure there is justice \nfor people who live, say, downwind in California from a company that \nreceived the product from Libby.\n  The people in Libby are taken care of. The people in my State and \nmany other States are not taken care of. This isn't fair. What happened \nto equal justice? What happened to fairness? We can do it. People of \ngoodwill on both sides can do the right thing. This isn't a question of \nthis bill or no bill.\n  So I honestly think that by supporting this point of order, first of \nall, we are being honest with the people. We are being honest with the \npeople. We are saying there is not enough money in this trust fund and \nthe taxpayers are going to have to bear the burden and who knows what \nwill happen at that time. With the kind of deficits that are being \nracked up here, with the kind of national debt that is being racked up \nhere, where is the money going to come from?\n  Some say: Go back to the court system. That is a very complicated \nmatter. Every State has its own way. In some States it works well, like \nCalifornia. In other States, it doesn't. So I urge my colleagues, yes, \nto protect asbestos victims who may not be so lucky as the people in \nLibby. Let's take care of the people in Libby, and let's take care of \nall of the victims and potential victims and vote against waiving this \nbudget point of order.\n  A budget point of order lies against this bill. The Parliamentarian \nhas told us; the CBO has told us. Let's do the honest thing. Let's \nsupport the budget point of order, go back to the drawing board. Let's \ntake care of these people and do it in the right way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, and after a \ndiscussion over lunch about Libby, MT, and some of the provisions found \nin this legislation, listening to the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia, I think we had better answer some of the questions that are \nbeing asked about this.\n  As you know, I am here on the floor again, joining Senator Baucus, my \ncolleague, urging our colleagues not to support this budget point of \norder. We have to deal with this terrible thing. If the point of order \non the bill is successful, the bill dies and we will get no bill at \nall. There will be nothing to go to final passage, nothing to go to the \nHouse of Representatives, nothing to be considered in conference. I do \nnot think that serves the interests of the victims of asbestosis or \nother asbestos-related diseases.\n  I want to talk about Libby, MT, I guess, because I live there--not in \nLibby, but in Montana. Many of my great friends live in Libby, MT. \nFamilies are watching this together in their living rooms today, \nwatching this broadcast on C-SPAN. Televisions are set up in \nrestaurants and dining rooms and hotel lobbies so people can continue \nto see what happens here as they go about their day.\n  I have been in close contact with the community leaders and people \ndirectly affected by health problems on a daily basis. For some of my \ncolleagues, this debate is about technical details of a very \ncomplicated bill. For people in Libby, of course, it is life or death.\n  I want to show some pictures that have been sent to us. We want to \ngive you an idea about how important this is.\n  Behind me--I don't know whether the cameras are picking it up; I \nassume they are from somewhere--is a picture of a baseball field. This \nfield was built in 1959. You have to remember, this vermiculite mine \nstarted in 1924. For many years we didn't know anything about asbestos. \nWe didn't know anything about the problems it caused. But we know if \nyou are exposed, these diseases develop over time, and it takes a long \ntime.\n  This baseball field was built in 1959, next to the processing plant. \nFor years, the children of Libby played baseball in asbestos-\ncontaminated fields while their siblings played on actual vermiculite \npiles of asbestos next to the fields. It is unbelievable. The former \nGovernor of Montana was raised in Libby, MT. They thought it was a lot \nof fun because it was slick and, boy, you could slide a long way. The \nhigh school running track and football field were built on tailings \nfrom that mine site. For over 25 years, children have been directly \nexposed to tremolite-laced tailings which were used to line the track \nand, of course, the football field.\n  Maybe I can consider myself lucky; I never had to referee a football \ngame up there and I had some 20 years refereeing that game in that \nState.\n  The saddest of all is it is all now coming home. It is now being \nidentified. This is the photo of 250 crosses at Libby, MT, \nmemorializing those residents who have died from asbestos-related \ndiseases. Mr. President, 250 is 10 percent of the entire population of \nthe town. Gayla Benefield told my office recently about how much this \nmatter affected her life:\n\n       Slow suffocation from tremolite asbestos is a terrible way \n     to die but worse yet, watching our parents die and then, \n     watching the looks on their grandchildren's faces when we \n     tell them we have the disease is worse than dying.\n       To watch one person die from the effects of our fiber is \n     horrific. But to know that your own fate is no better, and \n     that you cannot\n\n[[Page S1156]]\n\n     even protect your children or assure them that help will be \n     there is even worse.\n\n  Earlier this week I read a letter I received from Jim Davidson who \nhas been diagnosed with mesothelioma. He is one of many cases in the \nsmall town of Libby. His pleas were to get this legislation passed and \nto do the right thing--get something to conference and get something to \nthe House, because a lot of these folks will not live long enough to \never hear their case pleaded in court.\n  Jim has been watching these debates with his family. Yesterday, Jim's \nson, Dr. Steve Davidson, wrote me a letter about some of the statements \nthat have been made here on the floor. He said:\n\n       As a past board member of our local hospital and as a past \n     board member of our federally funded community health center, \n     I have seen firsthand the impact of asbestos exposure on my \n     hometown. As a health care provider, I am reminded daily of \n     the price that has to be paid by my community. And as a son \n     who is helping his father cope with mesothelioma, I must \n     watch him struggle with his mortality. My father worked at \n     the Grace facility for several months in the 1950s.\n\n  This is way back in the 1950s. Now, later, this terrible disease \nsurfaces.\n\n       We rely on Congress to do the will of the people. Since the \n     Grace bankruptcy was ignored by Congress, we must now seek a \n     reasonable remedy.\n       There exists no empirical medical data to support the \n     assertion on the Senate floor that ``Libby is like East \n     Hampton. . . .''\n       I and my community would appreciate access to any facts to \n     support such a statement. In their absence, we would \n     appreciate an apology from the Senate floor. These remarks \n     seek to minimize the humanity of the crisis in Libby and my \n     Father's struggle.\n\n  It is something when it touches your life.\n\n       We are uncertain if your remarks were made from ignorance \n     or malice. Please help us to understand your position.\n\n  He is asking the Senate to clarify some of the statements that were \nmade that seem unfair to some of the folks who are victims of the \nsituation around Libby.\n  This is a photograph of Vernon Riley putting flowers on his wife's \ngrave. Darlene Riley never worked at the mine or had anything to do \nwith it. She died of the most severe type of asbestosis in 1995.\n\n  The fact is, no other asbestos location in the United States created \nas widespread a catastrophe as is in Libby, MT. To suggest that \nenclosed asbestos treatment facilities are the same as an open-pit mine \nthat blew dust and the winds took it for miles and miles into the air \nsince 1924, and it rained down on a town--to say that is not different \nthan any other situation in this country is not true.\n  I think it is important that we pass a bill. That is why I urge my \ncolleagues not to support this point of order because it will kill this \npiece of legislation. How many hours have all of us put in, trying to \npass something that would give justice to people who right now stand to \ncollect nothing for their injuries?\n  I urge my colleagues to support the motion to waive the budget point \nof order. It is necessary that we get a bill out of this Senate, send \nit to the House of Representatives. Let them deliberate. Let them carry \non this argument. Let's get to conference and let's do what is right \nfor the people who have been impacted by asbestos and asbestosis and \nthe diseases related to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana for \nhis impassioned advocacy for the people of Montana. I want to make sure \nhe has completed his remarks. I have plenty of time to wait if he has \nnot.\n  Mr. BURNS. I completed. I yield to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wish to add to those remarks. This morning I met \nwith a number of Tennesseans here in an event we call Tennessee \nTuesday. It is a meeting we have every Tuesday. Senator Frist and I \nhost it for Tennesseans who are visiting Washington, and it is a chance \nto let them know what we are working on.\n  I talked with them about asbestos. One of my friends on the other \nside of the aisle began this debate, which should have started earlier, \nby saying: Why are we talking about asbestos when we have a war, when \nwe have deficits out of control, when jobs are going overseas, when \nkids are not learning in schools, when Medicaid costs are rising and \nprescription drug benefits are not being delivered as efficiently as we \nwould like? Why are we talking about asbestos?\n  I think we have an obligation to say to the American people, and to \nourselves, we know exactly why we are talking about asbestos. We are \ntalking about asbestos because it has to do with tens of thousands, \nmaybe hundreds of thousands of American jobs. We are talking about \nasbestos because it has to do with whether we are going to retain our \npreeminence as the leader in the world in competitiveness, whether we \nare going to be able to lead the world in terms of the standard of \nliving we have. We are talking about asbestos because we have thousands \nof Americans who have been hurt and who deserve compensation and who \ncannot be compensated.\n  Asbestos is right where it ought to be. It is at the top of our \nagenda. We have Democrats and Republicans working together to solve the \nproblem because it is about jobs, it is about America's role in the \nworld, and it is about Americans who have been hurt and who have no way \nto be compensated unless we decide to help them.\n  Let's take the first point. The FAIR Act, as we call it--and that is \na good name for it--is about jobs because since the 1980s, more than 70 \ncompanies have gone bankrupt as a result of asbestos lawsuits. These \nlawsuits have occurred because people were working for those companies \nand they were exposed to asbestos and many of them died or were \nseriously ill. More than 60,000 workers lost their jobs since the 1980s \nbecause 70 companies have gone bankrupt over asbestos lawsuits.\n  If we picked up the paper and read in the morning that 60,000 jobs \nhad gone to China, there would be speeches made all across this Senate \nfloor about whose fault it was. It will be our fault if we do not solve \nthe asbestos problem and 60,000 more jobs are lost. Those are real, \ngood-paying, manufacturing jobs that will be lost if we do not solve \nthe asbestos problem.\n  My State of Tennessee has its share of those jobs. The auto industry, \nas an example, has one-third of the manufacturing jobs in Tennessee. We \nare glad that Saturn and Nissan have come to our state, and that we \nhave gone from a handful of suppliers to nearly a thousand. But those \ncompanies, those suppliers, those jobs are at risk if we do not solve \nthe asbestos problems.\n  The FAIR Act is about America's role in the world. It's about our \ncompetitiveness. The President talked about that in his State of the \nUnion Address. He talked about it in Nashville. He is now talking about \nit wherever he goes. We are confident in our ability to lead the world. \nWe know we are only 5 percent of the people and that last year we \nproduced 30 percent of the wealth. We know the rest of the world is \neyeing that statistic and saying, If American brainpower and economic \nconditions produced a growth economy that gives Americans 30 percent of \nthe wealth for 5 percent of the people, we want to emulate that. So we \nhave to work hard every day to make sure we create an environment in \nthis country in which American businesses can grow the largest number \nof new American jobs. The last thing we want to do is lose American \njobs.\n  How do we do that? We keep costs down. We stop runaway lawsuits. We \nsolve the health care problem. We invest in science and technology \nbecause 85 or 90 percent of our new jobs since World War II have come \nfrom advances in science and technology. That is why we have introduced \nthe Protecting America's Competitive Edge or PACE Act in this Senate, \nwhere we have 31 Democrats and 31 Republicans who have signed onto \nlegislation recommended by the National Academies that would invest 9 \nbillion new dollars this year in keeping our advantage in science and \ntechnology. We want to stay competitive.\n  According to a report from NERA Economic Consulting, ``Asbestos \nlitigation has damaged U.S. competitiveness.'' For example, if you are \nworried about asbestos lawsuits, you want to put your plant somewhere \noverseas and your jobs somewhere overseas, and we lose out.\n  Productivity growth in the United States, according to that report, \nin asbestos-affected manufacturing sectors\n\n[[Page S1157]]\n\nhas lagged behind growth in their counterparts in other countries by \nhalf a percent.\n  We Tennesseans worry about that because we like manufacturing jobs. \nAs I said, one-third of them are auto jobs, and many of them are \nchemical jobs. We don't like lagging behind. We like our standard of \nliving. That report says we lose $51 billion annually, with a total \nloss of $303 billion. The dollars are hard to comprehend. But jobs and \ncompetitiveness are what we are talking about here.\n  Finally, the FAIR Act is about compensation to Americans who have \nbeen hurt. We say the words ``compensation to victims,'' but that \ndoesn't really say it as plainly as ``Americans have been hurt.''\n  Here is a fact that got my attention. This is one reason I am \nspeaking about this issue. This is the reason I am a cosponsor of the \nbill offered by Senator Specter and Senator Leahy. Seventy billion \ndollars has been spent on asbestos litigation through 2002. Asbestos \nlitigation is litigation to help people who have been hurt, who are \ngoing to die, in many cases, from asbestos. Nearly 60 percent of that \n$70 billion was spent on attorney's fees and other transaction costs. \nIn other words, the people who are hurt got 40 percent of the $70 \nbillion. That is not right.\n  In addition, it is taking up to 3 years for victims to collect their \ncompensation as a result of complex litigation. Some businesses have \ngone bankrupt, so you don't collect from them. Some people have died, \nso they are in no position to collect. The legal process has taken too \nlong for them, and 60 percent of the money that is collected is going \nto the lawyers.\n  This is not about plaintiffs' lawyers. Half the money goes to defense \nlawyers and half to the plaintiffs' lawyers. Whose fault is that? I \ndon't know whose fault it has been, but I will tell you whose fault it \nwill be if we allow this to continue. Former Chief Justice Rehnquist \nand Justice Ginsburg both said it to us. They said: We can't fix this \nproblem in the judiciary; the Congress needs to do it. In one case, the \nSupreme Court said:\n\n       The elephantine mass of asbestos cases . . . defies \n     customary judicial administration and calls for national \n     legislation.\n\n  That is us. That is what we are here for. That is why we get the big \nbucks. That is why we have the salaries. This is a big problem. We are \nsupposed to solve it, and we ought to solve it. We have been trying to \nsolve it. For the last 10 years, some of the best Members of this body \non both sides of the aisle have been working on it. I could not begin \nto name them. I have heard Senator Specter say that Senator Gary Hart, \nmore than 20 years ago, came to see him about it. Senator Specter and \nSenator Leahy have worked hard, as have Senator Hatch and many other \nMembers. Some of them don't agree about the eventual result, but many \nof the best Senators are working hard because they see this as a \nproblem of jobs and competitiveness and Americans who have been hurt.\n  Where do we come at this point today? We have a budget point of order \nagainst the bill. If the point of order succeeds, the bill fails. Those \nof us who believe it is our job to solve the asbestos problem won't get \nto take the next step to actually debate the bill and see if we can \nbridge our differences and save jobs, improve competitiveness, and help \nAmericans who have been hurt. I urge my colleagues not to let this \npoint of order kill the asbestos legislation because we in Congress are \nthe only ones who can solve this problem properly.\n  I respect the fact that the point of order is being made. But a point \nof order, as the Senator from New Mexico, the former chairman of the \nBudget Committee for so long, has said, doesn't automatically kill a \nbill; it just says to us: Stop and think; consider the point of order. \nAnd when we consider the point of order, which is designed for the \npurpose of making sure we don't slip in the legislation provisions \nwhich will cause big expenses in future years, we find this doesn't \ncause big, unanticipated expenses in future years. In fact, a February \n13, 2006 letter from the Congressional Budget Office concludes that \n``this legislation would be deficit neutral over the life of the \nfund.'' So the point of order deserves respect, but this bill does not \ndeserve to be killed by a point of order.\n  I implore my colleagues. We have a job to do. This is a tough piece \nof legislation. We are divided on our side. We have some who like the \ntrust fund, but we have other Members who like another approach. There \nare some Democrats who like the trust fund and some who prefer another \napproach. I believe it is our responsibility to the people who put us \nhere to solve this big problem. It will save tens of thousands of jobs, \nit can help tens of thousands of Americans who have been hurt, and it \nwill help to assure America's preeminence 10, 15, 20 years from now.\n  I urge my colleagues, don't let the point of order kill the bill and \nkill our opportunity to solve this problem.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are voting on a motion to waive the \nBudget Act in order that the bill creating an asbestos trust fund can \ncontinue to be considered on the floor of the Senate.\n  For the past couple of years, I have encouraged the creation of some \nkind of a trust fund to settle the many asbestos claims that are \nclogging our court system.\n  The current tort system does not work at all, in my judgment, with \nrespect to asbestos-related claims.\n  According to the RAND study, lawyers on both sides of the issue are \ngetting 58 cents of every dollar spent on asbestos litigation, which \nmeans that the victims are only getting 42 cents of every dollar \nexpended. In addition, there are some very sick people who are getting \nno help while some people who will never get sick are getting awards. \nFrankly, that isn't fair or equitable.\n  So I have been sympathetic to the creation of some kind of a trust \nfund, and I know that the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee have worked very hard to develop the trust fund proposal now \nbeing considered.\n  I also know that the motion to waive the Budget Act is considered by \nsome a technical issue. But some recent studies, including one done by \nmy colleague Senator Conrad, the ranking member on the Senate Budget \nCommittee, suggest that the potential budget exposure to the United \nStates Government is substantial.\n  The Conrad study indicates that this trust fund could fall short by \nmore than $150 billion, which in the out years will put powerful \npressure on the Congress to fund the shortfall.\n  This country has a Federal budget that is increasing its indebtedness \nby $704 billion in this fiscal year alone. We also have a trade deficit \nof $720 billion this year, for a combined $1.4 trillion debt problem. \nOur country's economic future is threatened by this massive debt, and I \nam reluctant to put in place anything that might substantially add to \nthat burden.\n  The prospect that this trust fund could fall far short of that which \nis necessary to reimburse asbestos victims makes it a very real \npossibility that the Federal Government would be forced to add to its \ndebt by covering the extra liability for those asbestos victims.\n  Until or unless those issues are resolved, I feel that the best \ncourse is to support the point of order in the hope that the authors of \nthe legislation can resolve these differences and offer us greater \nconfidence that this legislation will not add to the crushing debt that \nAmerica already faces.\n  Therefore, while I will support the point of order, I will continue \nto work with my colleagues to find a solution that addresses this \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, section 307 of H. Con. Res. 95, the \nConcurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2006, permits the \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee to make adjustments to the \nallocations and aggregates provided certain conditions are met relating \nto Asbestos Injury Trust Fund legislation.\n  Pursuant to sections 307, I hereby submit the following revisions to \nH. Con. Res. 95. I ask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                        ($ in millions)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrent Allocation to Senate Judiciary Committee:\n    FY 2006 Budget Authority.........................              7,387\n    FY 2006 Outlays..................................              6,528\n    FY 2006-2010 Budget Authority....................             32,071\n    FY 2006-2010 Outlays.............................             31,766\nAdjustments:\n    FY 2006 Budget Authority.........................                  0\n\n[[Page S1158]]\n\n \n    FY 2006 Outlays..................................                  0\n    FY 2006-2010 Budget Authority....................             48,200\n    FY 2006-2010 Outlays.............................             32,900\nRevised Allocation to Senate Judiciary Committee:\n    FY 2006 Budget Authority.........................              7,387\n    FY 2006 Outlays..................................              6,526\n    FY 2006-2010 Budget Authority....................             80,271\n    FY 2006-2010 Outlays.............................             64,666\nOriginal Senate Paygo Point-of-Order 2006 Budget\n Resolution policy balances:\n    FY 2006..........................................             16,849\n    FY 2006-2010.....................................             75,580\n    FY 2011-2015.....................................            274,999\nAdjustment:\n    FY 2006..........................................                  0\n    FY 2006-2010.....................................                400\n    FY 2011-2015.....................................              6,600\nRevised Senate Paygo Point-of-Order 2006 Budget\n Resolution policy balances:\n    FY 2006..........................................             16,849\n    FY 2006-2010.....................................             75,980\n    FY 2011-2015.....................................            281,599\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as we worked through the Budget last year, \none of the main dilemmas confronting us as a government was clearly the \nunsustainably high levels of entitlement spending now and in the \nfuture. This spending in the not too distant future will crowd out the \nGovernment's ability to do much more than merely pay the costs of the \nentitlement programs themselves. Eventually, it will rob us of the \nability to fund most essential discretionary Federal programs. So \nlayering on new payments and programs, which claimants in time will \ncome to expect as another entitlement from the Federal Government \nrather than the private sector, will threaten the Nation's economy with \neven more damage from too much Government borrowing and high tax \nburdens.\n  I, too, am concerned about the immense hardship that the asbestos \nlitigation explosion has imposed on our economy for more than a decade \nnow. The immense volume of litigation from occupational exposure to \nasbestos has already bankrupted numerous companies, large and small. \nThe greatest harm from the litigation is that genuinely and critically \nsick individuals cannot get their day in court--and the financial help \nthey desperately need--because the court system is overwhelmed by \nasbestos claims from tens of thousands of individuals who are not even \nsick yet, and may never be sick. Moreover, a disproportionate amount of \nvictim compensation is being siphoned off in attorney fees.\n  Congress needs to address this crisis so that those who are truly \nsick from asbestos exposure are quickly and fully compensated. Yet our \nnational economy also needs to be protected from further damage due to \nthese thousands of protracted, unnecessary, and unfounded asbestos \nclaims in our courts. But as part of that effort, we also need to \nensure that the costs of compensating asbestos victims are not shifted \noff of the companies that would be legally liable in court and onto \nAmerica's taxpayers.\n  I therefore hope the Senator, who is one of the authors of the bill, \nwill allow me to ask him a few questions to clarify the legislative \nintent behind the bill we have before us and the degree of confidence \nhe has that the trust fund established by the FAIR Act will be funded \nfrom nontaxpayer sources for the life of the fund, as required by the \nbudget resolution for fiscal year 2006.\n  This past August CBO estimated that paying claims as provided for \nunder this legislation would cost between $120 and $150 billion. CBO \nalso estimated that the trust fund would incur an additional $10 \nbillion in administrative and interest costs. CBO's total estimate for \nthe bill then was that it would cost between $130 billion and $160 \nbillion in order to meet the obligations of the trust fund over its 50-\nyear life.\n  Then in a letter on December 19 to the Senator as chairman of \nJudiciary Committee, CBO elaborated on its earlier estimate for S. 852 \nand its ability to stay within the $140 billion provided for under the \nbill by stating:\n\n       There is a significant likelihood that the fund's revenues \n     would fall short of the amount needed to pay valid claims, \n     debt service, and administrative costs. There is also some \n     likelihood that the fund's revenues would be sufficient to \n     meet those needs. The final outcome cannot be predicted with \n     great certainty [over 50 years].\n\n  Given the uncertainty of this statement, I have been concerned that \nthe fund could rapidly run up a deficit and that the taxpayers would \nthen be asked to bail the asbestos trust fund out.\n  The clear track record of Government administered compensation \nprograms designed to mandate a ``no-fault'' solution for liability \nclaimants as in this case--has been that Congress ends up bailing out \nsuch funds' exploding costs with tax dollars. The Government \nAccountability Office, GAO, released a report just this past November \nthat found that four victim compensation programs--the Black Lung \nProgram, the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, the Energy Employees \nOccupational Illness Compensation Program, and the Radiation Exposure \nCompensation Program--all expanded significantly over time after their \ncreation to include additional categories of victims, to cover more \nmedical conditions, or to provide significant additional benefits. GAO \nalso found that those new and added costs ended up being paid by the \ntaxpayers even if the victim compensation programs started out as \nprivately funded.\n\n  So, again, while I strongly agree--as most everyone does--that the \nasbestos litigation crisis needs to be solved, it is unfair to do it by \nmaking hard working American taxpayers pay the tens of billions of \ndollars in additional compensation instead of the private companies \nresponsible for the problem.\n  So, I would ask the senior Senator from Pennsylvania and the manager \nof the bill, what assurances can he provide--beyond the uncertain and \nnot entirely inspiring CBO estimate regarding this bill--that the \ntaxpayers will not end up footing the bill for this program, and that \nthe new asbestos trust fund will not increase the Federal Government's \nbudget deficit over the 2006-2056 period, as required by section 307 of \nthe budget resolution for fiscal year 2006, the so-called reserve fund.\n  Mr. SPECTER. First, I want to commend my colleague for raising this \nimportant issue; that is, the potential impact to the American taxpayer \nof the asbestos trust fund. In response to my colleague's inquiry, I \nhave been working very diligently to make every effort to tailor the \ntrust fund so it remains solvent and to ensure that the American \ntaxpayer will never be required to spend money to bail out the fund.\n  As you know, the measure would create a $140 billion trust fund, \nfinanced by companies facing lawsuits and their insurers, to compensate \nvictims of asbestos exposure. This amount of funding was a difficult \nissue to resolve and took a long time to negotiate.\n  However, the bill contains several provisions that express our intent \nfor the fund to remain funded by private, nontaxpayer sources for its \nfull life. First off, the bill should not cause the deficit to go up \nbecause the FAIR Act requires a commensurate amount of revenues to come \nin from the private sector as is paid out in claims and program costs.\n  Second, the bill explicitly states that the American taxpayer should \nnever bear the burden to pay for asbestos claims should the fund become \ninsolvent. Indeed, section 406(b) of the bill expressly provides that \nthe legislation would not obligate the Federal Government to pay any \npart of an award under the bill if amounts in the asbestos fund are \ninadequate. In addition, the ranking member and I added a finding to \nthe managers' amendment to underscore our intent that the taxpayer \nshould not have any obligation whatsoever under the proposed trust \nfund.\n  Admittedly, we as a Congress now cannot tie the hands of a future \nCongress, but our expectation is that future Congresses will honor our \ncommitment in this regard.\n  The FAIR Act also provides the trust fund administrator with the \nability to sunset the fund if he or she finds that it ``will not have \nsufficient resources to pay 100 percent of all resolved claims while \nalso meeting all other obligations of the fund under this act. . . .'' \nAfter such a determination, the trust fund is supposed to terminate.\n  In the event a sunset does occur, all pending and future claims will \nrevert back to the tort system. Some claimants would then have to \nlitigate their claims in court and would not have a predetermined \naward. Many companies would also be thrown back into the tort system--\neven as they and their insurers have to continue payments into the \ntrust fund to pay off any outstanding debt incurred by the fund.\n  While that will hopefully not occur, we also fully expect that future \nCongresses will not step in and try to take over the asbestos trust \nfund's obligations using taxpayer funds.\n\n[[Page S1159]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate my colleague's willingness to clarify this \nimportant point. I would note the Congressional Budget Office yesterday \nreleased an estimate of the chairman's substitute on the asbestos trust \nfund bill, consistent with what the chairman just said, which states:\n\n        . . . so long as the fund's administrator does not borrow \n     amounts beyond the means of the fund to repay (as the bill \n     would require), the government's general funds would not be \n     used to pay asbestos claims. Furthermore, section 406 of the \n     bill states that the legislation would not obligate the \n     federal government to pay any part of an award under the bill \n     if amounts in the asbestos fund are inadequate. Thus, \n     CBO concludes that the legislation would be deficit-\n     neutral over the life of the fund.\n\n  So given Chairman Specter's assurances and this conclusion by CBO; it \nis my intention to adjust the Judiciary Committee's 302(a) allocation \nto the extent that such legislation would not increase the deficit for \nthe life of the fund--which brings me to my second concern. There is no \nargument that the genesis of this crisis was fueled primarily by the \naggressive and abusive tactics of trial lawyers. I think you will agree \nthat those same trial lawyers should not now gain a windfall from this \nlegislation. However, they should be compensated fairly and adequately \nfor their work on any claim on behalf of injured victims.\n  Under this bill, an attorney may not receive more than 5 percent of a \nfinal award made under the trust fund. This is more than generous \ncompensation for filing a claim under a no-fault compensation system \nwhere no litigation cost will be incurred and which for the most part \nwill only involve filling out forms for clients.\n  Under the tiered compensation scheme using set medical criteria and \nawards for multiple levels of asbestos-related injury, awards to \nclaimants will range from $25,000 for level II claimants, with a so-\ncalled ``mixed disease with impairment'', to $1.1 million for \nmesothelioma victims in level IX. At a 5 percent fee, attorneys who \nmerely prepare forms in order to file a claim on behalf of a client can \nreceive between $1,250 and $55,000. This is very generous compensation \nfor merely filling out paperwork.\n  Does the Senator foresee any circumstances under which the 5 percent \nlimit on attorney fees could be increased?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree with my colleague's assessment that a 5 percent \ncap on attorney's fees will ensure that victims and not attorneys are \nthe ones that actually receive the lion's share of the compensation \nthat they are entitled to. That is one of the primary goals of this \nlitigation reform bill. The bill makes no provision anywhere that would \nallow the 5 percent cap to be exceeded for filing a claim with the \nfund; however, in the case of appeals of an award under the fund, \nattorneys are permitted to receive reasonable hourly rates for their \nservices rendered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to speak about S. 852, the so-\ncalled Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005. Because this \nlegislation does not provide fairness for asbestos victims or small \nbusinesses, I oppose it. We need to take more time to address the \nproblems with this bill and work to produce a result that is fair to \nall parties involved.\n  At the outset, I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who \nhave been working for years to develop a bill that addresses this issue \nappropriately. There is no doubt that this is one of the most difficult \nand complicated issues that the Judiciary Committee and the Senate have \ndealt with in recent years. Both last year, and in 2003, the Judiciary \nCommittee spent weeks and weeks marking up legislation. In both cases, \nthe end result was not satisfactory. But this was not because of lack \nof effort on the part of the Senators who want to find a solution.\n  Unfortunately, the solution this bill provides is badly flawed. This \nbill simply is not ready for floor consideration. That, if nothing \nelse, is evident from the managers' package or substitute that will \ninclude over 40 significant changes to the bill. When the managers of a \nbill are still working on a managers' package with that many changes, \nbefore many amendments have even been offered, the only conclusion to \nbe drawn is that the bill is not ready for the floor.\n  Asbestos victims around the nation deserve just and fair compensation \nfor the exposure and resulting injuries they have suffered. My own \nState of Wisconsin ranks 16th in the Nation in asbestos-related deaths, \nand I know many Wisconsinites are following this debate closely because \nthe outcome could have a substantial effect on their pending legal \nclaims and their right to fair and just compensation.\n  Many Wisconsinites who were employed at mills and factories around my \nstate were exposed to asbestos. Some of these workers even unknowingly \nbrought asbestos material home on their clothes. A number of these \nasbestos victims, or their survivors, have pending claims in court. \nUnder this legislation, their claims would be extinguished and they \nwould have to start over to seek compensation from the trust fund. \nThese are real people who have endured horrible disease and loss. Some \nhad a loved one cut down in the prime of life, just months after \ngetting a diagnosis. We need to find a solution that compensates these \nvictims in both a fair and timely way and ensures they are protected \nafter we force them to give up their rights to pursue their claims in \ncourt.\n  I support the concept of a national trust fund to compensate victims \nof asbestos-related diseases and address the strain that these asbestos \ncases have placed on our legal system and our economy. But I will only \nsupport a bill that in my judgment is fair to all parties involved, \nincluding, most especially, the victims of asbestos disease. That \nmeans, not only do the medical criteria and claims values have to be \nfair, but the design and funding of the system has to be adequate to \npay the victims properly and completely.\n  There are, in my mind, enough conflicting reports regarding the \nadequacy of the fund that this bill creates to warrant opposition to \nthe legislation. During this debate, many of my colleagues have \nreferenced the CBO study that was completed last fall. Supporters of \nthis bill cite the CBO report and its estimate that valid claims \nsubmitted to the asbestos fund over the next 50 years could be between \n$120 billion and $150 billion as justification for the $140 billion \nasbestos fund pricetag.\n  But as CBO itself points out, the pricetag could run higher than $150 \nbillion for a variety of reasons. As the Senate Budget Committee \nminority staff pointed out in its analysis, CBO said the legislation is \ndesigned to produce incoming revenue of $140 billion. It did not \nconclude that the fund will in fact be able to collect $140 billion. \nAccording to CBO, it is possible that defendant companies could go \nbankrupt and therefore would not be able to pay into the asbestos fund, \nthereby raising the possibility that the fund could not raise $140 \nbillion.\n  In addition, the pricetag could run significantly higher than $140 \nbillion because according to CBO, it is very likely the administrator \nis going to have to borrow money from the Treasury Department at the \noutset of this process. Numerous studies and experts have predicted \nthat there will be more claims filed than revenue collected in the \ninitial years of the fund. That borrowed money will have to be repaid \nwith interest, adding considerably to the cost of the fund. More \nimportant, having a large portion of the trust fund dedicated to \ninterest payments means less money for asbestos victims. There is more \nthan a little doubt that $140 billion is an adequate amount to keep the \nfund solvent and functioning. Until Congress can be virtually certain \nthat the amounts to be raised by the fund will cover all victims' \nclaims, I do not believe we can fairly ask asbestos victims in \nWisconsin and around the nation to give up their legal rights and take \na gamble with this fund.\n\n  And so a budget point of order was raised against this measure. \nSupporters of the bill have asserted that the point of order and other \nbudget points of order that also potentially lie against the \nlegislation are purely technical in nature. Their arguments suggest \nthat it is only through some unintended fluke of the Budget Act that \nsupporters must find 60 votes to waive the budget points of order so \nthey can proceed with the proposal.\n  In fact, while some may view the points of order as technical in \nnature, the budget issues raised by this bill are significant. Indeed, \nthe risk to taxpayers created by this bill would be\n\n[[Page S1160]]\n\nconsiderable even were the nation not already in the most dire of \nfiscal straits. The budget policies of the White House and Congress for \nthe past 5 years have been nothing short of reckless, and the last \nthing we should be doing is to add to our budget problems by roping \ntaxpayers with a massive new underfunded commitment.\n  The analysis presented by the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, \nthe ranking member of the Budget Committee, a few days ago is telling. \nBased on conservative estimates, a review by professional staff of the \nSenate Budget Committee projects that over time the trust fund \nestablished by this legislation to compensate people made sick by \nasbestos will fall $150 billion short of the funds it needs. Moreover, \nthe analysis shows that the shortfall may amount to $300 billion under \neven reasonable assumptions.\n  Lest some argue that these figures aren't meaningful, $300 billion is \nmore than we spent last year on the Departments of Agriculture, \nCommerce, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, \nJustice, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs, \nand the Environmental Protection Agency, combined.\n  This bill presents a potentially massive new burden for taxpayers on \ntop of the record government debt with which they have been saddled. \nAnd because they face that burden, taxpayers are entitled to the full \nprotection of the Budget Act, no matter how technical such protection \nmay be in the eyes of the bill's supporters. Taxpayers deserve the \nsafeguard of a 60-vote budget point of order. I will not vote to waive \nthe Budget Act.\n  There is no doubt that this bill will require a significant number of \nasbestos victims to give up their legal rights and, in many cases, \npending claims in court. Under the language of this bill, unless a \nclaimant is already presenting evidence before a judge or jury or the \nfinal verdict has been issued, the claimant's case is stayed and the \nclaimant is redirected to the asbestos trust fund. We are all aware \nthat there will be victims who have invested a significant amount of \ntheir time and resources into pursuing legal claims, but for whatever \nreason, their cases have not yet reached the evidentiary stage. As any \nlegal observer knows, cases can take years to reach the evidentiary \nstage. Is it fair to ask asbestos victims who have invested years of \ntheir lives and extensive resources to give up their legal rights and \ninstead file claims with a fund that may not have enough money to pay \nout all the claims? I do not think it is fair or reasonable and I had \nhoped we would take more time to ensure the fund will remain solvent \nbefore moving forward with this legislation.\n  I am also concerned about the ability of victims to reenter the legal \nsystem in the event the asbestos fund is declared insolvent. This issue \ninvolves fundamental questions of fairness for victims, but also for \nthe businesses and insurers that are paying into this fund. Again, I \nwant to reiterate that I support the concept of a trust fund to \ncompensate victims of asbestos disease and I understand that if \ncorrectly created and administered, the fund could guarantee certainty \nto both victims and defendant companies. This legislation, however, \ndoes not give that certainty to either party. If the fund's ability to \npay claims declines, asbestos victims could find themselves at the \nmercy of Congress. Last week, Senator Specter voiced a willingness to \nmake modifications to medical standards or criteria if it looks like \nthe fund might exceed $140 billion. This is anything but fair to \nasbestos victims. To change the medical standards or criteria midstream \nintroduces great uncertainty for these victims, which I find \nunacceptable. If we are going to ask victims to forgo their legal \nrights and enter this system, the least we can do is assure them that \nthey will receive just compensation.\n  There are two things we absolutely have to do in any asbestos \nlegislation. First, we have to be sure that there is adequate money \nright away to pay the large number of claims that we know will be filed \nalmost immediately. I think this debate has shown that there is not \nenough money to pay out the initial claims and substantial disagreement \nas to whether there is even enough total money in the fund to pay out \nclaims over the life of the fund.\n  The other thing we must do is make sure there is a strong sunset \nprovision that will allow victims to file suit in the future if this \ntrust fund isn't able to pay their claims. Under this bill's language, \nasbestos victims have to wait until the administrator has declared that \nthe fund can no longer pay claims and has followed procedures before \nthey can file their cases in court again. Moreover, the bill states \nthat the termination of the fund takes effect 180 days after the date \nthat the administrator determines that the fund will not have \nsufficient resources to pay all of its obligations. So, even though the \nadministrator has declared that the fund does not have enough revenue \nto meets its obligations, asbestos victims would have to wait until the \nfund formally terminates 180 days later to file their claims in court. \nFor some victims, 180 days of waiting seems a lot to ask, after they \nwere forced to give up their legal rights to enter this fund in the \nfirst place. I would hope that we can legislate a more prompt and \ncertain sunset provision before asking asbestos victims to give up \ntheir legal rights.\n  I have also heard concerns from small business owners that this bill \nwill unfairly impact their businesses, in some cases even driving them \nout of business. There are a number of small and medium-sized \nbusinesses around the nation that have purchased insurance in the past \nto cover their asbestos liability. Under this legislation, that \ncoverage would not be taken into account. Small businesses will have to \npay into the trust fund at levels comparable to their past asbestos \nliability, even if that liability had been covered by insurance. In \neffect, small businesses will be punished for responsibly ensuring \ntheir liability. A number of these smaller businesses have said these \nmandatory payments would drive them into bankruptcy. Meanwhile, larger \nbusinesses that also have asbestos liability would benefit from paying \ninto this trust fund because of the way the mandatory payments are \nstructured. Under the bill, many of these larger businesses would pay \nfar less than they currently pay to resolve these claims. I cannot \nsupport legislation that unnecessarily hurts smaller businesses while \nallowing more culpable and larger businesses the chance to evade their \nfull responsibility to asbestos victims.\n  In addition, like many of my colleagues, I have concerns about the \nimpact that this legislation will have on the Federal budget. \nSupporters of the bill assert that no taxpayer money will ever be used \nto keep this trust fund solvent. But what happens if the fund does \nbecome insolvent? I agree with my colleagues who say that if we pass \nthis bill, Congress will find it very difficult to let the trust fund \nexpire. Senator Specter is on record as saying medical standards and \ncriteria could be altered, which I already noted is incredibly unfair \nto victims. Others in this chamber have voiced concerns that the \nobligation for the fund could be shifted to taxpayers and I share those \nconcerns also. I know Senator Specter and Senator Leahy, two colleagues \nwhom I deeply respect and who have worked tirelessly on this issue, say \nthat taxpayer money will not be used for this fund. But there is no way \nto say that with absolute certainty. If the fund runs out, one \npossibility is that taxpayer money will have to be used to continue to \npay claims. This option is no more desirable than changing the medical \nstandards under the bill or forcing claimants and companies back into \nthe legal system. The potential budgetary impact is one more reason \nthat this legislation should be studied further so that we can ensure \nthe trust fund will provide fair compensation to asbestos victims.\n  We can do better by both the victims and business interests looking \nto us for a solution to this problem. I believe that if we take more \ntime to ensure the solvency of the fund, to ensure that victims' legal \nrights are adequately protected, and to ensure that taxpayer money will \nnot have to finance the fund, we can reach a solution that truly can be \ncalled fair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S1161]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent I be given an additional 5 \nminutes to speak to compensate for the 5 minutes requested by the \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the issue before the Senate today could \nnot have more importance for hundreds of thousands of American peoples. \nUnbeknownst to many, in their workplace environment, in their homes, \nplaces they have visited during the course of their lives, innocent \npeople have been exposed to asbestos fibers. The fibers are inhaled \ninto the lungs and sit like tiny detonation devices that someday may \nexplode. If they do, they could cause asbestosis which reduces the \nefficiency of the lungs or, even worse, mesothelioma, a fatal condition \nsimilar to lung cancer which claims the life of the innocent victim.\n  As I have said repeatedly, I don't know of a single worker or person \nafflicted with this disease who willingly put themselves in this \ncircumstance. But for many thousands of people, they find themselves \ninfected and dying.\n  Conversely, we know that many companies that made products with \nasbestos over the years knew for decades that it was a dangerous \nsubstance, a substance which was shortening the lives of their \nemployees and a danger to their customers. They said nothing. As a \nresult, when these little detonation devices or timebombs went off in \nthe lungs of Americans, thousands and hundreds of thousands and \nmillions of Americans, it created a wave of lawsuits against the \ncompanies that made products containing asbestos.\n  That has been going on for decades. Those who estimated the number of \nafflicted victims have been way off. The Johns Manville trust fund said \nthere would be 200,000 victims. It turned out there were 2.1 million. \nSo it has been a test of our legal system to give fair compensation to \nthe people who have been hurt. Many people have gone through the system \nand received compensation.\n  Of course, there have been some who have abused the system on both \nsides. There have been some filing lawsuits for people who were not \nsick. There have been businesses, which were clearly liable, that did \neverything they could to avoid paying victims. Those things happen in \ncourts of justice across America every single day.\n  Now comes the bill before the Senate, this so-called Fairness in \nAsbestos Injury Resolution Act, which says that we should basically \ndeny to hundreds of thousands of Americans their day in court, their \ndue process, their chance to stand before a judge and jury to have \ntheir fate decided, their chance to say that we believe the person on \nthe other side of this lawsuit is responsible for the illness and death \nin our families. This bill is designed to close down that opportunity, \nto shut the courthouse doors and to replace them.\n  As I said before, it is quite a bold undertaking to replace the court \nsystem in America with something new. That something is this trust \nfund. And in a few moments, we will have a vote on in this Senate. The \nvote is critically important. It is a budget point of order. It goes to \nthe heart of this trust fund and as to whether we can trust that $140 \nbillion in the trust fund will do the job. It asks the most basic \nquestion: Are we, in fact, not creating a private-funded trust fund \nbut, rather, an obligation of the American Government, the Government, \nto pay in years to come for these victims? Are we replacing a court \nsystem, where the businesses which have some exposure, some liability, \npay up in court, with a system where the taxpayers take care of the \nvictims?\n  If you believe that the companies that are most liable are paying \ninto this trust fund the amounts they otherwise would pay in court--we \nknow that is not true. Three weeks ago, U.S. Gypsum, a major company, \nannounced if they were to pay off all the asbestos claims against their \ncompany they would be paying out somewhere in the range of $4 billion. \nHowever, under this bill, U.S. Gypsum will pay into the trust fund \nsomewhere in the range of $800 million, maybe $900 million at the most. \nSo for this company, this is a windfall. They will escape some $3.1 \nbillion in exposure and liability and others will step in to pay the \ndifference. Companies will step in to make up the difference and \nultimately, it is my belief, when the trust fund fails, as it is likely \nto fail, then it will fall on the shoulders of the American taxpayers \nto make up the difference.\n  If this bill passes, you can expect the stock of many of these \ncompanies that are on the line for asbestos claims to go up \ndramatically, declare dividends, pay more to their CEOs, make sure that \ntheir profits are larger and shared by more. But when it comes to the \nstock of the American people, it will go down because we will be \naccepting responsibility not for just this generation but \ngenerations to come.\n\n  The budget point of order before the Senate raises this fundamental \nquestion. It is one that, on its face, few would argue with; that \nultimately, the American taxpayers are going to be holding the bill, \nmaking up for these corporations which will be off the hook.\n  This afternoon, Senator Conrad, the ranking member on the Committee \non Budget, received a letter from the Congressional Budget Office, \nsigned by Donald Marron, the Acting Director. The letter clarifies a \nletter that has been talked about in the Senate a lot. I will not read \nthe entirety of the letter but it says, to clarify an earlier letter:\n\n       As CBO has noted in previous assessments of asbestos \n     legislation, there is an enormous amount of uncertainty about \n     the potential costs under the proposed amendment. Operating \n     the Asbestos Injury Claims Resolution Fund would be an \n     entirely new government task, and CBO and other analysts have \n     little basis for judging how the fund's administrator would \n     implement the legislation. No one can be certain, because of \n     the limited data that are available, as to how many claimants \n     there would be and how much would have to be paid to them. \n     The revenues under the amendment would be, at most, $140 \n     billion, but could be significantly less.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       CBO concluded, in its February 13 letters to Senators Gregg \n     and Specter, that the proposed amendment would be ``deficit-\n     neutral over the life of the fund.'' That conclusion is based \n     on the fact that the sunset provisions of the legislation \n     would limit spending for claims compensation, debt service, \n     and administrative costs to an amount no greater than the \n     budgetary resources that would be available to the fund from \n     assessments on liable firms, assets of existing bankruptcy \n     trust funds, any interest earnings. Thus, if valid claims and \n     other costs of the funds were to exceed its resources, the \n     administrator would not have the authority to spend amounts \n     in excess of those resources.\n\n  Senator Specter admitted it. He came to the Senate last week and was \nasked: What happens if this fund runs out of money? What if our guess \nthat it is going to cost $150 billion is wrong? He gave an honest \nanswer: We will just cut the compensation to victims and give them less \nmoney.\n  I think that is right. That is the only place to turn because the \nalternative is to turn back to the U.S. Treasury. That is what this \nbudget point of order is all about.\n  Members of Congress in the Senate and House who are mindful of the \nbudget deficit we face together understand that we are not only \nplunging into the darkness with this trust fund, into something that \nhas never been tested or tried at this magnitude but, more importantly, \nwe are putting at risk the lives and fortunes of families across \nAmerica, innocent victims of asbestos exposure, who simply want justice \nso that before their loved one dies, before the suffering continues \nfrom asbestos exposure, that, in fact, they will have a chance for fair \ncompensation. With this trust fund they will not. Their lawsuit will \nstop the minute this bill is signed into law, if it reaches that point. \nTheir day in court is over. They will wait to see if this trust fund, \nas promised, will make them whole.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I see the Senator from Delaware. \nHow much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 15\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield to the Senator from Delaware 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have refrained from speaking on this bill \nup until now because, quite frankly, my colleague, our leader, Senator \nDurbin, and our ranking Member of the Committee on the Budget and \nothers have spoken with eloquence and precision, I believe, about this \npoint of order.\n  I have a number of amendments if this point of order fails. But \nbefore the\n\n[[Page S1162]]\n\ntime closes on this vote, I did want to ask the indulgence of my \ncolleagues to make a few very brief points.\n  No. 1, this is a Herculean attempt by one of my best friends in the \nSenate--one of my best friends, period, Senator Specter--to try to deal \nwith the real problem. The real problem is that there are a lot of \npeople out there suffering from the effects of asbestos. There are not \na lot of companies out there with the money to pay all of these claims. \nThere is the concern that some of the very companies we have to go to, \nto recover from, may very well declare bankruptcy. So I understand the \nmotivation. It is a decent, honorable motivation.\n  But the bottom line is, what we are asking an awful lot of people to \ndo is to give up a right in tort that has existed in common law for \nhundreds and hundreds of years prior to our Nation's history but \nthroughout our Nation's history. The deal was it would be in return for \na guarantee. They would take less, they would get in line, people who \nhad claims they could pursue now would not be able to pursue them \nimmediately until the medical effects occurred. All kinds of \nlimitations were prepared to be put on individuals' rights and claims \nin return for a deal.\n  What was the deal? The deal was that they--the victim--having met the \ncriteria of the bill, would be guaranteed a payment and guaranteed a \npayment within a time certain and that everyone would know the rules.\n  When I was a young Senator my first year here, I was No. 100 in \nseniority. I sat in the back corner. Russell Long was in the Senate \nwith the finance bill. Senator Schweiker of Pennsylvania and Senator \nCase from New Jersey and I worked out an agreement related to a compact \nrelating to the Delaware River area. I walked up to the Senator from \nLouisiana, Mr. Long, and I said: Senator, I hope you can support this. \nWe have worked this out. He said: Yes, I will be with you. I will be \nwith you.\n  I had a staffer who had a lot more experience than I. I had only been \nhere months, maybe a year. This staffer worked here before and was \nseasoned and said: By the way, ask for a rollcall vote. I asked for a \nrollcall vote. And in the process, when the vote came, it got to Long \nand Long voted ``no.'' I said: He just told me ``yes.''\n  Well, he told me, yes, he would vote for it, if it were not a \nrollcall vote. I didn't know he said that, but he meant that only if it \nwas a voice vote he would vote for it--meaning he could drop it in \nconference. I walked up to him and I said: Senator, we had a deal. And \nI was referring to my colleagues from Pennsylvania and New Jersey and \nDelaware. And he put his arm around me, as only he could do, he pulled \nme in close like he used to do to everyone: Joe, as my Uncle Earl used \nto say: I ain't for no deal I ain't in on.\n\n  Guess what. The victims are not in on this bill. They are not in on \nthis bill. Because if my colleagues are right--and I believe they are--\nabout how short this fund is going to come and how quickly it is going \nto reach that point, and how underfunded right from the very beginning \nthis is likely to be, guess what happens. At some point, the \nadministrator of this whole outfit can look down the road and say: By \nthe way, we are going to run out of money, and he can recommend a \ncouple of things. He can recommend that the criteria to qualify change. \nHe can recommend that the amount of money recovered change or he can \nrecommend the fund sunset and people go back, in part, to what they had \nbefore.\n  What would happen if I had said to the business community: There is \none other thing he could do. He could go back and change the \ncontributions and what category each of the businesses fall in. He has \nthe discretion to do that. He can go to a company that had more money \nthan another company, even though not as much responsibility, and kick \nthem up into a higher category. I wonder how many of my friends would \nbe saying: Wait, wait, wait a minute. That is not fair. Businesses have \nto plan. Businesses have to have certainty. You have to make sure that \nwhat you tell them in here is going to happen.\n  Guess what, folks. That is what we are doing to the victim. That is \nwhat we are doing to you, the person who gave up your right that only \nthe Congress can take away from you. Give up your right.\n  There is much more to say. I hope I will not have to say it because I \nhope this point of order is sustained. But if it is not, there are a \nnumber of amendments I have.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much.\n  The bottom line is, I do not, for a moment--and, again, because he is \non the floor and he is my friend--I do not question the motivation, the \nintention, the desire, the intensity with which my friend from \nPennsylvania feels about this issue. I believe he believes if this \npasses we are going to be doing the victims of asbestosis--and all \nother aspects of the exposure to asbestos--we are going to be doing \nthem more good than harm.\n  But I disagree. If the money were here, if the money were guaranteed, \nunder no circumstances could it fall short, then, in fact, that would \nbe the case. But the last piece I will mention here is, I heard my good \nfriend from California talk about Goldman Sachs has a list. Isn't this \namazing? We are about to vote on a bill that by some measure will cost \nat least $140 billion to somebody--I think a lot more--and there is a \nlist that Goldman Sachs has. And we don't? I ain't for no deal I ain't \nin on. I ain't in on this deal. I am not for it. I am not for it.\n  I thank the Chair and thank my colleague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware.\n  I wish to add, we brought up this whole issue of this secret list \nlast week, and Senator Specter came to the floor and he said he \nbelieves for a variety of reasons he cannot tell us, cannot disclose to \nthe public, the contributors, the businesses that will contribute to \nthis fund and how much they are going to be asked to give. So we are \ndealing with an amount, $140 billion, that many people question. \nSerious groups have analyzed it and said it is not nearly enough. And \nwhen it comes to the contributions from businesses to create the fund, \nwe are dealing with a secret list.\n  This may be the first time in the history of the Senate we have \nspoken on the floor openly about how things are determined. Apparently \nthis one company that has been mentioned on the floor created a list of \nbusinesses and decided how much, under the criteria, they would be \npaying in.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from Illinois yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. On your time I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have no time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has no time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield for a question, if it is pointed.\n  Mr. SPECTER. When you refer to the so-called secret list, as I \npointed out to you on several occasions over the past several days, \nisn't it true you have seen the list?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No, I have not. And I thank the Senator for raising that \npoint.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Isn't it true the list has been made available to you to \nsee?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator the same thing I said last \nweek when we engaged in this conversation: For some reason, the \nSenator--whom I respect very much, and I have said this publicly, and \nit is not to be construed otherwise--has decided this list is \nconfidential. So the list is made accessible to staff members and \nMembers of the Senate to view but not to take notes or copies. Now, \nthat is fact.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield----\n  Mr. DURBIN. And when I asked the Senator from Pennsylvania if he \nwould make this list part of the Record, so we could see it right here \nin the Congressional Record, published for America to see, he said he \nwould take it under advisement. He came back the next day and said for \na variety of reasons, he could not do it. The fact remains----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Not until I complete my thought. The fact remains that \nthis list is secret to the public. If this is a public forum, if we are \nconsidering legislation that will impact the public, why, then, is the \nmost fundamental\n\n[[Page S1163]]\n\nquestion about who will pay into this trust fund being kept \nconfidential and secret?\n  It strikes me as straining credulity that this process is so open and \ntransparent that we cannot tell the businesses of America how much they \nhave to pay in or the victims of America how much they can expect to \nreceive into this trust fund for their own payments. That is a fact. \nAnd because staff members or Senators can go to the hearing room and \nlook through the report--not make a note, not make a copy--does not \ncreate a lot of confidence.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois at this \npoint yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I believe the Senator from New Jersey is coming to the \nfloor and asked to speak. With only 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining, I reserve \nthe remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield for 30 seconds?\n  Mr. DURBIN. To show the Senator from Pennsylvania how much I respect \nhim, yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Would the Senator from Illinois be willing to accept, in \nopen court, the list?\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I am allowed to put it in the Record.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator from Illinois would be bound by the \ndenomination on the list, which is law and Senate rules. It is not \nsomething Arlen Specter has made up. But this is a list which you can \nhave in your hand. It is not a secret list, but there are rules of \nconfidentiality established by law and by Senate rule.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator----\n  Mr. SPECTER. And if the Senator from Illinois declines, that is fine \nwith me.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, I think he \nhas constructed a situation here that isn't fair to this process. To \nthink that we would be dealing with the lives and fortunes of so many \nhundreds of thousands of families, and that we are saying we cannot \nshare with them the most fundamental information about how this trust \nfund is created, I think we could do better, we should do better in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Would the Senator from Illinois accept my \ncharacterization of his position as ridiculous?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No. I would accept my characterization as challenging the \nSenator from Pennsylvania to accept the obvious. If this list has been \ncreated by some private company and cannot be shared with the people of \nAmerica in the midst of the debate on this important bill, there is a \nserious flaw in this legislation, a flaw that cannot be overcome, even \nwith the good feelings I have for the chairman of this committee.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I want to speak. We are debating a budget \npoint of order. People in America are thinking this is some kind of a \ntechnical jargon that Senators are using. What does it mean?\n  A budget point of order is a parliamentary rule that can be used to \nmake sure that the Senate carefully weighs whether we are putting undue \nburdens and obligations on future Congresses, which obviously means to \nfuture generations of Americans.\n  We are raising--and I have raised--this budget point of order today. \nI will be the first one to admit, it is a very technical budget point \nof order. But let me explain the reasons I believe it is a real budget \npoint of order in its effect, stopping huge obligations by this \nGovernment in the future.\n  In the wisdom, I believe, of the Senate in last year's budget, we put \nin a budget point of order that would say beyond 10 years, if there is \nspending of more than $5 billion obligated, a bill would be subject to \na budget point of order. It is because it had become practice around \nhere to make things kind of ramp up, and, then, in the future spend the \nmoney so it did not look as though we were spending money now. It \nlooked as though things were either budget neutral or had very little \nimpact on the budget.\n  I said the other day on this very floor, talking about what is going \nto happen with Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, as the baby \nboomers retire in this country, it is a serious problem we are facing. \nIf there is a problem with this trust fund--which many people believe \nthere will be a huge problem with this trust fund, that it will be \ngrossly underfunded--if the problem ends up coming back to the \ntaxpayer, it will happen at a time when the baby boomers are starting \nto retire.\n\n  I know the Presiding Officer from South Carolina is one of the most \nfiscally responsible people in this body. I have followed his short \nrecord in the Senate and know how passionate he is about our \nentitlement programs. I feel the same way he does. But with that \nlooming problem of the baby boomers coming up, the last thing we can \nafford to do is to enact a bill that potentially could have a major \nimpact--literally, maybe with a number in the hundreds of billions of \ndollars--that could have a drain on our Government.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania says there are no Federal revenues at \nstake here, the trust fund does not allow for that. Here is why I think \nit is a real budget point of order. I have been around this place long \nenough--I have only been here in the Senate 5 years, and in the House \nbefore that 4 years, but that is long enough to see how this town \nworks. The Congress is creating this trust fund. If this trust fund \nruns out of money and there are still victims around, the people in \nthis very body will stand up and say: Congress created the problem, \nCongress needs to fix the problem. Everybody will join in because there \nwill be victims and people will have posters of victims out there. And \nthere are real victims, people who are suffering, people who are not \ngetting the help they need today. That is why I believe this is a real \nbudget point of order because I think the Congress will act and will \ngive the money to supplement the trust fund. It will not be their \nmoney; it will be the taxpayers' money. But they will give the money.\n  Now, I have heard a lot of people come down here and say why there is \na problem. The fact is, we have a broken legal system that needs to be \nfixed. The trial lawyers in this country have discovered these class \naction lawsuits: Bring your Rolodex in and we will see who we can sue. \nAnd so many people who are not victims are clogging up the courts, who \nI believe are led there by unscrupulous lawyers. It is blocking real \nvictims from receiving compensation.\n  It has been said that many businesses have gone out of business. The \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee has argued one of the reasons we \nneed the trust fund is because a lot of businesses have gone out of \nbusiness so there is nobody left to sue. Why did they go out of \nbusiness in the first place? It is because of frivolous lawsuits, \nhaving to spend millions and millions of dollars defending themselves. \nIn a lot of these cases, the businesses had nothing to do with \nasbestos.\n  I remember this one company that came in to visit me. They were an \ninsurance company thinking of getting into insuring folks in the \nasbestos field. So they did a study. They came to the conclusion it was \ntoo risky, and they decided not to go into that business. I forget the \nexact figure, but I know since that time they have paid hundreds of \nmillions of dollars out defending themselves because they did not \nrelease the study.\n  This was their own internal document they used to decide whether they \nwere going to go into a certain business. But because they did not \nrelease the study, trial lawyers brought them in to the courts and sued \nthem. In many cases, it is cheaper to settle than it is to defend \nyourself in court. So they paid out umpteen millions of dollars.\n  The problem with that is insurance companies are a passthrough. \nAmericans are paying the bills. They are just a company that takes in \npremiums and pays out claims. They are there to make a profit. And if \nthey have to pay things out, they have to raise the premiums, which we \nall pay.\n\n[[Page S1164]]\n\n  So we know there is a serious problem. We know it has been caused \nbecause of a bad system, and we need to fix the system. I am the first \none who wants to stand up here to fix the system. The alliance that has \nbeen formed here to try to support this budget point of order is a \nlittle strange. There are some fiscal conservatives. There are some \npeople who support the trial lawyers. I have never been exactly claimed \nby the trial lawyers as being one of their friends, and I feel a little \nuncomfortable to be in this position, to be honest with you. But I am \nstanding up for this budget point of order because I believe this bill \nis fiscally irresponsible to the taxpayers into the future.\n  Now, I want to address one other portion or one other thought no one \nhas addressed on the floor of the Senate. I was in the House of \nRepresentatives for 4 years, and there I served on the Ways and Means \nCommittee. The Constitution of the United States says something very \nclear. It is a very simple writing. That is the beauty of the \nConstitution, how simple the writing is. Section 7 of article I of the \nConstitution states:\n\n       All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House \n     of Representatives. . . .\n\n  That is a very simple statement. In the letter to the budget \nchairman, the Congressional Budget Office says:\n\n       CBO expects those sums--\n\n  Talking about the sums for the trust fund--\n\n     would be treated in the budget as Federal revenues.\n\n  Section 7:\n\n       All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House \n     of Representatives.\n\n  Any Member of the House of Representatives can raise this \nconstitutional question. I cannot remember a time when somebody raised \nthis constitutional question when the House of Representatives did not \nsupport it. It is called a blue slip. I raised one when I was there. It \nwas on the nuclear waste bill that was up. I raised that budget point \nof order, and that was at a time when the vast majority of House \nMembers supported the nuclear waste bill. Yet they supported me on that \nblue slip, that constitutional question, because they wanted to protect \ntheir rights as a body.\n  Well, beyond the budget point of order, we may be spinning our wheels \nbecause this trust fund raises revenues, and it is the prerogative of \nthe House of Representatives to start a bill like that. So even beyond \nthe budget point of order, we may be wasting our time with this bill \nbecause of the trust fund that has been set up.\n  So I encourage my colleagues, let's sustain this budget point of \norder and start over. Let's get a good medical criteria bill, work in a \nbipartisan fashion, get together and limit it.\n  Let's make sure that victims of asbestosis and mesothelioma are \ncompensated. Let's get rid of all of the phony claims. It will quit \nclogging up our court system. We won't have all these lawyers getting \nrich over all these class action lawsuits. We will actually get the \nvictims their just compensation.\n  If we join together and get something done and quit making partisan \npolitical points, I believe the actual victims will be better off, but \nso will those businesses that are threatened to go out of existence \neven as we speak.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I think I have been yielded time. I \nwould like to check with the people at the desk to see whether that is \nthe case. I heard the Senator from Illinois say I was expected on the \nfloor. Is that noted in the Record in any way?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have no record of the Senator from Illinois \nyielding time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, since I am on the floor and there is \nnobody else here on the Democratic side, I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe permitted to speak for not more than 5 minutes or so.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Whose time is that coming off of, Mr. President?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I believe it is our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There would be an additional 5 minutes, unless \nsomeone else yields time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: The opponents of the \nposition of the Senator from Nevada, how much time do they have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 23 minutes. The \nSenator from Illinois has 3 minutes 22 seconds.\n  The Senator from Vermont has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. This is in opposition to the position. I will reserve my \n15 minutes for the Senator from Pennsylvania and myself.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, before the Senator from New Jersey speaks, \nI yield 15 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey made a unanimous \nconsent request for 5 minutes. Is there objection to that?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to use Senator Durbin's \ntime. He has 3 minutes left. I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to use Senator Durbin's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, since time is limited, I am going to \nget down to the nuts and bolts. I come from a State in which asbestos \nwas prominent in manufacturing in many places. As a matter of fact, \nearly in the 1950s, a doctor named Irving Selikoff, who was a \nresearcher as well as a physician, discovered the lethality of \nasbestos. He is the one who raised the alarm about the dangers of that \nproduct.\n  He saw mesothelioma and asbestosis.\n  In my office in New Jersey, I had a man and his wife and his mature \nson, who was about 30 years old, come in to see me because they all had \nmesothelioma, but only the father worked in the manufacturing facility, \nthe mill. His wife and child, his son, were made ill as a result of the \nmother washing her husband's clothes. That is how lethal, how dangerous \nasbestos is.\n  This bill is an abstract exercise. There are real people involved, \npeople who are going to die as a result of the exposure. I have seen it \nup front and personal. A friend of mine who was a lawyer, after \npracticing 20 years, got a call from a member of a union one day that \nhad asbestos workers, and he was told to get a chest x ray. He did. \nAfter 20 years of no illness, nothing, suddenly they found that he had \na spot on his lung, and it turned into mesothelioma and he was dead \nsoon thereafter.\n  I recently had a World War II vet--I am one as well--come into my \noffice, sick from mesothelioma, from work he did 40 years ago. We have \nseen so many cases where the gestation period is so long, so that to \nsuddenly close this out and say that is going to be enough money, $140 \nbillion--it sounds like a lot, but it is not a lot when it comes to \nindividuals who need help and who need to be able to continue to \nconduct their lives and do whatever they can to make life comfortable.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has stated that the fund will need \n$10 billion more. Other analysts put the figure as high as $300 \nbillion. So it is fairly obvious that I am going to oppose this bill \nand support the point of order. I urge my colleagues to do the same \nbecause what we are doing is dismissing the suffering of people who \nhave been exposed to this, even though the companies knew how dangerous \nthe material was they were working with. They permitted people to work \nwith it and did not do anything about it, except ultimately, in many \ncases, they went bankrupt as a result of their behavior.\n  I yield the floor, and I hope my colleagues will oppose this bill and \nsupport the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first, I want to acknowledge the \nextraordinary amount of work that the chairman of the committee and the \nranking member have put into this bill, and how much I admire the \ndiligence they have brought to the task.\n  I rise today on the question of a budget point of order that has been \nraised by the Senator from Nevada. That budget point of order is \nclearly well taken. A number of months ago, my technical staff on the \nBudget Committee came to me and said they had\n\n[[Page S1165]]\n\nbeen reviewing this legislation and they wanted to alert me that they \nbelieved this legislation was underwater, that it was underfunded, that \nit would lead to severe consequences not only for taxpayers but also \nfor those who were the victims; it might also lead to severe \nconsequences to companies that thought they were escaping the court \nsystem.\n  Why is that? Well, it is true because the analysis that has been done \ndemonstrates it is much more likely this fund will go insolvent than \nnot. Why?\n  First, because claims and administrative expenses are likely to \nexceed the contributions to the asbestos trust fund.\n  Second, upfront claims will far exceed contributions, so the trust \nfund will have to borrow substantial amounts, and that borrowing will \ncome from the Federal Treasury, increasing the ultimate cost.\n  Third, small adjustments in the amount and timing of the assumptions \nquickly bankrupt the trust fund.\n  Finally, it is very unrealistic to assume that the trust fund, once \ninitiated, will ever terminate.\n  Mr. President, CBO said in a letter today:\n\n       CBO cannot estimate any costs or savings that might result \n     from several features or consequences of the legislation. A \n     number of those features could add to the cost of the \n     legislation.\n\n  What are those features? Here are a number of things that CBO said \nthey could not estimate. They said they made no provision for dormant \nclaims. Dormant claims are cases that were brought previously but for \nwhich there is nobody to pay under the current system. No. 2, we also \nknow there are trusts that are only paying cents on the dollar. Those \ndormant claims could come back against this fund.\n  Second, exceptional medical claims: Exceptional medical claims are \nclaims that don't fit neatly into one of the nine categories provided \nfor in this bill. CBO said they could not make an estimate for those.\n  Third, CBO made no estimates for family members' claims; that is, \nfamily members who have been affected because a loved one comes home \nwith asbestos on their work clothes. I had a family come to me where \nboth the mother and the daughter became ill because the husband brought \nasbestos home on his work clothes and that made them ill. They will \nhave claims.\n  Then there was no provision for CT scans, which were omitted; that \nis, costs associated with using CT scans for plural abnormalities as \nevidence of asbestosis.\n  It also omitted the cost of compensating victims at other Libby-like \nsites. Libby is an unusual circumstance, but it is not the only one \nwhere an entire community has been badly hurt. That will increase the \ncost.\n  We have only found one area where there might be potential savings, \nand that is the medical studies area. That is a circumstance where \nthere could preclude some tier VI cancer claims, and that could reduce \ncosts. But it will affect fewer than 1 percent of claims.\n  There are additional areas of uncertainty in the CBO analysis: the \nnumber of future cancer claims. CBO estimated 78,000 new cancer claims. \nThe Tilling-Hast study, financed by Johns Manville--so it is not \nfinanced by the trial bar or by labor unions, not financed by companies \nwho are against this legislation. Instead, it was financed by the Johns \nManville trust. The Tilling-Hast study did 14 different scenarios. They \nconcluded, on average, there would be 133,000 new cancer claims, not \nthe 78,000 provided for in the CBO analysis. If they are right, this \nbill is $295 billion underwater instead of the $150 billion we have \nassumed, based on increasing the cancer claims from the 78,000 in the \nCBO study to 90,000.\n  The percent of nonmalignant claims is another area we believe will \nincrease costs. CBO says only 15 percent of the people will fall into \ntier II and tier III. Tier II gets $25,000 cash reimbursement. Tier III \ngets $100,000. They say only 15 percent of the claims will fall there. \nOther objective experts say it is more like 10 to 40 percent. We took \nthe midrange of that estimate, 25 percent. We think that is a more \nprudent estimate of the amount of financing costs on fund borrowing.\n  We have heard over and over that this will only cost $120 billion to \n$140 billion or $120 billion to $150 billion, depending on the \nestimates, and that CBO has said there is an assumption that the claims \nwill cost in that range: $120 billion to $150 billion. That leaves out \nsomething. That leaves out something pretty important. That leaves out \nthe financing costs because everyone acknowledges that the early claims \nwill be far in excess of the early revenue. The result is an enormous \nmismatch between funds going out and funds coming in. That borrowing is \ngoing to be made from the Federal Treasury. The interest cost on that \nmoney has not been calculated in the work of CBO. They acknowledge \nthat. That is the biggest single difference we have identified. You \nhave to include financing cost.\n  In addition to that, the amount of revenue in the trust fund may well \nreduce revenue. In fact, CBO notes that revenues will be, at most, $140 \nbillion, and that revenues could be significantly less.\n  When we put all of these factors together, our analysis, using very \nconservative assumptions, including the asbestos trust fund, faces a \nshortfall of at least $150 billion over its lifetime or $50 billion in \nnet present value.\n  Using what I believe is a more realistic estimate of future cancer \nclaims, the 133,000 average in the Tillinghast study, the shortfall \nwould grow to nearly $300 billion. That really shouldn't be a surprise \nbecause if we look at what has happened with other funds like this, \nwhat we have found is that very often the initial estimates are \nentirely wrong.\n  If we look at the original range of the Manville claims, this \nestimate was done back in the late 1980s, and they estimated there \nwould be 50,000 to 200,000 claims. Already, there have been 690,000 \nclaims. They now estimate there will be 1.4 million, for a final total \nof over 2.1 million claims. When they initially started, they said \nthere would be 50,000 to 200,000. They were wrong by a country mile.\n  We looked at the black lung fund. Back in the late 1960s when it was \ninitiated, they said the total cost would be $3 billion. We are at $41 \nbillion today and counting.\n  The hard reality is that CBO has reaffirmed there is a significant \nlikelihood that the asbestos funding is inadequate. Here is what they \nsaid in a letter today:\n\n       CBO's analysis indicates that the proposed trust fund under \n     Senate amendment 2746 might not have adequate resources to \n     pay all valid claims. There is a significant likelihood that \n     the fund's revenues would fall short of the amount needed to \n     pay valid claims, debt service, and administrative costs.\n\n  Let there be no doubt. This is what it says.\n  In the point of order which has been brought by the Senator from \nNevada, it shall not be in order to consider any bill, joint \nresolution, amendment, motion, or conference report which would cause a \nnet increase in direct spending in excess of $5 billion in any of the \nfour 10-year periods beginning in 2016 through 2055.\n  S. 852 creates an entitlement. The language could not be more clear. \nIt says in section 131:\n\n       An asbestos claimant who meets the requirements of section \n     111 shall be entitled to an award in an amount determined by \n     reference to the benefit table and the matrices developed \n     under section (b).\n\n  Are these all just words? Are all these just numbers on a page? Or \ndoes this have some real-world consequence?\n  We can look to the Johns Manville trust for the answer to that \nquestion. Because they estimated incorrectly, because they dramatically \nunderestimated the number of claims, claimants today are getting 5 \ncents on the dollar. Five cents on the dollar. That could happen to \nvictims. The other possibility, of course, is that people will come to \nCongress and say: Look, you designed this fund. You said it was going \nto produce. You said it was going to work. Now it has failed. You have \nto pony up. You have to pay. What do my colleagues think is the most \nlikely outcome in the years ahead?\n  CBO has also confirmed that the long-term spending point of order \nexists against this legislation. Here is what they said, and this was \non February 13, yesterday:\n\n       Substantial payments from the fund would continue well \n     after 2015. Consequently, pursuant to section 407 of H. Con. \n     Res. 95, CBO estimates that enacting the bill as amended\n\n[[Page S1166]]\n\n     would cause an increase in net direct spending greater than \n     $5 billion in at least one of the 10-year periods from 2016 \n     to 2055.\n\n  CBO also reaffirmed that the fund is governmental:\n\n       Operating the Asbestos Injury Claims Resolution Fund would \n     be an entirely new governmental task, and CBO and other \n     analysts have little basis for judging how the fund's \n     administrator would implement the legislation.\n\n  CBO's estimate shows that the asbestos bill will worsen the Federal \ndeficit by $7 billion over the first 10 years. We believe that is very \nconservative. We believe the amount of increase to the deficit will be \nfar in excess of that when we adjust for the dormant claims, when we \nadjust for the debt service, when we adjust for the other expenses that \nhave been left out.\n\n  There have been some who have said: Well, these really aren't Federal \nfunds. Oh, yes, they are. These are Federal funds because the money, \njust as it is in all of these instances of trust funds, is considered \nFederal--in the airport and airway trust fund, in the black lung \ndisability fund, in the hazardous substance Superfund, in the highway \ntrust fund, and in the unemployment insurance fund. It doesn't matter \nthat, yes, there are private funds here; without question, that is part \nof the picture, but it is not the whole picture. In every one of these \ncases where we have private funds being mixed with Government funds, \nthe final result is considered governmental payments. The above trust \nfunds receive ``private'' receipts that are designated for specific \npurposes. Spending from these trust funds is treated as Federal.\n  At the end of the day, we have to make a judgment. Some have said: \nThe Federal Government's exposure is limited, it is restricted, because \nafter $40 billion, it shuts down. I think we have to ask ourselves: Is \nthat likely? Is that really likely to occur? Can we imagine the \ncompanies being told they owe $40 billion back to the Federal Treasury \nand they are exposed to going back to court? If we want a march on \nWashington, enact this legislation, because it will go insolvent in the \nsecond 10-year period, according to our estimates, and we will have a \nrun on Washington unlike anything we have seen in the modern age.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining to the various \nparties?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 15 minutes, and \nthe Senator from Nevada has 8 minutes. That is all the remaining time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield the remainder of my \ntime to the Senator from Pennsylvania, but I would like to make just a \ncouple of points, if he doesn't mind, before I do that.\n  Mr. President, with all of the talk, let us not lose sight of a \ncouple of things. This bill does not violate 407(b), no matter what \nanybody says, because we specifically say the taxpayer funds will not \nbe spent to compensate victims of asbestos exposure. That has been our \nposition from day one, and that is what the bill says today: not a \nsingle dollar is spent. In fact, the CBO states that over the life of \nthe fund, whether or not it sunsets, we would not expect the \nlegislation to add to the aggregate Federal debt. It just doesn't add \nto debt. The Federal Government is involved only because it acts as a \nconduit for the private funding of $140 billion. All the parties said \nthey wanted that in the Department of Labor because they had the \nexperience and the infrastructure necessary to set up a quick start for \nthe victims.\n  We have heard the figures about projection of interest rates. If we \nfollow those projections, the interest rates would have to be at 25 \npercent. Twenty-five percent. Even with the recent increases by the \nFederal Reserve Board, we are still way in the low single digits.\n  The CBO considered all the estimates. They met with dozens of \nfinancial experts, economists, auditors, everybody. They say payments \nwere raised from $120 billion to $150 billion, at most. They said $140 \nbillion will cover all claims, payments, administrative costs, and \nborrowing costs. That is why we have the financial institutions, we \nhave our veterans, we have labor. As this chart shows, labor \norganizations are strongly for it.\n  Then we ought to keep in mind that these are the people who are not \ngoing to recover unless this bill goes through, and 26 veterans \norganizations have come out to say they oppose this budget point of \norder. Twenty-six veterans organizations oppose it because they know \nthey need this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to comment briefly on the \ndisagreement I had with the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin. He has \nmade the false representation that there is a secret list of who is \ngoing to provide the money. It is not a secret list. It has been made \navailable, and I offered it to him on the floor. But under the law, \nwhen it contains confidential information, it is available for the \nSenators and their staffs and those preparing the legislation, but it \nis not available for the general public on trade secrets. When the bill \nis certified, then it goes into the public record and the public \ndomain. But to say that it is a secret list is the purest form of \ndemagoguery and a specious argument.\n  On to the essential point of this budget point of order, it does not \nhave any substantive merit because there is no Federal money involved. \nThe Federal Government is implicated only because the Department of \nLabor is a conduit. That is the only reason the Federal Government is \ninvolved.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has said flatly in the letter to me \ndated yesterday:\n\n       CBO concludes that the legislation would be deficit-neutral \n     over the life of the fund.\n\n  CBO, in their letter today to Senator Conrad, repeated:\n\n       CBO concluded in its February 13 letter to Senators Gregg \n     and Specter that the proposed amendment would be deficit-\n     neutral over the life of the fund.\n\n  So there is no Federal money involved, pure and simple, and there is \nno basis to say that the budget would be impacted, so that on the \nmerits, there is no basis for this point of order.\n  The practical application is that if this point of order is \nsustained, this bill will die. This is an issue which has been before \nthe Judiciary Committee for the better part of three decades, and it \nhas been before the committee in the past 3 years on a very intense \nbasis. The majority leader has set aside 2 weeks for the consideration \nof this bill. If this point of order is overruled, we will proceed to a \ncloture vote tomorrow, and we will proceed to take up amendments, and \nwe have a realistic chance of concluding this bill yet this week. It is \nbacked up against a recess period, and we have a chance to finish this \nbill.\n  If this point of order is sustained, then the work which Judge Becker \nhas done in presiding over some 36 meetings, attended by 20 to 50 to 60 \nrepresentatives, countless meetings, will be in vain. If the point of \norder is upheld, the bill is gone. If it is rejected, there will be \nample opportunity for amendments to be presented and for the bill to be \nimproved.\n\n  There are those who wish to offer an alternative of a medical \ncriteria bill. I do not think a medical criteria bill is as good as the \ncurrent bill because the medical criteria bill would not cover \nemployees whose companies are bankrupt or veterans who have no one to \nsue. But at least that would be an alternative which would be \npreferable to the current system. I believe it is fair to say that the \nPresiding Officer might be attracted to a medical criteria bill, and \ncertainly many who oppose the trust fund would prefer to have something \nsuch as a medical criteria bill rather than have nothing.\n  If the point of order is upheld and the bill is dropped, you can't do \nanything. There is a question as to whether it is germane, but that is \na matter for the Parliamentarian and that is a matter for ingenuity and \nthat may be worked out. If you do not go to a medical criteria bill, \nthere are germane amendments which could be offered to change the \nmedical criteria.\n  Here again, I am opposed to the modifications, but they could be made \nand the bill could be altered. The whole beauty about the Senate is \nthat--when we have these complex issues and we have the synergism of \n100 Senators and our staffs--with our experience, with our analysis of \nwhat we have done, we have a chance to establish public policy in the \ninterests of Americans.\n\n[[Page S1167]]\n\n  Everybody agrees. Not one person who has taken the floor has \ndisagreed with the enormity of the problem. Everybody agrees that it is \nhorrible that people are dying of deadly diseases from exposure to \nasbestos and have no one from whom to collect.\n  There is disagreement about how to handle it. There is no \ndisagreement about the tremendous amount of work which has been done in \nthis bill. On a strictly personal level, the committee, the staffs, and \nI have put in countless hours that ought not to go down the drain on a \ntechnicality. If we have this bill on the floor for 3 more days this \nweek and if at the end of that time, or whatever time the bill is on \nthe floor, there is a decision made that no bill is better than the \nbill we come to, then so be it. It is rejected. But to have it rejected \non a technicality is a terrible waste of so much time and effort which \nhas gone into bringing this bill to this position.\n  I have made a statement which I believe to be true--although I can't \nprove it--that there has never been a bill subjected to more analysis \nand scrutiny than this bill. Or in the alternative of accepting that \nassertion--I know it is a grandiose assertion--can anybody point to any \nbill which has had more analysis or more scrutiny? What a waste it \nwould be to have it dismissed on a technicality when the consequences \nare that thousands of victims of asbestos will continue to die without \ncompensation, the 77 companies now in bankruptcy will be multiplied, \nand the economy will withstand a $300 billion loss.\n  Let us take 3 more days, as we have taken the past 3 years, to see if \nwe can produce a bill which will satisfy the critics of the present \nmeasure.\n  We have done a count as to how the Senators are going to vote. It is \nimpossible to say with certainty exactly what is going to happen. There \nare too many people who are still undecided. So as I talk to my 99 \ncolleagues, I ask you to weigh very heavily this vote because this is a \nmeasure, as many are, which might be decided by a single vote. Why let \nit all go down the drain on a technicality when we might be able, in \nthe course of 3 more days, to produce something which would be \nsatisfactory to a majority of this body?\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator has 3 minutes 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am willing to yield back the remaining time if the \nSenator from Nevada is.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: The pending motion \nis my motion to waive?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No response having been made to the rollcall, \nthe quorum call is in order.\n  The clerk will call the roll to ascertain the presence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use leader time, in that all time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to \nwaive the valid budget point of order raised by my colleague, Senator \nJohn Ensign. This is not a technicality, it is the absolute foundation \nof this flawed program, this trust fund. A vote on the budget point of \norder is the key vote on this bill.\n  Cloture was filed last night by the majority leader on both the bill \nand the Specter substitute amendment. The first cloture motion will \nripen tomorrow morning. The effect of that action will be to ensure \nthere will be no meaningful opportunity to amend this bill.\n  The chairman of the committee says we should not defeat the bill on a \nbudget point of order and should instead attempt to improve the bill by \namendment. Mr. President, please, that is not very sensible. The \nmajority leader's decision to file cloture last night completely \nundercuts that argument. There is no serious chance this bill will be \nimproved through amendment.\n  Why do I say that? After cloture is invoked on the substitute, only \ngermane amendments will be in order, and after the substitute is \nadopted, no amendments at all will be in order. Many of the most \nimportant amendments to the bill are highly relevant but nongermane. \nThere are lots of them.\n  How about the amendment of Senator Lindsey Graham to deal with \nenvironmental exposure to asbestos across the country? Senator Graham's \namendment, which he has talked about for months now, dealing with \nasbestos exposure around the rest of the country would not be in order. \nThat is hard to accept. There are many other amendments of comparable \nsignificance to that of Lindsey Graham. Any Senator with concerns about \nthe bill should vote to sustain the point of order because the only \nmeaningful way to improve the legislation is by committing it back to \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  I have said that Senator Durbin and I will work with Senator Cornyn \nand others to find an alternative approach along the lines of the Texas \nand Illinois State statutes. The pending bill may be well-intentioned, \nbut it is ill-conceived. It would deprive asbestos victims of their \nright to obtain compensation for their injuries in court and throw them \ninto an administrative system that is doomed to fail. It is doomed to \nfail.\n  If someone doesn't like the entitlement programs in this country, \nthen you should hate this bill before us because it is another \nentitlement program, and it will make the black lung program look \ninsignificant.\n  This program started at $3 billion; it is now $41 billion and on the \nrise still.\n  The trust fund is undercapitalized and structured in a way that will \ndeprive seriously injured victims of fair treatment.\n  The bill is opposed by every major asbestos victims group, as well as \nnumerous scientists and doctors and experts on asbestos-caused \ndiseases, and nearly every labor union.\n  In addition, virtually the entire insurance industry and a large \nnumber of small- and medium-sized businesses oppose this bill. It is \ndeath to too many companies.\n  People stand on the floor of the Senate and talk about cases where \nthey have had to file bankruptcy. When those companies went into \nbankruptcy, they did just fine. Victims did not get their money but \nothers did. A lot of the companies have come out of bankruptcy.\n  Yesterday, Senator Frist and I received a letter signed by more than \n350 individual veterans and their families, representatives of large \nnumbers of people around this country.\n  Among other things in this letter, they state:\n\n       We are aware of the repeated claims by proponents of S. 852 \n     that this legislation is good for veterans. We are also aware \n     that several veterans' organization officials have endorsed \n     the legislation. We, as individual veterans and families, \n     want to make it clear that these officials and organizations \n     do not represent the position, nor the complete position, of \n     the veterans' community. We strongly oppose this legislation. \n     We believe that a system as envisioned by S. 852 would \n     exacerbate, not relieve, the suffering of veterans with \n     asbestos-related diseases.\n\n  The budget point of order before us is significant and goes to the \nheart of the bill. In addition to being unfair to victims, the bill is \nunfair to the Federal taxpayer.\n  I repeat: I have received calls in recent days from Karl Rove saying: \nWhat are we going to do about entitlement programs in this country?\n  He, of course, is concerned.\n  We have a debt ceiling vote that is going to be coming up in the next \nseveral weeks. That is why he called me on behalf of the President.\n  If he is concerned about the entitlement programs that are now in \nexistence, they should really be frightened about this one. This is \nopen ended. Some have said it will be as much as $600 billion \nunderwater.\n  The budget point of order raised by Senator Ensign is clearly valid. \nYesterday, responding to an inquiry from\n\n[[Page S1168]]\n\nChairman Gregg of the Senate Budget Committee, the Congressional Budget \nOffice reaffirmed its conclusion from last August that the bill \nviolates section 407 of the Budget Act. You can manipulate, twist, and \ntry to say it doesn't say what it says, but they say it violates \nsection 407 of the Budget Act. CBO estimates that enacting the bill as \namended would cause an increase in net direct spending.\n  In the same letter, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that in \nthe years 2006 through 2015, the cost of the fund will exceed industry \ncontributions to it by at least $6 billion. The only way to make up \nthat difference is to borrow it. Who do you borrow it from? From the \nFederal Treasury.\n  In a letter to Senator Conrad today, the Congressional Budget Office \nhighlighted the extraordinary uncertainties associated with the cost of \nthis bill.\n  Senator Conrad read parts of this into the Record today, as have \nothers.\n  Senator Conrad, of all people in this body, of all people in this \nbody, is seen as a fair man. His main concern about what is going on in \nGovernment today is spending.\n  I remind everyone that when Senator Conrad was elected in 1986, he \ntook a vow. He said: If the budget is not reduced by the time I stand \nfor reelection, I will not run for reelection. He fulfilled that \ncommitment because the budget deficit had not gone down. He is a man of \nhis word.\n  Unfortunately, the sitting Senator, Mr. Burdick, died, and as a \nresult Senator Conrad is back with us. But he gave up his Senate seat \nbecause he believed the deficit was not right.\n  I think those of you on the other side of the aisle who have worked \nwith Senator Conrad would have to acknowledge that when he deals with \nmatters of fiscal responsibility of this country, he is fair. His own \nindividual analysis indicates that this will be at least $150 billion \nand maybe as much as $290 billion in the red.\n  I remind my colleagues that this bill effectively creates an \nentitlement for asbestos victims and obligates the Federal Government \nto provide compensation to those victims. Throughout the fund's \nexistence, the Federal Government is obligated to pay regardless of the \nactual amount raised by the fund through company contributions; thus \nthis obligation remains so long as the fund is operational. Experts \nconclude that the amount of payouts will outpace the contributions to \nthe fund not just in the near term but in the long term as well.\n\n  I say to my friends, Democrats and Republicans, read the Wall Street \nJournal of today. If there is ever a publication that is concerned \nabout what is happening to the financial situation in this country, we \nall have to acknowledge it is the Wall Street Journal. I don't like a \nlot of their political editorials. But whenever they talk about money, \nI read and listen.\n  In an editorial this morning, that newspaper pointed out, for \nexample, repeating what I said, that the black lung program ``which was \ninitially supposed to cost $3 billion and was later supposed to be \nfinanced by the coal industry, it has since paid out more than $41 \nbillion, borrowing some $9 billion from the Treasury.''\n  They acknowledge that the bill before us is bad.\n  There are alternatives to solving this difficult problem. My friend, \nthe distinguished junior Senator from Texas, is on the Senate floor. I \npledge to work with him on his proposal to establish a medical criteria \nsystem that will assure a more orderly resolution of the asbestos \nclaims. That is the way it is going to be no matter what the outcome of \nthis. The current bill is not the answer.\n  I urge my colleagues to establish a medical criteria system that will \ndo what we think should be done.\n  I very much appreciate the work of Senator Leahy and Senator Specter. \nI think these two Senators have done a wonderful job and are doing the \nbest they can.\n  If my friend, Senator Specter, is on the floor, I would be happy to \nask unanimous consent that he be allowed to speak to respond to \nanything I have said, if he believes that is appropriate.\n  No one on our side will object. I have finished using my leader time. \nI would be happy, if he feels so inclined, to ask unanimous consent \nthat he be given whatever time he wants to respond to what I said.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader for that. I \nshall accept it.\n  Mr. REID. How much time does the Senator need or want?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I didn't know there was a limitation on how much I want.\n  Mr. REID. As minority leader, I was entitled to 10 minutes. I think \nanything over that would be out of the ordinary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will take less than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Specter \nbe allowed to speak for up to 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, whatever arguments are advanced by \nskillful advocates and skillful Senators, the underlying question of \nthis budget point of order is whether the budget will be impacted and \nhurt. The fact is, there is no Federal money. So there is no \nsubstantive merit to the point of order. The Federal Government is \nimplicated only because the Department of Labor is involved as a \nconduit.\n  That is fact No. 1.\n  Fact No. 2 is if this budget point of order is upheld, this bill is \nkilled after 3 intense years of work, with hundreds of meetings, with \nnumerous conferences, and 36 meetings presided over by Judge Becker and \nmyself. And there will be no opportunity to have amendments to improve \nit.\n  We may yet be able to pass a bill which will satisfy the critics.\n  So let us have 3 more days as we have worked 3 years. It has been a \nprocess by the committee for three decades. But let us have 3 more days \nwith all the work that has been done to bring it to this point. \nEveryone agrees with the need for a bill.\n  Everyone agrees there are tens of thousands of asbestos victims who \nare dying without compensation because their companies are bankrupt, or \nbecause they are veterans who sustained their injuries in the service \nand have no one to sue. Everyone agrees it has a tremendous impact on \nthe economy.\n  So let us take 3 more days. This vote is razor thin. Nobody knows how \nit is going to come out. It may well be decided by a single vote, as so \nmany votes are in this body.\n  I ask each of my colleagues to ponder carefully--there are many, as \nlast reported, undecided--and give us the benefit of the doubt. Give me \nthe benefit of the doubt as chairman of the committee who has brought \nthis forward. Give the Judiciary Committee the benefit of the doubt, \nand give the benefit of the doubt to substantially more than 50 \nSenators. We are at least in the high fifties--maybe higher. But give \nus the benefit of the doubt with 3 more days of the time of the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Nevada for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question is on \nagreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We have one absentee tonight, and that may well have determined \nwhich way this particular vote had gone. Thus, I switched my vote from \na yea to a nay, thus the vote was 58 to 41. That allows us to, at some \npoint in the future, have the option to reconsider the motion. We will \nmake a decision on that at some point in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order against the bill is \nsustained. Pursuant to section 312(f) of the Budget Act, the bill is \nrecommitted to the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, in a few moments I will have a very brief \nstatement about what went on with the vote on the asbestos bill, but \nfor our colleagues, I wish to outline where we are going tonight and \nover the next several days.\n  Calendar No. 360, S. 2271, is the USA PATRIOT Act Additional \nReauthorizing Amendments Act. This bill addresses some of the concerns \nof Members on both sides of the aisle as it relates to the PATRIOT Act. \nI believe that we strongly support it and we are prepared to consider \nthis measure next.\n  Therefore, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of S. 2271, the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing \nAmendments Act of 2006.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Feingold, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I had hoped we would at least be able to \nproceed to that bill tonight. As our colleagues know, this bill is \nready to go. It is an important bill. It is important for the safety \nand security of the American people. It is a bill we have worked on for \na long period of time, and we believe there is overwhelming support for \nthis bill. The consent I asked for was for the Senate to begin \nconsideration of that legislation. We had the objection from the other \nside of the aisle that was expressed.\n  I now move to proceed to S. 2271. The motion to proceed is now \npending and is debatable. We have been told that there will be an \neffort to filibuster the motion to proceed. Therefore, I now send a \ncloture motion to the desk and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to S. 2271: to clarify that individuals who receive \n     FISA orders can challenge nondisclosure requirements, that \n     individuals who receive National Security Letters are not \n     required to disclose the name of their attorney, that \n     libraries are not wire or electronic communication service \n     providers unless they provide specific services, and for \n     other purposes.\n         Bill Frist, James Inhofe, Richard Burr, Christopher Bond, \n           Chuck Hagel, Saxby Chambliss, John E. Sununu, Wayne \n           Allard, Johnny Isakson, John Cornyn, Jim DeMint, Craig \n           Thomas, Larry Craig, Ted Stevens, Lindsey Graham, Norm \n           Coleman.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, again, the motion is pending, and if the \nSenators desire to debate the motion they should be prepared to do so. \nThe Chair is obligated to put the question. I put Members on notice \nthat they should remain on the floor if they feel the need to hold up \nthis important legislation; otherwise, we will be proceeding to the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, with respect to the vote we took minutes \nago on the asbestos legislation, it does mean that legislation is, in \nessence, off the floor now, and that we are proceeding with the \nconsideration of the PATRIOT Act, although we have an obstruction \nunderway and we have a threatened filibuster underway, and we will \naddress that in the coming days.\n  The vote on the motion to waive the point of order on the asbestos \nbill was 59 to 40. In order to have the option to keep a heartbeat at \nleast in this piece of legislation, because it is so important to \nvictims, to our economy, to jobs, what I did, as an advocate for the \nSpecter-Leahy bill, is I switched my vote from yes to no. From a \nprocedural standpoint, what that allows me to do as leader is to bring \nthat back to the floor at some appropriate time if there is indication \nto do so in the future.\n  We did have one absentee vote tonight that could have made the \ndifference, and with that I switched my vote. I do want to make it very \nclear, because there is always misunderstanding in terms of when a \nSenator switches his vote, I strongly support the Specter-Leahy bill, \nand I switched my vote for procedural reasons.\n  So this vote did reflect 59 to 40 on the floor, although the actual \nvote is depicted as 58 to 41.\n  Let me also add, and I think I speak for the majority of my \ncolleagues, that I am disappointed in the fact we are not able to \nproceed with this asbestos litigation bill. The consequence of this \nvote tonight is that victims who are in need are not going to receive \nfair and just compensation. They deserve it. They need it. The problem \nhas been clearly spelled out on the floor of this body.\n  We have made progress over the last couple of weeks in that people \nrecognize this is a serious problem that has gone on for too long, yet \nhas to be addressed in a legislative way, that it denies justice to \nvictims, that it hurts and punishes our economy and, unless it is \naddressed, will continue to destroy jobs in this country.\n  Unfortunately, by refusing to move forward on this bipartisan bill, a \nbipartisan bill, the Senate chose to protect special interest groups \nrather than the interests of those innocent victims who deserve more. \nThe cost to our society will be felt unless it is addressed sometime in \nthe future.\n  I do thank all of those who acknowledge there is a real and serious \nproblem that Congress should debate, and it must be resolved at some \npoint in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to address the issue that was just \nconsidered before the Senate and say that I hope, now, that we can work \ntogether on a bipartisan basis to find some accommodation--not to \ncreate a trust fund, in an amount that has never been established, with \ncontributions that have never been disclosed publicly but, rather, \nsomething that is much more open and transparent.\n  The starting point is obvious. Some States have already addressed \nthis issue with significant changes in the existing tort system that \nmake it more fair and quicker for victims to get compensation. I think \nthat is the way to address this, and I hope that now we can have an \neffort by Members from both sides of the aisle on a bipartisan basis to \nestablish this.\n  I do quarrel with the leader's conclusion that special interests \ndefeated this legislation. Let's be very honest with the American \npeople. This bill was a clash of the special-interest titans on both \nsides. Senator Bennett of Utah, on the other side of the aisle, whom I \nrespect very much, came to the floor\n\n[[Page S1170]]\n\nand listed 10 major corporations that, with the passage of this \nlegislation, would have saved $20 billion in liability--$20 billion \nthat they would otherwise have to pay to victims of asbestos exposure \naround America. To say that everyone opposing this bill was a special \ninterest but 10 companies that were $20 billion ahead if this bill \npassed were not special interests defies a rational explanation.\n  I would also add that I think we have to consider the fact that when \nwe come down to consider this bill, there is going to have to be give \nand take on both sides, and I hope we can reach that point. Those in \nthe legal community, as well as those who represent the businesses and \ninsurance companies who have stakes in this fight, have to be willing \nto give some ground and to work toward compromise.\n  I came to Congress years ago, and when I arrived the first issue with \nwhich I was confronted was asbestos. It is still here today and there \nare more victims today and we have to find a reasonable way to help \nthose victims.\n  I am heartened by Senator Cornyn of Texas, who has been willing to \ncome to this floor and talk about the medical criterion alternative. I \ndon't know if we can reach an agreement, but I sure want to try. I have \nsaid to my colleagues on this side of the aisle who did not agree with \nthe disposition on the last vote that we should put our heads together \nand see if we can come out with a reasonable answer to this challenge \nwe face. I sincerely hope that can be done.\n  I do have to say I wish the first bill we were considering would not \nhave been this so-called Armageddon of the special interest groups. \nWouldn't it have been much better for us to have considered Medicare \nprescription drug Part D reform when we have millions of seniors across \nAmerica struggling to understand this complicated system, wrestling \nwith plans that may offer the drugs that they need for their life-and-\ndeath situations; wanting the pharmacies they have always trusted to be \nincluded; hoping that they can pay the price of this plan?\n  I hear from these people every day. You would think that Members on \nboth sides of the aisle would be receiving these phone calls and, if \nthey have, you wonder why that was not the first bill that was brought \nup. It would have been a reasonable thing. Some have even suggested we \nshould have brought up ethics reform before we did anything else, and \nwe have introduced a bill on the Democratic side that will try to move \ntoward significant ethics reform. I hope those on the Republican side \nwho feel the same way will join us and make their own suggestions. But \nshouldn't we move to that legislation? That may not be popular with \nsome of the power brokers in this town, but if we want to restore the \nconfidence of the American people in Congress and the people who work \nhere, it certainly ought to be high on their agenda.\n  There again is another issue that we have not considered--ethics. \nMedicare; prescription drugs Part D; addressing the issue of LIHEAP--\nthat's the Low Income Heating and Energy Assistance Program--are \ncritically important across the Nation. We left that undone--\nunderfunded from last Congress. I think there is bipartisan support--I \nknow there is--for us to return to that issue, another one which will \nhelp a lot of needy families, vulnerable Americans across our Nation \nwho are faced with staggering and record heating bills. That, again, is \nan issue that does not have a special interest constituency, but it is \ncertainly one that families are concerned about across our country.\n  I know we are not ready to bring up the issue of health care because \nwe need to do some work on it. For 5 years, we have done virtually \nnothing and the cost of health insurance has gone up, the coverage has \ngone down, people are more vulnerable today than they were a few years \nago and more people are uninsured. We ought to be talking about \nreasonable bipartisan efforts to deal with health insurance and making \nit more affordable and more accessible for every American family. That \nis something that could be done.\n  When some come to the floor and say: This is the No. 1 issue facing \nCongress, the people I represent think there are other issues far more \nimportant, issues that relate to their everyday lives and the \nlivelihoods of their families. I hope we can return to those issues.\n  We have expended a lot of effort and energy on this issue. Perhaps by \nworking on a bipartisan basis we can find a way through this. But in \nthe meantime, let's take up some of these equally important, if not \nmore important, issues for families across America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/14/senate-section/article/S1170-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Specialist Allen \nKokesh, Jr. who died on February 7, 2006, from injuries sustained while \nserving in Iraq. He was a member of Charlie Battery, First Battalion \n147th Field Artillery Brigade of Yankton.\n  Specialist Kokesh was one of five South Dakota National Guard members \ninvolved in a roadside bomb attack on December 4, 2005, en route to \nBaghdad. Two soldiers were killed in the immediate aftermath, Sergeant \nFirst Class Richard Schild and Staff Sergeant Daniel Cuka. Specialist \nKokesh suffered severe wounds, and after being medically evacuated out \nof Iraq, he was transferred to the Brook Army Medical Center at Fort \nSam Houston in San Antonio, TX.\n  Sadly, Specialist Kokesh didn't recover from his wounds and died \nafter developing severe complications. He was a graduate of Yankton \nHigh School and is remembered as a scholar athlete. In fact, he was a \nmember of the Yankton High School championship football team that won \nthe 2002 Class 11AA State title. The leadership skills Specialist \nKokesh demonstrated during high school were clearly evident when he \njoined the South Dakota National Guard that same year. He even \nsuccessfully convinced a fellow classmate, and member of his football \nteam, to join the National Guard the following year.\n  While I am deeply saddened by the loss of any military member serving \nin defense of our great Nation, the loss of the brave soldiers in the \n147th hits close to home. My oldest son, Brooks, served in that unit \nprior to joining the Army as an enlisted soldier with the 101st \nAirborne Division. On behalf of my entire family, I extend our \nheartfelt condolences to Specialist Kokesh's family and friends.\n  Specialist Kokesh's commitment to his fellow members of the South \nDakota National Guard, as well as all those who served in uniform with \nhim, is a testament to the strength of his character and the family \nthat instilled in him these values. His dedicated service to our \ngrateful Nation will never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/14/senate-section/article/S1170-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1170-S1172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION, 2006\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Last week, Senator Kyl placed a statement in the \nCongressional Record regarding the Graham-Levin amendment, which was \nenacted last year as section 1405 of the National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2006 and as section 1005 of the Detainee Treatment \nAct of 2005, as included in the Department of Defense Appropriations \nAct, 2006. Senator Kyl and Senator Reid cosponsored the Graham-Levin \namendment in the Senate.\n  Senator Kyl argues that this provision was intended to retroactively \nstrip the Federal courts, including the Supreme Court, of jurisdiction \nover pending cases. Senator Kyl's statement attached a January 18, \n2006, letter from Senator Kyl and Senator Graham to Attorney General \nGonzales, which makes the same argument.\n  As I stated when the Graham-Levin amendment was before the Senate and\n\n[[Page S1171]]\n\nreiterated when the Senate adopted the conference report containing the \nlegislation, this is not the case. The statute that we enacted does not \nretroactively strip the Supreme Court and other Federal courts of cases \nover which they had already assumed jurisdiction at the time the \nstatute was passed.\n  I do not believe that the unexpressed intentions or after-the-fact \nstatements of Senators--Senator Kyl, myself, or anyone else--can change \nthe facts or the legislative history that existed at the time Congress \nacted on a piece of legislation. The relevant considerations are the \nlanguage of the law itself, the changes that were made to that law as \nit went through the drafting process, and what was clearly stated \nbefore the bill was voted on by the Senate. I make this statement today \nfor the sole purpose of reiterating that history.\n  While section 1405(e)(1) provides that ``no court, justice, or judge \nshall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ \nof habeas corpus,'' the applicability of this language to pending cases \nis addressed in a separate provision--section 1405(h)--the structure \nand history of which make it clear that the courts are not stripped of \ncases over which they have already assumed jurisdiction.\n  Section 1405(h) clearly provides that only one portion of the act \napplies to pending cases: sections (e)(2) and (e)(3), which govern \ndirect appeals from final decisions by military commissions and CSRTs. \nThe rest of the statute becomes effective ``on the date of enactment,'' \nwhich, as Justice Scalia has pointed out, ``is presumed to mean `shall \nhave prospective effect upon enactment,' '' Landgraf v. USI Films.\n  At Congressional Record page S970, Senator Kyl argues that the \noriginal Graham amendment was never ``modified to carve out pending \nlitigation.'' He is incorrect. In fact, the amendment was modified, and \nit was modified for the precise purpose of carving out pending \nlitigation.\n  The original Graham amendment specified that all provisions--\nincluding the restrictions on habeas petitions--applied to pending \ncases. On November 10, 2005, the original Graham amendment was debated \nand adopted by the Senate by a vote of 49-42. At that time, I objected \nto the Graham amendment's provision stripping jurisdiction in pending \ncases. In fact, I explicitly urged at Congressional Record page S12,663 \nthat we not adopt this amendment, in part, because ``It would eliminate \nthe jurisdiction already accepted by the Supreme Court in Hamdan.''\n  Because of my concerns, after the original Graham amendment was \nadopted, I began working on a revised version of the amendment, which \nbecame known as the Graham-Levin amendment. This new version removed \nthe language applying the habeas restrictions to pending cases, and \ninstead limited its retroactive effect only to the standards applicable \nto direct appeals of final determinations that may have been made by \nCSRTs or military commissions.\n  On November 14, 2005, Senator Graham and I introduced this new \nversion to the Senate together. In introducing the new Graham-Levin \namendment, Senator Graham did not specifically address the issue of the \namendment's effect on pending cases before yielding the floor to me. I \ndid address the issue. In particular, I explained to the Senate that \none of the principal reasons that so many of us voted against the prior \nversion of the amendment was its effect on pending cases and that this \nproblem had been addressed in the Graham-Levin amendment that was then \nbefore us. I stated at Congressional Record page S12,755:\n\n       The other problem which I focused on last Thursday \n     [November 10] with the first Graham amendment was that it \n     would have stripped all the courts, including the Supreme \n     Court, of jurisdiction over pending cases. What we have done \n     in this amendment, we have said that the standards in the \n     amendment will be applied in pending cases, but the amendment \n     will not strip the courts of jurisdiction over those cases. \n     For instance, the Supreme Court jurisdiction in Hamdan is \n     not affected. . . . I cosponsored the Graham amendment \n     with Senator Graham because I believe it is a significant \n     improvement over the provision which the Senate approved \n     last Thursday. . . . The direct review will provide for \n     convictions by the military commissions, and because it \n     would not strip courts of jurisdiction over these matters \n     where they have taken jurisdiction, it does, again, apply \n     the substantive law and assume that the courts would apply \n     the substantive law if this amendment is agreed to. \n     However, it does not strip the courts of jurisdiction.\n\n  Senator Graham took the floor again immediately after I concluded my \nexplanation of what our new amendment accomplished. He did not disagree \nwith my statement about the effect of the revised bill on pending cases \nanywhere in his remarks. Indeed, neither Senator Graham nor Senator Kyl \nsaid anything at that time to contest my very clear statement that the \nnew amendment did not retroactively strip the courts of jurisdiction \nover pending cases.\n  When the Senate approved the Graham-Levin Amendment by a vote of 84 \nto 14 on November 15, 2005, I explained again at S12,802 that our \namendment would not strip the courts of jurisdiction over pending \ncases:\n\n       The Graham-Levin-Kyl amendment would not apply the habeas \n     prohibition in paragraph (1) to pending cases. So, although \n     the amendment would change the substantive law applicable to \n     pending cases, it would not strip the courts of jurisdiction \n     to hear them. Under the Graham-Levin-Kyl amendment, the \n     habeas prohibition would take effect on the date of enactment \n     of the legislation. Thus, this prohibition would apply only \n     to new habeas cases filed after the date of enactment. The \n     approach in this amendment preserves comity between the \n     judiciary and legislative branches. It avoids repeating the \n     unfortunate precedent in Ex parte McCardle, in which Congress \n     intervened to strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction over a \n     case which was pending before that Court.\n\n  Again, neither Senator Graham nor Senator Kyl offered a contrary \ninterpretation of the Graham-Levin amendment at that time.\n  The bill then went to a House-Senate conference. At this time, the \ninapplicability of the jurisdiction-stripping provision to pending \ncases was so clear that the administration's allies in the House tried \nin vain to alter the language of the effective date provision to make \nthe jurisdiction-stripping provision apply retroactively to pending \ncases, as it had in the original Graham amendment. I objected to this \nlanguage, and it was rejected by the Senate conferees.\n  At Congressional Record page S14,258, I explained this history when \nthe Senate adopted the conference report on December 21, 2005:\n\n       Under the Supreme Court's ruling in Lindh v. Murphy, 521 \n     U.S. 320, the fact that Congress has chosen not to apply the \n     habeas-stripping provision to pending cases means that the \n     courts retain jurisdiction to consider these appeals. Again, \n     the Senate voted affirmatively to remove language from the \n     original Graham amendment that would have applied this \n     provision to pending cases. The conference report retains the \n     same effective date as the Senate bill, thereby adopting the \n     Senate position that this provision will not strip the courts \n     of jurisdiction in pending cases.\n       Let me be specific.\n       The original Graham amendment approved by the Senate \n     contained language stating that the habeas-stripping \n     provision `shall apply to any application or other action \n     that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.' We objected to this language and it was not included in \n     the Senate-passed bill.\n       An early draft of the Graham-Levin-Kyl amendment contained \n     language stating that the habeas-stripping provision `shall \n     apply to any application or other action that is pending on \n     or after the date of the enactment of this Act, except that \n     the Supreme Court of the United States shall have \n     jurisdiction to determine the lawfulness of the removal, \n     pursuant to such amendment, of its jurisdiction to hear any \n     case in which certiorari has been granted as of such date'. \n     We objected to this language and it was not included in the \n     Senate-passed bill.\n       A House proposal during the conference contained language \n     stating that the habeas-stripping provision `shall apply to \n     any application or other action that is pending on or after \n     the date of enactment of this Act.' We objected to this \n     language and it was not included in the conference report.\n       Rather, the conference report states that the provision \n     ``shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.'' These words have their ordinary meaning--that the \n     provision is prospective in its application, and does not \n     apply to pending cases. By taking this position, we preserve \n     comity between the judicial and legislative branches and \n     avoid repeating the unfortunate precedent in Ex parte \n     McCardle, in which Congress intervened to strip the Supreme \n     Court of jurisdiction over a case which was pending before \n     that Court.\n\n  As a result, the language sought by the administration and its \nallies, which would have applied the jurisdiction-stripping provision \nto pending cases, was not included in the final version of the bill.\n  It was not until after we concluded the conference and the conference \nreport passed the Senate on December 21,\n\n[[Page S1172]]\n\n2005, that Senator Kyl placed a colloquy in the Congressional Record \narguing that Section 1005 should be interpreted to retroactively strip \nthe courts of jurisdiction over pending cases. At the same time, a \nnumber of other Senators placed statements in the Congressional Record \nstating their belief that the provision would not strip the courts of \njurisdiction over pending cases.\n  Those statements, coming as they did after the conclusion of the \nconference and final action on the bill in both the House and the \nSenate, carry no more weight as legislative history than the statement \nthat Senator Kyl placed in the Congressional Record last week or any \nother after-the-fact statement in the Congressional Record. Both the \ncontemporaneous legislative history and the language and structure of \nthe Graham-Levin amendment itself demonstrate that this provision was \nnot intended to, and did not, retroactively strip the Federal courts of \njurisdiction over pending cases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/14/senate-section/article/S1172-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today during Black History Month \nto celebrate and remember the rich history of the millions of African \nAmericans who have made this country what it is today.\n  It is a time to honor leaders from across the country--some who are \nwell known and others who are almost forgotten. It is a time to cherish \nthe pioneers to give them the recognition they deserve and to preserve \ntheir names, faces, and stories for generations to come.\n  This Black History Month, we especially remember and mourn the recent \nloss of two of the key players in the civil rights movement Rosa Parks \nand Coretta Scott King.\n  In October, we said goodbye to the ``First Woman of Civil Rights,'' \nRosa Parks. When Ms. Parks refused to give up her seat on a city bus in \nMontgomery, AL, in 1955, we know that a movement had already begun, but \nshe poured fuel on the fire--inspiring the historic Montgomery bus \nboycott. She refused to give up her seat to a White man because she was \ntired--tired of being treated like a second-class citizen, tired of \nbeing forced to move because someone else decided they deserved to sit \nmore than she did. And she became a model and a hero for me and \ngenerations of Americans looking to make our country truly the land of \nthe free.\n  And then we just lost another icon. Not only was Coretta Scott King \nmarried to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., but she was a pioneer with her \nown voice in the civil rights movement at a time when women were not \noften recognized for their own talents and merit. She was resolute, but \nshe was feisty--someone after my own heart. She founded the King Center \nfor Nonviolent Social Change and saw to it that the center became \ndeeply involved with the issues that she believed breed violence--\nhunger, unemployment, voting rights and racism. And when her husband \nwas tragically shot, she comforted a nation that was torn apart. She is \nthe reason we have a national holiday that honors Dr. King.\n  While we remember the lives and deeds of Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott \nKing, and countless others, we need to honor their memory not just with \nwords, but with deeds. We need to reexamine what this country must \nstill do to ensure equality every day. We need to evaluate the work we \nstill need to do to guarantee that African Americans are not left \nbehind when it comes to the issues that matter.\n  This Black History Month, I am still concerned and dedicated to \nfighting for the issues that matter to African Americans. We must make \nhigher education more affordable for families. We must fight for \nadequate health care. We must fight to keep our neighborhoods and \ncommunities safe. We must fight to make sure the needs of Hurricanes \nKatrina survivors are not forgotten.\n  The cost of college tuition has been skyrocketing. It is putting \nstress on the families and students who have to struggle just to be \nable to pay their bills. That is why I have introduced legislation to \ncreate a tuition tax credit to families and to students who pay for \ntheir own tuition. This legislation would offer a tax credit of up to \n$4,000 a year per student to help them with the cost of the education \nthey deserve. America needs our young people to know that they will not \nbe limited by the size of their wallet to follow their big dreams.\n  I also want to assure African Americans that they are not limited in \nthe health care they receive because of spartan or skimpy funding for \nthe health issues that affect them most. That is why I teamed up with \nCongresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones in the Uterine Fibroids Research \nand Education Act of 2005, to double fibroid research funding and to \nlaunch an education campaign for patients and physicians. Uterine \nfibroids are a terrible, painful ailment that plague mostly African-\nAmerican women. Fibroids affect the entire family--not only the woman \nwho has to endure them but also those who love her and who hate to see \nthe lady they love in so much pain. They have gone ignored for too \nlong. We need to fight for the resources to find the cause, to find \nbetter treatments, and hopefully to find a cure for this devastating \ndisease so that women and families don't have to deal with this pain in \ntheir lives.\n  Families also want to know the neighborhoods they live in are safe. \nThe number of gangs nationwide and in my own home State of Maryland has \nbeen rising. Families don't want to have to worry about gang violence \nin their streets. That is why in Maryland I have helped launch a \nstatewide antigang initiative that I hope can serve as a model for the \ncountry. This initiative will not only go after the bad guys through \nsuppression and enforcement, but it will offer prevention and \nintervention efforts to help the good kids in the communities who are \ntrying so hard. Mothers and fathers shouldn't have to worry about \nlosing their children to gang violence in their neighborhoods, and that \nis why I am going to continue to give help to our communities to \nprotect themselves.\n  We need to offer protection to the survivors of Hurricane Katrina in \nthe gulf coast communities because the Federal Government really let \nthem down. I know the African-American community feels very prickly \nabout this and feels abandoned. They should know that even though \nPresident Bush hires cronies and doesn't have competent people working \nfor him, the American people haven't abandoned them. We are going to \nwork to rebuild the communities in Louisiana. We are going to get the \nsurvivors housing and jobs and health care. We are going to open the \nschools. We are going to stick with them, and we are going to fight for \nthem.\n  So this year during Black History Month, I honor the memories of the \ngreat leaders who have come before us with my commitment to fighting \nfor these important year-round issues. And I am going to do it not just \nwith words, but with deeds. I urge you all to join me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/14/senate-section/article/S1172-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1172-S1173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  IN RECOGNITION OF DR. ROBERT W. GORE\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the \nlifetime of accomplishments of Dr. Robert W. Gore, who was recently \ninducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.\n  In 1957, during his sophomore year at the University of Delaware, Bob \nGore came up with the idea of using polytetraflouroethylene, PTFE, to \ninsulate wire. Little did he know how this seemingly simple idea would \nimpact everything from supercomputers to Arctic exploration.\n  In 1958, Bob's parent's, W.L. ``Bill'' Gore and his wife Genevieve, \nbegan W.L. Gore & Associates in the basement of their Delaware home. \nBill was a research chemist at DuPont and, based on Robert's idea, \ndeveloped and patented a process for insulating wire with PTFE.\n  Bob Gore went on to graduate from the University of Delaware 2 years \nlater and joined his parents in developing and expanding their home \nbusiness. After an order for 7\\1/2\\ miles of insulated cable from the \ncity of Denver, W.L. Gore & Associates opened their first manufacturing \nplant in Newark, DE, in 1961.\n  In 1969, insulated cables from W.L. Gore & Associates were used \nduring the\n\n[[Page S1173]]\n\nfirst moon landing, connecting seismic readers to the landing craft \nduring Neil Armstrong's historic moonwalk. Also in 1969, Dr. Gore began \nmanufacturing cables for use in high-tech supercomputers.\n  While many people would be satisfied with having one of the most \nsuccessful and cutting-edge companies in America, Bob Gore and his \nparents continued to explore the possibilities of \npolytetraflouroethylene. In 1975, a spinoff of this compound, called \nexpanded polytetraflouroethylene, ePTFE, was used to develop vascular \ngrafts that heart surgeons around the world still rely on today. \nRecognized for exceptional performance and quality, they have earned \nthe endorsement of renowned surgeons worldwide and are credited with \nsaving countless lives.\n  In 1976, Bob Gore took the reigns as CEO of W.L. Gore & Associates. \nThis same year, the company received its first order for GORE-TEX \nfabric, which was the first fabric that was both waterproof and \nbreathable. Initially used to make rainwear, this groundbreaking fabric \nwould revolutionize the clothing industry and forever change how people \ninteracted with their environments.\n  In 1990, GORE-TEX proved its toughness in the wilds of Antarctica. An \ninternational team of explorers wore GORE-TEX outerwear while \ntraversing the polar continent. After braving the wilds of this hostile \nenvironment, one member of the team credited the revolutionary fabric \nwith saving his life.\n  Besides the cutting-edge innovation and consistent quality that W.L. \nGore & Associates provides to its customers, the organization has \nconsistently been ranked as one of the ``100 Best Companies to Work \nFor'' by Fortune magazine. This honor is especially significant when \nyou think about the impact that a good corporate environment has on the \nhealth and well-being of its employees. The morale and team structure \nthat W.L. Gore & Associates uses in its day-to-day work environment \nhelps ensure that their employees continue to provide the world with \ncutting-edge products that make our lives easier and better.\n  Bob Gore was named to the University of Delaware's College of \nDistinguished Alumni in 1990 and was inducted into the National Academy \nof Engineering in 1995. In 2005, Dr. Gore was awarded the Perkin Medal, \nwhich is considered to be one of the most prestigious awards for \napplied chemistry.\n  By fostering an environment where people are free to test the \nboundaries of innovation, Bob Gore has created a workplace that \nencourages energy, enthusiasm, and creativity. Whether it is extreme \nweather clothing, surgical components, or guitar strings, the employees \nof W.L. Gore & Associates never settle for second best. The leadership \nof Dr. Gore has made this possible, and all of Delaware is proud that \nhe continues to make sure that the First State remains a leader in \ninnovative products.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/14/senate-section/article/S1173-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IDAHO'S FRIEND IN THE IRS\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve the \nprevention, diagnosis, and treatment of heart disease, stroke, and \nother cardiovascular diseases in women; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``HEART \nfor Women Act of 2006.'' I want to thank Senator Lisa Murkowski for \njoining me on this important legislation. I am also pleased that \nCongresswomen Lois Capps and Barbara Cubin are introducing companion \nlegislation in the House of Representatives.\n  We face an alarming situation in this country. While over the last 25 \nyears we have made good progress in reducing the death rate for men \nwith heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases, the same \ndoes not hold true for women. Not only have we not lowered the \ncardiovascular disease mortality rate for women--the death rate has \nactually gone up for women during that same period.\n  A lot of people think of heart disease as a ``man's disease.'' But \nwhile heart disease is certainly a significant problem for men, it is \nan equally important problem for women.\n  Fact: Heart disease and stroke actually kill more women each year \nthan men.\n  Fact: Heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases are \nthe number 1 killer in the United States and in my home State of \nMichigan. In Michigan, 43 percent of all deaths in women are due to \ncardiovascular disease.\n  Fact: 1 in 3 adult women has some form of cardiovascular disease.\n  Fact: Minority women, particularly African American, Hispanic and \nNative American women are at even greater risk from heart disease and \nstroke.\n  The first step in addressing any problem is acknowledging it--that's \nwhy efforts to educate women about their risk of heart disease are so \nimportant.\n  The good news is that we have made progress in educating women: \nnearly half of women can now identify heart disease as the leading \ncause of death in women. The bad news is that while women are now more \naware of their risk of heart disease many of their doctors are not.\n  Astoundingly, 4 out of 5 doctors do not know that more women die of \nheart disease each year than men. Those numbers are alarming because \ndoctors decide how aggressively to treat their patients based on the \namount of risk they perceive for that patient.\n  I suspect we all know women who have been to their doctors or to \nemergency rooms exhibiting symptoms of a heart attack, only to be told \nthey were suffering from ``stress'' or indigestion.\n  As a result, women don't get the same care that men do. Even though \nwomen make up 53 percent of all deaths from cardiovascular disease, \nthey receive only 33 percent of coronary interventions such as \nangioplasties and stints.\n  Likewise, 61 percent of total stroke deaths are in women, but only 38 \npercent of the procedures to prevent stroke are performed on women.\n  And when women do receive treatment, it is often based on research \nthat was solely done on men. For too many years, everyone has just \nassumed that treatments that are effective for men work equally well in \nwomen.\n  But now we know that gender really does make a difference. Diagnostic \ntests, prescription drugs, and medical devices may work differently in \nwomen than in men. When there is a difference, patients and their \nhealthcare providers need and deserve to know this. And right now, all \ntoo often that kind of information simply isn't available to clinicians \nand researchers.\n  That is why Senator Murkowski and I are introducing the ``HEART for \nWomen Act'' to help to turn this problem around. This legislation takes \na 3-pronged approach to reducing the heart disease death rate for \nwomen.\n  First, the bill would authorize grants to educate doctors on how to \nprevent, diagnose and treat heart disease and strokes in women. Doctors \nand other healthcare providers first and foremost need to know that \nheart disease is a major problem in women, so that they treat it \naccordingly.\n  The bill would also require that health information that is already\n\n[[Page S1177]]\n\nbeing reported to the federal government be gender-specific, and would \nrequire annual recommendations to Congress for improving the treatment \nof heart disease in women. Doctors need to know what medical treatments \nare safe and effective for their women patients.\n  Finally, the bill would also expand a current program run by the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC called WISEWOMAN, Well-\nIntegrated Screening and Evaluation for Women Across the Nation.\n  The WISEWOMAN program provides free heart disease and stroke \nscreening to low-income, uninsured women. While Michigan is fortunate \nto be one of the 14 States that has a WISEWOMAN program, every State \nshould have this important program.\n  These are simple, cost-effective, but meaningful steps that Congress \ncan take that will help get the death rate for women from heart disease \nand stroke going in the right direction--down.\n  Today is Valentine's Day, a day for showing our loved ones how much \nwe love and appreciation them.\n  As women, we tend to be really great at taking care of everyone \naround us--our children, our husbands, our aging parents. \nUnfortunately, we're not nearly so good about taking care of ourselves.\n  So I hope that this Valentine's Day will also be a day to raise \nawareness about the risks of heart disease for women and to encourage \nour loved ones--our mothers, sisters, and friends--to take good care of \nthemselves. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this critical \nlegislation.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, February is American Heart Month, and \nheart disease remains the Nation's leading cause of death.\n  Many women believe that heart disease is a man's disease and, \nunfortunately, do not view it as a serious health threat. Yet, in every \nyear since 1984, cardiovascular disease claimed the lives of more women \nthan men. In fact, cardiovascular disease death rates have declined in \nmen since 1979, while the death rate for women during that same period \nhas actually increased. The numbers are disturbing: cardiovascular \ndiseases claim the lives of more than 480,000 women per year; that's \nnearly a death per minute among females and nearly 12 times as many \nlives as claimed by breast cancer. One in four females has some form of \ncardiovascular disease.\n  That is why I am pleased to join with my colleague from Michigan, \nSenator Stabenow, to introduce important legislation, the HEART for \nWomen Act, or Heart disease Education, Analysis and Research, and \nTreatment for Women Act. This important bill improves the prevention, \ndiagnosis and treatment of heart disease and stroke in women.\n  In Alaska, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death, \ntotaling nearly 800 deaths each year. Women in Alaska have higher death \nrates from stroke than do women nationally. Mortality among Native \nAlaskan women is dramatically on the rise, whereas, it is declining \namong Caucasian women in the Lower 48.\n  Despite being the number one killer, many women and their health care \nproviders do not know that the biggest health care threat to women is \nheart disease. In fact, a recent survey found that 45 percent of women \nstill don't know that heart disease is the number one killer of women.\n  Perhaps even more troubling is the lack of awareness among health \ncare providers. According to American Heart Association figures, less \nthan one in five physicians recognize that more women suffer from heart \ndisease than men. Among primary care physicians, only 8 percent of \nprimary care physicians--and even more astounding--only 17 percent of \ncardiologists recognize that more women die of heart disease than men. \nAdditionally, studies show that women are less likely to receive \naggressive treatment because heart disease often manifests itself \ndifferently in women than men.\n  This is why the HEART Act is so important. Our bill takes a three-\npronged approach to reducing the heart disease death rate for women, \nthrough; 1. education; 2. research; and 3. screening.\n  First, the bill would authorize the Department of Health and Human \nServices to educate healthcare professionals and older women about \nunique aspects of care in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of \nwomen with heart disease and stroke.\n  Second, the bill would require disclosure of gender-specific health \ninformation that is already being reported to the Federal Government. \nMany agencies already collect information based on gender, but do not \ndisseminate or analyze the gender differences. This bill would release \nthat information so that it could be studied, and important health \ntrends in women could be detected.\n  Lastly, the bill would authorize the expansion of the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention's WISEWOMAN program, the Well-Integrated \nScreening and Evaluation for Women Across the Nation program. The \nWISEWOMAN program provides free heart disease and stroke screening to \nlow-income uninsured women, but the program is currently limited to \njust 14 States.\n  My State of Alaska is fortunate to have two WISEWOMAN program sites. \nThese programs screen for high blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose \nin Native Alaskan women and provide invaluable counseling on diet and \nexercise. One program in Alaska alone has successfully screened 1,437 \nAlaskan Native women and has provided them with a culturally \nappropriate intervention program that has produced life-saving results.\n  Heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases cost \nAmericans more than any other disease--an estimated $403 billion in \n2006, including more than $250 billion in direct medical costs. We, as \na nation, can control those costs--prevention through early detection \nis the most cost-effective way to combat this disease.\n  Today, as we celebrate Valentine's Day and see images of hearts just \nabout everywhere, let us not forget that the heart is much more than a \nsymbol--it is a vital organ that can't be taken for granted. Coronary \ndisease can be effectively treated and sometimes even prevented--it \ndoes not have to be the number one cause of death in women. And, that \nis why I encourage my colleagues to support the HEART for Women Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 2280. A bill to stop transactions which operate to promote fraud, \nrisk, and under-development, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today, I am introducing new legislation to \naddress a growing problem in our country, one that is robbing thousands \nof Americans of their dream of homeownership, and costing the mortgage \nindustry hundreds of millions of dollars each year.\n  I am talking about the problem of mortgage fraud--the practice of \ndefrauding individuals of their rightful property, and using tricks and \nschemes to steal from banks and other financial institutions. Mortgage \nfraud comes in a variety of forms, from inflated appraisals to the use \nof straw buyers, but the net result is the same: financial institutions \nlose out to the tune of approximately $1.01 billion each year, and \nconsumers lose their savings, their good credit, and their homes.\n  Although the data in this area is limited, mortgage fraud is clearly \non the rise. According to the FBI, mortgage fraud cases were up 25 \npercent last year, and 400 percent since 2002. Further, in 2004, the \nmortgage industry noted 12,000 cases of suspicious activity, three \ntimes the amount reported in 2001. This is due largely to the housing \nboom which is driving up housing prices across the country. Nearly $2.5 \ntrillion in mortgage loans were made during 2005, and the number is \nonly expected to rise this year.\n  But mortgage fraud is about more than just dollars and statistics; \nit's about real people, real homes, and real lives. My hometown Chicago \nTribune has featured a series of articles about mortgage fraud in \nIllinois, which, along with Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, Missouri, \nMichigan, California, Nevada, Colorado and Utah, is among the FBI's \ntop-ten mortgage fraud `hot spots.'\n  The stories highlight, for example, the plight of the good folks on \nMay Street in Chicago, who saw a block's worth of homes go boarded up \nin the span of a just few years, as swindlers\n\n[[Page S1178]]\n\nracked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in bad loans, and left \nshells of houses behind. The Tribune stories highlighted the plight of \n75-year-old Ruth Williams, who had to spend her personal funds to clear \nthe title to her home after fraudsters secured $400,000 in loans on \nthree buildings they didn't own. And two doors down from Ms. Williams, \nCorey Latimer can't sell his building or borrow against it, because a \nlending company hasn't released a phony mortgage that Corey didn't \nauthorize.\n  Law enforcement, consumer groups and many in the mortgage industry \nare doing what they can to combat fraud, and I applaud their good work. \nNow, Congress needs to come to the table and do its part.\n  I, along with Senator Durbin and Senator Menendez, am introducing the \nSTOP FRAUD Act today to address the critical problem of mortgage fraud. \nSTOP FRAUD (Stopping Transactions which Operate to Promote Fraud, Risk \nand Under-Development) would provide the first Federal definition of \nmortgage fraud and authorize stiff criminal penalties against \nfraudulent actors. STOP FRAUD requires a wide range of mortgage \nprofessionals to report suspected fraudulent activity, and gives these \nsame professionals safe harbor from liability when they report \nsuspicious incidents. It also authorizes several grant programs to help \nState and local law enforcement fight fraud, provide the mortgage \nindustry with updates on fraud trends, and further support the \nDepartments of Treasury, Justice and Housing and Urban Development's \nfraud-fighting efforts.\n  The STOP FRAUD Act will build upon the good work of the FBI, the \nTreasury Department, HUD, consumer groups, many in the mortgage \nindustry, and State and local law enforcement, giving them the tools \nthey need to stop mortgage fraud in its tracks. The cost of this bill \nis well worth the benefit to American taxpayers and companies, and it \nhas been endorsed by a range of law enforcement and consumer groups. \nThe Illinois Attorney General's office and the Chicago Police \nDepartment have told me how valuable this bill would be to their \nenforcement efforts, and ACORN, the Center For Responsible Lending, the \nNational Association of Consumer Advocates, the National Community \nReinvestment Coalition, National Consumer Law Center, and U.S. PIRG \nsaid in a recent letter that this bill would ``help protect consumers \nfrom fraudulent and abusive practices in the mortgage industry.''\n  The STOP FRAUD Act is a tough, cost-effective, and balanced way to \naddress the serious problem of mortgage fraud in our country. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in this important effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST:\n  S. 2283. A bill to establish a congressional commemorative medal for \norgan donors and their families; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, each day, 74 people receive an organ \ntransplant. And each day, another 18 patients die waiting.\n  While it doesn't get a lot of public attention, for every family who \nstruggles with the pain and uncertainty of waiting for that life saving \ngift, the organ donation shortage is an urgent crisis.\n  Right now, over 97,000 people are on the waiting list. Fewer than \nhalf of them will get the transplant they need. Almost 2,000 of the \npatients on the list are from my home state of Tennessee.\n  As a heart and lung transplant surgeon, I have direct and intimate \nexperience with this issue. I've devoted two decades of my life to \ngiving others a second chance through transplantation.\n  I have sat next to the hospital bed and looked into eyes of patients \nand their families and seen the frustration, desperation and fear they \nfeel as they wait and hope for the miraculous gift that can reverse a \nfatal diagnosis.\n  I've personally shared in the elation when the donation came through. \nI also know very well the tragedy when a patient dies before they could \nreceive a transplant--a direct result of a large and growing shortage \nof organ donors.\n  The medical community is trying to raise public awareness. I'm proud \nto say that four Tennessee hospitals are participating in the \nnationwide, ``Organ Donation Breakthrough Collaborative Gift of Life \nInitiative.''\n  Led by the Department of Health and Human Services, this is a \nmultiphase national collaboration designed to increase access to \ntransplantable organs and promote organ donation among the public.\n  In Tennessee, we have two active organ procurement organizations, the \nTennessee Donor Services and the Mid South Transplant Foundation. There \nare also 10 transplant centers throughout the state.\n  As a transplant surgeon and a Tennessean, I am proud of these path \nbreaking efforts. But, the sobering fact remains, we still have far too \nfew donors to meet the urgent demand.\n  I understand that it's a difficult and emotional decision to, \nliterally, give part of oneself away. Many people, understandably, feel \nsqueamish about choosing donation. But by giving the gift of life, \nmiracles can come from tragedy, and a whole family can be saved.\n  I bring all of this up because there is something we can do here in \nthe Senate.\n  Today, I am proposing that we create a congressional commemorative \nmedal to honor organ donors and their families under the Gift of Life \nCongressional Medal Act of 2006.\n  At no cost to the Government, we can recognize the extraordinary \ngenerosity of a donor's gift and send a message to the broader public \nabout how vitally important organ donation is to thousands of people \ndesperately waiting for that precious gift.\n  Congressman Pete Stark of California has introduced companion \nlegislation in the House. He shares my belief that organ donation is \none of the most precious gifts an individual can give to a fellow human \nbeing.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this simple and sincere gesture of \nsupport. By honoring our fellow citizens in this way, we, too, can help \ngive the gift of life.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2283\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SUNSET PROVISION.\n\n       This Act shall be effective during the 5-year period \n     beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself and Mr. Bayh):\n  S. 2286. A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to eliminate the separate work participation rate for 2-parent \nfamilies under the temporary assistance for needy families programs; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the ``Equality \nfor Two-Parent Families Act of 2006'' that I am introducing with \nSenator Bayh. When Congress reauthorized the Temporary Assistance for \nNeedy Families program as part of the Spending Reconciliation bill two \nweeks ago, we failed to eliminate a pernicious disincentive to marriage \nthat was contained in that bill. The Equality for Two-Parent Families \nAct will correct that unfortunate error.\n  Republicans and Democrats often have different ideas about how best \nto promote self sufficiency and economic mobility for low-income \nfamilies. But one thing on which we all can agree is that children are \nbetter off when they grow up with two responsible parents.\n  The evidence shows that, on average, children in two-parent families \ndo better in school and are more likely to lead successful, independent \nlives. That is why recent TANF legislation, including the bipartisan \nPRIDE Act in the Senate and H.R. 240 in the House, and Administration \nproposals have recognized that the separate two-parent work \nparticipation standard, which introduces an anti-marriage bias in TANF, \nshould be eliminated.\n  Unfortunately, the recent TANF reauthorization failed to reflect this \nlong-standing consensus. Instead, the new law compels States to meet an \nunequal work participation standard with their own State-funded \nprograms. Whereas States must ensure that 50 percent of their single \nparents satisfy the work requirements, they will be penalized if fewer \nthan 90 percent of their two-parent families meet what are even greater \nwork requirements.\n  As a result, many States, including Illinois which until now has \nsuccessfully served two-parent families in its state program, may now \nface an unfortunate choice: stop serving two-parent families or face a \npenalty. I even heard one welfare official joke that States may be \nbetter off paying couples to split up in order to avoid possible \npenalties. What kind of incentive is that?\n  Requiring States to treat two-parent families differently undermines \nefforts on both the state and federal level to promote and strengthen \ntwo-parent families. It is especially ironic that the policy is part of \na bill that includes funding for marriage promotion and fatherhood \nprograms.\n  The remedy for this contradiction is clear; we must eliminate the \nseparate two-parent work participation standard. Senator Bayh and I \nhave introduced the ``Equality for Two-Parent Families Act of 2006'' to \neliminate this standard and rectify the inequity in current TANF \npolicy. Our bill does not change two-parent work requirements or \ninterfere with State efforts to promote employment and reduce \ncaseloads. Instead, our bill reinforces State efforts to support two-\nparent families in the ways that they know best.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and join us in \npromoting stronger families. Thank you for your attention to this \nimportant matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/14/senate-section/article/S1179-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1179-S1180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 371--DESIGNATING JULY 22, 2006 AS ``NATIONAL DAY OF \n                         THE AMERICAN COWBOY''\n\n  Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Burns, Mr. \nAllard, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Reid, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Salazar, \nMr. Baucus, Mr. Craig, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Allen, and Mr. \nEnsign) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 371\n\n       Whereas pioneering men and women, recognized as cowboys, \n     helped establish the American West;\n       Whereas that cowboy spirit continues to infuse this country \n     with its solid character, sound family values, and good \n     common sense;\n       Whereas the cowboy embodies honesty, integrity, courage, \n     compassion, respect, a strong work ethic, and patriotism;\n       Whereas the cowboy loves, lives off of, and depends on the \n     land and its creatures, and is an excellent steward, \n     protecting and enhancing the environment;\n       Whereas the cowboy continues to play a significant role in \n     the culture and economy of the United States;\n       Whereas approximately 800,000 ranchers are conducting \n     business in all 50 States and are contributing to the \n     economic well being of nearly every county in the Nation;\n       Whereas rodeo is the sixth most-watched sport in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas membership in rodeo and other organizations \n     encompassing the livelihood of a cowboy transcends race and \n     sex and spans every generation;\n       Whereas the cowboy is an American icon;\n       Whereas to recognize the American cowboy is to acknowledge \n     the ongoing commitment of the United States to an esteemed \n     and enduring code of conduct; and\n       Whereas the ongoing contributions made by cowboys to their \n     communities should be recognized and encouraged: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates July 22, 2006, as ``National Day of the \n     American Cowboy''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ndesignating July 22, 2006, as ``National Day of the American Cowboy.''\n  The cowboy has influenced American culture in literature, music, art, \nfashion, theater, and sport. What's more, these folks contribute \nsubstantially to the economic well-being of our country. In 2005 alone, \nUnited States cash receipts from the sale of cattle and calves exceeded \n$48 billion, accounting\n\n[[Page S1180]]\n\nfor nearly 40 percent of all livestock sales and nearly half of all \nfarm receipts. Clearly, the cowboy is not merely a romantic figure, but \nan integral part of our Nation's economy.\n  As many Americans know, last year's celebration was a great success. \nThe first observance of the National Day of the American Cowboy was \ncommemorated across the country with various festivities and events. In \nWyoming, the day fell within Cheyenne Frontier Days, one of the world's \nlargest outdoor rodeos and our State's premier cowboy competition.\n  Cheyenne Frontier Days can be traced as far back as 1896 when a group \nof cowboys from the Two Bar Ranch put on an impromptu cowboy contest in \nCheyenne. Frontier Days has come a long way since that time, \nincorporating Indian war dances, artillery drills, a full carnival, \nrowdy street dances, country and western entertainers, and renown \nmusical performances. However, Frontier Days stays true to its roots, \nshowcasing cowboys and cowgirls in sports such as saddle bronc riding, \nwild horse racing, bull dogging, steer wrestling, calf roping, and \nbareback riding, events which truly demonstrate their cowboy skills.\n  While in Wyoming for the 2005 Cheyenne Frontier Days celebration, I \nhad the distinct honor of delivering a statement from President Bush \nsupporting the National Day of the American Cowboy. His statement \noutlined the importance of the cowboy, ``as a symbol of the grand \nhistory of the American West,'' and recognized the Cowboy's love of \nland and country as character traits which should be revered by all \nAmericans. I could not agree more.\n  Although the National Day of the American Cowboy came and went in \n2005, the celebration has continued throughout the United States and \nacross the world. For example, Arizona's Governor recently issued an \nofficial proclamation declaring July 22, 2006 as the Second Annual \nNational Day of the Cowboy in Arizona. T.J. Casey, a country musician \nand cowboy poet from Montana, is helping to promote the National Day of \nthe Cowboy by carrying his flag on tour with him, and Pro Rodeo Hall of \nFame Executive Director Larry McCormack and his staff are planning a \nNational Day of the Cowboy flag presentation during their upcoming \nannual induction ceremony on July 15, 2006.\n  Support for the National Day of the American Cowboy is not confined \nto our Nation's borders. The Desert Cowboys, a group of men and women \nin the United States Military and Department of Defense civilians who \nhave been serving our country in Iraq since December of 2005, planted \ntheir National Day of the Cowboy flag prominently in their camp shortly \nafter their arrival. Some of these folks are in Iraq for their, third, \nfourth and even fifth rotations. This touching display of support by \nthose completing dangerous missions so far from home certainly tugs at \nmy heart strings. It also serves to illustrate how important this day \nis to the American people and those who support American ideals.\n  I call on the Senate to once again recognize our country's cowboys \nand cowgirls and their significant contributions through designation of \nthe second annual National Day of the American Cowboy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/14/senate-section/article/S1180-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 372--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT OIL AND \n GAS COMPANIES SHOULD NOT BE PROVIDED OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF ROYALTY \n            RELIEF WHEN ENERGY PRICES ARE AT HISTORIC HIGHS\n\n  Mr. KERRY submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE;'' in the bill \n     and insert the following:\n     This Act may be cited as the ``Asbestos and Silica Claims \n     Priorities Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Asbestos is a mineral that was widely used before the \n     mid-1970s for insulation, fireproofing, and other purposes.\n       (2) Many American workers were exposed to asbestos, \n     especially during the Second World War.\n       (3) Long-term exposure to asbestos has been associated with \n     mesothelioma and lung cancer, as well as with such non-\n     malignant conditions as asbestosis, pleural plaques, and \n     diffuse pleural thickening.\n       (4) Although the use of asbestos has dramatically declined \n     since 1980 and workplace exposures have been regulated since \n     1971 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, \n     the diseases caused by asbestos often have long latency \n     periods and past exposures will continue to result in \n     significant claims well into the future.\n       (5) Asbestos related claims, driven largely by unimpaired \n     claimants, have flooded our courts such that the United \n     States Supreme Court has characterized the situation as ``an \n     elephantine mass'' that ``calls for national legislation'' \n     (Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corporation, 119 S. Ct. 2295, 2302 \n     (1999).\n       (6) The American Bar Association supports enactment of \n     Federal legislation that would allow persons alleging non-\n     malignant asbestos-related disease claims to file a cause of \n     action in Federal or State court only if those persons meet \n     the medical criteria in the ``ABA Standard for Non-Malignant \n     Asbestos-Related Disease Claims'' and toll all applicable \n     statutes of limitations until such time as the medical \n     criteria in such standard are met.\n       (7) Reports indicate that up to 90 percent of asbestos \n     claims are filed by individuals who allege that they have \n     been exposed to asbestos, but who suffer no demonstrable \n     asbestos-related impairment. Lawyer-sponsored x-ray \n     screenings of workers at occupational locations are used to \n     amass large numbers of claimants, the vast majority of whom \n     are unimpaired.\n       (8) The costs of compensating unimpaired claimants and \n     litigating their claims jeopardizes the ability of defendants \n     to compensate people with cancer and other serious diseases, \n     threatens the savings, retirement benefits, and jobs of \n     current and retired employees, and adversely affects the \n     communities in which the defendants operate.\n       (9) More than 73 companies have declared bankruptcy due to \n     the burden of asbestos litigation. The rate of asbestos-\n     driven bankruptcies is accelerating. Between 2000 and 2004, \n     there were more asbestos-related bankruptcy filings than in \n     either of the prior 2 decades.\n       (10) Bankruptcies have led plaintiffs and their lawyers to \n     expand their search for solvent peripheral defendants. The \n     number of asbestos defendants now includes over 8,500 \n     companies, affecting many small and medium size companies and \n     industries that span 85 percent of the United States economy.\n       (11) Efforts to address asbestos litigation may augment \n     silica-related filings.\n       (12) Silica is a naturally occurring mineral and is the \n     second most common constituent of the earth's crust. \n     Crystalline silica in the form of quartz is present in sand, \n     gravel, soil, and rocks.\n       (13) Silica-related illness, including silicosis can \n     develop from the inhalation of respirable silica dust. \n     Silicosis was widely recognized as an occupational disease \n     many years ago.\n       (14) Silica claims, like asbestos claims, often involve \n     individuals with no demonstrable impairment. Claimants \n     frequently are identified through the use of interstate, for-\n     profit, screening companies.\n       (15) Silica screening processes have been found subject to \n     substantial abuse and potential fraud in Federal silica \n     litigation (In re Silica Prods. Liab. Litig. (MDL No. 1553), \n     398 F. Supp. 2d 563 (S.D. Tex. 2005)) and it therefore is \n     necessary to address silica legislation to preempt an \n     asbestos-like litigation crisis.\n       (16) Concerns about statutes of limitations may prompt \n     unimpaired asbestos and silica claimants to bring lawsuits \n     prematurely to protect against losing their ability to assert \n     a claim in the future should they develop an impairing \n     condition.\n       (17) Sound public policy requires that the claims of \n     persons with no present physical impairment from asbestos or \n     silica exposure, be deferred to give priority to physically \n     impaired claimants, and to safeguard the jobs, benefits, and \n     savings of workers in affected companies.\n       (18) Claimant consolidations, joinders, and similar \n     procedures used by some courts to deal with the mass of \n     asbestos and silica cases can--\n       (A) undermine the appropriate functioning of the court \n     system;\n       (B) deny due process to plaintiffs and defendants; and\n       (C) further encourage the filing of thousands of cases by \n     exposed persons who are not sick and likely will never \n     develop an impairing condition caused by exposure to asbestos \n     or silica.\n       (19) Several states have enacted legislation to prioritize \n     asbestos and silica claims that serve as a model for national \n     reform including Texas, Ohio, Florida, and Georgia.\n       (20) Asbestos litigation, if left unchecked by reasonable \n     congressional intervention, will--\n       (A) continue to inhibit the national economy and run \n     counter to plans to stimulate economic growth and the \n     creation of jobs;\n       (B) threaten the savings, retirement benefits, and \n     employment of defendant's current and retired employees;\n       (C) affect adversely the communities in which these \n     defendants operate; and\n       (D) impair interstate commerce and national initiatives.\n       (21) The public interest and the interest of interstate \n     commerce requires deferring the claims of exposed persons who \n     are not sick in order to--\n       (A) preserve, now and for the future, defendants' ability \n     to compensate people who develop cancer and other serious \n     asbestos-related injuries; and\n       (B) safeguard the jobs, benefits, and savings of American \n     workers and the well-being of the national economy.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) give priority to current claimants who can demonstrate \n     an asbestos-related or silica-related impairment based on \n     reasonable, objective medical criteria;\n       (2) toll the running of statutes of limitations for persons \n     who have been exposed to asbestos or to silica, but who have \n     no present asbestos-related or silica-related impairment; and\n       (3) enhance the ability of the courts to supervise and \n     control asbestos and silica litigation.\n\n     SEC. 3.

\n     and\n       (B) ending on the date--\n       (i) such claim is dismissed; or\n       (ii) an abatement period of 1 year ends.\n       (4) Court duties.--A court may not abate or dismiss a claim \n     under paragraph (3) until a defendant files with the court, \n     or with the clerk of the court, a written stipulation that, \n     with respect to a new action on such claim commenced by the \n     plaintiff in another State, district, or division, that the \n     claimant and the defendant may--\n       (A) rely on responses to discovery already provided under \n     the rules of civil procedure of the State, district, or \n     division in which such claim was originally filed; and\n       (B) rely on any additional discovery that may be conducted \n     under the rules of civil procedure in another State, \n     district, or division.\n       (f) Venue.--\n       (1) In general.--An asbestos or silica claim filed after \n     the date of enactment of this Act may be filed only in the \n     county of the State or the district or division of the United \n     States where--\n       (A) the claimant resided for a period of at least 180 \n     consecutive days immediately prior to filing suit; or\n       (B) the exposed person had the most substantial cumulative \n     exposure to asbestos for an asbestos claim or to silica for a \n     silica claim, and that such exposure was a substantial \n     contributing factor to the asbestos or silica related \n     impairment on which such claim is based.\n       (2) Improper venue.--With respect to asbestos or silica \n     claims pending as of the date of enactment of this Act, and \n     in which the trial, or any new trial or retrial following \n     motion, appeal, or otherwise, has not commenced with \n     presentation of evidence to the trier of fact as of the date \n     of enactment of this Act, any claim as to which venue would \n     not have been proper if the claim originally had been brought \n     in accordance with paragraph (1) shall, not later than 90 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act, be transferred \n     to the court of general civil jurisdiction in the county, \n     district, or division of the State in which the action is \n     pending in which either--\n       (A) the claimant was domiciled at the time the asbestos or \n     silica claim originally was filed;

A defendant participant \n     has a right to obtain a rehearing of the Administrator's \n     determination under this subsection under the procedures \n     prescribed in subsection (i)(10). The Administrator may \n     adjust a defendant participant's payment obligations under \n     this subsection, either by forgiving the relevant portion of \n     the otherwise applicable payment obligation or by providing \n     relevant rebates from the defendant hardship and inequity \n     adjustment account created under subsection (j) after \n     payment of the otherwise applicable payment obligation, at \n     the discretion of the Administrator.\n       (2) Financial hardship adjustments.--\n       (A) General.--Any defendant participant in any tier may \n     apply for an adjustment under this paragraph at any time \n     during the period in which a payment obligation to the Fund \n     remains outstanding and may qualify for such an adjustment by \n     demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Administrator that \n     the amount of its payment obligation would materially and \n     adversely affect the defendant participant's ability to \n     continue its business and to pay or satisfy its debts \n     generally as and when they come due. Such an adjustment shall \n     be in an amount that in the judgment of the Administrator is \n     reasonably necessary to prevent such material and adverse \n     effect on the defendant participant's ability to continue its \n     business and to pay or satisfy its debts generally as and \n     when they come due.\n       (B) Factors to consider.-In determining whether to make an \n     adjustment under subparagraph (A) and the amount thereof, the \n     Administrator shall consider--\n       (1) the financial situation of the defendant participant \n     and its affiliated group as shown in historical audited \n     financial statements, including income statement, balance \n     sheet, and statement of cash flow, for the three fiscal years \n     ending immediately prior to the application and projected \n     financial statements for the three fiscal years following the \n     application;\n       (2) an analysis of capital spending and fixed charge \n     coverage on a historical basis for the three fiscal years \n     immediately preceding a defendant participant's application \n     and for the three fiscal years following the application;\n       (3) any payments or transfers of property made, or \n     obligations incurred, within the preceding 6 years by the \n     defendant participant to or for the benefit of any insider as \n     defined under section 101(31) of title 11 of the United \n     States Code or any affiliate as defined under section 101(2) \n     of title 11 of the United States Code;\n       (4) any prior extraordinary transactions within the \n     preceding 6 years involving the defendant participant, \n     including without limitation payments of extraordinary \n     salaries, bonuses, or dividends;\n       (5) the defendant participant's ability to satisfy its \n     payment obligations to the Fund by borrowing or financing \n     with equity capital, or through issuance of securities of the \n     defendant participant or its affiliated group to the Fund;\n       (6) the defendant participant's ability to delay \n     discretionary capital spending; and\n       (7) any other factor that the Administrator considers \n     relevant.\n       (C) Term.--A financial hardship adjustment under this \n     paragraph shall have a term of 5 years unless the \n     Administrator determines at the time the adjustment is made \n     that a shorter or longer period is appropriate in the light \n     of the financial condition of the defendant participant and \n     its affiliated group and other relevant factors, provided \n     that a financial hardship adjustment under this paragraph \n     shall terminate automatically in the event that the defendant \n     participant holding the adjustment files a petition under \n     title 11, United States Code.\n       (D) Renewal.--A defendant participant may renew a hardship \n     adjustment upon expiration by demonstrating that it remains \n     justified. Such renewed hardship adjustments shall have a \n     term of 5 years unless the Administrator determines at the \n     time of the renewed adjustment that a shorter or longer \n     period is appropriate in the light of the financial condition \n     of the defendant participant and its affiliated group and \n     other relevant factors, provided that a renewed financial \n     hardship adjustment under this paragraph shall terminate \n     automatically in the event that the defendant participant \n     holding the adjustment files a petition under title 11, \n     United States Code.\n       (E) Procedure.--\n       (1) The Administrator shall prescribe the information to be \n     submitted in applications for adjustments under this \n     paragraph.\n       (2) All audited financial information required under this \n     paragraph shall be as reported by the defendant participant \n     in its annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of \n     1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). Any defendant participant that \n     does not file reports with the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission or which does not have audited financial \n     statements shall submit financial statements prepared \n     pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles. The \n     chairman, chief executive officer, and chief financial \n     officer of the defendant participant shall certify under \n     penalty of law the completeness and accuracy of the financial \n     statements provided under this sub-paragraph.\n       (3) The chairman, chief executive officer, and chief \n     financial officer of the defendant participant shall certify \n     that any projected information and analyses submitted to the \n     Administrator were made in good faith and are reasonable \n     and attainable.''\n       (3) Inequity adjustments.--\n       (A) In general--A defendant participant--\n       (i) may qualify for an adjustment based on inequity by \n     demonstrating that the amount of its payment obligation under \n     the statutory allocation is exception 25 ally inequitable--\n       (I) when measured against the amount of the likely cost to \n     the defendant participant net of insurance of its future \n     liability in the tort system in the absence of the Fund;\n       (II) when measured against the likely cost of past and \n     potential future claims in the absence of this Act;\n       (III) when compared to the median payment rate for all \n     defendant participants in the same tier; or\n       (IV) when measured against the percentage of the prior \n     asbestos expenditures of the defendant that were incurred \n     with respect to claims that neither resulted in an adverse \n     judgment against the defendant, nor were the subject of a \n     settlement that required a\n\n[[Page S1194]]\n\n     payment to a plaintiff by or on behalf of that defendant;\n       (ii) shall qualify for a two-tier main tier and a two-tier \n     subtier adjustment reducing the defendant participant's \n     payment obligation based on inequity by demonstrating that \n     not less than 95 percent of such person's prior asbestos \n     expenditures arose from claims related to the manufacture and \n     sale of railroad locomotives and related products, so long as \n     such person's manufacture and sale of railroad locomotives \n     and related products is temporally and causally remote, and \n     for purposes of this clause, a person's manufacture and sale \n     of railroad locomotives and related products shall be deemed \n     to be temporally and causally remote if the asbestos claims \n     historically and generally filed against such person relate \n     to the manufacture and sale of railroad locomotives and \n     related products by an entity dissolved more than 25 years \n     before the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (iii) shall be granted a two-tier adjustment reducing the \n     defendant participant's payment obligation based on inequity \n     by demonstrating that not less than 95 percent of such \n     participant's prior asbestos expenditures arose from asbestos \n     claims based on successor liability arising from a merger to \n     which the participant or its predecessor was a party that \n     occurred at least 30 years before the date of enactment of \n     this Act, and that such prior asbestos expenditures exceed \n     the inflation-adjusted value of the assets of the company \n     from which such liability was derived in such merger, and \n     upon such demonstration the Administrator shall grant such \n     adjustment for the life of the Fund and amounts paid by such \n     defendant participant prior to such adjustment in excess of \n     its adjusted payment obligation under this clause shall be \n     credited against next succeeding required payment \n     obligations; and\n       (iv) may, subject to the discretion of the Administrator, \n     be exempt from any payment obligation if such defendant \n     participant establishes with the Administrator that--\n       (I) such participant has satisfied all past claims; and\n       (II) there is no reasonable likelihood in the absence of \n     this Act of any future claims with costs for which the \n     defendant participant might be responsible.\n       (B) Payment rate.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the \n     payment rate of a defendant participant is the payment amount \n     of the defendant participant as a percentage of such \n     defendant participant's gross revenues for the year ending \n     December 31, 2002.\n       (C) Term.--Subject to the annual availability of funds in \n     the defendant hardship and inequity adjustment account \n     established under subsection (j), an inequity adjustment \n     under this subsection shall have a term of 3 years.\n       (D) Renewal.--A defendant participant may renew an inequity \n     adjustment every 16 years by demonstrating that the \n     adjustment remains justified.\n       (E) Reinstatement.--\n       (i) In general.--Following the termination of an inequity \n     adjustment under subparagraph (A), and during the funding \n     period prescribed under subsection (a), the Administrator \n     shall annually determine whether there has been a material \n     change in conditions which would support a finding that the \n     amount of the defendant participant's payment under the \n     statutory allocation was not inequitable. Based on this \n     determination, the Administrator may, consistent with the \n     policies and legislative intent underlying this Act, \n     reinstate any or all of the payment obligations of the \n     defendant participant as if the inequity adjustment had not \n     been granted for that 10 year period.\n       (ii) Terms and conditions.--In the event of a reinstatement \n     under clause (i), the Administrator may require the defendant \n     participant to pay any part or all of amounts not paid due to \n     the inequity adjustment on such terms and conditions as \n     established by the Administrator.\n       (4) Limitation on adjustments.--The aggregate total of \n     financial hardship adjustments under paragraph (2) and \n     inequity adjustments under paragraph (3) in effect in any \n     given year shall not be limited.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2791. Mr. CORNYN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed to \namendment SA 2746 proposed by Mr. Frist (for Mr. Specter (for himself \nand Mr. Leahy)) to the bill S. 852, to create a fair and efficient \nsystem to resolve claims of victims for bodily injury caused by \nasbestos exposure, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on \nthe table; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after ``SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE;'' in the \n     amendment and insert the following:\n     This Act may be cited as the ``Asbestos and Silica Claims \n     Priorities Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Asbestos is a mineral that was widely used before the \n     mid-1970s for insulation, fireproofing, and other purposes.\n       (2) Many American workers were exposed to asbestos, \n     especially during the Second World War.\n       (3) Long-term exposure to asbestos has been associated with \n     mesothelioma and lung cancer, as well as with such non-\n     malignant conditions as asbestosis, pleural plaques, and \n     diffuse pleural thickening.\n       (4) Although the use of asbestos has dramatically declined \n     since 1980 and workplace exposures have been regulated since \n     1971 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, \n     the diseases caused by asbestos often have long latency \n     periods and past exposures will continue to result in \n     significant claims well into the future.\n       (5) Asbestos related claims, driven largely by unimpaired \n     claimants, have flooded our courts such that the United \n     States Supreme Court has characterized the situation as ``an \n     elephantine mass'' that ``calls for national legislation'' \n     (Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corporation, 119 S. Ct. 2295, 2302 \n     (1999).\n       (6) The American Bar Association supports enactment of \n     Federal legislation that would allow persons alleging non-\n     malignant asbestos-related disease claims to file a cause of \n     action in Federal or State court only if those persons meet \n     the medical criteria in the ``ABA Standard for Non-Malignant \n     Asbestos-Related Disease Claims'' and toll all applicable \n     statutes of limitations until such time as the medical \n     criteria in such standard are met.\n       (7) Reports indicate that up to 90 percent of asbestos \n     claims are filed by individuals who allege that they have \n     been exposed to asbestos, but who suffer no demonstrable \n     asbestos-related impairment. Lawyer-sponsored x-ray \n     screenings of workers at occupational locations are used to \n     amass large numbers of claimants, the vast majority of whom \n     are unimpaired.\n       (8) The costs of compensating unimpaired claimants and \n     litigating their claims jeopardizes the ability of defendants \n     to compensate people with cancer and other serious diseases, \n     threatens the savings, retirement benefits, and jobs of \n     current and retired employees, and adversely affects the \n     communities in which the defendants operate.\n       (9) More than 73 companies have declared bankruptcy due to \n     the burden of asbestos litigation. The rate of asbestos-\n     driven bankruptcies is accelerating. Between 2000 and 2004, \n     there were more asbestos-related bankruptcy filings than in \n     either of the prior 2 decades.\n       (10) Bankruptcies have led plaintiffs and their lawyers to \n     expand their search for solvent peripheral defendants. The \n     number of asbestos defendants now includes over 8,500 \n     companies, affecting many small and medium size companies and \n     industries that span 85 percent of the United States economy.\n       (11) Efforts to address asbestos litigation may augment \n     silica-related filings.\n       (12) Silica is a naturally occurring mineral and is the \n     second most common constituent of the earth's crust. \n     Crystalline silica in the form of quartz is present in sand, \n     gravel, soil, and rocks.\n       (13) Silica-related illness, including silicosis can \n     develop from the inhalation of respirable silica dust. \n     Silicosis was widely recognized as an occupational disease \n     many years ago.\n       (14) Silica claims, like asbestos claims, often involve \n     individuals with no demonstrable impairment. Claimants \n     frequently are identified through the use of interstate, for-\n     profit, screening companies.\n       (15) Silica screening processes have been found subject to \n     substantial abuse and potential fraud in Federal silica \n     litigation (In re Silica Prods. Liab. Litig. (MDL No. 1553), \n     398 F. Supp. 2d 563 (S.D. Tex. 2005)) and it therefore is \n     necessary to address silica legislation to preempt an \n     asbestos-like litigation crisis.\n       (16) Concerns about statutes of limitations may prompt \n     unimpaired asbestos and silica claimants to bring lawsuits \n     prematurely to protect against losing their ability to assert \n     a claim in the future should they develop an impairing \n     condition.\n       (17) Sound public policy requires that the claims of \n     persons with no present physical impairment from asbestos or \n     silica exposure, be deferred to give priority to physically \n     impaired claimants, and to safeguard the jobs, benefits, and \n     savings of workers in affected companies.\n       (18) Claimant consolidations, joinders, and similar \n     procedures used by some courts to deal with the mass of \n     asbestos and silica cases can--\n       (A) undermine the appropriate functioning of the court \n     system;\n       (B) deny due process to plaintiffs and defendants; and\n       (C) further encourage the filing of thousands of cases by \n     exposed persons who are not sick and likely will never \n     develop an impairing condition caused by exposure to asbestos \n     or silica.\n       (19) Several states have enacted legislation to prioritize \n     asbestos and silica claims that serve as a model for national \n     reform including Texas, Ohio, Florida, and Georgia.\n       (20) Asbestos litigation, if left unchecked by reasonable \n     congressional intervention, will--\n       (A) continue to inhibit the national economy and run \n     counter to plans to stimulate economic growth and the \n     creation of jobs;\n       (B) threaten the savings, retirement benefits, and \n     employment of defendant's current and retired employees;\n       (C) affect adversely the communities in which these \n     defendants operate; and\n       (D) impair interstate commerce and national initiatives.\n       (21) The public interest and the interest of interstate \n     commerce requires deferring the claims of exposed persons who \n     are not sick in order to--\n       (A) preserve, now and for the future, defendants' ability \n     to compensate people who develop cancer and other serious \n     asbestos-related injuries; and\n\n[[Page S1195]]\n\n       (B) safeguard the jobs, benefits, and savings of American \n     workers and the well-being of the national economy.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) give priority to current claimants who can demonstrate \n     an asbestos-related or silica-related impairment based on \n     reasonable, objective medical criteria;\n       (2) toll the running of statutes of limitations for persons \n     who have been exposed to asbestos or to silica, but who have \n     no present asbestos-related or silica-related impairment; and\n       (3) enhance the ability of the courts to supervise and \n     control asbestos and silica litigation.\n\n     SEC. 3.

or\n       (2) by order of the trial court upon--\n       (A) motion of 1 of the parties; and\n       (B) for good cause shown.\n       (d) Consolidation.--\n       (1) At trial.--\n       (A) In general.--A court may consolidate for trial any \n     number and type of asbestos or silica claims with the consent \n     of all the parties.\n       (B) Absence of consent.--In the absence of any consent \n     under subparagraph (A), a court may consolidate for trial \n     only asbestos claims or silica claims relating to the same \n     exposed person and members of the household of such exposed \n     person.\n       (2) Class actions.--No class action or any other form of \n     mass aggregation claim filing relating to more than 1 exposed \n     person, except claims relating to the exposed person and \n     members of the household of such exposed person, shall be \n     permitted for asbestos or silica claims.\n       (3) At discovery.--Any decision by a court to consolidate \n     claims under paragraph (1) shall not preclude consolidation \n     of asbestos or silica claim cases by a court order for \n     pretrial or discovery purposes.\n       (e) Forum Non Conveniens.--\n       (1) In general.--Any asbestos or silica claim filed on or \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, if the court in \n     which such claim is pending, on written motion of a party, \n     finds that in the interest of justice and for the convenience \n     of the parties a claim or action to which this Act applies \n     would be more properly heard in a forum outside the State, \n     district, or division in which such claim was filed, the \n     court shall--\n       (A) decline to exercise jurisdiction under the doctrine of \n     forum non conveniens; and\n       (B) shall stay or dismiss such claim.\n       (2) Considerations.--In determining whether to grant a \n     motion to stay or dismiss a claim under paragraph (1), a \n     court shall consider whether--\n       (A) an alternate forum exists in which such claim or action \n     may be tried;\n       (B) the alternate forum provides an adequate remedy;\n       (C) maintenance of such claim in the court of the State in \n     which the claim was filed would work a substantial injustice \n     to the moving party;\n       (D) the alternate forum, as a result of the submission of \n     the parties or otherwise, can exercise jurisdiction over all \n     the defendants properly joined to such claim;\n       (E) the balance of the private interests of the parties and \n     the public interest of the State in which such claim was \n     filed predominate in favor of such claim being brought in an \n     alternate forum; and\n       (F) the stay or dismissal would not result in unreasonable \n     duplication or proliferation of litigation.\n       (3) Waiver of statute of limitations defense.--A trial \n     court may not abate or dismiss a claim under this subsection \n     until a defendant files with the court, or with the clerk of \n     the court, a written stipulation that, with respect to a new \n     action on such claim commenced by the plaintiff, the \n     defendant waives the right to assert a statute of limitations \n     defense in all other States, districts, or divisions in which \n     such claim was not barred by limitations at the time such \n     claim was filed in the State where such claim was originally \n     filed as necessary to effect a tolling of the limitations \n     periods in those States --\n       (A) beginning on the date such claim was originally filed; \n     and\n       (B) ending on the date--\n       (i) such claim is dismissed; or\n       (ii) an abatement period of 1 year ends.\n       (4) Court duties.--A court may not abate or dismiss a claim \n     under paragraph (3) until a defendant files with the court, \n     or with the clerk of the court, a written stipulation that, \n     with respect to a new action on such claim commenced by the \n     plaintiff in another State, district, or division, that the \n     claimant and the defendant may--\n       (A) rely on responses to discovery already provided under \n     the rules of civil procedure of\n\n[[Page S1199]]\n\n     the State, district, or division in which such claim was \n     originally filed; and\n       (B) rely on any additional discovery that may be conducted \n     under the rules of civil procedure in another State, \n     district, or division.\n       (f) Venue.--\n       (1) In general.--An asbestos or silica claim filed after \n     the date of enactment of this Act may be filed only in the \n     county of the State or the district or division of the United \n     States where--\n       (A) the claimant resided for a period of at least 180 \n     consecutive days immediately prior to filing suit; or\n       (B) the exposed person had the most substantial cumulative \n     exposure to asbestos for an asbestos claim or to silica for a \n     silica claim, and that such exposure was a substantial \n     contributing factor to the asbestos or silica related \n     impairment on which such claim is based.\n       (2) Improper venue.--With respect to asbestos or silica \n     claims pending as of the date of enactment of this Act, and \n     in which the trial, or any new trial or retrial following \n     motion, appeal, or otherwise, has not commenced with \n     presentation of evidence to the trier of fact as of the date \n     of enactment of this Act, any claim as to which venue would \n     not have been proper if the claim originally had been brought \n     in accordance with paragraph (1) shall, not later than 90 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act, be transferred \n     to the court of general civil jurisdiction in the county, \n     district, or division of the State in which the action is \n     pending in which either--\n       (A) the claimant was domiciled at the time the asbestos or \n     silica claim originally was filed; or\n       (B) the exposed person had the most substantial cumulative \n     exposure to asbestos for an asbestos claim or to silica for a \n     silica claim, and that such exposure was a substantial \n     contributing factor to the asbestos or silica related \n     impairment on which the claim is based.\n       (3) Removal.--\n       (A) In general.--If a State court refuses or fails to apply \n     the provisions of this Act, any party in a civil action for \n     an asbestos claim may remove such action to a district court \n     of the United States in accordance with chapter 89 of title \n     28, United States Code.\n       (B) Jurisdiction over removed actions.--The district courts \n     of the United States shall have jurisdiction of all civil \n     actions removed under this paragraph, without regard to the \n     amount in controversy and without regard to the citizenship \n     or residence of the parties.\n       (C) Removal by any defendant.--A civil action may be \n     removed to the district court of the United States under this \n     paragraph by any defendant without the consent of all \n     defendants.\n       (D) Remand.--A district court of the United States shall \n     remand any civil action removed solely under this paragraph, \n     unless the court finds that--\n       (i) the State court failed to comply with procedures \n     prescribed by law; or\n       (ii) the failure to dismiss by the State court lacked \n     substantial support in the record before the State court.\n       (E) Limitation.--Civil actions in State court subject to \n     this Act may not be removed to any district court of the \n     United States unless such removal is otherwise proper without \n     regard to the provisions of this Act or is removed under this \n     paragraph.\n       (g) Preemption.--\n       (1) In general.--This Act shall govern all asbestos and \n     silica claims filed in Federal or State courts on or after \n     the effective date of this Act, or which are pending in \n     Federal or State courts on the effective date of this Act and \n     in which the trial, or any new trial or retrial following \n     motion, appeal or otherwise, has not commenced with \n     presentation of evidence to the trier of fact as of the \n     effective date of this Act, except for enforcement of claims \n     for which a final judgment has been duly entered by a court \n     and that is no longer subject to any appeal or judicial \n     review on the effective date of this Act.\n       (2) Greater limitations by states.--Nothing in this Act \n     shall limit or preempt any State law or precedent having the \n     effect of imposing additional or greater limits or \n     restrictions on the assertion or prosecution of an asbestos \n     or silica claim.\n\n     SEC. 6.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Millions of Americans have been exposed to forms of \n     asbestos that can have devastating health effects.\n       (2) Various injuries can be caused by exposure to some \n     forms of asbestos, including some forms of cancer.\n       (3) The injuries caused by asbestos can have latency \n     periods of up to 40 years, and even limited exposure to some \n     forms of asbestos may result in injury in some cases.\n       (4) Asbestos litigation has had a significant detrimental \n     effect on the country's economy, driving companies into \n     bankruptcy, diverting resources from those who are truly \n     sick, and endangering jobs and pensions.\n       (5) The scope of the asbestos litigation crisis cuts across \n     every State and virtually every industry.\n       (6) The United States Supreme Court has recognized that \n     Congress must act to create a more rational asbestos claims \n     system. In 1991, a Judicial Conference Ad Hoc Committee on \n     Asbestos Litigation, appointed by Chief Justice William \n     Rehnquist, found that the ``ultimate solution should be \n     legislation recognizing the national proportions of the \n     problem . . . and creating a national asbestos dispute \n     resolution scheme . . .''. The Court found in 1997 in Amchem \n     Products Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 595 (1997), that \n     ``[t]he argument is sensibly made that a nationwide \n     administrative claims processing regime would provide the \n     most secure, fair, and efficient means of compensating \n     victims of asbestos exposure.'' In 1999, the Court in Ortiz \n     v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 819, 821 (1999), found that the \n     ``elephantine mass of asbestos cases . . . defies customary \n     judicial administration and calls for national legislation.'' \n     That finding was again recognized in 2003 by the Court in \n     Norfolk & Western Railway Co. v. Ayers, 123 S. Ct. 1210 \n     (2003).\n       (7) This crisis, and its significant effect on the health \n     and welfare of the people of the United States, on interstate \n     and foreign commerce, and on the bankruptcy system, compels \n     Congress to exercise its power to regulate interstate \n     commerce and create this legislative solution in the form of \n     a national asbestos injury claims resolution program to \n     supersede all existing methods to compensate those injured by \n     asbestos, except as specified in this Act.\n       (8) This crisis has also imposed a deleterious burden upon \n     the United States bankruptcy courts, which have assumed a \n     heavy burden of administering complicated and protracted \n     bankruptcies with limited personnel.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to--\n       (1) create a privately funded administrative scheme to \n     provide the necessary resources for a fair and efficient \n     system to resolve asbestos injury claims that will provide \n     compensation for legitimate present and future claimants of \n     asbestos exposure as provided in this Act;\n       (2) provide compensation to those present and future \n     victims based on the severity of their injuries, while \n     establishing a system flexible enough to accommodate \n     individuals whose conditions worsen;\n       (3) relieve the Federal and State courts of the burden of \n     the asbestos litigation; and\n       (4) increase economic stability by resolving the asbestos \n     litigation crisis that has bankrupted companies with asbestos \n     liability, diverted resources from the truly sick, and \n     endangered jobs and pensions.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act, the following definitions shall apply:\n       (1) Asbestos.--The term ``asbestos'' includes--\n       (A) chrysotile;\n       (B) amosite;\n       (C) crocidolite;\n       (D) tremolite asbestos;\n       (E) winchite asbestos;\n       (F) richterite asbestos;\n       (G) anthophyllite asbestos;\n       (H) actinolite asbestos;\n       (I) any of the minerals listed under subparagraphs (A) \n     through (H) that has been chemically treated or altered, and \n     any asbestiform variety, type, or component thereof;

The Chief Executive Officer \n     may adjust a defendant participant's payment obligations \n     under this subsection, either by forgiving the relevant \n     portion of the otherwise applicable payment obligation or by \n     providing relevant rebates from the defendant hardship and \n     inequity adjustment account created under subsection (j) \n     after payment of the otherwise applicable payment obligation, \n     at the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer.\n       (2) Financial hardship adjustments.--\n       (A) In general.--A defendant participant may apply for an \n     adjustment based on financial hardship at any time during the \n     period in which a payment obligation to the Fund remains \n     outstanding and may qualify for such adjustment by \n     demonstrating that the amount of its payment obligation under \n     the statutory allocation would constitute a severe financial \n     hardship.\n       (B) Term.--Subject to the annual availability of funds in \n     the defendant hardship and inequity adjustment account \n     established under subsection (j), a financial hardship \n     adjustment under this subsection shall have a term of 3 \n     years.\n       (C) Renewal.--After an initial hardship adjustment is \n     granted under this paragraph, a defendant participant may \n     renew its hardship adjustment by demonstrating that it \n     remains justified.\n       (D) Reinstatement.--Following the expiration of the \n     hardship adjustment period provided for under this section \n     and during the funding period prescribed under subsection \n     (a), the Chief Executive Officer shall annually determine \n     whether there has been a material change in the financial \n     condition of the defendant participant such that the Chief \n     Executive Officer may, consistent with the policies and \n     legislative intent underlying this Act, reinstate under terms \n     and conditions established by the Chief Executive Officer any \n     part or all of the defendant participant's payment obligation \n     under the statutory allocation that was not paid during the \n     hardship adjustment term.\n       (3) Inequity adjustments.--\n       (A) In general.--A defendant partici-\n     pant--\n       (i) may qualify for an adjustment based on inequity by \n     demonstrating that the amount of its payment obligation under \n     the statutory allocation is exceptionally inequitable--\n\n       (I) when measured against the amount of the likely cost to \n     the defendant participant net of insurance of its future \n     liability in the tort system in the absence of the Fund;\n       (II) when compared to the median payment rate for all \n     defendant participants in the same tier; or\n       (III) when measured against the percentage of the prior \n     asbestos expenditures of the defendant that were incurred \n     with respect to claims that neither resulted in an adverse \n     judgment against the defendant, nor were the subject of a \n     settlement that required a payment to a plaintiff by or on \n     behalf of that defendant;\n\n       (ii) shall qualify for a two-tier main tier and a two-tier \n     subtier adjustment reducing the defendant participant's \n     payment obligation based on inequity by demonstrating that \n     not less than 95 percent of such person's prior asbestos \n     expenditures arose from claims related to the manufacture and \n     sale of railroad locomotives and related products, so long as \n     such person's manufacture and sale of railroad locomotives \n     and related products is temporally and causally remote, and \n     for purposes of this clause, a person's manufacture and sale \n     of railroad locomotives and related products shall be deemed \n     to be temporally and causally remote if the asbestos claims \n     historically and generally filed against such person relate \n     to the manufacture and sale of railroad locomotives and \n     related products by an entity dissolved more than 25 years \n     before the date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (iii) shall be granted a two-tier adjustment reducing the \n     defendant participant's payment obligation based on inequity \n     by demonstrating that not less than 95 percent of such \n     participant's prior asbestos expenditures arose from asbestos \n     claims based on successor liability arising from a merger to \n     which the participant or its predecessor was a party that \n     occurred at least 30 years before the date of enactment of \n     this Act, and that such prior asbestos expenditures exceed \n     the inflation-adjusted value of the assets of the company \n     from which such liability was derived in such merger, and \n     upon such demonstration the Chief Executive Officer shall \n     grant such adjustment for the life of the Fund and amounts \n     paid by such defendant participant prior to such adjustment \n     in excess of its adjusted payment obligation under this \n     clause shall be credited against next succeeding required \n     payment obligations.\n       (B) Payment rate.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the \n     payment rate of a defendant participant is the payment amount \n     of the defendant participant as a percentage of such \n     defendant participant's gross revenues for the year ending \n     December 31, 2002.\n       (C) Term.--Subject to the annual availability of funds in \n     the defendant hardship and inequity adjustment account \n     established under subsection (j), an inequity adjustment \n     under this subsection shall have a term of 3 years.\n       (D) Renewal.--A defendant participant may renew an inequity \n     adjustment every 3 years by demonstrating that the adjustment \n     remains justified.\n       (E) Reinstatement.--\n       (i) In general.--Following the termination of an inequity \n     adjustment under subparagraph (A), and during the funding \n     period prescribed under subsection (a), the Chief Executive \n     Officer shall annually determine whether there has been a \n     material change in conditions which would support a finding \n     that the amount of the defendant participant's payment under \n     the statutory allocation was not inequitable. Based on this \n     determination, the Chief Executive Officer may, consistent \n     with the policies and legislative intent underlying this Act, \n     reinstate any or all of the payment obligations of the \n     defendant participant as if the inequity adjustment had not \n     been granted for that 3-year period.\n       (ii) Terms and conditions.--In the event of a reinstatement \n     under clause (i), the Chief Executive Officer may require the \n     defendant participant to pay any part or all of amounts not \n     paid due to the inequity adjustment on such terms and \n     conditions as established by the Chief Executive Officer.\n       (4) Limitation on payments by defendant participants.--\n       (A) In general.--Under expedited procedures established by \n     the Chief Executive Officer, any defendant participant may \n     apply for a limitation on its annual payment obligation to \n     the Fund by showing that it qualifies under subparagraph (C). \n     The Chief Executive Officer shall promptly grant that \n     application if the requirements under subparagraph (C) are \n     satisfied.\n       (B) Stay of payment.--A defendant participant who applies \n     for a limitation on its annual payment obligation to the Fund \n     under subparagraph (A) shall have the payment required under \n     subsection (i)(1)(A)(iv) stayed until the Chief Executive \n     Officer has made a determination with respect to the \n     application of that defendant participant.\n       (C) Application for limitation.--A defendant participant \n     may apply under subparagraph (A) for a limit on its annual \n     payment obligation to the Fund if that defendant \n     participant--\n       (i) is included in Tiers II, III, IV, V, or VI under \n     section 202; and\n\n[[Page S1214]]\n\n       (ii) has prior asbestos expenditures less than $200,000,000 \n     or has revenues as determined under section 203 that are less \n     than $15,000,000,000.\n       (D) Limitation.--\n       (i) In general.--A defendant participant that qualifies for \n     a limitation under this paragraph may apply for only 1 of the \n     limits under subclause (I), (II), or (III) of clause (ii). A \n     defendant participant may not change its application once the \n     application has been approved by the Chief Executive Officer.\n       (ii) Application for 1 limitation.--Subject to clause (i), \n     a defendant participant may apply for a limit of an amount \n     equal to--\n\n       (I) 125 percent of the arithmetical average for fiscal \n     years 1998 through 2002 of the annual prior asbestos \n     expenditures of that defendant participant;\n       (II) 150 percent of the arithmetical average for fiscal \n     years 1998 through 2002 of the annual prior asbestos \n     expenditures of that defendant participant, excluding--\n\n       (aa) the amount of any payments by insurance carriers for \n     the benefit of that defendant participant or on behalf of \n     that defendant participant; and\n       (bb) any reimbursements of the amounts actually paid by \n     that defendant participant with respect to prior asbestos \n     expenditures for fiscal years 1998 through 2002, regardless \n     of when such reimbursements were actually paid; or\n\n       (III) 1.67024 percent of the revenues for the most recent \n     fiscal year ending on or prior to December 31, 2002, of the \n     affiliated group to which that defendant participant belongs.\n\n       (E) Judicial review.--A defendant participant is entitled \n     to judicial review under section 303 of a denial of an \n     application under this paragraph. During the pendency of that \n     review, section 223(a) shall not apply to that defendant \n     participant. Without regard to section 305(a), the reviewing \n     court may, in its discretion, provide such interlocutory \n     relief to the defendant participant as may be just.\n       (F) Applicability of the guarantee surcharge.--A defendant \n     participant whose application under this paragraph is \n     approved by the Chief Executive Officer, shall not be exempt \n     from the guaranteed payment surcharge established under \n     subsection (l), unless otherwise provided in this Act.\n       (G) Minimum payment.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of this paragraph, a defendant participant that is granted a \n     limitation by the Chief Executive Officer shall pay not less \n     than 10 percent of the amount the participant is scheduled to \n     pay under section 202.\n       (5) Limitation on adjustments.--The aggregate total of \n     financial hardship adjustments under paragraph (2) and \n     inequity adjustments under paragraph (3) in effect in any \n     given year shall not exceed $300,000,000, except to the \n     extent that--\n       (A) additional monies are available for such adjustments as \n     a result of carryover of prior years' funds under subsection \n     (j)(3) or as a result of monies being made available in that \n     year under subsection (k)(1)(A); or\n       (B) the Chief Executive Officer determines that the \n     $300,000,000 is insufficient and additional adjustments as \n     provided under paragraph (5) are needed to address situations \n     in which a defendant participant would otherwise be rendered \n     insolvent by its payment obligations without such adjustment.\n       (6) Bankruptcy relief.--\n       (A) In general.--Any defendant participant may apply for an \n     adjustment under this paragraph at any time during the period \n     in which a payment obligation to the Fund remains outstanding \n     and may qualify for such adjustment by demonstrating, to a \n     reasonable degree of certainty, evidence that the amount of \n     its payment obligation would render the defendant participant \n     insolvent, as defined under section 101 of title 11, United \n     States Code, and unable to pay its debts as they become due.\n       (B) Information required.--Any defendant participant \n     seeking an adjustment or renewal of an adjustment under this \n     paragraph shall provide the Chief Executive Officer with the \n     information required under section 521(1) of title 11 of the \n     United States Code.\n       (C) Limitation.--Any adjustment granted by the Chief \n     Executive Officer under subparagraph (A) shall be limited to \n     the extent reasonably necessary to prevent insolvency of a \n     defendant participant.\n       (D) Term.--To the extent the Chief Executive Officer grants \n     any relief under this paragraph, such adjustments shall have \n     a term of 1 year. An adjustment may be renewed or modified on \n     an annual basis upon the defendant participant demonstrating \n     that the adjustment or modification remains justified under \n     this paragraph.\n       (E) Reinstatement.--During the funding period prescribed \n     under subparagraph (A), the Chief Executive Officer shall \n     annually determine whether there has been a material change \n     in the financial condition of any defendant participant \n     granted an adjustment under this paragraph such that the \n     Chief Executive Officer may, consistent with the policies and \n     legislative intent underlying this Act, reinstate under terms \n     and conditions established by the Chief Executive Officer any \n     part or all of the defendant participant's payment obligation \n     under the statutory allocation that was not paid during the \n     adjustment term.\n       (7) Advisory panels.--\n       (A) Appointment.--The Chief Executive Officer shall appoint \n     a Financial Hardship Adjustment Panel and an Inequity \n     Adjustment Panel to advise the Chief Executive Officer in \n     carrying out this subsection.\n       (B) Membership.--The membership of the panels appointed \n     under subparagraph (A) may overlap.\n       (C) Coordination.--The panels appointed under subparagraph \n     (A) shall coordinate their deliberations and advice.\n       (e) Limitation on Liability.--The liability of each \n     defendant participant to pay to the Fund shall be limited to \n     the payment obligations under this Act, and, except as \n     provided in subsection (f) and section 203(b)(2)(D), no \n     defendant participant shall have any liability for the \n     payment obligations of any other defendant participant.\n       (f) Consolidation of Payments.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of determining the payment \n     levels of defendant participants, any affiliated group \n     including 1 or more defendant participants may irrevocably \n     elect, as part of the submissions to be made under paragraphs \n     (1) and (3) of subsection (i), to report on a consolidated \n     basis all of the information necessary to determine the \n     payment level under this subtitle and pay to the Fund on a \n     consolidated basis.\n       (2) Election.--If an affiliated group elects consolidation \n     as provided in this subsection--\n       (A) for purposes of this Act other than this subsection, \n     the affiliated group shall be treated as if it were a single \n     participant, including with respect to the assessment of a \n     single annual payment under this subtitle for the entire \n     affiliated group;\n       (B) the ultimate parent of the affiliated group shall \n     prepare and submit each submission to be made under \n     subsection (i) on behalf of the entire affiliated group and \n     shall be solely liable, as between the Chief Executive \n     Officer and the affiliated group only, for the payment of the \n     annual amount due from the affiliated group under this \n     subtitle, except that, if the ultimate parent does not pay \n     when due any payment obligation for the affiliated group, the \n     Chief Executive Officer shall have the right to seek payment \n     of all or any portion of the entire amount due (as well as \n     any other amount for which the affiliated group may be liable \n     under sections 223 and 224) from any member of the affiliated \n     group;\n       (C) all members of the affiliated group shall be identified \n     in the submission under subsection (i) and shall certify \n     compliance with this subsection and the Chief Executive \n     Officer's regulations implementing this subsection; and\n       (D) the obligations under this subtitle shall not change \n     even if, after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     beneficial ownership interest between any members of the \n     affiliated group shall change.\n       (3) Cause of action.--Notwithstanding section 221(e), this \n     Act shall not preclude actions among persons within an \n     affiliated group with respect to the payment obligations \n     under this Act.\n       (g) Determination of Prior Asbestos Expenditures.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of determining a defendant \n     participant's prior asbestos expenditures, the Chief \n     Executive Officer shall prescribe such rules as may be \n     necessary or appropriate to assure that payments by \n     indemnitors before December 31, 2002, shall be counted as \n     part of the indemnitor's prior asbestos expenditures, rather \n     than the indemnitee's prior asbestos expenditures, in \n     accordance with this subsection.\n       (2) Indemnifiable costs.--If an indemnitor has paid or \n     reimbursed to an indemnitee any indemnifiable cost or \n     otherwise made a payment on behalf of or for the benefit of \n     an indemnitee to a third party for an indemnifiable cost \n     before December 31, 2002, the amount of such indemnifiable \n     cost shall be solely for the account of the indemnitor for \n     purposes under this Act.\n       (3) Insurance payments.--When computing the prior asbestos \n     expenditures with respect to an asbestos claim, any amount \n     paid or reimbursed by insurance shall be solely for the \n     account of the indemnitor, even if the indemnitor would have \n     no direct right to the benefit of the insurance, if--\n       (A) such insurance has been paid or reimbursed to the \n     indemnitor or the indemnitee, or paid on behalf of or for the \n     benefit of the indemnitee; and\n       (B) the indemnitor has either, with respect to such \n     asbestos claim or any similar asbestos claim, paid or \n     reimbursed to its indemnitee any indemnifiable cost or paid \n     to any third party on behalf of or for the benefit of the \n     indemnitee any indemnifiable cost.\n       (4) Treatment of certain expenditures.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of this Act, where--\n       (A) an indemnitor entered into a stock purchase agreement \n     in 1988 that involved the sale of the stock of businesses \n     that produced friction and other products; and\n       (B) the stock purchase agreement provided that the \n     indemnitor indemnified the indemnitee and its affiliates for \n     losses arising from various matters, including asbestos \n     claims--\n       (i) asserted before the date of the agreement; and\n       (ii) filed after the date of the agreement and prior to the \n     10-year anniversary of the stock sale,\n\n     then the prior asbestos expenditures arising from the \n     asbestos claims described in clauses (i) and (ii) shall not \n     be for the account of either the indemnitor or indemnitee.\n       (h) Minimum Annual Payments.--\n       (1) In general.--The aggregate annual payments of defendant \n     participants to the\n\n[[Page S1215]]\n\n     Fund shall be at least $3,000,000,000 for each calendar year \n     in the first 30 years of the Fund, or until such shorter time \n     as the condition set forth in subsection (a)(2) is attained.\n       (2) Guaranteed payment account.--To the extent payments in \n     accordance with sections 202 and 203 (as modified by \n     subsections (b), (d), (f), (g), and (m) of this section) fail \n     in any year to raise at least $3,000,000,000, after \n     applicable reductions or adjustments have been taken \n     according to subsections (d) and (m), the balance needed to \n     meet this required minimum aggregate annual payment shall be \n     obtained from the defendant guaranteed payment account \n     established under subsection (k).\n       (3) Guaranteed payment surcharge.--To the extent the \n     procedure set forth in paragraph (2) is insufficient to \n     satisfy the required minimum aggregate annual payment, after \n     applicable reductions or adjustments have been taken \n     according to subsections (d) and (m), the Chief Executive \n     Officer shall unless the Chief Executive Officer implements a \n     funding holiday under section 205(b), assess a guaranteed \n     payment surcharge under subsection (l).\n       (i) Procedures for Making Payments.--\n       (1) Initial year: tiers ii-vi.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 90 days after enactment of \n     this Act, each defendant participant that is included in \n     Tiers II, III, IV, V, or VI shall file with the Chief \n     Executive Officer--\n       (i) a statement of whether the defendant participant \n     irrevocably elects to report on a consolidated basis under \n     subsection (f);\n       (ii) a good-faith estimate of its prior asbestos \n     expenditures;\n       (iii) a statement of its 2002 revenues, determined in \n     accordance with section 203(a)(2);\n       (iv) payment in the amount specified in section 203 for the \n     lowest subtier of the tier within which the defendant \n     participant falls, except that if the defendant participant, \n     or the affiliated group including the defendant participant, \n     had 2002 revenues exceeding $3,000,000,000, it or its \n     affiliated group shall pay the amount specified for Subtier 3 \n     of Tiers II, III, or IV or Subtier 2 of Tiers V or VI, \n     depending on the applicable Tier;

The Committee shall \n     make this determination by first promulgating a rule \n     establishing a methodology for allocation of payments among \n     insurer participants and then applying such methodology to \n     determine the individual payment for each insurer \n     participant. The methodology may include 1 or more allocation \n     formulas to be applied to all insurer participants or groups \n     of similarly situated participants. The Committee's rule \n     shall include a methodology for adjusting payments by insurer \n     participants to make up, during the first 5 years of the life \n     of the Fund and any subsequent years as provided in section \n     405(e) for any reduction in an insurer participant's annual \n     allocated amount caused by the granting of a financial \n     hardship or exceptional circumstance adjustment under this \n     section, and any amount by which aggregate insurer payments \n     fall below the level required under paragraph (3)(C) by \n     reason of the failure or refusal of any insurer participant \n     to make a required payment, or for any other reason that \n     causes such payments to fall below the level required under \n     paragraph (3)(C).

In proposing an allocation methodology, the \n     Committee may consult with such actuaries and other experts \n     as it deems appropriate. After hearings and public comment on \n     the proposed allocation methodology, the Committee shall as \n     promptly as possible promulgate a final rule establishing \n     such methodology. After promulgation of the final rule, the \n     Committee shall determine the individual payment of each \n     insurer participant under the procedures set forth in \n     subsection (b).\n       (C) Scope.--Every insurer, reinsurer, and runoff entity \n     with asbestos-related obligations in the United States shall \n     be subject to the Committee's and Chief Executive Officer's \n     authority under this Act, including allocation \n     determinations, and shall be required to fulfill its payment \n     obligation without regard as to whether it is licensed in the \n     United States. Every insurer participant not licensed or \n     domiciled in the United States shall, upon the first payment \n     to the Fund, submit a written consent to the Committee's and \n     Chief Executive Officer's authority under this Act, and to \n     the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States for \n     purposes of enforcing this Act, in a form determined by the \n     Chief Executive Officer. Any insurer participant refusing to \n     provide a written consent shall be subject to fines and \n     penalties as provided in section 223.\n       (D) Issuers of finite risk policies.--\n\n[[Page S1218]]\n\n       (i) In general.--The issuer of any policy of retrospective \n     reinsurance purchased by an insurer participant or its \n     affiliate after 1990 that provides for a risk or loss \n     transfer to insure for asbestos losses and other losses (both \n     known and unknown), including those policies commonly \n     referred to as ``finite risk'', ``aggregate stop loss'', \n     ``aggregate excess of loss'', or ``loss portfolio transfer'' \n     policies, shall be obligated to make payments required under \n     this Act directly to the Fund on behalf of the insurer \n     participant who is the beneficiary of such policy, subject to \n     the underlying retention and the limits of liability \n     applicable to such policy.\n       (ii) Payments.--Payments to the Fund required under this \n     Act shall be treated as loss payments for asbestos bodily \n     injury (as if such payments were incurred as liabilities \n     imposed in the tort system) and shall not be subject to \n     exclusion under policies described under clause (i) as a \n     liability with respect to tax or assessment. Within 90 days \n     after the scheduled date to make an annual payment to the \n     Fund, the insurer participant shall, at its discretion, \n     direct the reinsurer issuing such policy to pay all or a \n     portion of the annual payment directly to the Fund up to the \n     full applicable limits of liability under the policy. The \n     reinsurer issuing such policy shall be obligated to make such \n     payments directly to the Fund and shall be subject to the \n     enforcement provisions under section 223. The insurer \n     participant shall remain obligated to make payment to the \n     Fund of that portion of the annual payment not directed to \n     the issuer of such reinsurance policy.\n       (2) Amount of payments.--\n       (A) Aggregate payment obligation.--The total payment \n     required of all insurer participants over the life of the \n     Fund shall be equal to $46,025,000,000, less any bankruptcy \n     trust credits under section 222(d).\n       (B) Accounting standards.--In determining the payment \n     obligations of participants that are not licensed or \n     domiciled in the United States or that are runoff entities, \n     the Committee shall use accounting standards required for \n     United States licensed direct insurers.\n       (C) Captive insurance companies.--No payment to the Fund \n     shall be required from a captive insurance company, unless \n     and only to the extent a captive insurance company, on the \n     date of enactment of this Act, has liability, directly or \n     indirectly, for any asbestos claim of a person or persons \n     other than and unaffiliated with its ultimate parent or \n     affiliated group or pool in which the ultimate parent \n     participates or participated, or unaffiliated with a person \n     that was its ultimate parent or a member of its affiliated \n     group or pool at the time the relevant insurance or \n     reinsurance was issued by the captive insurance company.\n       (D) Several liability.--Unless otherwise provided under \n     this Act, each insurer participant's obligation to make \n     payments to the Fund is several. Unless otherwise provided \n     under this Act, there is no joint liability, and the future \n     insolvency by any insurer participant shall not affect the \n     payment required of any other insurer participant.\n       (3) Payment of criteria.--\n       (A) Inclusion in insurer participant category.--\n       (i) In general.--Insurers that have paid, or been assessed \n     by a legal judgment or settlement, at least $1,000,000 in \n     defense and indemnity costs before the date of enactment of \n     this Act in response to claims for compensation for asbestos \n     injuries arising from a policy of liability insurance or \n     contract of liability reinsurance or retrocessional \n     reinsurance shall be insurer participants in the Fund. Other \n     insurers shall be exempt from mandatory payments.\n       (ii) Inapplicability of section 202.--Since insurers may be \n     subject in certain jurisdictions to direct action suits, and \n     it is not the intent of this Act to impose upon an insurer, \n     due to its operation as an insurer, payment obligations to \n     the Fund in situations where the insurer is the subject of a \n     direct action, no insurer subject to mandatory payments under \n     this section shall also be liable for payments to the Fund as \n     a defendant participant under section 202.\n       (B) Insurer participant allocation methodology.--\n       (i) In general.--The Committee shall establish the payment \n     obligations of individual insurer participants to reflect, on \n     an equitable basis, the relative tort system liability of the \n     participating insurers in the absence of this Act, \n     considering and weighting, as appropriate (but exclusive of \n     workers' compensation), such factors as--\n\n       (I) historic premium for lines of insurance associated with \n     asbestos exposure over relevant periods of time;\n       (II) recent loss experience for asbestos liability;\n       (III) amounts reserved for asbestos liability;\n       (IV) the likely cost to each insurer participant of its \n     future liabilities under applicable insurance policies; and\n       (V) any other factor the Committee may determine is \n     relevant and appropriate.\n\n       (ii) Determination of reserves.--The Committee may \n     establish procedures and standards for determination of the \n     asbestos reserves of insurer participants. The reserves of a \n     United States licensed reinsurer that is wholly owned by, or \n     under common control of, a United States licensed direct \n     insurer shall be included as part of the direct insurer's \n     reserves when the reinsurer's financial results are included \n     as part of the direct insurer's United States operations, as \n     reflected in footnote 33 of its filings with the National \n     Association of Insurance Commissioners or in published \n     financial statements prepared in accordance with generally \n     accepted accounting principles.\n       (C) Payment schedule.--The aggregate annual amount of \n     payments by insurer participants over the life of the Fund \n     shall be as follows:\n       (i) For years 1 and 2, $2,700,000,000 annually.\n       (ii) For years 3 through 5, $5,075,000,000 annually.\n       (iii) For years 6 through 27, $1,147,000,000 annually.\n       (iv) For year 28, $166,000,000.\n       (D) Certain runoff entities.--A runoff entity shall include \n     any direct insurer or reinsurer whose asbestos liability \n     reserves have been transferred, directly or indirectly, to \n     the runoff entity and on whose behalf the runoff entity \n     handles or adjusts and, where appropriate, pays asbestos \n     claims.\n       (E) Financial hardship and exceptional circumstance \n     adjustments.--\n       (i) In general.--Under the procedures established in \n     subsection (b), an insurer participant may seek adjustment of \n     the amount of its payments based on exceptional circumstances \n     or severe financial hardship.\n       (ii) Financial adjustments.--An insurer participant may \n     qualify for an adjustment based on severe financial hardship \n     by demonstrating that payment of the amounts required by the \n     Committee's methodology would jeopardize the solvency of such \n     participant.\n       (iii) Exceptional circumstance adjustment.--An insurer \n     participant may qualify for an adjustment based on \n     exceptional circumstances by demonstrating--\n\n       (I) that the amount of its payments under the Committee's \n     allocation methodology is exceptionally inequitable when \n     measured against the amount of the likely cost to the \n     participant of its future liability in the tort system in the \n     absence of the Fund;\n       (II) an offset credit as described in subparagraphs (A) and \n     (C) of subsection (b)(4); or\n       (III) other exceptional circumstances.\n\n     The Committee may determine whether to grant an adjustment \n     and the size of any such adjustment, but except as provided \n     under paragraph (1)(B), subsection (f)(3), and section \n     405(e), any such adjustment shall not affect the aggregate \n     payment obligations of insurer participants specified in \n     paragraph (2)(A) and subparagraph (C) of this paragraph.\n       (iv) Time period of adjustment.--Except for adjustments for \n     offset credits, adjustments granted under this subsection \n     shall have a term not to exceed 3 years. An insurer \n     participant may renew its adjustment by demonstrating to the \n     Chief Executive Officer that it remains justified.\n       (F) Funding holidays.--\n       (i) In general.--If the Chief Executive Officer determines, \n     at any time after 10 years following the date of enactment of \n     this Act, that the assets of the Fund at the time of such \n     determination and expected future payments are sufficient to \n     satisfy the Fund's anticipated obligations without the need \n     for all, or any portion of, that year's payment otherwise \n     required under this subtitle, the Chief Executive Officer \n     shall reduce or waive all or any part of the payments \n     required from insurer participants for that year.\n       (ii) Annual review.--The Chief Executive Officer shall \n     undertake the review required by this subsection and make the \n     necessary determination under clause (i) every year.\n       (iii) Limitations of funding holidays.--Any reduction or \n     waiver of the insurer participants' funding obligations \n     shall--\n\n       (I) be made only to the extent the Chief Executive Officer \n     determines that the Fund will still be able to satisfy all of \n     its anticipated obligations; and\n       (II) be applied on an equal pro rata basis to the funding \n     obligations of all insurer participants for that year.\n\n       (iv) New information.--If at any time the Chief Executive \n     Officer determines that a reduction or waiver under this \n     section may cause the assets of the Fund and expected future \n     payments to decrease to a level at which the Fund may not be \n     able to satisfy all of its anticipated obligations, the Chief \n     Executive Officer shall revoke all or any part of such \n     reduction or waiver to the extent necessary to ensure that \n     the Fund's obligations are met. Such revocations shall be \n     applied on an equal pro rata basis to the funding obligations \n     of all insurer participants for that year.\n       (b) Procedure for Notifying Insurer Participants of \n     Individual Payment Obligations.--\n       (1) Notice to participants.--Not later than 30 days after \n     promulgation of the final rule establishing an allocation \n     methodology under subsection (a)(1), the Committee shall--\n       (A) directly notify all reasonably identifiable insurer \n     participants of the requirement to submit information \n     necessary to calculate the amount of any required payment to \n     the Fund under the allocation methodology; and\n       (B) publish in a newspaper with a circulation of at least \n     500,000 and on the Internet a notice--\n       (i) requiring any person who may be an insurer participant \n     (as determined by criteria outlined in the notice) to submit \n     such information; and\n       (ii) that includes a list of all insurer participants \n     notified by the Committee under subparagraph (A), and \n     provides for 30 days\n\n[[Page S1219]]\n\n     for the submission of comments or information regarding the \n     completeness and accuracy of the list of identified insurer \n     participants.\n       (2) Response required by individual insurer participants.--\n       (A) In general.--Any person who receives notice under \n     paragraph (1)(A), and any other person meeting the criteria \n     specified in the notice published under paragraph (1)(B), \n     shall respond by providing the Committee with all the \n     information requested in the notice under a schedule or by a \n     date established by the Committee.\n       (B) Certification.--The response submitted under \n     subparagraph (A) shall be signed by a responsible corporate \n     officer, general partner, proprietor, or individual of \n     similar authority, who shall certify under penalty of law the \n     completeness and accuracy of the information submitted.\n       (3) Notice to insurer participants of initial payment \n     determination.--\n       (A) In general.--\n       (i) Notice to insurers.--Not later than 120 days after \n     receipt of the information required by paragraph (2), the \n     Committee shall send each insurer participant a notice of \n     initial determination requiring payments to the Fund, which \n     shall be based on the information received from the \n     participant in response to the Committee's request for \n     information. An insurer participant's payments shall be \n     payable over the schedule established in subsection \n     (a)(3)(C), in annual amounts proportionate to the aggregate \n     annual amount of payments for all insurer participants for \n     the applicable year.\n       (ii) Public notice.--Not later than 7 days after sending \n     the notification of initial determination to insurer \n     participants, the Committee shall publish in a newspaper with \n     a circulation of at least 500,000 and on the Internet a \n     notice listing the insurer participants that have been sent \n     such notification, and the initial determination on the \n     payment obligation of each identified participant.\n       (B) No response; incomplete response.--If no response is \n     received from an insurer participant, or if the response is \n     incomplete, the initial determination requiring a payment \n     from the insurer participant shall be based on the best \n     information available to the Committee.\n       (4) Committee review, revision, and finalization of initial \n     payment determinations.--\n       (A) Comments from insurer participants.--Not later than 30 \n     days after receiving a notice of initial determination from \n     the Committee, an insurer participant may provide the \n     Committee with additional information to support adjustments \n     to the required payments to reflect severe financial hardship \n     or exceptional circumstances, including the provision of an \n     offset credit for an insurer participant for the amount of \n     any asbestos-related payments it made or was legally \n     obligated to make, including payments released from an \n     escrow, as the result of a bankruptcy judicially confirmed \n     after May 22, 2003, but before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (B) Additional participants.--If, before the final \n     determination of the Committee, the Committee receives \n     information that an additional person may qualify as an \n     insurer participant, the Committee shall require such person \n     to submit information necessary to determine whether payments \n     from that person should be required, in accordance with the \n     requirements of this subsection.\n       (C) Revision procedures.--The Committee shall adopt \n     procedures for revising initial payments based on information \n     received under subparagraphs (A) and (B), including a \n     provision requiring an offset credit for an insurer \n     participant for the amount of any asbestos-related payments \n     it made or was legally obligated to make, including payments \n     released from an escrow, as the result of a bankruptcy \n     confirmed after May 22, 2003, but before the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (5) Examinations and subpoenas.--\n       (A) Examinations.--The Committee may conduct examinations \n     of the books and records of insurer participants to determine \n     the completeness and accuracy of information submitted, or \n     required to be submitted, to the Committee for purposes of \n     determining participant payments.\n       (B) Subpoenas.--The Committee may request the Attorney \n     General to subpoena persons to compel testimony, records, and \n     other information relevant to its responsibilities under this \n     section. The Attorney General may enforce such subpoena in \n     appropriate proceedings in the United States district court \n     for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena was \n     addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.\n       (6) Escrow payments.--Without regard to an insurer \n     participant's payment obligation under this section, any \n     escrow or similar account established before the date of \n     enactment of this Act by an insurer participant in connection \n     with an asbestos trust fund that has not been judicially \n     confirmed by final order by the date of enactment of this Act \n     shall be the property of the insurer participant and returned \n     to that insurer participant.\n       (7) Notice to insurer participants of final payment \n     determinations.--Not later than 60 days after the notice of \n     initial determination is sent to the insurer participants, \n     the Committee shall send each insurer participant a notice of \n     final determination.\n       (c) Insurer Participants Voluntary Allocation Agreement.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the Committee \n     proposes its rule establishing an allocation methodology \n     under subsection (a)(1), direct insurer participants licensed \n     or domiciled in the United States, other direct insurer \n     participants, reinsurer participants licensed or domiciled in \n     the United States, or other reinsurer participants, may \n     submit an allocation agreement, approved by all of the \n     participants in the applicable group, to the Committee.\n       (2) Allocation agreement.--To the extent the participants \n     in any such applicable group voluntarily agree upon an \n     allocation arrangement, any such allocation agreement shall \n     only govern the allocation of payments within that group and \n     shall not determine the aggregate amount due from that group.\n       (3) Certification.--The Committee shall determine whether \n     an allocation agreement submitted under subparagraph (A) \n     meets the requirements of this subtitle and, if so, shall \n     certify the agreement as establishing the allocation \n     methodology governing the individual payment obligations of \n     the participants who are parties to the agreement. The \n     authority of the Committee under this subtitle shall, with \n     respect to participants who are parties to a certified \n     allocation agreement, terminate on the day after the \n     Committee certifies such agreement. Under subsection (f), the \n     Chief Executive Officer shall assume responsibility, if \n     necessary, for calculating the individual payment obligations \n     of participants who are parties to the certified agreement.\n       (d) Committee Report.--\n       (1) Recipients.--Until the work of the Committee has been \n     completed and the Committee terminated, the Committee shall \n     submit an annual report, containing the information described \n     under paragraph (2), to--\n       (A) the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate;\n       (B) the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (C) the Chief Executive Officer.\n       (2) Contents.--The report under paragraph (1) shall state \n     the amount that each insurer participant is required to pay \n     to the Fund, including the payment schedule for such \n     payments.\n       (e) Interim Payments.--\n       (1) Amount of interim payment.--Within 90 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, insurer participants shall \n     make an aggregate payment to the Fund not to exceed 50 \n     percent of the aggregate funding obligation specified under \n     subsection (a)(3)(C) for year 1.\n       (2) Reserve information.--Within 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, each insurer participant shall submit \n     to the Chief Executive Officer a certified statement of its \n     net held reserves for asbestos liabilities as of December 31, \n     2004.\n       (3) Allocation of interim payment.--The Chief Executive \n     Officer shall allocate the interim payment among the \n     individual insurer participants on an equitable basis using \n     the net held asbestos reserve information provided by insurer \n     participants under subsection (a)(3)(B). Within 60 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Chief Executive \n     Officer shall publish in a newspaper with a circulation of at \n     least 500,000 and on the Internet the name of each insurer \n     participant, and the amount of the insurer participant's \n     allocated share of the interim payment. The use of net held \n     asbestos reserves as the basis to determine an interim \n     allocation shall not be binding on the Chief Executive \n     Officer in the determination of an appropriate final \n     allocation methodology under this section. All payments \n     required under this paragraph shall be credited against the \n     participant's ultimate payment obligation to the Fund \n     established by the Committee. If an interim payment exceeds \n     the ultimate payment, the Fund shall pay interest on the \n     amount of the overpayment at a rate determined by the Chief \n     Executive Officer. If the ultimate payment exceeds the \n     interim payment, the participant shall pay interest on the \n     amount of the underpayment at the same rate. Any participant \n     may seek an exemption from or reduction in any payment \n     required under this subsection under the financial hardship \n     and exceptional circumstance standards established under \n     subsection (a)(3)(E).\n       (4) Appeal of interim payment decisions.--A decision by the \n     Chief Executive Officer to establish an interim payment \n     obligation shall be considered final agency action and \n     reviewable under section 303, except that the reviewing court \n     may not stay an interim payment during the pendency of the \n     appeal.\n       (f) Transfer of Authority From the Committee to the Chief \n     Executive Officer.--\n       (1) In general.--Upon termination of the Committee under \n     section 215, the Chief Executive Officer shall assume all the \n     responsibilities and authority of the Committee, except that \n     the Chief Executive Officer shall not have the power to \n     modify the allocation methodology established by the \n     Committee or by certified agreement or to promulgate a rule \n     establishing any such methodology.\n       (2) Financial hardship and exceptional circumstance \n     adjustments.--Upon termination of the Committee under section \n     215, the Chief Executive Officer shall have the authority, \n     upon application by any insurer participant, to make \n     adjustments to annual payments upon the same grounds as \n     provided in subsection (a)(3)(D). Adjustments granted under \n     this subsection shall have a term not to exceed 3 years. An \n     insurer participant may renew its adjustment by demonstrating \n     that it remains justified. Upon the grant of any adjustment, \n     the Chief Executive Officer\n\n[[Page S1220]]\n\n     shall increase the payments, consistent with subsection \n     (a)(1)(B), required of all other insurer participants so that \n     there is no reduction in the aggregate payment required of \n     all insurer participants for the applicable years. The \n     increase in an insurer participant's required payment shall \n     be in proportion to such participant's share of the aggregate \n     payment obligation of all insurer participants.\n       (3) Credits for shortfall assessments.--If insurer \n     participants are required during the first 5 years of the \n     life of the Fund to make up any shortfall in required insurer \n     payments under subsection (a)(1)(B), then, beginning in year \n     6, the Chief Executive Officer shall grant each insurer \n     participant a credit against its annual required payments \n     during the applicable years that in the aggregate equal the \n     amount of shortfall assessments paid by such insurer \n     participant during the first 5 years of the life of the Fund. \n     The credit shall be prorated over the same number of years as \n     the number of years during which the insurer participant paid \n     a shortfall assessment. Insurer participants which did not \n     pay all required payments to the Fund during the first 5 \n     years of the life of the Fund shall not be eligible for a \n     credit. The Chief Executive Officer shall not grant a credit \n     for shortfall assessments imposed under section 405(e).\n       (4) Financial security requirements.--Whenever an insurer \n     participant's A.M. Best's claims payment rating or Standard \n     and Poor's financial strength rating falls below A-, and \n     until such time as either the insurer participant's A.M. \n     Best's Rating or Standard and Poor's rating is equal to or \n     greater than A-, the Chief Executive Officer shall have the \n     authority to require that the participating insurer either--\n       (A) pay the present value of its remaining Fund payments at \n     a discount rate determined by the Chief Executive Officer; or\n       (B) provide an evergreen letter of credit or financial \n     guarantee for future payments issued by an institution with \n     an A.M. Best's claims payment rating or Standard & Poor's \n     financial strength rating of at least A+.\n       (g) Accounting Treatment.--Insurer participants' payment \n     obligations to the Fund shall be subject to discounting under \n     the applicable accounting guidelines for generally accepted \n     accounting purposes and statutory accounting purposes for \n     each insurer participant. This subsection shall in no way \n     reduce the amount of monetary payments to the Fund by insurer \n     participants as required under subsection (a).\n       (h) Judicial Review.--The Committee's rule establishing an \n     allocation methodology, its final determinations of payment \n     obligations and other final action shall be judicially \n     reviewable as provided in title III.\n\n     SEC. 213. POWERS OF ASBESTOS INSURERS COMMITTEE.\n\n       (a) Rulemaking.--The Committee shall promulgate such rules \n     and regulations as necessary to implement its authority under \n     this Act, including regulations governing an allocation \n     methodology.

MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND.\n\n       (a) In General.--Amounts in the Fund shall be held for the \n     exclusive purpose of providing benefits to asbestos claimants \n     and their beneficiaries and to otherwise defray the \n     reasonable expenses of administering the Fund.\n       (b) Investments.--\n       (1) In general.--Amounts in the Fund shall be administered \n     and invested with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence, \n     under the circumstances prevailing at the time of such \n     investment, that a prudent person acting in a like capacity \n     and manner would use.\n       (2) Strategy.--The Chief Executive Officer shall invest \n     amounts in the Fund in a manner that enables the Fund to make \n     current and future distributions to or for the benefit of \n     asbestos claimants. In pursuing an investment strategy under \n     this subparagraph, the Chief Executive Officer shall \n     consider, to the extent relevant to an investment decision or \n     action--\n       (A) the size of the Fund;\n       (B) the nature and estimated duration of the Fund;\n       (C) the liquidity and distribution requirements of the \n     Fund;\n       (D) general economic conditions at the time of the \n     investment;\n       (E) the possible effect of inflation or deflation on Fund \n     assets;\n       (F) the role that each investment or course of action plays \n     with respect to the overall assets of the Fund;\n       (G) the expected amount to be earned (including both income \n     and appreciation of capital) through investment of amounts in \n     the Fund; and\n       (H) the needs of asbestos claimants for current and future \n     distributions authorized under this Act.\n       (c) Bankruptcy Trust Guarantee.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, the Chief Executive Officer shall have the \n     authority to impose a pro rata surcharge on all participants \n     under this subsection to ensure the liquidity of the Fund, \n     if--\n       (A) the declared assets from 1 or more bankruptcy trusts \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated on or before July 31, 2004, are not \n     available to the Fund because a final judgment that has been \n     entered by a court and is no longer subject to any appeal or \n     review has enjoined the transfer of assets required under \n     section 524(j)(2) of title 11, United States Code (as amended \n     by section 402(f) of this Act); and\n       (B) borrowing is insufficient to assure the Fund's ability \n     to meet its obligations under this Act such that the required \n     borrowed amount is likely to increase the risk of termination \n     of this Act under section 405 based on reasonable claims \n     projections.\n       (2) Allocation.--Any surcharge imposed under this \n     subsection shall be imposed over a period of 5 years on a pro \n     rata basis upon all participants, in accordance with the \n     relative aggregate funding obligations under sections \n     202(a)(2) and 212(a)(2)(A).\n       (3) Certification.--\n       (A) In general.--Before imposing a surcharge under this \n     subsection, the Chief Executive Officer shall publish in a \n     newspaper with a circulation of at least 500,000 and on the \n     Internet a notice and provide in such notice for a public \n     comment period of 30 days.\n       (B) Contents of notice.--The notice required under \n     subparagraph (A) shall include--\n       (i) information explaining the circumstances that make a \n     surcharge necessary and a certification that the requirements \n     under paragraph (1) are met;\n       (ii) the amount of the declared assets from any trust \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated on or before July 31, 2004, that \n     was not made, or is no longer, available to the Fund;\n       (iii) the total aggregate amount of the necessary \n     surcharge; and\n       (iv) the surcharge amount for each tier and subtier of \n     defendant participants and for each insurer participant.\n       (C) Final notice.--The Chief Executive Officer shall \n     publish in a newspaper with a circulation of at least 500,000 \n     and on the Internet a final notice and provide each \n     participant with written notice of that participant's \n     schedule of payments under this subsection. In no event shall \n     any required surcharge under this subsection be due before 60 \n     days after the Chief Executive Officer publishes the final \n     notice in a newspaper with a circulation of at least 500,000 \n     and on the Internet and provides each participant with \n     written notice of its schedule of payments.\n       (4) Maximum amount.--In no event shall the total aggregate \n     surcharge imposed by the Chief Executive Officer exceed the \n     lesser of--\n       (A) the total aggregate amount of the declared assets of \n     the trusts established under a plan of reorganization \n     confirmed and substantially consummated prior to July 31, \n     2004, that are no longer available to the Fund; or\n       (B) $4,000,000,000.\n       (5) Declared assets.--\n       (A) In general.--In this subsection, the term ``declared \n     assets'' means--\n       (i) the amount of assets transferred by any trust \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated on or before July 31, 2004, to the \n     Fund that is required to be returned to that trust under the \n     final judgment described in paragraph (1)(A); or\n       (ii) if no assets were transferred by the trust to the \n     Fund, the amount of assets the Chief Executive Officer \n     determines would have been available for transfer to the Fund \n     from that trust under section 402(f).\n       (B) Determination.--In making a determination under \n     subparagraph (A)(ii), the Chief Executive Officer may rely on \n     any information reasonably available, and may request, and \n     use subpoena authority of the Chief Executive Officer if \n     necessary to obtain, relevant information from any such trust \n     or its trustees.\n       (d) Bankruptcy Trust Credits.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, but subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, \n     the Chief Executive Officer shall provide a credit toward the \n     aggregate payment obligations under sections 202(a)(2) and \n     212(a)(2)(A) for assets received by the Fund from any \n     bankruptcy trust established under a plan of reorganization \n     confirmed and substantially consummated after July 31, 2004.\n       (2) Allocation of credits.--The Chief Executive Officer \n     shall allocate, for each such bankruptcy trust, the credits \n     for such assets between the defendant and insurer aggregate \n     payment obligations as follows:\n       (A) Defendant participants.--The aggregate amount that all \n     persons other than insurers contributing to the bankruptcy \n     trust would have been required to pay as Tier I defendants \n     under section 203(b) if the plan of reorganization under \n     which the bankruptcy trust was established had not been \n     confirmed and substantially consummated and the proceeding \n     under chapter 11 of title 11, United States Code, that \n     resulted in the establishment of the bankruptcy trust had \n     remained pending as of the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n[[Page S1222]]\n\n       (B) Insurer participants.--The aggregate amount of all \n     credits to which insurers are entitled to under section \n     202(c)(4)(A) of the Act.\n\n     SEC. 223.

or\n       (II) asserting any conspiracy, act, conduct, statement, \n     omission, or failure to detect, disclose, or warn relating to \n     the presence or health effects of asbestos or the use, sale, \n     distribution, manufacture, production, development, \n     inspection, advertising, marketing, or installation of \n     asbestos, asserted as or in a direct action against an \n     insurer or reinsurer based upon any theory, statutory, \n     contract, tort, or otherwise; or\n\n       (iv) by any third party, and premised on any theory, \n     allegation, or cause of action, for reimbursement of \n     healthcare costs allegedly associated with the use of or \n     exposure to asbestos, whether such claim is asserted \n     directly, indirectly or derivatively.\n       (B) Exceptions.--Subparagraph (A) (ii) and (iii) shall not \n     apply to claims against participants by persons--\n       (i) with whom the participant is in privity of contract;\n       (ii) who have received an assignment of insurance rights \n     not otherwise voided by this Act; or\n       (iii) who are beneficiaries covered by the express terms of \n     a contract with that participant.\n       (3) Preemption.--Any action asserting an asbestos claim \n     (including a claim described in paragraph (2)) in any Federal \n     or State court is preempted by this Act, except for any \n     action for which an unappealable verdict or final order or \n     final judgment has been entered by a court before the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (4) Dismissal.--No judgment other than a judgment of \n     dismissal may be entered in any such action, including an \n     action pending on appeal, or on petition or motion for \n     discretionary review, on or after the date of enactment of \n     this Act. A court may dismiss any such action on its motion. \n     If the court denies the motion to dismiss, it shall stay \n     further proceedings until final disposition of any appeal \n     taken under this Act.\n       (5) Removal.--\n       (A) In general.--If an action in any State court under \n     paragraph (3) is preempted, barred, or otherwise precluded \n     under this Act, and not dismissed, or if an order entered \n     after the date of enactment of this Act purporting to enter \n     judgment or deny review is not rescinded and replaced with an \n     order of dismissal within 30 days after the filing of a \n     motion by any party to the action advising the court of the \n     provisions of this Act, any party may remove the case to the \n     district court of the United States for the district in which \n     such action is pending.\n       (B) Time limits.--For actions originally filed after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the notice of removal shall be \n     filed within the time limits specified in section 1441(b) of \n     title 28, United States Code.\n       (C) Procedures.--The procedures for removal and proceedings \n     after removal shall be in accordance with sections 1446 \n     through 1450 of title 28, United States Code, except--\n       (i) as may be necessary to accommodate removal of any \n     actions pending (including on appeal) on the date of \n     enactment of this Act; and\n       (ii) orders to remand removed actions shall be immediately \n     appealable.\n       (D) Jurisdiction.--The jurisdiction of the district court \n     shall be limited to--\n       (i) determining whether removal was proper; and\n       (ii) determining, based on the evidentiary record, whether \n     the claim presented is preempted, barred, or otherwise \n     precluded under this Act.\n       (6) Credits.--If, notwithstanding the express intent of \n     Congress stated in this section, any court finally determines \n     for any reason that an asbestos claim, including a claim \n     described under paragraph (2), for which, as of the date of \n     enactment of this Act, there had been no verdict or final \n     order or final judgment entered by a court, is not subject to \n     the exclusive remedy or preemption provisions of this \n     section, then any participant required to satisfy a final \n     judgment executed with respect to any such claim may elect to \n     receive a credit against any assessment owed to the Fund \n     equal to the amount of the payment made with respect to such \n     executed judgment. The Chief Executive Officer shall require \n     participants seeking credit under this section to demonstrate \n     that the participant timely pursued all available remedies, \n     including remedies available under this section to obtain \n     dismissal of the claim, and that the participant notified the \n     Chief Executive Officer at least 20 days before the \n     expiration of any period within which to appeal the denial of \n     a motion to dismiss based on this section. The Chief \n     Executive Officer may require such participant to furnish \n     such further information as is necessary and appropriate to \n     establish eligibility for and the amount of the credits. The \n     Chief Executive Officer may intervene in any action in which \n     a credit may be due under this section.\n\n     SEC. 404. EFFECT ON INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS.\n\n       (a) Erosion of Insurance Coverage Limits.--\n       (1) Definitions.--In this section, the following \n     definitions shall apply:\n       (A) Deemed erosion amount.--The term ``deemed erosion \n     amount'' means the amount of erosion deemed to occur at \n     enactment under paragraph (2).\n       (B) Earned erosion amount.--The term ``earned erosion \n     amount'' means, in the event of any early sunset under \n     section 405(f), the percentage, as set forth in the following \n     schedule, depending on the year in which the defendant \n     participants' funding obligations end, of those amounts \n     which, at the time of the early sunset, a defendant \n     participant has paid to the fund and remains obligated to pay \n     into the fund.\n  Year After Enactment In Which Defendant Participant's Funding \n  Obligation Ends:                               Applicable Percentage:\n  10........................................................70.78  ....\n\n  11........................................................68.75  ....\n\n  12........................................................67.06  ....\n\n  13........................................................65.63  ....\n\n  14........................................................64.40  ....\n\n  15........................................................63.33  ....\n\n  16........................................................62.40  ....\n\n  17........................................................61.58  ....\n\n  18........................................................60.39  ....\n\n  19........................................................59.33  ....\n\n  20........................................................58.38  ....\n\n  21........................................................57.51  ....\n\n  22........................................................56.36  ....\n\n  23........................................................55.31  ....\n\n  24........................................................56.71  ....\n\n  25........................................................58.11  ....\n\n  26........................................................59.51  ....\n\n       (C) Remaining aggregate products limits.--The term \n     ``remaining aggregate products limits'' means aggregate \n     limits that apply to insurance coverage granted under the \n     ``products hazard'', ``completed operations hazard'', or \n     ``Products--Completed Operations Liability'' in any \n     comprehensive general liability policy issued between \n     calendar years 1940 and 1986 to cover injury which occurs in \n     any State, as reduced by--\n       (i) any existing impairment of such aggregate limits as of \n     the date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (ii) the resolution of claims for reimbursement or coverage \n     of liability or paid or incurred loss for which notice was \n     provided to the insurer before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (D) Scheduled payment amounts.--The term ``scheduled \n     payment amounts'' means the future payment obligation to the \n     Fund under this Act from a defendant participant in the \n     amount established under sections 203 and 204.\n       (2) Quantum and timing of erosion.--\n       (A) Erosion upon enactment.--The collective payment \n     obligations to the Fund of the insurer and reinsurer \n     participants as assessed by the Chief Executive Officer shall \n     be deemed as of the date of enactment of this Act to erode \n     remaining aggregate products limits available to a defendant \n     participant only in an amount of 59.64 percent of each \n     defendant participant's scheduled payment amount.\n       (B) No assertion of claim.--No insurer or reinsurer may \n     assert any claim against a defendant participant or captive \n     insurer for insurance, reinsurance, payment of a deductible, \n     or retrospective premium adjustment arising out of that \n     insurer's or reinsurer's payments to the Fund or the erosion \n     deemed to occur under this section.\n       (C) Policies without certain limits or with exclusion.--\n     Except as provided under subparagraph (E), nothing in this \n     section shall require or permit the erosion of any insurance \n     policy or limit that does not contain an aggregate products \n     limit, or that contains an asbestos exclusion.\n       (D) Treatment of consolidation election.--If an affiliated \n     group elects consolidation as provided in section 204(f), the \n     total erosion of limits for the affiliated group under \n     paragraph (2)(A) shall not exceed 59.64 percent of the \n     scheduled payment amount of the single payment obligation for \n     the entire affiliated group. The total erosion of limits for \n     any individual defendant participant in the affiliated group \n     shall not exceed its individual share of 59.64 percent of the \n     affiliated group's scheduled payment amount, as measured by \n     the individual defendant participant's percentage share of \n     the affiliated group's prior asbestos expenditures.\n       (E) Rule of construction.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section, nothing in this Act shall be \n     deemed to erode remaining aggregate products limits of a \n     defendant participant that can demonstrate by a preponderance \n     of the evidence that 75 percent of its prior asbestos \n     expenditures were made in defense or satisfaction of asbestos \n     claims alleging bodily injury arising exclusively from the \n     exposure to asbestos at premises owned, rented, or controlled \n     by the\n\n[[Page S1228]]\n\n     defendant participant (a ``premises defendant''). In \n     calculating such percentage, where expenditures were made in \n     defense or satisfaction of asbestos claims alleging bodily \n     injury due to exposure to the defendant participant's \n     products and to asbestos at premises owned, rented, or \n     controlled by the defendant participant, half of such \n     expenditures shall be deemed to be for such premises \n     exposures. If a defendant participant establishes itself as a \n     premises defendant, 75 percent of the payments by such \n     defendant participant shall erode coverage limits, if any, \n     applicable to premises liabilities under applicable law.\n       (3) Method of erosion.--\n       (A) Allocation.--The amount of erosion allocated to each \n     defendant participant shall be allocated among periods in \n     which policies with remaining aggregate product limits are \n     available to that defendant participant pro rata by policy \n     period, in ascending order by attachment point.\n       (B) Other erosion methods.--\n       (i) In general.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the \n     method of erosion of any remaining aggregate products limits \n     which are subject to--\n\n       (I) a coverage-in-place or settlement agreement between a \n     defendant participant and 1 or more insurance participants as \n     of the date of enactment; or\n       (II) a final and nonappealable judgment as of the date of \n     enactment or resulting from a claim for coverage or \n     reimbursement pending as of such date, shall be as specified \n     in such agreement or judgment with regard to erosion \n     applicable to such insurance participants' policies.\n\n       (ii) Remaining limits.--To the extent that a final \n     nonappealable judgment or settlement agreement to which an \n     insurer participant and a defendant participant are parties \n     in effect as of the date of enactment of this Act \n     extinguished a defendant participant's right to seek coverage \n     for asbestos claims under an insurer participant's policies, \n     any remaining limits in such policies shall not be considered \n     to be remaining aggregate products limits under subsection \n     (a)(1)(A).\n       (4) Payments by defendant participant.--Payments made by a \n     defendant participant shall be deemed to erode, exhaust, or \n     otherwise satisfy applicable self-insured retentions, \n     deductibles, retrospectively rated premiums, and limits \n     issued by nonparticipating insolvent or captive insurance \n     companies. Reduction of remaining aggregate limits under this \n     subsection shall not limit the right of a defendant \n     participant to collect from any insurer not a participant.\n       (5) Effect on other insurance claims.--Other than as \n     specified in this subsection, this Act does not alter, \n     change, modify, or affect insurance for claims other than \n     asbestos claims.\n       (b) Dispute Resolution Procedure.--\n       (1) Arbitration.--The parties to a dispute regarding the \n     erosion of insurance coverage limits under this section may \n     agree in writing to settle such dispute by arbitration. Any \n     such provision or agreement shall be valid, irrevocable, and \n     enforceable, except for any grounds that exist at law or in \n     equity for revocation of a contract.\n       (2) Title 9, united states code.--Arbitration of such \n     disputes, awards by arbitrators, and confirmation of awards \n     shall be governed by title 9, United States Code, to the \n     extent such title is not inconsistent with this section. In \n     any such arbitration proceeding, the erosion principles \n     provided for under this section shall be binding on the \n     arbitrator, unless the parties agree to the contrary.\n       (3) Final and binding award.--An award by an arbitrator \n     shall be final and binding between the parties to the \n     arbitration, but shall have no force or effect on any other \n     person. The parties to an arbitration may agree that in the \n     event a policy which is the subject matter of an award is \n     subsequently determined to be eroded in a manner different \n     from the manner determined by the arbitration in a judgment \n     rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction from which no \n     appeal can or has been taken, such arbitration award may be \n     modified by any court of competent jurisdiction upon \n     application by any party to the arbitration. Any such \n     modification shall govern the rights and obligations between \n     such parties after the date of such modification.\n       (c) Effect on Nonparticipants.--\n       (1) In general.--No insurance company or reinsurance \n     company that is not a participant, other than a captive \n     insurer, shall be entitled to claim that payments to the Fund \n     erode, exhaust, or otherwise limit the nonparticipant's \n     insurance or reinsurance obligations.\n       (2) Other claims.--Nothing in this Act shall preclude a \n     participant from pursuing any claim for insurance or \n     reinsurance from any person that is not a participant other \n     than a captive insurer.\n       (d) Finite Risk Policies Not Affected.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, this Act shall not alter, affect or impair any \n     rights or obligations of--\n       (A) any party to an insurance contract that expressly \n     provides coverage for governmental charges or assessments \n     imposed to replace insurance or reinsurance liabilities in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act; or\n       (B) subject to paragraph (2), any person with respect to \n     any insurance or reinsurance purchased by a participant after \n     December 31, 1996, that expressly (but not necessarily \n     exclusively) provides coverage for asbestos liabilities, \n     including those policies commonly referred to as ``finite \n     risk'' policies.\n       (2) Limitation.--No person may assert that any amounts paid \n     to the Fund in accordance with this Act are covered by any \n     policy described under paragraph (1)(B) purchased by a \n     defendant participant, unless such policy specifically \n     provides coverage for required payments to a Federal trust \n     fund established by a Federal statute to resolve asbestos \n     injury claims.\n       (e) Effect on Certain Insurance and Reinsurance Claims.--\n       (1) No coverage for fund assessments.--No participant or \n     captive insurer may pursue an insurance or reinsurance claim \n     against another participant or captive insurer for payments \n     to the Fund required under this Act, except under a contract \n     specifically providing insurance or reinsurance for required \n     payments to a Federal trust fund established by a Federal \n     statute to resolve asbestos injury claims or, where \n     applicable, under finite risk policies under subsection (d).\n       (2) Certain insurance assignments voided.--Any assignment \n     of any rights to insurance coverage for asbestos claims to \n     any person who has asserted an asbestos claim before the \n     effective date, or to any trust, person, or other entity not \n     part of an affiliated group as defined in section 201(1) of \n     this Act established or appointed for the purpose of paying \n     asbestos claims which were asserted before the effective \n     date, or by any Tier I defendant participant shall be null \n     and void. This subsection shall not void or affect in any way \n     any assignments of rights to insurance coverage other than to \n     asbestos claimants or to trusts, persons, or other entities \n     not part of an affiliated group as defined in section 201(1) \n     of this Act established or appointed for the purpose of \n     paying asbestos claims, or by Tier I defendant participants.\n       (3) Insurance claims preserved.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, this Act shall not alter, affect, or \n     impair any rights or obligations of any person with respect \n     to any insurance or reinsurance for amounts that any person \n     pays, has paid, or becomes legally obligated to pay in \n     respect of asbestos or other claims, except to the extent \n     that--\n       (A) such person pays or becomes legally obligated to pay \n     claims that are superseded by section 403;\n       (B) any such rights or obligations of such person with \n     respect to insurance or reinsurance are prohibited by \n     paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (e); or\n       (C) the limits of insurance otherwise available to such \n     participant in respect of asbestos claims are deemed to be \n     eroded under subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 405. ADDITIONAL FUNDING OR RETURN TO COURT.\n\n       (a) Verification of Unanticipated Claims.--\n       (1) In general.--If the number of claims that qualify for \n     compensation under a claim level exceed 115 percent of the \n     number of claims expected to qualify for compensation under \n     that claim level or designation in the 2004 Congressional \n     Budget Office estimate of asbestos-injury claims, or the Fund \n     otherwise is projected to be unable to pay all qualified \n     claims in any year in the future, the Chief Executive Officer \n     shall conduct a review of a statistically significant sample \n     of claims qualifying for compensation under the appropriate \n     claim level or designation.\n       (2) Determinations.--\n       (A) In general.--The Chief Executive Officer's review shall \n     examine the best available medical evidence in order to \n     determine which one of the following is true:\n       (i) Without a significant number of exceptions, all of the \n     claimants who qualified for compensation under the claim \n     level or designation suffer from an injury or disease that \n     was caused by occupational exposure to asbestos.\n       (ii) A significant number of claimants who qualified for \n     compensation under the claim level or designation do not \n     suffer from an injury or disease that was caused by \n     occupational exposure to asbestos.\n       (B) Future claims.--If the Chief Executive Officer projects \n     that the Fund will be unable to pay all qualified claims in \n     any year in the future, the Chief Executive Officer shall \n     also determine whether the Fund lacks the resources to pay \n     all qualified claimants over the life of the Fund.\n       (C) Final determination.--The final determination of the \n     Chief Executive Officer under this paragraph shall be made in \n     accordance with notice and comment under subchapter II of \n     chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code (commonly referred \n     to as the Administrative Procedure Act).\n       (b) Judicial Review of Chief Executive Officer Verification \n     of Claims.--The Chief Executive Officer's determination that \n     either subparagraph (A) or (B) in paragraph (2) of subsection \n     (a) is true shall be subject to judicial review in the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. \n     Review may be sought by any interested party. The review \n     shall be conducted in accordance with the standards and \n     procedures of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code \n     (commonly referred to as the Administrative Procedure Act), \n     except that all findings based on medical science shall be \n     reviewed de novo.\n       (c) Additional Trust-Fund Assessments or Return to Court.--\n       (1) Additional assessments against defendant \n     participants.--\n       (A) Definition.--In this paragraph the term ``nonbankruptcy \n     defendant participant'' means a defendant participant that \n     has not entered into a final confirmed plan\n\n[[Page S1229]]\n\n     of reorganization under section 524(g) of title 11, United \n     States Code.\n       (B) Additional assessments.--\n       (i) In general.--The Chief Executive Officer shall make a \n     recommendation under clause (ii), if the United States Court \n     of Appeals finds as a result of its review under subsection \n     (b) that--\n\n       (I) without a significant number of exceptions, all of the \n     claimants who qualified for compensation under the claim \n     level or designation under review suffer from an injury or \n     disease that is caused by occupational exposure to asbestos; \n     or\n       (II) the Fund lacks the resources necessary to pay all \n     qualified claimants at the present time, and the Chief \n     Executive Officer projects that the Fund will remain unable \n     to pay all qualified claimants over the life of the Fund.\n\n       (ii) Recommendations.--If the United States Court of \n     Appeals makes a finding under subclause (I) or (II) of clause \n     (i), the Chief Executive Officer shall recommend to Congress \n     that it enact--\n\n       (I) additional assessments against all nonbankruptcy \n     defendant participants, in accordance with each nonbankruptcy \n     defendant participant's relative prior assessments (taking \n     into account hardship and inequity reductions), in an amount \n     necessary to allow the Fund to compensate all qualified \n     claimants; or\n       (II) an expansion of the Fund's borrowing authority, by an \n     amount necessary to allow the Fund to compensate all \n     qualified claimants.\n\n       (2) Expedited congressional action on limited additional \n     assessments or borrowing.--Either of the following shall \n     constitute a modification of the Fund that shall be submitted \n     by the Chief Executive Officer to Congress in the appropriate \n     form for expedited action under title V:\n       (A) A recommendation of additional assessments that does \n     not exceed a defendant participant's original assessment \n     obligation by more than 10 percent, if no additional \n     assessment has been imposed by Congress within the previous 5 \n     years.\n       (B) A recommendation to expand borrowing authority by no \n     more than $5,000,000,000.\n       (3) Return to court.--\n       (A) In general.--If Congress declines to enact within 1 \n     year after the date of the recommendation made by the Chief \n     Executive Officer under paragraph (1)(B), and the Chief \n     Executive Officer again determines that the Fund lacks the \n     resources necessary to pay all qualified claimants at the \n     present time, and the Chief Executive Officer continues to \n     project that the Fund will remain unable to pay all qualified \n     claimants over the life of the Fund, any individual who \n     qualifies for compensation under the Fund may file a civil \n     action in United States District Court against any defendant \n     participant to obtain relief for injuries suffered as a \n     result of exposure to asbestos.\n       (B) Exclusive remedy and limitations.--\n       (i) In general.--As of the effective date of a return to \n     court authorized by this paragraph, an action under this \n     paragraph shall be the exclusive remedy for any asbestos \n     claim that might otherwise exist under Federal, State, or \n     other law, regardless of whether such claim arose before or \n     after the effective date of this Act or of the return to \n     court, except that claims against the Fund that have \n     qualified for compensation and remain eligible for \n     compensation under subparagraph (F) may be paid by the Fund. \n     The applicable statute of limitations for a claim brought \n     under this paragraph is 2 years after the asbestos injury or \n     disease was diagnosed or the claimant had discovered facts \n     that would have led a reasonable person to obtain such a \n     diagnosis, except that claimants who filed a claim against \n     the Fund under this Act before the return to court shall have \n     2 years after the date of the return to court to file an \n     action under this paragraph, whichever is longer.\n       (ii) Limitation.--An individual who has received or is \n     entitled to receive an award from the Fund may not bring an \n     action under this paragraph, except--\n\n       (I) an individual who received an award for a nonmalignant \n     disease (Levels I through V) from the Fund may assert a claim \n     for a malignant disease under this paragraph, unless the \n     malignancy was diagnosed or the claimant had discovered facts \n     that would have led a reasonable person to obtain such a \n     diagnosis before the date on which the nonmalignant claim was \n     settled; and\n       (II) an individual who received an award for a nonmalignant \n     or malignant disease (except mesothelioma) (Levels I through \n     VI) from the Fund may assert a claim for mesothelioma under \n     this paragraph, unless the mesothelioma was diagnosed or the \n     claimant had discovered facts that would have led a \n     reasonable person to obtain such a diagnosis before the date \n     on which the nonmalignant or other malignant claim was \n     settled.\n\n       (C) Limits on attorneys' fees.--\n       (i) In general.--In any action permitted under subparagraph \n     (B), notwithstanding any contract, the representative of an \n     individual may not receive, for services rendered in \n     connection with an action permitted under subparagraph (A), \n     more than 20 percent of a final award made as a result of \n     such action.\n       (ii) Reasonable fee for work actually and reasonably \n     performed.--In addition to the limitation specified in clause \n     (i), a representative of an individual may not receive a fee \n     unless--\n\n       (I) the representative submits to the court appropriately \n     detailed billing documentation for the work actually \n     performed in the course of representation of the individual; \n     and\n       (II) the court finds that the fee to be awarded is for work \n     actually and reasonably performed on behalf of the claimant \n     does not exceed 200 percent of a reasonable hourly fee for \n     such work.\n\n       (D) Continued funding.--If asbestos claims are returned to \n     court under subparagraph (A), participants shall remain \n     required to make payments as provided under subtitles A and B \n     of title II. The Fund shall pay all claims under Levels VI, \n     and VII, that were found to qualify for compensation before \n     the date of a return to court under subparagraph (A). If the \n     full amount of payments required under title II is not \n     necessary for the Fund to pay claims that remain entitled to \n     compensation, pay the Fund's debt, and support the Fund's \n     continued operation as needed to pay such claims and debt, \n     the Chief Executive Officer may reduce such payments. Any \n     such reductions shall be allocated among participants in the \n     same proportion as the liability under subtitles A and B of \n     title II.\n       (d) Correction of Inappropriate Claims Criteria.--If the \n     United States Court of Appeals finds as a result of its \n     review under subsection (b) that a significant number the \n     claimants who qualified for compensation under the claim \n     level under review do not suffer from an injury or disease \n     that was caused by occupational exposure to asbestos, the \n     Chief Executive Officer shall correct the compensation \n     criteria in order to exclude from eligibility for \n     compensation all such claims.\n       (e) Judicial Review of Chief Executive Officer \n     Corrections.--The Chief Executive Officer's correction of \n     compensation criteria under subsection (d) shall become \n     effective upon the conclusion of final, unappealable judicial \n     review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District \n     of Columbia Circuit. Review may be sought by any interested \n     party. The review shall be conducted under the standards and \n     procedures of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, \n     except that all findings based on medical science shall be \n     reviewed de novo, and the Chief Executive Officer's \n     corrections shall be reviewed to determine that the \n     corrections are reasonably tailored to achieve the result \n     required by this section. The Court may order such relief as \n     is necessary to achieve the results required by this section.\n       (f) Temporary Stay of Unanticipated Claims.--The Chief \n     Executive Officer shall stay payment of claims for a claim \n     level that results in or is subject to review under \n     subsection (a) pending such review and the collection of \n     additional assessments or the correction of compensation \n     criteria.\n       (g) Report.--The Chief Executive Officer shall submit an \n     annual report to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate \n     and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives on the operation of the Asbestos Injury \n     Claims Resolution Fund within 6 months after the close of \n     each fiscal year.\n       (h) Contents of Report.--The annual report submitted under \n     this subsection shall include an analysis of--\n       (1) the claims experience of the program during the most \n     recent fiscal year, including--\n       (A) the number of claims made to the Corporation and a \n     description of the types of medical diagnoses and asbestos \n     exposures underlying those claims;\n       (B) the number of claims denied by the Corporation and a \n     description of the types of medical diagnoses and asbestos \n     exposures underlying those claims, and a general description \n     of the reasons for their denial;\n       (C) a summary of the eligibility determinations made by the \n     Corporation under section 114;\n       (D) a summary of the awards made from the Fund, including \n     the amount of the awards; and\n       (E) for each eligible condition, a statement of the \n     percentage of asbestos claimants who filed claims during the \n     prior calendar year and were determined to be eligible to \n     receive compensation under this Act, who have received the \n     compensation to which such claimants are entitled according \n     to section 131;\n       (2) the administrative performance of the program, \n     including--\n       (A) the performance of the program in meeting the time \n     limits prescribed by law and an analysis of the reasons for \n     any systemic delays;\n       (B) any backlogs of claims that may exist and an \n     explanation of the reasons for such backlogs;\n       (C) the costs to the Fund of administering the program; and\n       (D) any other significant factors bearing on the efficiency \n     of the program;\n       (3) the financial condition of the Fund, including--\n       (A) statements of the Fund's revenues, expenses, assets, \n     and liabilities;\n       (B) the identity of all participants, the funding \n     allocations of each participant, and the total amounts of all \n     payments to the Fund;\n       (C) a list of all financial hardship or inequity \n     adjustments applied for during the fiscal year, and the \n     adjustments that were made during the fiscal year;\n       (D) a statement of the investments of the Fund; and\n       (E) a statement of the borrowings of the Fund; and\n\n[[Page S1230]]\n\n       (4) a summary of prosecutions under section 1348 of title \n     18, United States Code (as added by this Act).\n       (i) Injunction After Confirmation of Bankruptcy Plan of \n     Reorganization.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 524(g)(2)(B)(ii) (IV)(bb) of title \n     11, United States Code, is amended by inserting after \n     ``plan'' the following: ``, or, if such a vote is not \n     obtained with respect to any such class of claimants so \n     established, the plan satisfies the requirements for \n     confirmation of a plan under section 1129(b) that would apply \n     to such class if the class did not accept the plan for \n     purposes of section 1129(a)(8) (whether or not the class has \n     accepted the plan)''.\n       (2) Effective date; application.--The amendment made by \n     paragraph (1) shall take effect on the date of enactment of \n     this Act, and shall apply with respect to cases under title \n     11 of the United States Code, which were commenced before, \n     on, or after such date.\n\n     SEC. 406.

Mr. CORNYN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed to \namendment SA 2746 proposed by Mr. Frist (for Mr. Specter (for himself \nand Mr. Leahy)) to the bill S. 852, to create a fair and efficient \nsystem to resolve claims of victims for bodily injury caused by \nasbestos exposure, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on \nthe table; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness \n     in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2006'' or the ``FAIR Act \n     of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Millions of Americans have been exposed to forms of \n     asbestos that can have devastating health effects.\n       (2) Various injuries can be caused by exposure to some \n     forms of asbestos, including pleural disease and some forms \n     of cancer.\n       (3) The injuries caused by asbestos can have latency \n     periods of up to 40 years, and even limited exposure to some \n     forms of asbestos may result in injury in some cases.\n       (4) Asbestos litigation has had a significant detrimental \n     effect on the country's economy, driving companies into \n     bankruptcy, diverting resources from those who are truly \n     sick, and endangering jobs and pensions.\n       (5) The scope of the asbestos litigation crisis cuts across \n     every State and virtually every industry.\n       (6) The United States Supreme Court has recognized that \n     Congress must act to create a more rational asbestos claims \n     system. In 1991, a Judicial Conference Ad Hoc Committee on \n     Asbestos Litigation, appointed by Chief Justice William \n     Rehnquist, found that the ``ultimate solution should be \n     legislation recognizing the national proportions of the \n     problem . . . and creating a national asbestos dispute \n     resolution scheme . . .''. The Court found in 1997 in Amchem \n     Products Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 595 (1997), that \n     ``[t]he argument is sensibly made that a nationwide \n     administrative claims processing regime would provide the \n     most secure, fair, and efficient means of compensating \n     victims of asbestos exposure.'' In 1999, the Court in Ortiz \n     v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 819, 821 (1999), found that the \n     ``elephantine mass of asbestos cases . . . defies customary \n     judicial administration and calls for national legislation.'' \n     That finding was again recognized in 2003 by the Court in \n     Norfolk & Western Railway Co. v. Ayers, 123 S. Ct. 1210 \n     (2003).\n       (7) This crisis, and its significant effect on the health \n     and welfare of the people of the United States, on interstate \n     and foreign commerce, and on the bankruptcy system, compels \n     Congress to exercise its power to regulate interstate \n     commerce and create this legislative solution in the form of \n     a national asbestos injury claims resolution program to \n     supersede all existing methods to compensate those injured by \n     asbestos, except as specified in this Act.\n       (8) This crisis has also imposed a deleterious burden upon \n     the United States bankruptcy courts, which have assumed a \n     heavy burden of administering complicated and protracted \n     bankruptcies with limited personnel.\n       (9) This crisis has devastated many communities across the \n     country, but hardest hit has been Libby, Montana, where \n     tremolite asbestos, one of the most deadly forms of asbestos, \n     was contained in the vermiculite ore mined from the area and \n     despite ongoing cleanup by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, many still suffer from the deadly dust.\n       (10) The asbestos found in Libby, Montana, tremolite \n     asbestos, has demonstrated an unusually high level of \n     toxicity, as compared to chrysotile asbestos. Diseases \n     contracted from this tremolite asbestos are unique and highly \n     progressive. These diseases typically manifest in a \n     characteristic pleural disease pattern, and often result in \n     severe impairment or death without radiographic interstitial \n     disease or typical chrysotile markers of radiographic \n     severity. According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and \n     Disease Registry previous studies by the National Institutes \n     of Occupational Safety and Health document significantly \n     increased rates of pulmonary abnormalities and disease \n     (asbestosis and lung cancer) among former workers.\n       (11) Environmental Protection Agency supported studies have \n     determined that the raw vermiculite ore mined and milled in \n     Libby, Montana contained 21 to 26 percent asbestos, by \n     weight. The milled ore, resulting from the processing in \n     Libby, which was shipped out of Libby contained markedly \n     reduced percentages of asbestos. A 1982 Environmental \n     Protection Agency-supported study concluded that ore shipped \n     out of Libby contained 0.3 to 7 percent asbestos, by weight.\n       (12) In Libby, Montana, exposure pathways are and were not \n     limited to the workplace, rather, for decades there has been \n     an unprecedented 24 hour per day contamination of the \n     community's homes, playgrounds, gardens, and community air, \n     such that the entire\n\n[[Page S1232]]\n\n     community of Libby, Montana, has been designated a Superfund \n     site and is listed on the Environmental Protection Agency's \n     National Priorities List.\n       (13) These multiple exposure pathways have caused severe \n     asbestos disease and death not only in former workers at the \n     mine and milling facilities, but also in the workers' spouses \n     and children, and in community members who had no direct \n     contact with the mine. According to the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, some potentially important alternative \n     pathways for past asbestos exposure include elevated \n     concentrations of asbestos in ambient air and recreational \n     exposures from children playing in piles of vermiculite. \n     Furthermore, the Environmental Protection Agency has \n     determined that current potential pathways of exposure \n     include vermiculite placed in walls and attics as thermal \n     insulation, vermiculite or ore used as road bed material, ore \n     used as ornamental landscaping, and vermiculite or \n     concentrated ore used as a soil and garden amendment or \n     aggregate in driveways.\n       (14) The Environmental Protection Agency also concluded, \n     ``Asbestos contamination exists in a number of potential \n     source materials at multiple locations in and around the \n     residential and commercial area of Libby. . . While data are \n     not yet sufficient to perform reliable human-health risk \n     evaluations for all sources and all types of disturbance, it \n     is apparent that releases of fiber concentrations higher than \n     Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards may \n     occur in some cases . . . and that screening-level estimates \n     of lifetime excess cancer risk can exceed the upper-bound \n     risk range of 1E-04 usually used by the Environmental \n     Protection Agency for residents under a variety of exposure \n     scenarios. The occurrence of non-occupational asbestos-\n     related disease that has been observed among Libby residents \n     is extremely unusual, and has not been associated with \n     asbestos mines elsewhere, suggesting either very high and \n     prolonged environmental exposures and/or increased toxicity \n     of this form of amphibole asbestos.''.\n       (15) According to a November 2003 article from the Journal \n     Environmental Health Perspectives titled, Radiographic \n     Abnormalities and Exposure to Asbestos-Contaminated \n     Vermiculite in the Community of Libby, Montana, USA, Libby \n     residents who have evidence of ``no apparent exposure'', \n     i.e., did not work with asbestos, were not a family member of \n     a former worker, etc., had a greater rate of pleural \n     abnormalities (6.7 percent) than did those in control groups \n     or general populations found in other studies from other \n     states (which ranged from 0.2 percent to 4.6 percent). \n     ``Given the ubiquitous nature of vermiculite contamination in \n     Libby, along with historical evidence of elevated asbestos \n     concentrations in the air, it would be difficult to find \n     participants who could be characterized as unexposed.''.\n       (16) Nothing in this Act is intended to increase the \n     Federal deficit or impose any burden on the taxpayer. The \n     Office of Asbestos Disease Compensation established under \n     this Act shall be privately funded by annual payments from \n     defendant participants that have been subject to asbestos \n     liability and their insurers. Section 406(b) of this Act \n     expressly provides that nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to create any obligation of funding from the United \n     States or to require the United States to satisfy any claims \n     if the amounts in the Fund are inadequate. Any borrowing by \n     the Fund is limited to monies expected to be paid into the \n     Fund, and the Administrator shall have no fiscal authority \n     beyond the amount of private money coming into the Fund. This \n     Act provides the Administrator with broad enforcement \n     authority to pursue debts to the Fund owed by defendant \n     participants or insurer participants and their successors in \n     interest.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to--\n       (1) create a privately funded, publicly administered fund \n     to provide the necessary resources for a fair and efficient \n     system to resolve asbestos injury claims that will provide \n     compensation for legitimate present and future claimants of \n     asbestos exposure as provided in this Act;\n       (2) provide compensation to those present and future \n     victims based on the severity of their injuries, while \n     establishing a system flexible enough to accommodate \n     individuals whose conditions worsen;\n       (3) relieve the Federal and State courts of the burden of \n     the asbestos litigation; and\n       (4) increase economic stability by resolving the asbestos \n     litigation crisis that has bankrupted companies with asbestos \n     liability, diverted resources from the truly sick, and \n     endangered jobs and pensions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

At the hearing, the claimant shall be entitled \n     to present oral evidence and written testimony in further \n     support of that claim.\n       (B) Conduct of hearing.--When practicable, the hearing will \n     be set at a time and place convenient for the claimant. In \n     conducting the hearing, the representative of the \n     Administrator shall not be bound by common law or statutory \n     rules of evidence, by technical or formal rules of procedure, \n     or by section 554 of title 5, United States Code, except as \n     provided by this Act, but shall conduct the hearing in such \n     manner as to best ascertain the rights of the claimant. For \n     this purpose, the representative shall receive\n\n[[Page S1238]]\n\n     such relevant evidence as the claimant adduces and such other \n     evidence as the representative determines necessary or useful \n     in evaluating the claim.\n       (C) Request for subpoenas.--\n       (i) In general.--A claimant may request a subpoena but the \n     decision to grant or deny such a request is within the \n     discretion of the representative of the Administrator.

If such decision materially differs from the \n     proposed decision, the claimant shall be entitled to review \n     of the decision under subsection (d).\n       (2) Time and content.--If the claimant requests review of \n     all or part of the proposed decision the Administrator shall \n     issue a final decision on the claim not later than 180 days \n     after the request for review is received, if the claimant \n     requests a hearing, or not later than 90 days after the \n     request for review is received, if the claimant requests \n     review of the written record. Such decision shall be in \n     writing and contain findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n       (f) Representation.--A claimant may authorize an attorney \n     or other individual to represent him or her in any proceeding \n     under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 115.

Such a \n     bankrupt business entity may continue to so proceed, if--\n       (A) on request of a party in interest or on a motion of the \n     court, and after a notice and a hearing, the bankruptcy court \n     presiding over the chapter 11 case of the bankrupt business \n     entity determines that such confirmation is required to avoid \n     the liquidation or the need for further financial \n     reorganization of that entity; and\n       (B) an order confirming the plan of reorganization is \n     entered by the bankruptcy court within 9 months after the \n     date of enactment of this Act or such longer period of time \n     approved by the bankruptcy court for cause shown.\n       (3) Applicability.--If the bankruptcy court does not make \n     the determination required under paragraph (2), or if an \n     order confirming the plan is not entered within 9 months \n     after the date of enactment of this Act or such longer period \n     of time approved by the bankruptcy court for cause shown, the \n     provisions of this Act shall apply to the bankrupt business \n     entity notwithstanding the certification. Any timely appeal \n     under title 11, United States Code, from a confirmation order \n     entered during the applicable time period shall automatically \n     extend the time during which this Act is inapplicable to the \n     bankrupt business entity, until the appeal is fully and \n     finally resolved.\n       (4) Offsets.--\n       (A) Payments by insurers.--To the extent that a bankrupt \n     business entity or debtor successfully confirms a plan of \n     reorganization, including a trust, and channeling injunction \n     that involves payments by insurers who are otherwise subject \n     to this Act as described under section 524(g) of title 11, \n     United States Code, an insurer who makes payments to the \n     trust shall obtain a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the \n     amount otherwise payable by that insurer under this Act to \n     the Fund.\n       (B) Contributions to fund.--Any cash payments by a bankrupt \n     business entity, if any, to a trust described under section \n     524(g) of title 11, United States Code, may be counted as a \n     contribution to the Fund.\n       (d) Tiers II Through VI.--Except as provided in section 204 \n     and subsection (b) of this section, persons or affiliated \n     groups are included in Tier II, III, IV, V, or VI, according \n     to the prior asbestos expenditures paid by such persons or \n     affiliated groups as follows:\n       (1) Tier II: $75,000,000 or greater.\n       (2) Tier III: $50,000,000 or greater, but less than \n     $75,000,000.\n       (3) Tier IV: $10,000,000 or greater, but less than \n     $50,000,000.\n       (4) Tier V: $5,000,000 or greater, but less than \n     $10,000,000.\n       (5) Tier VI: $1,000,000 or greater, but less than \n     $5,000,000.\n       (6) Asbestos premises defendant participants.--\n       (A) In general.--Asbestos premises defendant participants \n     that would be included in Tier II, III, IV or V according to \n     their\n\n[[Page S1244]]\n\n     prior asbestos expenditures shall, after 5 years of the Fund \n     being operational, instead be assigned to the immediately \n     lower tier, such that--\n       (i) an asbestos premises defendant participant that would \n     be assigned to Tier II shall instead be assigned to Tier III;\n       (ii) an asbestos premises defendant participant that would \n     be assigned to Tier III shall instead be assigned to Tier IV;\n       (iii) an asbestos premises defendant participant that would \n     be assigned to Tier IV shall instead be assigned to Tier V;

ASSESSMENT ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Each defendant participant or affiliated \n     group shall pay to the Fund in the amounts provided under \n     this subtitle as appropriate for its tier and subtier each \n     year until the earlier to occur of the following:\n       (1) The participant or affiliated group has satisfied its \n     obligations under this subtitle during the 30 annual payment \n     cycles of the operation of the Fund.\n       (2) The amount received by the Fund from defendant \n     participants, excluding any amounts rebated to defendant \n     participants under subsections (e) and (n), equals the \n     maximum aggregate payment obligation of section 202(a)(2).\n       (b) Small Business Exemption.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this subtitle, a person or affiliated group that \n     is a small business concern (as defined under section 3 of \n     the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632)), on December 31, \n     2002, is exempt from any payment requirement under this \n     subtitle and shall not be included in the subtier allocations \n     under section 203.\n       (c) Limitation.--\n       (1) In General.--Under expedited procedures established by \n     the Administrator, any defendant participant may apply for a \n     limitation on its annual payment obligation to\n\n[[Page S1246]]\n\n     the Fund by showing that it qualifies under subparagraph (3), \n     and the Administrator shall promptly grant such application \n     if the standards in subparagraph (3) are satisfied.\n       (2) Stay of Payment.--A defendant participant who applies \n     for a limitation on its annual payment obligation to the Fund \n     under subparagraph (1) shall have the payment required under \n     subsection (i)(1)(A)(iv) stayed until the Administrator has \n     made a determination with respect to the application of such \n     defendant participant.\n       (3) Application for Limitation.--A defendant participant \n     may apply under subparagraph (A) for a limit on its annual \n     payment obligation to the Fund if:\n       (A) it is included in Tiers II, III, IV, V, or VI under \n     section 202; and\n       (B) its prior asbestos expenditures are less than $200 \n     million and its revenues as defined in this section are less \n     than $10 Billion.\n       (4) Limitation.--Such qualifying defendant participant may \n     apply for the limit set forth in either clause (A), (B) or \n     (C), provided that it may apply only under one such clause \n     and may not change its application once the application has \n     been approved by the Administrator. A defendant participant \n     qualifying under this subparagraph may apply for a limit on \n     its annual payment obligation to the Fund to an amount equal \n     to--\n       (A) 125 percent of the arithmetical average for fiscal \n     years 1998 through 2002 of such defendant participant's \n     annual prior asbestos expenditures; or\n       (B) 150 percent of the arithmetical average for fiscal \n     years 1998 through 2002 of such defendant participant's \n     annual prior asbestos expenditures, excluding (I) the amount \n     of any payments by insurance carriers for the benefit of such \n     defendant participant or on behalf of such defendant \n     participant, and (II) any reimbursements of the amounts \n     actually paid by such defendant participant with respect to \n     prior asbestos expenditures for fiscal years 1998 through \n     2002, regardless of when such reimbursements were actually \n     paid; or\n       (C) 1.67024 percent of the revenues for the most recent \n     fiscal year ending on or prior to December 31, 2002, of the \n     affiliated group to which such defendant participant belongs.\n       (5) Judicial review. A defendant participant who is \n     aggrieved by the denial by the Administrator or its \n     application under this paragraph is entitled to judicial \n     review under section 303, and during the pendency of such \n     review, section 223(a) shall not apply to that defendant \n     participant. Without regard to section 305(a), the reviewing \n     court may, in its discretion, provide such interlocutory \n     relief to the defendant participant as may be just.\n       (6) Applicability of the guarantee surcharge.--A defendant \n     participant whose application for a limitation on its annual \n     payment obligation to the Fund under subparagraph (A) is \n     approved by the Administrator, shall not be exempt from the \n     guaranteed payment surcharge established under subsection (1) \n     unless otherwise provided in this Act.\n       (7) Minimum payment.--Notwithstanding the limitations \n     provided in this subsection, a defendant participant that is \n     granted a limitation by the Administrator shall pay no less \n     than 5 percent of the amount the participant is scheduled to \n     pay under section 202.\n       (d) Adjustments.--\n       (1) In general.--Under expedited procedures established by \n     the Administrator, a defendant participant may seek \n     adjustment of the amount of its payment obligation based on \n     severe financial hardship or demonstrated inequity. The \n     Administrator may determine whether to grant an adjustment, \n     in accordance with this subsection. A defendant participant \n     has a right to obtain a rehearing of the Administrator's \n     determination under this subsection under the procedures \n     prescribed in subsection (i)(10). The Administrator may \n     adjust a defendant participant's payment obligations under \n     this subsection, either by forgiving the relevant portion of \n     the otherwise applicable payment obligation or by providing \n     relevant rebates from the defendant hardship and inequity \n     adjustment account created under subsection (j) after payment \n     of the otherwise applicable payment obligation, at the \n     discretion of the Administrator.\n       (2) Financial hardship adjustments.--\n       (A) In general.--Any defendant participant in any tier may \n     apply for an adjustment under this paragraph at any time \n     during the period in which a payment obligation to the Funds \n     remains outstanding any may qualify for such an adjustment by \n     demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Administrator that \n     the amount of its payment obligation would materially and \n     adversely affect the defendant participant's ability to \n     continue its business and to pay or satisfy its debts \n     generally as and when they come due. Such an adjustment shall \n     be in an amount that in the judgment of the Administrator is \n     reasonably necessary to prevent such material and adverse \n     effect on the defendant participant's ability to continue its \n     business and to pay or satisfy its debts generally as and \n     when they come due.\n       (B) Factors to consider.--In determining whether to make an \n     adjustment under subparagraph (A) and the amount thereof, the \n     Administrator shall consider--\n       (1) the financial situation of the defendant participant \n     and its affiliated group as shown in historical audited \n     financial statements, including income statement, balance \n     sheet, and statement of cash flow, for the three fiscal years \n     ending immediately prior to the application and projected \n     financial statements for the three fiscal years following the \n     application;\n       (2) an analysis of capital spending and fixed charge \n     coverage on a historical basis for the three fiscal years \n     immediately proceeding a defendant participant's application \n     and for the three fiscal years following the application;\n       (3) any payments or transfers of property made, or \n     obligations incurred, within the preceding 6 years by the \n     defendant participant to or for the benefit of any insider as \n     defined under section 101(31) of title 11 of the United \n     States Code or any affiliate as defined under section 101(2) \n     of title 11 of the United States Code;\n       (4) any prior extraordinary transactions within the \n     preceding 6 years involving the defendant participant, \n     including without limitation payments or extraordinary \n     salaries, bonuses, or dividends;\n       (5) the defendant participant's ability to satisfy its \n     payment obligations to the Fund by borrowing or financing \n     with equity capital, or through issuance of securities of the \n     defendant participant or its affiliated group to the Fund;\n       (6) the defendant participant's ability to delay \n     discretionary capital spending; and\n       (7) any other factor that the Administrator considers \n     relevant.\n       (C) Term.--A financial hardship adjustment under this \n     paragraph shall have a term of 5 years unless the \n     Administrator determines at the time the adjustment is made \n     that a shorter or longer period is appropriate in the light \n     of the financial condition of the defendant participant and \n     its affiliated group and other relevant factors, provided \n     that a financial hardship adjustment under this paragraph \n     shall terminate automatically in the event that the defendant \n     participant holding the adjustment files a petition under \n     title 11, United States Code.\n       (D) Renewal.--A defendant participant may renew a hardship \n     adjustment upon expiration by demonstrating that it remains \n     justified. Such renewed hardship adjustments shall have a \n     term of 5 years unless the Administrator determines at the \n     time of the renewed adjustment that a shorter or longer \n     period is appropriate in the light of the financial condition \n     of the defendant participant and its affiliated group and \n     other relevant factors, provided that a renewed financial \n     hardship adjustment under this paragraph shall terminate \n     automatically in the event that the defendant participant \n     holding the adjustment files a petition under title 11, \n     United States Code.\n       (E) Procedure.--\n       (1) The Administrator shall prescribe the information to be \n     submitted in applications for adjustments under this \n     paragraph.\n       (2) All audited financial information required under this \n     paragraph shall be as reported by the defendant participant \n     in its annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of \n     1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). Any defendant participant that \n     does not file reports with the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission or which does not have audited financial \n     statements shall submit financial statements prepared \n     pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles. The \n     chairman, chief executive officer, and chief financial \n     officer of the defendant participant shall certify under \n     penalty of law the completeness and accuracy of the financial \n     statements provided under this sub-paragraph.\n       (3) The chairman, chief executive officer, and chief \n     financial officer of the defendant participant shall certify \n     that any projected information and\n       (3) Inequity adjustments.--\n       (A) In general.--A defendant participant--\n       (i) may qualify for an adjustment based on inequity by \n     demonstrating that the amount of its payment obligation under \n     the statutory allocation is exceptionally inequitable--\n\n       (I) when measured against the amount of the likely cost to \n     the defendant participant net of insurance of its future \n     liability in the tort system in the absence of the Fund;\n       (II) when measured against the likely cost of past and \n     potential future claims in the absence of this Act;\n       (III) when compared to the median payment rate for all \n     defendant participants in the same tier; or\n       (IV) when measured against the percentage of the prior \n     asbestos expenditures of the defendant that were incurred \n     with respect to claims that neither resulted in an adverse \n     judgment against the defendant, nor were the subject of a \n     settlement that required a payment to a plaintiff by or on \n     behalf of that defendant;\n\n       (ii) shall be granted a two-tier main tier and a two-tier \n     subtier adjustment reducing the defendant participant's \n     payment obligation based on inequity by demonstrating that \n     not less than 95 percent of such person's prior asbestos \n     expenditures arose from claims related to the manufacture and \n     sale of railroad locomotives and related products, so long as \n     such person's manufacture and sale of railroad locomotives \n     and related products is temporally and causally remote, and \n     for purposes of this clause, a person's manufacture and sale \n     of railroad locomotives and related products shall be deemed \n     to be temporally and causally remote if the asbestos claims \n     historically and generally filed against such person relate \n     to the manufacture and sale of railroad locomotives and \n     related products by an entity dissolved more than 25 years \n     before the date of enactment of this Act;\n\n[[Page S1247]]\n\n       (iii) shall be granted a two-tier adjustment reducing the \n     defendant participant's payment obligation based on inequity \n     by demonstrating that not less than 95 percent of such \n     participant's prior asbestos expenditures arose from asbestos \n     claims based on successor liability arising from a merger to \n     which the participant or its predecessor was a party that \n     occurred at least 30 years before the date of enactment of \n     this Act, and that such prior asbestos expenditures exceed \n     the inflation-adjusted value of the assets of the company \n     from which such liability was derived in such merger, and \n     upon such demonstration the Administrator shall grant such \n     adjustment for the life of the Fund and amounts paid by such \n     defendant participant prior to such adjustment in excess of \n     its adjusted payment obligation under this clause shall be \n     credited against next succeeding required payment \n     obligations; and\n       (iv) may, subject to the discretion of the Administrator, \n     be exempt from any payment obligation if such defendant \n     participant establishes with the Administrator that--\n\n       (I) such participant has satisfied all past claims; and\n       (II) there is no reasonable likelihood in the absence of \n     this Act of any future claims with costs for which the \n     defendant participant might be responsible.\n\n       (B) Payment rate.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the \n     payment rate of a defendant participant is the payment amount \n     of the defendant participant as a percentage of such \n     defendant participant's gross revenues for the year ending \n     December 31, 2002.\n       (C) Term.--Subject to the annual availability of funds in \n     the defendant inequity adjustment account established under \n     subsection (k), an inequity adjustment under this subsection \n     shall have a term of 3 years.\n       (D) Renewal.--A defendant participant may renew an inequity \n     adjustment every 3 years by demonstrating that the adjustment \n     remains justified.\n       (E) Reinstatement.--\n       (i) In general.--Following the termination of an inequity \n     adjustment under subparagraph (A), and during the funding \n     period prescribed under subsection (a), the Administrator \n     shall annually determine whether there has been a material \n     change in conditions which would support a finding that the \n     amount of the defendant participant's payment under the \n     statutory allocation was not inequitable. Based on this \n     determination, the Administrator may, consistent with the \n     policies and legislative intent underlying this Act, \n     reinstate any or all of the payment obligations of the \n     defendant participant as if the inequity adjustment had not \n     been granted for that 3-year period.\n       (ii) Terms and conditions.--In the event of a reinstatement \n     under clause (i), the Administrator may require the defendant \n     participant to pay any part or all of amounts not paid due to \n     the inequity adjustment on such terms and conditions as \n     established by the Administrator.\n       (4) Limitation on adjustments.--The aggregate total of \n     financial hardship adjustments under paragraph (2) and \n     inequity adjustments under paragraph (3) in effect in any \n     given year shall not be limited.\n       (6) Rulemaking and Advisory panels.--\n       (A) Appointment.--The Administrator may appoint a Financial \n     Hardship Adjustment Panel and an Inequity Adjustment Panel to \n     advise the Administrator in carrying out this subsection.\n       (B) Membership.--The membership of the panels appointed \n     under subparagraph (A) may overlap.\n       (C) Coordination.--The panels appointed under subparagraph \n     (A) shall coordinate their deliberations and advice. The \n     Administrator may adopt rules consistent with this Act to \n     make the determination of hardship and inequity adjustments \n     more efficient and predictable.\n       (f) Limitation on Liability.--The liability of each \n     defendant participant to pay to the Fund shall be limited to \n     the payment obligations under this Act, and, except as \n     provided in subsection (f) and section 203(b)(2)(D), no \n     defendant participant shall have any liability for the \n     payment obligations of any other defendant participant.\n       (g) Consolidation of Payments.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of determining the payment \n     levels of defendant participants, any affiliated group \n     including 1 or more defendant participants may irrevocably \n     elect, as part of the submissions to be made under paragraphs \n     (1) and (3) of subsection (j), to report on a consolidated \n     basis all of the information necessary to determine the \n     payment level under this subtitle and pay to the Fund on a \n     consolidated basis.\n       (2) Election.--If an affiliated group elects consolidation \n     as provided in this subsection--\n       (A) for purposes of this Act other than this subsection, \n     the affiliated group shall be treated as if it were a single \n     participant, including with respect to the assessment of a \n     single annual payment under this subtitle for the entire \n     affiliated group;\n       (B) the ultimate parent of the affiliated group shall \n     prepare and submit each submission to be made under \n     subsection (i) on behalf of the entire affiliated group and \n     shall be solely liable, as between the Administrator and the \n     affiliated group only, for the payment of the annual amount \n     due from the affiliated group under this subtitle, except \n     that, if the ultimate parent does not pay when due any \n     payment obligation for the affiliated group, the \n     Administrator shall have the right to seek payment of all or \n     any portion of the entire amount due (as well as any other \n     amount for which the affiliated group may be liable under \n     sections 223 and 224) from any member of the affiliated \n     group;\n       (C) all members of the affiliated group shall be identified \n     in the submission under subsection (j) and shall certify \n     compliance with this subsection and the Administrator's \n     regulations implementing this subsection; and\n       (D) the obligations under this subtitle shall not change \n     even if, after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     beneficial ownership interest between any members of the \n     affiliated group shall change.\n       (3) Cause of action.--Notwithstanding section 221(e), this \n     Act shall not preclude actions among persons within an \n     affiliated group with respect to the payment obligations \n     under this Act.\n       (h) Determination of Prior Asbestos Expenditures.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of determining a defendant \n     participant's prior asbestos expenditures, the Administrator \n     shall prescribe such rules as may be necessary or appropriate \n     to assure that payments by indemnitors before December 31, \n     2002, shall be counted as part of the indemnitor's prior \n     asbestos expenditures, rather than the indemnitee's prior \n     asbestos expenditures, in accordance with this subsection.\n       (2) Indemnifiable costs.--If an indemnitor has paid or \n     reimbursed to an indemnitee any indemnifiable cost or \n     otherwise made a payment on behalf of or for the benefit of \n     an indemnitee to a third party for an indemnifiable cost \n     before December 31, 2002, the amount of such indemnifiable \n     cost shall be solely for the account of the indemnitor for \n     purposes under this Act.\n       (3) Insurance payments.--When computing the prior asbestos \n     expenditures with respect to an asbestos claim, any amount \n     paid or reimbursed by insurance shall be solely for the \n     account of the indemnitor, even if the indemnitor would have \n     no direct right to the benefit of the insurance, if--\n       (A) such insurance has been paid or reimbursed to the \n     indemnitor or the indemnitee, or paid on behalf of or for the \n     benefit of the indemnitee; and\n       (B) the indemnitor has either, with respect to such \n     asbestos claim or any similar asbestos claim, paid or \n     reimbursed to its indemnitee any indemnifiable cost or paid \n     to any third party on behalf of or for the benefit of the \n     indemnitee any indemnifiable cost.\n       (4) Treatment of certain expenditures.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of this Act, where--\n       (A) an indemnitor entered into a stock purchase agreement \n     in 1988 that involved the sale of the stock of businesses \n     that produced friction and other products; and\n       (B) the stock purchase agreement provided that the \n     indemnitor indemnified the indemnitee and its affiliates for \n     losses arising from various matters, including asbestos \n     claims--\n       (i) asserted before the date of the agreement; and\n       (ii) filed after the date of the agreement and prior to the \n     10-year anniversary of the stock sale,\n     then the prior asbestos expenditures arising from the \n     asbestos claims described in clauses (i) and (ii) shall not \n     be for the account of either the indemnitor or indemnitee.\n       (i) Minimum Annual Payments.--\n       (1) In general.--The aggregate annual payments of defendant \n     participants to the Fund shall be at least $3,000,000,000 for \n     each calendar year in the first 30 years of the Fund, or \n     until such shorter time as the condition set forth in \n     subsection (a)(2) is attained.\n       (2) Guaranteed payment account.--To the extent payments in \n     accordance with sections 202 and 203 (as modified by \n     subsections (b), (e), (g), (h), and (n) of this section) fail \n     in any year to raise at least $3,000,000,000, after \n     applicable reductions or adjustments have been taken \n     according to subsections (e) and (n), the balance needed to \n     meet this required minimum aggregate annual payment shall be \n     obtained from the defendant guaranteed payment account \n     established under subsection (k).\n       (j) Procedures for Making Payments.--\n       (1) Initial year: tiers ii-vi.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 90 days after enactment of \n     this Act, each defendant participant that is included in \n     Tiers II, III, IV, V, or VI shall file with the \n     Administrator--\n       (i) a statement of whether the defendant participant \n     irrevocably elects to report on a consolidated basis under \n     subsection (g);\n       (ii) a good-faith estimate of its prior asbestos \n     expenditures;\n       (iii) a statement of its 2002 revenues, determined in \n     accordance with section 203(a)(2);\n       (iv) payment in the amount specified in section 203 for the \n     lowest subtier of the tier within which the defendant \n     participant falls, except that if the defendant participant, \n     or the affiliated group including the defendant participant, \n     had 2002 revenues exceeding $3,000,000,000, it or its \n     affiliated group shall pay the amount specified for Subtier 3 \n     of Tiers II, III, or IV or Subtier 2 of Tiers V or VI, \n     depending on the applicable Tier; and\n       (v) a signature page personally verifying the truth of the \n     statements and estimates described under this subparagraph, \n     as required under section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of \n     2002 (15 U.S.C. 7201 et seq.).\n       (B) Relief.--\n       (i) In general.--The Administrator shall establish \n     procedures to grant a defendant\n\n[[Page S1248]]\n\n     participant relief from its initial payment obligation if the \n     participant shows that--\n\n       (I) the participant is likely to qualify for a financial \n     hardship adjustment; and\n       (II) failure to provide interim relief would cause severe \n     irreparable harm.\n\n       (ii) Judicial relief.--The Administrator's refusal to grant \n     relief under clause (i) is subject to immediate judicial \n     review under section 303.\n       (2) Initial year: tier i.--Not later than 60 days after \n     enactment of this Act, each debtor shall file with the \n     Administrator--\n       (A) a statement identifying the bankruptcy case(s) \n     associated with the debtor;\n       (B) a statement whether its prior asbestos expenditures \n     exceed $1,000,000;\n       (C) a statement whether it has material continuing business \n     operations and, if not, whether it holds cash or other assets \n     that have been allocated or earmarked for asbestos \n     settlements;\n       (D) in the case of debtors falling within Subtier 1 of Tier \n     I--\n       (i) a statement of the debtor's 2002 revenues, determined \n     in accordance with section 203(a)(2);\n       (ii) for those debtors subject to the payment requirement \n     of section 203(b)(2)(B)(ii), a statement whether its prior \n     asbestos expenditures do not exceed $10,000,000, and a \n     description of its business operations sufficient to show the \n     requirements of that section are met; and\n       (iii) a payment under section 203(b)(2)(B);\n       (E) in the case of debtors falling within Subtier 2 of Tier \n     I, an assignment of its assets under section 203(b)(3)(B);\n       (F) in the case of debtors falling within Subtier 3 of Tier \n     I, a payment under section 203(b)(4)(B), and a statement of \n     how such payment was calculated; and\n       (G) a signature page personally verifying the truth of the \n     statements and estimates described under this paragraph, as \n     required under section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 \n     (15 U.S.C. 7201 et seq.).\n       (3) Initial year: tier vii.--Not later than 90 days after \n     enactment of this Act, each defendant participant in Tier VII \n     shall file with the Administrator--\n       (A) a good-faith estimate of all payments of the type \n     described in section 203(h)(1) (as modified by section \n     203(h)(6));\n       (B) a statement of revenues calculated in accordance with \n     sections 203(a)(2) and 203(h);

and\n       (B) publish in the Federal Register a notice--\n       (i) setting forth the criteria in this Act, and as \n     prescribed by the Administrator in accordance with this Act, \n     for paying under this subtitle as a defendant participant and \n     requiring any person who may be a defendant participant to \n     submit such information; and\n       (ii) that includes a list of all defendant participants \n     notified by the Administrator under subparagraph (A), and \n     provides for 30 days for the submission by the public of \n     comments or information regarding the completeness and \n     accuracy of the list of identified defendant participants.\n       (5) Response required.--\n       (A) In general.--Any person who receives notice under \n     paragraph (4)(A), and any other person meeting the criteria \n     specified in the notice published under paragraph (4)(B), \n     shall provide the Administrator with an address to send any \n     notice from the Administrator in accordance with this Act and \n     all the information required by the Administrator in \n     accordance with this subsection no later than the earlier \n     of--\n       (i) 30 days after the receipt of direct notice; or\n       (ii) 30 days after the publication of notice in the Federal \n     Register.\n       (B) Certification.--The response submitted under \n     subparagraph (A) shall be signed by a responsible corporate \n     officer, general partner, proprietor, or individual of \n     similar authority, who shall certify under penalty of law the \n     completeness and accuracy of the information submitted.\n       (C) Consent to audit authority.--The response submitted \n     under subparagraph (A) shall include, on behalf of the \n     defendant participant or affiliated group, a consent to the \n     Administrator's audit authority under section 221(d).\n       (6) Notice of initial determination.--\n       (A) In general.--\n       (i) Notice to individual.--Not later than 60 days after \n     receiving a response under paragraph (5), the Administrator \n     shall send the person a notice of initial determination \n     identifying the tier and subtier, if any, into which the \n     person falls and the annual payment obligation, if any, to \n     the Fund, which determination shall be based on the \n     information received from the person under this subsection \n     and any other pertinent information available to the \n     Administrator and identified to the defendant participant.\n       (ii) Public notice.--Not later than 7 days after sending \n     the notification of initial determination to defendant \n     participants, the Administrator shall publish in the Federal \n     Register a notice listing the defendant participants that \n     have been sent such notification, and the initial \n     determination identifying the tier and subtier assignment and \n     annual payment obligation of each identified participant.\n       (B) No response; incomplete response.--If no response in \n     accordance with paragraph (5) is received from a defendant \n     participant, or if the response is incomplete, the initial \n     determination shall be based on the best information \n     available to the Administrator.\n       (C) Payments.--Within 30 days of receiving a notice of \n     initial determination requiring payment, the defendant \n     participant shall pay the Administrator the amount required \n     by the notice, after deducting any previous payment made by \n     the participant under this subsection. If the amount that the \n     defendant participant is required to pay is less than any \n     previous payment made by the participant under this \n     subsection, the Administrator shall credit any excess payment \n     against the future payment obligations of that defendant \n     participant. The pendency of a petition for rehearing under \n     paragraph (10) shall not stay the obligation of the \n     participant to make the payment specified in the \n     Administrator's notice.\n       (7) Exemptions for information required.--\n       (A) Prior asbestos expenditures.--In lieu of submitting \n     information related to prior asbestos expenditures as may be \n     required for purposes of this subtitle, a non-debtor \n     defendant participant may consent to be assigned to Tier II.\n       (B) Revenues.--In lieu of submitting information related to \n     revenues as may be required for purposes of this subtitle, a \n     non-debtor defendant participant may consent to be assigned \n     to Subtier 1 of the defendant participant's applicable tier.\n       (8) New information.--\n       (A) Existing participant.--The Administrator shall adopt \n     procedures for requiring additional payment, or refunding \n     amounts already paid, based on new information received.\n       (B) Additional participant.--If the Administrator, at any \n     time, receives information that an additional person may \n     qualify as a defendant participant, the Administrator shall \n     require such person to submit information necessary to \n     determine whether that person is required to make payments, \n     and in what amount, under this subtitle and shall make any \n     determination or take any other act consistent with this Act \n     based on such information or any other information available \n     to the Administrator with respect to such person.\n       (9) Subpoenas.--The Administrator may request the Attorney \n     General to subpoena persons to compel testimony, records, and \n     other information relevant to its responsibilities under this \n     section. The Attorney General may enforce such subpoena in \n     appropriate proceedings in the United States district court \n     for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena was \n     addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.\n       (10) Rehearing.--A defendant participant has a right to \n     obtain rehearing of the Administrator's determination under \n     this subsection of the applicable tier or subtier of the \n     Administrator's determination under subsection (e) of a \n     financial hardship or inequity adjustment, and of the \n     Administrator's determination under subsection (n) of a \n     distributor's adjustment, if the request for rehearing is \n     filed within 30 days after the defendant participant's \n     receipt of notice from the Administrator of the \n     determination. A defendant participant may not file an action \n     under section 303 unless the defendant participant requests a \n     rehearing under this paragraph. The Administrator shall \n     publish a notice in the Federal Register of any change in a \n     defendant participant's tier or subtier assignment or payment \n     obligation as a result of a rehearing.\n       (k) Defendant Inequity Adjustment Account.--\n       (1) In general.--To the extent the total payments by \n     defendant participants in any given year exceed the minimum \n     aggregate annual payments required under subsection (i), \n     excess monies up to a maximum of $300,000,000 in any such \n     year shall be placed in a defendant inequity adjustment \n     account established within the Fund by the Administrator.\n       (2) Use of account monies.--Monies from the defendant \n     inequity adjustment account shall be preserved and \n     administered like the remainder of the Fund, but shall be \n     reserved and may be used only--\n       (A) to make up for any relief granted to a defendant \n     participant for demonstrated inequity under subsection (d) or \n     to reimburse any defendant participant granted such relief \n     after its payment of the amount otherwise due; and\n       (B) if the condition set forth in subsection (a)(2) is met, \n     for any purpose that the Fund may serve under this Act.\n       (3) Carryover of unused funds.--To the extent the \n     Administrator does not, in any given year, use all of the \n     funds allocated to the account under paragraph (1) for \n     adjustments granted under subsection (e), remaining funds in \n     the account shall be carried forward for use by the \n     Administrator for adjustments in subsequent years.\n       (l) Defendant Guaranteed Payment Account.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to subsections (i) and (k), if \n     there are excess monies paid by defendant participants in any \n     given year, including any bankruptcy trust credits that may \n     be due under section 222(d), such monies--\n\n[[Page S1249]]\n\n       (A) at the discretion of the Administrator, may be used to \n     provide additional adjustments under subsection (e), up to a \n     maximum aggregate of $50,000,000 in such year; and\n       (B) to the extent not used under subparagraph (A), shall be \n     placed in a defendant guaranteed payment account established \n     within the Fund by the Administrator.\n       (2) Use of account monies.--Monies from the defendant \n     guaranteed payment account shall be preserved and \n     administered like the remainder of the Fund, but shall be \n     reserved and may be used only--\n       (A) to ensure the minimum aggregate annual payment required \n     under subsection (i), after applicable reductions or \n     adjustments have been taken according to subsections (e) and \n     (m) is reached each year; and\n       (B) if the condition set forth in subsection (a)(2) is met, \n     for any purpose that the Fund may serve under this Act.\n       (n) Adjustments for Distributors.--\n       (1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term \n     ``distributor'' means a person--\n       (A) whose prior asbestos expenditures arise exclusively \n     from the sale of products manufactured by others;\n       (B) who did not prior to December 31, 2002, sell raw \n     asbestos or a product containing more than 95 percent \n     asbestos by weight;\n       (C) whose prior asbestos expenditures did not arise out \n     of--\n       (i) the manufacture, installation, repair, reconditioning, \n     maintaining, servicing, constructing, or remanufacturing of \n     any product;\n       (ii) the control of the design, specification, or \n     manufacture of any product; or\n       (iii) the sale or resale of any product under, as part of, \n     or under the auspices of, its own brand, trademark, or \n     service mark; and\n       (D) who is not subject to assignment under section 202 to \n     Tier I, II, III or VII.\n       (2) Tier reassignment for distributors.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding section 202, the \n     Administrator shall assign a distributor to a Tier for \n     purposes of this title under the procedures set forth in this \n     paragraph.\n       (B) Designation.--After a final determination by the \n     Administrator under section 204(j), any person who is, or any \n     affiliated group in which every member is, a distributor may \n     apply to the Administrator for adjustment of its Tier \n     assignment under this subsection. Such application shall be \n     prepared in accordance with such procedures as the \n     Administrator shall promulgate by rule. Once the \n     Administrator designates a person or affiliated group as a \n     distributor under this subsection, such designation and the \n     adjustment of tier assignment under this subsection are \n     final.\n       (C) Payments.--Any person or affiliated group that seeks \n     adjustment of its Tier assignment under this subsection shall \n     pay all amounts required of it under this title until a final \n     determination by the Administrator is made under this \n     subsection. Such payments may not be stayed pending any \n     appeal. The Administrator shall grant any person or \n     affiliated group a refund or credit of any payments made if \n     such adjustment results in a lower payment obligation.\n       (D) Adjustment.--Subject to paragraph (3), any person or \n     affiliated group that the Administrator has designated as a \n     distributor under this subsection shall be given an \n     adjustment of Tier assignment as follows:\n       (i) A distributor that but for this subsection would be \n     assigned to Tier IV shall be deemed assigned to Tier V.\n       (ii) A distributor that but for this subsection would be \n     assigned to Tier V shall be deemed assigned to Tier VI.\n       (iii) A distributor that but for this subsection would be \n     assigned to Tier VI shall be deemed assigned to no Tier and \n     shall have no obligation to make any payment to the Fund \n     under this Act.\n       (E) Exclusive to inequity adjustment.--Any person or \n     affiliated group designated by the Administrator as a \n     distributor under this subsection shall not be eligible for \n     an inequity adjustment under subsection 204(e).\n       (3) Limitation on adjustments.--The aggregate total of \n     distributor adjustments under this subsection in effect in \n     any given year shall not exceed $50,000,000. If the aggregate \n     total of distributors adjustments under this subsection would \n     otherwise exceed $50,000,000, then each distributor's \n     adjustment shall be reduced pro rata until the aggregate of \n     all adjustments equals $50,000,000.\n       (4) Rehearing.--A defendant participant has a right to \n     obtain a rehearing of the Administrator's determination on an \n     adjustment under this subsection under the procedures \n     prescribed in subsection (j)(10).\n\n     SEC. 205. STEPDOWNS AND FUNDING HOLIDAYS.\n\n       (a) Stepdowns.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the minimum \n     aggregate annual funding obligation under section 204(i) \n     shall be reduced by 10 percent of the initial minimum \n     aggregate funding obligation at the end of the tenth, \n     fifteenth, twentieth, and twenty-fifth years after the date \n     of enactment of this Act. Except as otherwise provided in \n     this paragraph, the reductions under this paragraph shall be \n     applied on an equal pro rata basis to the funding obligations \n     of all defendant participants.\n       The reductions under this subsection shall not apply to \n     defendant participants in Tier I, subtiers 2 and 3, and class \n     action trusts. For defendant participants whose payment \n     obligation has been limited under section 204(c) or who have \n     received a financial hardship adjustment under section \n     204(e)(2), aggregate potential reductions under this \n     subsection shall be calculated on the basis of the defendant \n     participant's tier and subtier without regard to such \n     limitation or adjustment. If the aggregate potential \n     reduction under this subsection exceeds the reduction in the \n     defendant participant's payment obligation due to the \n     limitation under section 204(c) and the financial hardship \n     adjustment under section 204(e)(2), then the defendant \n     participant's payment obligation shall be further reduced by \n     the difference between the potential reduction provided under \n     this subsection and the reductions that the defendant \n     participant has already received due to the application of \n     the limitation provided in section 204(c) and the financial \n     hardship adjustment provided under section 204(e)(2). If the \n     reduction in the defendant participant's payment obligation \n     due to the limitation provided in section 204(c) and any the \n     financial hardship adjustment provided under section \n     204(e)(2) exceeds the amount of the reduction provided in \n     this subsection, then the defendant participant's payment \n     obligation shall not be further reduced under this paragraph.\n       (2) Limitation.--The Administrator shall suspend, cancel, \n     reduce, or delay any reduction under paragraph (1) if at any \n     time the Administrator finds, in accordance with subsection \n     (c), that such action is necessary and appropriate to ensure \n     that the assets of the Fund and expected future payments \n     remain sufficient to satisfy the Fund's anticipated \n     obligations.\n       (b) Funding Holidays.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Administrator determines, at any \n     time after 10 years following the date of enactment of this \n     Act, that the assets of the Fund at the time of such \n     determination and expected future payments, taking into \n     consideration any reductions under subsection (a), are \n     sufficient to satisfy the Fund's anticipated obligations \n     without the need for all, or any portion of, that year's \n     payment otherwise required under this subtitle, the \n     Administrator shall reduce or waive all or any part of the \n     payments required from defendant participants for that year.\n       (2) Annual review.--The Administrator shall undertake the \n     review required by this subsection and make the necessary \n     determination under paragraph (1) every year.\n       (3) Limitations on funding holidays.--Any reduction or \n     waiver of the defendant participants' funding obligations \n     shall--\n       (A) be made only to the extent the Administrator determines \n     that the Fund will still be able to satisfy all of its \n     anticipated obligations; and\n       (B) be applied on an equal pro rata basis to the funding \n     obligations of all defendant participants, except as \n     otherwise provided under this paragraph. The reductions or \n     waivers provided under this subsection shall not apply to \n     defendant participants in Tier I, subtiers 2 and 3, and class \n     action trusts. For defendant participants whose payment \n     obligation has been limited under section 204(c) or who have \n     received a financial hardship adjustment under section \n     204(e)(2), aggregate potential reductions or waivers under \n     this subsection shall be calculated on the basis of the \n     defendant participant's tier and subtier without regard to \n     such limitation or adjustment. If the aggregate potential \n     reductions or waivers under this subsection exceed the \n     reduction in the defendant participant's payment obligation \n     due to the limitation under section 204(c) and the financial \n     hardship adjustment under section 204(e)(2), then the \n     defendant participant's payment obligation shall be further \n     reduced by the difference between the potential reductions or \n     waivers provided under this subsection and the reductions \n     that the defendant participant has already received due to \n     the application of the limitation provided in section 204(c) \n     and the financial hardship adjustment provided under section \n     204(e)(2). If the reduction in the defendant participant's \n     payment obligation due to the limitation provided in section \n     204(c) and any the financial hardship adjustment provided \n     under section 204(e)(2) exceeds the amount of the reductions \n     or waivers provided in this subsection, then the defendant \n     participant's payment obligation shall not be further reduced \n     under this paragraph.\n       (4) New information.--If at any time the Administrator \n     determines that a reduction or waiver under this section may \n     cause the assets of the Fund and expected future payments to \n     decrease to a level at which the Fund may not be able to \n     satisfy all of its anticipated obligations, the Administrator \n     shall revoke all or any part of such reduction or waiver to \n     the extent necessary to ensure that the Fund's obligations \n     are met. Such revocations shall be applied on an equal pro \n     rata basis to the funding obligations of all defendant \n     participants, except defendant participants in Subtiers 2 and \n     3 of Tier I and class action trusts, for that year.\n       (c) Certification.--\n       (1) In general.--Before suspending, canceling, reducing, or \n     delaying any reduction under subsection (a) or granting or \n     revoking a reduction or waiver under subsection (b), the \n     Administrator shall certify that the requirements of this \n     section are satisfied.\n       (2) Notice and comment.--Before making a final \n     certification under this subsection, the Administrator shall \n     publish a notice in the Federal Register of a proposed \n     certification and a statement of the basis therefor and \n     provide in such notice for a public comment period of 30 \n     days.\n       (3) Final certification.--\n       (A) In general.--The Administrator shall publish a notice \n     of the final certification in\n\n[[Page S1250]]\n\n     the Federal Register after consideration of all comments \n     submitted under paragraph (2).\n       (B) Written notice.--Not later than 30 days after \n     publishing any final certification under subparagraph (A), \n     the Administrator shall provide each defendant participant \n     with written notice of that defendant's funding obligation \n     for that year.\n\n     SEC. 206. ACCOUNTING TREATMENT.\n\n       Defendant participants payment obligations to the Fund \n     shall be subject to discounting under the applicable \n     accounting guidelines for generally accepted accounting \n     purposes and statutory accounting purposes for each defendant \n     participant. This section shall in no way reduce the amount \n     of monetary payments to the Fund by defendant participants as \n     required under section 202(a)(2).\n\n                Subtitle B--Asbestos Insurers Commission\n\n     SEC. 210.

ESTABLISHMENT OF ASBESTOS INSURERS COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established the Asbestos \n     Insurers Commission (referred to in this subtitle as the \n     ``Commission'') to carry out the duties described in section \n     212.\n       (b) Membership.--\n       (1) Appointment.--The Commission shall be composed of 5 \n     members who shall be appointed by the President, by and with \n     the advice and consent of the Senate.\n       (2) Qualifications.--\n       (A) Expertise.--Members of the Commission shall have \n     sufficient expertise to fulfill their responsibilities under \n     this subtitle.\n       (B) Conflict of interest.--\n       (i) In general.--No member of the Commission appointed \n     under paragraph (1) may be an employee or immediate family \n     member of an employee of an insurer participant. No member of \n     the Commission shall be a shareholder of any insurer \n     participant. No member of the Commission shall be a former \n     officer or director, or a former employee or former \n     shareholder of any insurer participant who was such an \n     employee, shareholder, officer, or director at any time \n     during the 2-year period ending on the date of the \n     appointment, unless that is fully disclosed before \n     consideration in the Senate of the nomination for appointment \n     to the Commission.\n       (ii) Definition.--In clause (i), the term ``shareholder'' \n     shall not include a broadly based mutual fund that includes \n     the stocks of insurer participants as a portion of its \n     overall holdings.\n       (C) Federal employment.--A member of the Commission may not \n     be an officer or employee of the Federal Government, except \n     by reason of membership on the Commission.\n       (3) Period of appointment.--Members shall be appointed for \n     the life of the Commission.\n       (4) Vacancies.--Any vacancy in the Commission shall be \n     filled in the same manner as the original appointment.\n       (5) Chairman.--The President shall select a Chairman from \n     among the members of the Commission.\n       (c) Meetings.--\n       (1) Initial meeting.--Not later than 30 days after the date \n     on which all members of the Commission have been appointed, \n     the Commission shall hold its first meeting.\n       (2) Subsequent meetings.--The Commission shall meet at the \n     call of the Chairman, as necessary to accomplish the duties \n     under section 212.\n       (3) Quorum.--No business may be conducted or hearings held \n     without the participation of a majority of the members of the \n     Commission.\n\n     SEC. 212. DUTIES OF ASBESTOS INSURERS COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Determination of Insurer Payment Obligations.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Definitions.--For the purposes of this Act, the terms \n     ``insurer'' and ``insurer participant'' shall, unless stated \n     otherwise, include direct insurers and reinsurers, as well as \n     any run-off entity established, in whole or in part, to \n     review and pay asbestos claims.\n       (B) Procedures for determining insurer payments.--The \n     Commission shall determine the amount that each insurer \n     participant shall be required to pay into the Fund under the \n     procedures described in this section. The Commission shall \n     make this determination by first promulgating a rule \n     establishing a methodology for allocation of payments among \n     insurer participants and then applying such methodology to \n     determine the individual payment for each insurer \n     participant. The methodology may include 1 or more allocation \n     formulas to be applied to all insurer participants or groups \n     of similarly situated participants. The Commission's rule \n     shall include a methodology for adjusting payments by insurer \n     participants to make up, during the first 5 years of the life \n     of the Fund and any subsequent years as provided in section \n     405(f) for any reduction in an insurer participant's annual \n     allocated amount caused by the granting of a financial \n     hardship or exceptional circumstance adjustment under this \n     section, and any amount by which aggregate insurer payments \n     fall below the level required under paragraph (3)(C) by \n     reason of the failure or refusal of any insurer participant \n     to make a required payment, or for any other reason that \n     causes such payments to fall below the level required under \n     paragraph (3)(C). The Commission shall conduct a thorough \n     study (within the time limitations under this subparagraph) \n     of the accuracy of the reserve allocation of each insurer \n     participant, and may request information from the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission or any State regulatory agency. Under \n     this procedure, not later than 120 days after the initial \n     meeting of the Commission, the Commission shall commence a \n     rulemaking proceeding under section 213(a) to propose and \n     adopt a methodology for allocating payments among insurer \n     participants. In proposing an allocation methodology, the \n     Commission may consult with such actuaries and other experts \n     as it deems appropriate. After hearings and public comment on \n     the proposed allocation methodology, the Commission shall as \n     promptly as possible promulgate a final rule establishing \n     such methodology. After promulgation of the final rule, the \n     Commission shall determine the individual payment of each \n     insurer participant under the procedures set forth in \n     subsection (b).\n       (C) Scope.--Every insurer, reinsurer, and runoff entity \n     with asbestos-related obligations in the United States shall \n     be subject to the Commission's and Administrator's authority \n     under this Act, including allocation determinations, and \n     shall be required to fulfill its payment obligation without \n     regard as to whether it is licensed in the United States. \n     Every insurer participant not licensed or domiciled in the \n     United States shall, upon the first payment to the Fund, \n     submit a written consent to the Commission's and \n     Administrator's authority under this Act, and to the \n     jurisdiction of the courts of the United States for purposes \n     of enforcing this Act, in a form determined by the \n     Administrator. Any insurer participant refusing to provide a \n     written consent shall be subject to fines and penalties as \n     provided in section 223.\n       (D) Issuers of finite risk policies.--\n       (i) In general.--The issuer of any policy of retrospective \n     reinsurance purchased by an insurer participant or its \n     affiliate after 1990 that provides for a risk or loss \n     transfer to insure for asbestos losses and other losses (both \n     known and unknown), including those policies commonly \n     referred to as ``finite risk'', ``aggregate stop loss'', \n     ``aggregate excess of loss'', or ``loss portfolio transfer'' \n     policies, shall be obligated to make payments required under \n     this Act directly to the Fund on behalf of the insurer \n     participant who is the beneficiary of such policy, subject to \n     the underlying retention and the limits of liability \n     applicable to such policy.\n       (ii) Payments.--Payments to the Fund required under this \n     Act shall be treated as loss payments for asbestos bodily \n     injury (as if such payments were incurred as liabilities \n     imposed in the tort system) and shall not be subject to \n     exclusion under policies described under clause (i) as a \n     liability with respect to tax or assessment. Within 90 days \n     after the scheduled date to make an annual payment to the \n     Fund, the insurer participant shall, at its discretion, \n     direct the reinsurer issuing such policy to pay all or a \n     portion of the annual payment directly to the Fund up to the \n     full applicable limits of liability under the policy. The \n     reinsurer issuing such policy shall be obligated to make such \n     payments directly to the Fund and shall be subject to the \n     enforcement provisions under section 223. The insurer \n     participant shall remain obligated to make payment to the \n     Fund of that portion of the annual payment not directed to \n     the issuer of such reinsurance policy.\n       (2) Amount of payments.--\n       (A) Aggregate payment obligation.--The total payment \n     required of all insurer participants over the life of the \n     Fund shall be equal to $46,025,000,000, less any bankruptcy \n     trust credits under section 222(d).\n       (B) Accounting standards.--In determining the payment \n     obligations of participants that are not licensed or \n     domiciled in the United States or that are runoff entities, \n     the Commission shall use accounting standards required for \n     United States licensed direct insurers.\n       (C) Captive insurance companies.--No payment to the Fund \n     shall be required from a captive insurance company, unless \n     and only to the extent a captive insurance company, on the \n     date of enactment of this Act, insures the asbestos \n     liability, directly or indirectly, of (and that arises out of \n     the manufacture, sale, distribution or installation of \n     materials or products by, or other conduct of) a person or \n     persons other than and unaffiliated with its ultimate parent \n     or affiliated group or pool in which the ultimate parent \n     participates or participated, or unaffiliated with a person \n     that was its ultimate parent or a member of its affiliated \n     group or pool at the time the relevant insurance or \n     reinsurance was issued by the captive insurance company.\n       (D) Several liability.--Unless otherwise provided under \n     this Act, each insurer participant's obligation to make \n     payments to the Fund is several. Unless otherwise provided \n     under this Act, there is no joint liability, and the future \n     insolvency by any insurer participant shall not affect the \n     payment required of any other insurer participant.\n       (3) Payment of criteria.--\n       (A) Inclusion in insurer participant category.--\n\n[[Page S1251]]\n\n       (i) In general.--Insurers that have paid, or been assessed \n     by a legal judgment or settlement, at least $1,000,000 in \n     defense and indemnity costs before the date of enactment of \n     this Act in response to claims for compensation for asbestos \n     injuries arising from a policy of liability insurance or \n     contract of liability reinsurance or retrocessional \n     reinsurance shall be insurer participants in the Fund. Other \n     insurers shall be exempt from mandatory payments.\n       (ii) Inapplicability of section 202.--Since insurers may be \n     subject in certain jurisdictions to direct action suits, and \n     it is not the intent of this Act to impose upon an insurer, \n     due to its operation as an insurer, payment obligations to \n     the Fund in situations where the insurer is the subject of a \n     direct action, no insurer subject to mandatory payments under \n     this section shall also be liable for payments to the Fund as \n     a defendant participant under section 202.\n       (B) Insurer participant allocation methodology.--\n       (i) In general.--The Commission shall establish the payment \n     obligations of individual insurer participants to reflect, on \n     an equitable basis, the relative tort system liability of the \n     participating insurers in the absence of this Act, \n     considering and weighting, as appropriate (but exclusive of \n     workers' compensation), such factors as--\n\n       (I) historic premium for lines of insurance associated with \n     asbestos exposure over relevant periods of time;\n       (II) recent loss experience for asbestos liability;\n       (III) amounts reserved for asbestos liability;\n       (IV) the likely cost to each insurer participant of its \n     future liabilities under applicable insurance policies; and\n       (V) any other factor the Commission may determine is \n     relevant and appropriate.\n\n       (ii) Determination of reserves.--The Commission may \n     establish procedures and standards for determination of the \n     asbestos reserves of insurer participants. The reserves of a \n     United States licensed reinsurer that is wholly owned by, or \n     under common control of, a United States licensed direct \n     insurer shall be included as part of the direct insurer's \n     reserves when the reinsurer's financial results are included \n     as part of the direct insurer's United States operations, as \n     reflected in footnote 33 of its filings with the National \n     Association of Insurance Commissioners or in published \n     financial statements prepared in accordance with generally \n     accepted accounting principles.\n       (C) Payment schedule.--The aggregate annual amount of \n     payments by insurer participants over the life of the Fund \n     shall be as follows:\n       (i) For years 1 and 2, $2,700,000,000 annually.\n       (ii) For years 3 through 5, $5,075,000,000 annually.\n       (iii) For years 6 through 27, $1,147,000,000 annually.\n       (iv) For year 28, $166,000,000.\n       (D) Certain runoff entities.--A runoff entity shall include \n     any direct insurer or reinsurer whose asbestos liability \n     reserves have been transferred, directly or indirectly, to \n     the runoff entity and on whose behalf the runoff entity \n     handles or adjusts and, where appropriate, pays asbestos \n     claims.\n       (E) Financial hardship and exceptional circumstance \n     adjustments.--\n       (i) In general.--Under the procedures established in \n     subsection (b), an insurer participant may seek adjustment of \n     the amount of its payments based on exceptional circumstances \n     or severe financial hardship.\n       (ii) Financial adjustments.--An insurer participant may \n     qualify for an adjustment based on severe financial hardship \n     by demonstrating that payment of the amounts required by the \n     Commission's methodology would jeopardize the solvency of \n     such participant.\n       (iii) Exceptional circumstance adjustment.--An insurer \n     participant may qualify for an adjustment based on \n     exceptional circumstances by demonstrating--\n\n       (I) that the amount of its payments under the Commission's \n     allocation methodology is exceptionally inequitable when \n     measured against the amount of the likely cost to the \n     participant of its future liability in the tort system in the \n     absence of the Fund;\n       (II) an offset credit as described in subparagraphs (A) and \n     (C) of subsection (b)(4); or\n\n       (III) other exceptional circumstances.\n\n     The Commission may determine whether to grant an adjustment \n     and the size of any such adjustment, but except as provided \n     under paragraph (1)(B), subsection (f)(3), and section \n     405(f), any such adjustment shall not affect the aggregate \n     payment obligations of insurer participants specified in \n     paragraph (2)(A) and subparagraph (C) of this paragraph.\n       (iv) Time period of adjustment.--Except for adjustments for \n     offset credits, adjustments granted under this subsection \n     shall have a term not to exceed 3 years. An insurer \n     participant may renew its adjustment by demonstrating to the \n     Administrator that it remains justified.\n       (F) Funding holidays.--\n       (i) In general.--If the Administrator determines, at any \n     time after 10 years following the date of enactment of this \n     Act, that the assets of the Fund at the time of such \n     determination and expected future payments are sufficient to \n     satisfy the Fund's anticipated obligations without the need \n     for all, or any portion of, that year's payment otherwise \n     required under this subtitle, the Administrator shall reduce \n     or waive all or any part of the payments required from \n     insurer participants for that year.\n       (ii) Annual review.--The Administrator shall undertake the \n     review required by this subsection and make the necessary \n     determination under clause (i) every year.\n       (iii) Limitations of funding holidays.--Any reduction or \n     waiver of the insurer participants' funding obligations \n     shall--\n\n       (I) be made only to the extent the Administrator determines \n     that the Fund will still be able to satisfy all of its \n     anticipated obligations; and\n       (II) be applied on an equal pro rata basis to the funding \n     obligations of all insurer participants for that year.\n\n       (iv) New information.--If at any time the Administrator \n     determines that a reduction or waiver under this section may \n     cause the assets of the Fund and expected future payments to \n     decrease to a level at which the Fund may not be able to \n     satisfy all of its anticipated obligations, the Administrator \n     shall revoke all or any part of such reduction or waiver to \n     the extent necessary to ensure that the Fund's obligations \n     are met.

An insurer participant's payments shall be \n     payable over the schedule established in subsection \n     (a)(3)(C), in annual amounts proportionate to the aggregate \n     annual amount of payments for all insurer participants for \n     the applicable year.\n       (ii) Public notice.--Not later than 7 days after sending \n     the notification of initial determination to insurer \n     participants, the Commission shall publish in the Federal \n     Register a notice listing the insurer participants that have \n     been sent such notification, and the initial determination on \n     the payment obligation of each identified participant.\n       (B) No response; incomplete response.--If no response is \n     received from an insurer participant, or if the response is \n     incomplete, the initial determination requiring a payment \n     from the insurer participant shall be based on the best \n     information available to the Commission.\n       (4) Commission review, revision, and finalization of \n     initial payment determinations.--\n       (A) Comments from insurer participants.--Not later than 30 \n     days after receiving a notice of initial determination from \n     the Commission, an insurer participant may provide the \n     Commission with additional information to support adjustments \n     to the required payments to reflect severe financial hardship \n     or exceptional circumstances, including the provision of an \n     offset credit for an insurer participant for the amount of \n     any asbestos-related payments it made or was legally \n     obligated to make, including payments released from an \n     escrow, as the result of a bankruptcy judicially confirmed \n     after May 22, 2003, but before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (B) Additional participants.--If, before the final \n     determination of the Commission, the Commission receives \n     information that an additional person may qualify as an \n     insurer participant, the Commission shall require such person \n     to submit information necessary to determine whether payments \n     from\n\n[[Page S1252]]\n\n     that person should be required, in accordance with the \n     requirements of this subsection.\n       (C) Revision procedures.--The Commission shall adopt \n     procedures for revising initial payments based on information \n     received under subparagraphs (A) and (B), including a \n     provision requiring an offset credit for an insurer \n     participant for the amount of any asbestos-related payments \n     it made or was legally obligated to make, including payments \n     released from an escrow, as the result of a bankruptcy \n     confirmed after May 22, 2003, but before the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (5) Examinations and subpoenas.--\n       (A) Examinations.--The Commission may conduct examinations \n     of the books and records of insurer participants to determine \n     the completeness and accuracy of information submitted, or \n     required to be submitted, to the Commission for purposes of \n     determining participant payments.\n       (B) Subpoenas.--The Commission may request the Attorney \n     General to subpoena persons to compel testimony, records, and \n     other information relevant to its responsibilities under this \n     section.

The \n     authority of the Commission under this subtitle shall, with \n     respect to participants who are parties to a certified \n     allocation agreement, terminate on the day after the \n     Commission certifies such agreement. Under subsection (f), \n     the Administrator shall assume responsibility, if necessary, \n     for calculating the individual payment obligations of \n     participants who are parties to the certified agreement.\n       (d) Commission Report.--\n       (1) Recipients.--Until the work of the Commission has been \n     completed and the Commission terminated, the Commission shall \n     submit an annual report, containing the information described \n     under paragraph (2), to--\n       (A) the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate;\n       (B) the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (C) the Administrator.\n       (2) Contents.--The report under paragraph (1) shall state \n     the amount that each insurer participant is required to pay \n     to the Fund, including the payment schedule for such \n     payments.\n       (e) Interim Payments.--\n       (1) Amount of interim payment.--Within 90 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, insurer participants shall \n     make an aggregate payment to the Fund not to exceed 50 \n     percent of the aggregate funding obligation specified under \n     subsection (a)(3)(C) for year 1.\n       (2) Reserve information.--Within 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, each insurer participant shall submit \n     to the Administrator a certified statement of its net held \n     reserves for asbestos liabilities as of December 31, 2004.\n       (3) Allocation of interim payment.--The Administrator shall \n     allocate the interim payment among the individual insurer \n     participants on an equitable basis using the net held \n     asbestos reserve information provided by insurer participants \n     under subsection (a)(3)(B). Within 60 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall publish in the \n     Federal Register the name of each insurer participant, and \n     the amount of the insurer participant's allocated share of \n     the interim payment. The use of net held asbestos reserves as \n     the basis to determine an interim allocation shall not be \n     binding on the Administrator in the determination of an \n     appropriate final allocation methodology under this section. \n     All payments required under this paragraph shall be credited \n     against the participant's ultimate payment obligation to the \n     Fund established by the Commission. If an interim payment \n     exceeds the ultimate payment, the Fund shall pay interest on \n     the amount of the overpayment at a rate determined by the \n     Administrator. If the ultimate payment exceeds the interim \n     payment, the participant shall pay interest on the amount of \n     the underpayment at the same rate. Any participant may seek \n     an exemption from or reduction in any payment required under \n     this subsection under the financial hardship and exceptional \n     circumstance standards established under subsection \n     (a)(3)(E).\n       (4) Appeal of interim payment decisions.--A decision by the \n     Administrator to establish an interim payment obligation \n     shall be considered final agency action and reviewable under \n     section 303, except that the reviewing court may not stay an \n     interim payment during the pendency of the appeal.\n       (f) Transfer of Authority From the Commission to the \n     Administrator.--\n       (1) In general.--Upon termination of the Commission under \n     section 215, the Administrator shall assume all the \n     responsibilities and authority of the Commission, except that \n     the Administrator shall not have the power to modify the \n     allocation methodology established by the Commission or by \n     certified agreement or to promulgate a rule establishing any \n     such methodology.\n       (2) Financial hardship and exceptional circumstance \n     adjustments.--Upon termination of the Commission under \n     section 215, the Administrator shall have the authority, upon \n     application by any insurer participant, to make adjustments \n     to annual payments upon the same grounds as provided in \n     subsection (a)(3)(D). Adjustments granted under this \n     subsection shall have a term not to exceed 3 years. An \n     insurer participant may renew its adjustment by demonstrating \n     that it remains justified. Upon the grant of any adjustment, \n     the Administrator shall increase the payments, consistent \n     with subsection (a)(1)(B), required of all other insurer \n     participants so that there is no reduction in the aggregate \n     payment required of all insurer participants for the \n     applicable years. The increase in an insurer participant's \n     required payment shall be in proportion to such participant's \n     share of the aggregate payment obligation of all insurer \n     participants.\n       (3) Credits for shortfall assessments.--If insurer \n     participants are required during the first 5 years of the \n     life of the Fund to make up any shortfall in required insurer \n     payments under subsection (a)(1)(B), then, beginning in year \n     6, the Administrator shall grant each insurer participant a \n     credit against its annual required payments during the \n     applicable years that in the aggregate equal the amount of \n     shortfall assessments paid by such insurer participant during \n     the first 5 years of the life of the Fund. The credit shall \n     be prorated over the same number of years as the number of \n     years during which the insurer participant paid a shortfall \n     assessment. Insurer participants which did not pay all \n     required payments to the Fund during the first 5 years of the \n     life of the Fund shall not be eligible for a credit. The \n     Administrator shall not grant a credit for shortfall \n     assessments imposed under section 405(f).\n       (4) Financial security requirements.--Whenever an insurer \n     participant's A.M. Best's claims payment rating or Standard \n     and Poor's financial strength rating falls below A-, and \n     until such time as either the insurer participant's A.M. \n     Best's Rating or Standard and Poor's rating is equal to or \n     greater than A-, the Administrator shall have the authority \n     to require that the participating insurer either--\n       (A) pay the present value of its remaining Fund payments at \n     a discount rate determined by the Administrator; or\n       (B) provide an evergreen letter of credit or financial \n     guarantee for future payments issued by an institution with \n     an A.M. Best's claims payment rating or Standard & Poor's \n     financial strength rating of at least A+.\n       (g) Accounting Treatment.--Insurer participants' payment \n     obligations to the Fund shall be subject to discounting under \n     the applicable accounting guidelines for generally accepted \n     accounting purposes and statutory accounting purposes for \n     each insurer participant. This subsection shall in no way \n     reduce the amount of monetary payments to the Fund by insurer \n     participants as required under subsection (a).\n       (h) Judicial Review.--The Commission's rule establishing an \n     allocation methodology, its final determinations of payment \n     obligations and other final action shall be judicially \n     reviewable as provided in title III.\n\n     SEC. 213.

A court may dismiss any such action on its motion. \n     If the court denies the motion to dismiss, it shall stay \n     further proceedings until final disposition of any appeal \n     taken under this Act.\n       (5) Removal.--\n       (A) In general.--If an action in any State court under \n     paragraph (3) is preempted, barred, or otherwise precluded \n     under this Act, and not dismissed, or if an order entered \n     after the date of enactment of this Act purporting to enter \n     judgment or deny review is not rescinded and replaced with an \n     order of dismissal within 30 days after the filing of a \n     motion by any party to the action advising the court of the \n     provisions of this Act, any party may remove the case to the \n     district court of the United States for the district in which \n     such action is pending.\n       (B) Time limits.--For actions originally filed after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the notice of removal shall be \n     filed within the time limits specified in section 1441(b) of \n     title 28, United States Code.\n       (C) Procedures.--The procedures for removal and proceedings \n     after removal shall be in accordance with sections 1446 \n     through 1450 of title 28, United States Code, except as may \n     be necessary to accommodate removal of any actions pending \n     (including on appeal) on the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (D) Review of remand orders.--\n       (i) In general.--Section 1447 of title 28, United States \n     Code, shall apply to any removal of a case under this \n     section, except that notwithstanding subsection (d) of that \n     section, a court of appeals may accept an appeal from an \n     order of a district court granting or denying a motion to \n     remand an action to the State court from which it was removed \n     if application is made to the court of appeals not less than \n     30 days after entry of the order.\n       (ii) Time period for judgment.--If the court of appeals \n     accepts an appeal under clause (i), the court shall complete \n     all action on such appeal, including rendering judgment, not \n     later than 180 days after the date on which such appeal was \n     filed, unless an extension is granted under clause (iii).\n\n[[Page S1261]]\n\n       (iii) Extension of time period.--The court of appeals may \n     grant an extension of the 180-day period described in clause \n     (ii) if--\n\n       (I) all parties to the proceeding agree to such extension, \n     for any period of time; or\n       (II) such extension is for good cause shown and in the \n     interests of justice, for a period not to exceed 30 days.\n\n       (iv) Denial of appeal.--If a final judgment on the appeal \n     under clause (i) is not issued before the end of the period \n     described in clause (ii), including any extension under \n     clause (iii), the appeal shall be denied.\n       (E) Jurisdiction.--The jurisdiction of the district court \n     shall be limited to--\n       (i) determining whether removal was proper; and\n       (ii) determining, based on the evidentiary record, whether \n     the claim presented is preempted, barred, or otherwise \n     precluded under this Act.\n       (6) Credits.--\n       (A) In general.--If, notwithstanding the express intent of \n     Congress stated in this section, any court finally determines \n     for any reason that an asbestos claim is not barred under \n     this subsection and is not subject to the exclusive remedy or \n     preemption provisions of this section, then any participant \n     required to satisfy a final judgment executed with respect to \n     any such claim may elect to receive a credit against any \n     assessment owed to the Fund equal to the amount of the \n     payment made with respect to such executed judgment.\n       (B) Requirements.--The Administrator shall require \n     participants seeking credit under this paragraph to \n     demonstrate that the participant--\n       (i) timely pursued all available remedies, including \n     remedies available under this paragraph to obtain dismissal \n     of the claim; and\n       (ii) notified the Administrator at least 20 days before the \n     expiration of any period within which to appeal the denial of \n     a motion to dismiss based on this section.\n       (C) Information.--The Administrator may require a \n     participant seeking credit under this paragraph to furnish \n     such further information as is necessary and appropriate to \n     establish eligibility for, and the amount of, the credit.\n       (D) Intervention.--The Administrator may intervene in any \n     action in which a credit may be due under this paragraph.\n\n     SEC. 404.

and\n       (ii) the resolution of claims for reimbursement or coverage \n     of liability or paid or incurred loss for which notice was \n     provided to the insurer before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (E) Scheduled payment amounts.--The term ``scheduled \n     payment amounts'' means the future payment obligation to the \n     Fund under this Act from a defendant participant in the \n     amount established under sections 203 and 204.\n       (F) Unearned erosion amount.--The term ``unearned erosion \n     amount'' means the difference between the deemed erosion \n     amount and the earned erosion amount.\n       (2) Quantum and timing of erosion.--\n       (A) Erosion upon enactment.--The collective payment \n     obligations to the Fund of the insurer and reinsurer \n     participants as assessed by the Administrator shall be deemed \n     as of the date of enactment of this Act to erode remaining \n     aggregate products limits available to a defendant \n     participant only in an amount of 38.1 percent of each \n     defendant participant's scheduled payment amount.\n       (B) No assertion of claim.--No insurer or reinsurer may \n     assert any claim against a defendant participant or captive \n     insurer for insurance, reinsurance, payment of a deductible, \n     or retrospective premium adjustment arising out of that \n     insurer's or reinsurer's payments to the Fund or the erosion \n     deemed to occur under this section.\n       (C) Policies without certain limits or with exclusion.--\n     Except as provided under subparagraph (E), nothing in this \n     section shall require or permit the erosion of any insurance \n     policy or limit that does not contain an aggregate products \n     limit, or that contains an asbestos exclusion.\n       (D) Treatment of consolidation election.--If an affiliated \n     group elects consolidation as provided in section 204(g), the \n     total erosion of limits for the affiliated group under \n     paragraph (2)(A) shall not exceed 38.1 percent of the \n     scheduled payment amount of the single payment obligation for \n     the entire affiliated group. The total erosion of limits for \n     any individual defendant participant in the affiliated group \n     shall not exceed its individual share of 38.1 percent of the \n     affiliated group's scheduled payment amount, as measured by \n     the individual defendant participant's percentage share of \n     the affiliated group's prior asbestos expenditures.\n       (E) Rule of construction.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section, nothing in this Act shall be \n     deemed to erode remaining aggregate products limits of a \n     defendant participant that can demonstrate by a preponderance \n     of the evidence that 75 percent of its prior asbestos \n     expenditures were made in defense or satisfaction of asbestos \n     claims alleging bodily injury arising exclusively from the \n     exposure to asbestos at premises owned, rented, or controlled \n     by the defendant participant (a ``premises defendant''). In \n     calculating such percentage, where expenditures were made in \n     defense or satisfaction of asbestos claims alleging bodily \n     injury due to exposure to the defendant participant's \n     products and to asbestos at premises owned, rented, or \n     controlled by the defendant participant, half of such \n     expenditures shall be deemed to be for such premises \n     exposures. If a defendant participant establishes itself as a \n     premises defendant, 75 percent of the payments by such \n     defendant participant shall erode coverage limits, if any, \n     applicable to premises liabilities under applicable law.\n       (3) Method of erosion.--\n       (A) Allocation.--The amount of erosion allocated to each \n     defendant participant shall be allocated among periods in \n     which policies with remaining aggregate product limits are \n     available to that defendant participant pro rata by policy \n     period, in ascending order by attachment point.\n       (B) Other erosion methods.--\n       (i) In general.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the \n     method of erosion of any remaining aggregate products limits \n     which are subject to--\n\n       (I) a coverage-in-place or settlement agreement between a \n     defendant participant and 1 or more insurance participants as \n     of the date of enactment; or\n       (II) a final and nonappealable judgment as of the date of \n     enactment or resulting from a claim for coverage or \n     reimbursement pending as of such date, shall be as specified \n     in such agreement or judgment with regard to erosion \n     applicable to such insurance participants' policies.\n\n       (ii) Remaining limits.--To the extent that a final \n     nonappealable judgment or settlement agreement to which an \n     insurer participant and a defendant participant are parties \n     in effect as of the date of enactment of this Act \n     extinguished a defendant participant's right to seek coverage \n     for asbestos claims under an insurer participant's policies, \n     any remaining limits in such policies shall not be considered \n     to be remaining aggregate products limits under subsection \n     (a)(1)(A).\n       (5) Payments by defendant participant.--Payments made by a \n     defendant participant shall be deemed to erode, exhaust, or \n     otherwise satisfy applicable self-insured retentions, \n     deductibles, retrospectively rated premiums, and limits \n     issued by nonparticipating insolvent or captive insurance \n     companies. Reduction of remaining aggregate limits under this \n     subsection shall not limit the right of a defendant \n     participant to collect from any insurer not a participant.\n       (6) Effect on other insurance claims.--Other than as \n     specified in this subsection, this Act does not alter, \n     change, modify, or affect insurance for claims other than \n     asbestos claims.\n       (b) Dispute Resolution Procedure.--\n       (1) Arbitration.--The parties to a dispute regarding the \n     erosion of insurance coverage limits under this section may \n     agree in writing to settle such dispute by arbitration. Any \n     such provision or agreement shall be valid, irrevocable, and \n     enforceable, except\n\n[[Page S1262]]\n\n     for any grounds that exist at law or in equity for revocation \n     of a contract.\n       (2) Title 9, united states code.--Arbitration of such \n     disputes, awards by arbitrators, and confirmation of awards \n     shall be governed by title 9, United States Code, to the \n     extent such title is not inconsistent with this section. In \n     any such arbitration proceeding, the erosion principles \n     provided for under this section shall be binding on the \n     arbitrator, unless the parties agree to the contrary.\n       (3) Final and binding award.--An award by an arbitrator \n     shall be final and binding between the parties to the \n     arbitration, but shall have no force or effect on any other \n     person. The parties to an arbitration may agree that in the \n     event a policy which is the subject matter of an award is \n     subsequently determined to be eroded in a manner different \n     from the manner determined by the arbitration in a judgment \n     rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction from which no \n     appeal can or has been taken, such arbitration award may be \n     modified by any court of competent jurisdiction upon \n     application by any party to the arbitration. Any such \n     modification shall govern the rights and obligations between \n     such parties after the date of such modification.\n       (c) Effect on Nonparticipants.--\n       (1) In general.--No insurance company or reinsurance \n     company that is not a participant, other than a captive \n     insurer, shall be entitled to claim that payments to the Fund \n     erode, exhaust, or otherwise limit the nonparticipant's \n     insurance or reinsurance obligations.\n       (2) Other claims.--Nothing in this Act shall preclude a \n     participant from pursuing any claim for insurance or \n     reinsurance from any person that is not a participant other \n     than a captive insurer.\n       (d) Finite Risk Policies Not Affected.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, except subject to section 212(a)(1)(D), this Act \n     shall not alter, affect or impair any rights or obligations \n     of--\n       (A) any party to an insurance contract that expressly \n     provides coverage for governmental charges or assessments \n     imposed to replace insurance or reinsurance liabilities in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act; or\n       (B) subject to paragraph (2), any person with respect to \n     any insurance purchased by a participant after December 31, \n     1990, that expressly (but not necessarily exclusively) \n     provides coverage for asbestos liabilities, including those \n     policies commonly referred to as ``finite risk'' policies.\n       (2) Limitation.--No person may assert that any amounts paid \n     to the Fund in accordance with this Act are covered by any \n     policy described under paragraph (1)(B) purchased by a \n     defendant participant, unless such policy specifically \n     provides coverage for required payments to a Federal trust \n     fund established by a Federal statute to resolve asbestos \n     injury claims.\n       (e) Effect on Certain Insurance and Reinsurance Claims.--\n       (1) No coverage for fund assessments.--Subject to section \n     212(a)(1)(D), no participant or captive insurer may pursue an \n     insurance or reinsurance claim against another participant or \n     captive insurer for payments to the Fund required under this \n     Act, except under a written agreement specifically providing \n     insurance, reinsurance, or other reimbursement for required \n     payments to a Federal trust fund established by a Federal \n     statute to resolve asbestos injury claims or, where \n     applicable, under finite risk policies under subsection (d).\n       (2) Certain insurance assignments voided.--Any assignment \n     of any rights to insurance coverage for asbestos claims to \n     any person who has asserted an asbestos claim before the date \n     of enactment of this Act, or to any trust, person, or other \n     entity not part of an affiliated group as defined in section \n     201(1) of this Act established or appointed for the purpose \n     of paying asbestos claims which were asserted before such \n     date of enactment, or by any Tier I defendant participant \n     shall be null and void.

or\n       (B) the average number of claims that qualify for \n     compensation under a claim level or designation is less than \n     75 percent of the\n\n[[Page S1263]]\n\n     number of claims expected to qualify for compensation under \n     that claim level or designation in the most recent \n     Congressional Budget Office estimate of asbestos-injury \n     claims for any 3-year period, the Administrator shall conduct \n     a review of a statistically significant sample of claims \n     deemed ineligible for compensation under the appropriate \n     claim level or designation.\n       (2) Determinations.--The Administrator shall examine the \n     best available medical evidence and any recommendation made \n     under subsection (b)(5) in order to determine which 1 or more \n     of the following is true:\n       (A) Without a significant number of exceptions, all of the \n     claimants who qualified for compensation under the claim \n     level or designation suffer from an injury or disease for \n     which exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing \n     factor.\n       (B) A significant number of claimants who qualified for \n     compensation under the claim level or designation do not \n     suffer from an injury or disease for which exposure to \n     asbestos was a substantial contributing factor.\n       (C) A significant number of claimants who were denied \n     compensation under the claim level of designation did suffer \n     from an injury or disease for which exposure to asbestos was \n     a substantial contributing factor.\n       (D) The Congressional Budget Office projections \n     underestimated or overestimated the actual number of persons \n     who suffer from an injury or disease for which exposure to \n     asbestos was a substantial contributing factor.\n       (3) Recommendations concerning claims criteria.--If the \n     Administrator determines that a significant number of the \n     claimants who qualified for compensation under the claim \n     level under review do not suffer from an injury or disease \n     for which exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing \n     factor, or that a significant number of the claimants who \n     were denied compensation under the claim level under review \n     suffered from an injury or disease for which exposure to \n     asbestos was a substantial contributing factor, the \n     Administrator shall recommend to Congress, under subsection \n     (f), changes to the compensation criteria in order to ensure \n     that the Fund provides compensation for injury or disease for \n     which exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing \n     factor, but does not provide compensation to claimants who do \n     not suffer from an injury or disease for which asbestos \n     exposure was a substantial contributing factor.\n       (e) Recommendations of Administrator and Advisory \n     Committee.--\n       (1) Referral.--If the Administrator recommends changes to \n     this Act under subsection (d), the recommendations and \n     accompanying analysis shall be referred to the Advisory \n     Committee on Asbestos Disease Compensation established under \n     section 102 (in this subsection referred to as the ``Advisory \n     Committee'').\n       (2) Advisory committee recommendations.--The Advisory \n     Committee shall hold expedited public hearings on the \n     alternatives and recommendations of the Administrator and \n     make its own recommendations for reform of the program under \n     titles I and II.\n       (3) Transmittal to congress.--Not later than 90 days after \n     receiving the recommendations of the Administrator, the \n     Advisory Committee shall transmit the recommendations of the \n     Administrator and the recommendations of the Advisory \n     Committee to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and \n     the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (f) Shortfall Analysis.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Analysis.--If the Administrator concludes, at any time, \n     that the Fund may not be able to pay claims as such claims \n     become due at any time within the next 5 years and to satisfy \n     its other obligations, the Administrator shall prepare an \n     analysis of the reasons for the situation, an estimation of \n     when the Fund will no longer be able to pay claims as such \n     claims become due, a description of the range of reasonable \n     alternatives for responding to the situation, and a \n     recommendation as to which alternative best serves the \n     interest of claimants and the public. The report may include \n     a description of changes in the diagnostic, exposure, or \n     medical criteria of section 121 that the Administrator \n     believes may be necessary to protect the Fund. The \n     Administrator shall submit such analysis to the Committee on \n     the Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the House of Representatives. Any \n     recommendations made by the Administrator for changes to the \n     program shall, in addition, be referred to the Advisory \n     Committee on Asbestos Disease Compensation established under \n     section 102 for review.\n       (B) Range of alternatives.--The range of alternatives under \n     subparagraph (A) may include--\n       (ii) reform of the program set forth in titles I and II of \n     this Act (including changes in the diagnostic, exposure, or \n     medical criteria, changes in the enforcement or application \n     of those criteria, enhancement of enforcement authority, \n     changes in the timing of payments, changes in contributions \n     by defendant participants, insurer participants (or both such \n     participants), or changes in award values); or\n       (iii) any measure that the Administrator considers \n     appropriate.\n       (2) Considerations.--In formulating recommendations, the \n     Administrator shall take into account the reasons for any \n     shortfall, actual or projected, which may include--\n       (A) financial factors, including return on investments, \n     borrowing capacity, interest rates, ability to collect \n     contributions, and other relevant factors;\n       (B) the operation of the Fund generally, including \n     administration of the claims processing, the ability of the \n     Administrator to collect contributions from participants, \n     potential problems of fraud, the adequacy of the criteria to \n     rule out idiopathic mesothelioma, and inadequate flexibility \n     to extend the timing of payments;\n       (C) the appropriateness of the diagnostic, exposure, and \n     medical criteria, including the adequacy of the criteria to \n     rule out idiopathic mesothelioma;\n       (D) the actual incidence of asbestos-related diseases, \n     including mesothelioma, based on epidemiological studies and \n     other relevant data;\n       (E) compensation of diseases with alternative causes; and\n       (F) other factors that the Administrator considers \n     relevant.\n       (4) Resolved claims.--For purposes of this section, a claim \n     shall be deemed resolved when the Administrator has \n     determined the amount of the award due the claimant, and \n     either the claimant has waived judicial review or the time \n     for judicial review has expired.\n\n     SEC. 406.

The Administrator or \n     claims facility shall list all terminal health claims for \n     which notice has been provided under this clause on the \n     website established under clause (v).\n       (viii) Failure to pay.--If the Administrator or claims \n     facility does not pay the award as required under clause \n     (xiii), the Administrator shall refer the certified claim \n     within 10 days as a certified terminal health claim to the \n     defendants in the pending Federal and State court action or \n     to the potential defendants identified under clause (iii)(IV) \n     for terminal claims arising after the date of enactment of \n     this Act. The Administrator or claims facility shall list all \n     terminal health claims for which notice has been provided \n     under this clause on the website established under clause \n     (v).\n       (ix) Settlement offer.--Any participant or participants \n     may, within 30 days after receipt of such notice as provided \n     under clause (vii) or (viii), file and serve on all parties \n     and the Administrator a good faith settlement offer in an \n     aggregate amount not to exceed the total amount to which the \n     claimant would receive under section 131.

An acceptance of such settlement offer for claims \n     pending before the date of enactment of this Act shall be \n     subject to approval by the trial judge or authorized \n     magistrate in the court where the claim is pending. The court \n     shall approve any such accepted offer within 20 days after a \n     request, unless there is evidence of bad faith or fraud. No \n     court approval is necessary if the terminal health claim was \n     certified by the Administrator or claims facility under \n     clause (vi).\n       (x) Acceptance or rejection.--Within 20 days after receipt \n     of the settlement offer, or the amended settlement offer, the \n     claimant shall either accept or reject such offer in writing. \n     If the amount of the settlement offer made by the \n     Administrator, claims facility, or participants equals 100 \n     percent of what the claimant would receive under the Fund, \n     the claimant shall accept such settlement in writing.\n       (xi) Opportunity to cure.--If the settlement offer is \n     rejected for being less than what the claimant would receive \n     under the Fund, the participants shall have 10 business days \n     to make an amended offer. If the amended offer equals 100 \n     percent of what the claimant would receive under the Fund, \n     the claimant shall accept such settlement offer in writing. \n     If the settlement offer is again rejected as less than what \n     the claimant would\n\n[[Page S1272]]\n\n     receive under the Fund or if participants fail to make an \n     amended offer, the claimant shall recover 150 percent of what \n     the claimant would receive under the Fund. If the amount of \n     the amended settlement offer made by the Administrator, \n     claims facility, or participants equals 150 percent of what \n     the claimant would receive under the Fund, the claimant shall \n     accept such settlement in writing.\n       (xii) Payment schedule.--\n\n       (I) Mesothelioma claimants.--For mesothelioma claimants--\n\n       (aa) an initial payment of 50 percent shall be made within \n     30 days after the date the settlement is accepted and the \n     second and final payment shall be made 6 months after date \n     the settlement is accepted; or\n       (bb) if the Administrator determines that the payment \n     schedule would impose a severe financial hardship on the \n     Fund, or if the court determines that the settlement offer \n     would impose a severe financial hardship on the participant, \n     the payments may be extended 50 percent in 6 months and 50 \n     percent 11 months after the date the settlement offer is \n     accepted.\n\n       (II) Other terminal claimants.--For other terminal \n     claimants, as defined under section 106(c)(2)(B) and (C)--\n\n       (aa) the initial payment of 50 percent shall be made within \n     6 months after the date the settlement is accepted and the \n     second and final payment shall be made 12 months after date \n     the settlement is accepted; or\n       (bb) if the Administrator determines that the payment \n     schedule would impose a severe financial hardship on the \n     Fund, or if the court determines that the settlement offer \n     would impose a severe financial hardship on the participants, \n     the payments may be extended 50 percent within 1 year after \n     the date the settlement offer is accepted and 50 percent in 2 \n     years after date the settlement offer is accepted.\n\n       (III) Release.--Once a claimant has received final payment \n     of the accepted settlement offer, and penalty payment if \n     applicable, the claimant shall release any outstanding \n     asbestos claims.\n\n       (xiii) Recovery of costs.--\n\n       (I) In general.--Any participant whose settlement offer is \n     accepted may recover the cost of such settlement by deducting \n     from the participant's next and subsequent contributions to \n     the Fund the full amount of the payment made by such \n     participant to the terminal health claimant, unless the \n     Administrator finds, on the basis of clear and convincing \n     evidence, that the participant's offer is not in good faith. \n     Any such payment shall be considered a payment to the Fund \n     for purposes of section 404(e)(1) and in response to the \n     payment obligations imposed on participants in title II.\n       (II) Reimbursement.--Notwithstanding subclause (I), if the \n     deductions from the participant's next and subsequent \n     contributions to the Fund do not fully recover the cost of \n     such payments on or before its third annual contribution to \n     the Fund, the Fund shall reimburse such participant for such \n     remaining cost not later than 6 months after the date of the \n     third scheduled Fund contribution.\n\n       (xiv) Failure to make offer.--If participants fail to make \n     a settlement offer within the 30-day period described under \n     clause (ix) or make amended offers within the 10 business day \n     cure period described under clause (xi), the claimant shall \n     be entitled to recover 150 percent of what the claimant would \n     receive under the Fund.\n       (xv) Failure to pay.--If a participant fails to pay an \n     accepted settlement offer within the payment schedule under \n     clause (xii), the claimant shall be entitled to recover 150 \n     percent of what the claimant would receive under the Fund. If \n     the stay is lifted under subparagraph (B) the claimant may \n     seek a judgment or order for monetary damages from the court \n     where the case is currently pending or the appropriate \n     Federal or State court for claims arising after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (B) Stay terminated and reversion to court.--If 9 months \n     after a terminal health claim has been filed under \n     subparagraph (A), a claimant has not received a settlement \n     under subparagraph (A)(xii) and the Administrator has not \n     certified to Congress that the Fund or claims facility is \n     operational and paying terminal health claims at a reasonable \n     rate, the stay of claim provided under paragraph (1) shall be \n     lifted and such terminal health claimant, may immediately \n     seek a judgment or order for monetary damages from the court \n     where the case is currently pending or the appropriate \n     Federal or State court for claims arising after the date of \n     enactment of this Act. If a claimant has failed to file a \n     claim or notice of intent to seek a settlement, as required \n     under subparagraph (A)(ii), the provisions of this \n     subparagraph shall not apply.\n       (c) Continuance of Terminal Health Claims.--\n     Nothwithstanding section 106(f)(2) or any other provision of \n     this Act, any individual who has filed a terminal health \n     claim before the date of enactment of this Act may continue \n     that terminal health claim in the court where the case was \n     pending on the date of enactment of this Act. For terminal \n     health claims filed after the date of enactment of this Act \n     and before the Administrator certifies to Congress that the \n     Fund is operational and paying valid claims at a reasonable \n     rate, by claimants who do not elect to seek an offer of \n     judgment under subparagraph (A), the pending claim is not \n     stayed and such claimants may continue the terminal health \n     claims where the case is filed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2838.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness \n     in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2006'' or the ``FAIR Act \n     of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Millions of Americans have been exposed to forms of \n     asbestos that can have devastating health effects.\n       (2) Various injuries can be caused by exposure to some \n     forms of asbestos, including pleural disease and some forms \n     of cancer.\n       (3) The injuries caused by asbestos can have latency \n     periods of up to 40 years, and even limited exposure to some \n     forms of asbestos may result in injury in some cases.\n       (4) Asbestos litigation has had a significant detrimental \n     effect on the country's economy, driving companies into \n     bankruptcy, diverting resources from those who are truly \n     sick, and endangering jobs and pensions.\n       (5) The scope of the asbestos litigation crisis cuts across \n     every State and virtually every industry.\n       (6) The United States Supreme Court has recognized that \n     Congress must act to create a more rational asbestos claims \n     system. In 1991, a Judicial Conference Ad Hoc Committee on \n     Asbestos Litigation, appointed by Chief Justice William \n     Rehnquist, found that the ``ultimate solution should be \n     legislation recognizing the national proportions of the \n     problem . . . and creating a national asbestos dispute \n     resolution scheme . . . . The Court found in 1997 in Amchem \n     Products Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 595 (1997), that \n     ``[t]he argument is sensibly made that a nationwide \n     administrative claims processing regime would provide the \n     most secure, fair, and efficient means of compensating \n     victims of asbestos exposure.'' In 1999, the Court in Ortiz \n     v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 819, 821 (1999), found that the \n     ``elephantine mass of asbestos cases . . . defies customary \n     judicial administration and calls for national legislation.'' \n     That finding was again recognized in 2003 by the Court in \n     Norfolk & Western Railway Co. v. Ayers, 123 S. Ct. 1210 \n     (2003).\n       (7) This crisis, and its significant effect on the health \n     and welfare of the people of the United States, on interstate \n     and foreign commerce, and on the bankruptcy system, compels \n     Congress to exercise its power to regulate interstate \n     commerce and create this legislative solution in the form of \n     a national asbestos injury claims resolution program to \n     supersede all existing methods to compensate those injured by \n     asbestos, except as specified in this Act.\n       (8) This crisis has also imposed a deleterious burden upon \n     the United States bankruptcy courts, which have assumed a \n     heavy burden of administering complicated and protracted \n     bankruptcies with limited personnel.\n       (9) This crisis has devastated many communities across the \n     country, but hardest hit has been Libby, Montana, where \n     tremolite asbestos, 1 of the most deadly forms of asbestos, \n     was contained in the vermiculite ore mined from the area and \n     despite ongoing cleanup by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, many still suffer from the deadly dust.\n       (10) The asbestos found in Libby, Montana, tremolite \n     asbestos, has demonstrated an unusually high level of \n     toxicity, as compared to chrysotile asbestos. Diseases \n     contracted from this tremolite asbestos are unique and highly \n     progressive. These diseases typically manifest in a \n     characteristic pleural disease pattern, and often result in \n     severe impairment or death without radiographic interstitial \n     disease or typical chrysotile markers of radiographic \n     severity. According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and \n     Disease Registry previous studies by the National Institutes \n     of Occupational Safety and Health document significantly \n     increased rates of pulmonary abnormalities and disease \n     (asbestosis and lung cancer) among former workers.\n       (11) Environmental Protection Agency supported studies have \n     determined that the raw vermiculite ore mined and milled in \n     Libby, Montana contained 21 to 26 percent asbestos, by \n     weight. The milled ore, resulting from the processing in \n     Libby, which was shipped out of Libby contained markedly \n     reduced percentages of asbestos. A 1982 Environmental \n     Protection Agency-supported sutdy concluded that oreshipped \n     out of Libby contained 0.3 to 7 percent asbestos, by weight.\n       (12) In Libby, Montana, exposure pathways are and were not \n     limited to the workplace, rather, for decades there has been \n     an unprecedented 24 hour per day contamination of the \n     community's homes, playgrounds, gardens, and community air, \n     such that the entire community of Libby, Montana, has been \n     designated a Superfund site and is listed on the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's National Priorities List.\n       (13) These multiple exposure pathways have caused severe \n     asbestos disease and death not only in former workers at the \n     mine and milling facilities, but also in the workers' spouses \n     and children, and in community members who had no direct \n     contact with the mine. According to the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, some potentially important alternative \n     pathways for past asbestos exposure include elevated \n     concentrations of asbestos in ambient air and recreational \n     exposures from children playing in piles of vermiculite. \n     Furthermore, the Environmental Protection Agency has \n     determined that current potential pathways of exposure \n     include vermiculite placed in walls and attics as thermal \n     insulation, vermiculite or ore used as road bed material, ore \n     used as ornamental landscaping, and vermiculite or \n     concentrated ore used as a soil and garden amendment or \n     aggregate in driveways.\n       (14) The Environmental Protection Agency also concluded, \n     ``Asbestos contamination exists in a number of potential \n     source materials at multiple locations in and around the \n     residential and commercial area of Libby . . . While data are \n     not yet sufficient to perform reliable human-health risk \n     evaluations for all sources and all types of disturbance, it \n     is apparent that releases of fiber concentrations higher than \n     Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards may \n     occur in some cases . . . and that screening-level estimates \n     of lifetime excess cancer risk can exceed the upper-bound \n     risk range of 1E-04 usually used by the Environmental \n     Protection Agency for residents under a variety of exposure \n     scenarios. The occurrence of non-occupational asbestos-\n     related disease that has been observed among Libby residents \n     is extremely unusual, and has not been associated with \n     asbestos mines elsewhere, suggesting either very high and \n     prolonged environmental exposures and/or increased toxicity \n     of this form of amphibole asbestos.''.\n       (15) According to a November 2003 article from the Journal \n     Environmental Health Perspectives titled, Radiographic \n     Abnormalities and Exposure to Asbestos-Contaminated \n     Vermiculite in the Community of Libby, Montana, USA, Libby \n     residents who have evidence of ``no apparent exposure'', \n     i.e., did not work with asbestos, were not a family member of \n     a former worker, etc., had a greater rate of pleural \n     abnormalities (6.7 percent) than did those in control groups \n     or general populations found in other studies from other \n     states (which ranged from 0.2 percent to 4.6 percent). \n     ``Given the ubiquitous nature of vermiculite contamination in \n     Libby, along with historical evidence of elevated asbestos \n     concentrations in the air, it would be difficult to find \n     participants who could be characterized as unexposed.''.\n       (16) Nothing in this Act is intended to increase the \n     Federal deficit or impose any burden on the taxpayer. The \n     Office of Asbestos Disease Compensation established under \n     this Act shall be privately funded by annual payments from \n     defendant participants that have been subject to asbestos \n     liability and their insurers. Section 406(b) of this Act \n     expressly\n\n[[Page S1275]]\n\n     provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to \n     create any obligation of funding from the United States or to \n     require the United States to satisfy any claims if the \n     amounts in the Fund are inadequate. Any borrowing by the Fund \n     is limited to monies expected to be paid into the Fund, and \n     the Administrator shall have no fiscal authroity beyond the \n     amount of private money coming into the Fund.

If such decision materially differs from the \n     proposed decision, the claimant shall be entitled to review \n     of the decision under subsection (d).\n       (2) Time and content.--If the claimant requests review of \n     all or part of the proposed decision the Administrator shall \n     issue a final decision on the claim not later than 180 days \n     after the request for review is received, if the claimant \n     requests a hearing, or not later than 90 days after the \n     request for review is received, if the claimant requests \n     review of the written record. Such decision shall be in \n     writing and contain findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n       (f) Representation.--A claimant may authorize an attorney \n     or other individual to\n\n[[Page S1281]]\n\n     represent him or her in any proceeding under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 115.

For purposes of this \n     subsection, the term ``affiliated group'' shall include any \n     defendant participant that is an ultimate parent. The \n     limitation in this subsection shall not apply to defendant \n     participants in Tier I or to any affiliated group whose \n     revenues for the most recent fiscal year ending on or prior \n     to December 31, 2002, or for the most recent 12-month fiscal \n     year as of the date the limitation applied, whichever is \n     greater, exceeds $1,000,000,000. The revenues of the \n     affiliated group shall be determined in accordance with \n     section 203(a)(2), except for the applicable date. An \n     affiliated group that claims a reduction in its payment in \n     any year shall file with the Administrator, in accordance \n     with procedures prescribed by the Administrator, sufficient \n     infonnation to allow the Administrator to determine the \n     amount of any such reduction in that year. If as a result of \n     the application of the limitation provided in this subsection \n     an affiliated group is exempt from paying all or part of a \n     guaranteed payment surcharge or bankruptcy trust surcharge, \n     then the reduction in the affiliated group's payment \n     obligation due to the limitation in this subsection shall be \n     redistributed in accordance with subsection (m). Nothing in \n     this subsection shall be construed as reducing the minimum \n     aggregate annual payment obligation of defendant participants \n     as provided in section 204(i)(1).''\n\n[[Page S1289]]\n\n       (d) Procedures.--The Administrator shall prescribe \n     procedures on how amounts payable under this subtitle are to \n     be paid, including, to the extent the Administrator \n     determines appropriate, procedures relating to payment in \n     installments.\n       (e) Adjustments.--\n       (1) In general.--Under expedited procedures established by \n     the Administrator, a defendant participant may seek \n     adjustment of the amount of its payment obligation based on \n     severe financial hardship or demonstrated inequity. The \n     Administrator may determine whether to grant an adjustment \n     and the size of any such adjustment, in accordance with this \n     subsection. A defendant participant has a right to obtain a \n     rehearing of the Administrator's determination under this \n     subsection under the procedures prescribed in subsection \n     (j)(10). The Administrator may adjust a defendant \n     participant's payment obligations under this subsection, \n     either by forgiving the relevant portion of the otherwise \n     applicable payment obligation or by providing relevant \n     rebates from the defendant hardship and inequity adjustment \n     account created under subsection (k) after payment of the \n     otherwise applicable payment obligation, at the discretion of \n     the Administrator.\n       (2) Financial hardship adjustments.--\n       (A) In General.--Any defendant participant in any tier may \n     apply for an adjustment under this paragraph at any time \n     during the period in which a payment obligation to the Fund \n     remains outstanding and may qualify for such an adjustment by \n     demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Administrator that \n     the amount of its payment obligation would materially and \n     adversely affect the defendant participant's ability to \n     continue its business and to pay or satisfy its debts \n     generally as and when they come due. Such an adjustment shall \n     be in an amount that in the judgment of the Administrator is \n     reasonably necessary to prevent such material and adverse \n     effect on the defendant participant's ability to continue its \n     business and to pay or satisfy its debts generally as and \n     when they come due.\n       (B) Factors to consider.--In determining whether to make an \n     adjustment under subparagraph (A) and the amount thereof, the \n     Administrator shall consider--\n       (1) the financial situation of the defendant participant \n     and its affiliated group as shown in historical audited \n     financial statements, including income statement, balance \n     sheet, and statement of cash flow, for the three fiscal years \n     ending immediately prior to the application and projected \n     financial statements for the three fiscal years following the \n     application;\n       (2) an analysis of capital spending and fixed charge \n     coverage on a historical basis for the three fiscal years \n     immediately preceding a defendant participant's application \n     and for the three fiscal years following the application;\n       (3) any payments or transfers of property made, or \n     obligations incurred, within the preceding 6 years by the \n     defendant participant to or for the benefit of any insider as \n     defined under section 101 (31) of title 11 of the United \n     States Code or any affiliate as defined under section 101(2) \n     of title 11 of the United States Code;\n       (4) any prior extraordinary transactions within the \n     preceding 6 years involving the defendant participant, \n     including without limitation payments of extraordinary \n     salaries, bonuses, or dividends;\n       (5) the defendant participant's ability to satisfy its \n     payment obligations to the Fund by borrowing or financing \n     with equity capital, or through issuance of securities of the \n     defendant participant or its affiliated group to the Fund;\n       (6) the defendant participant's ability to delay \n     discretionary capital spending; and\n       (7) any other factor that the Administrator considers \n     relevant.\n       (B) Term.--A financial hardship adjustment under this \n     paragraph shall have a term of 5 years unless the \n     Administrator determines at the time the adjustment is made \n     that a shorter or longer period is appropriate in the light \n     of the financial condition of the defendant participant and \n     its affiliated group and other relevant factors, provided \n     that a financial hardship adjustment under this paragraph \n     shall terminate automatically in the event that the defendant \n     participant holding the adjustment files a petition under \n     title 11, United States Code.\n       (C) Renewal.--A defendant participant may renew a hardship \n     adjustment upon expiration by demonstrating that it remains \n     justified. Such renewed hardship adjustments shall have a \n     term of 5 years unless the Administrator determines at the \n     time of the renewed adjustment that a shorter or longer \n     period is appropriate in the light of the financial condition \n     of the defendant participant and its affiliated group and \n     other relevant factors, provided that a renewed financial \n     hardship adjustment under this paragraph shall terminate \n     automatically in the event that the defendant participant \n     holding the adjustment files a petition under title 11, \n     United States Code.\n       (D) Procedure.--\n       (1) The Administrator shall prescribe the information to be \n     submitted in applications for adjustments under this \n     paragraph.\n       (2) All audited financial information required under this \n     paragraph shall be as reported by the defendant participant \n     in its annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of \n     1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). Any defendant participant that \n     does not file reports with the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission or which does not have audited financial \n     statements shall submit financial statements prepared \n     pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles. The \n     chairman, chief executive officer, and chief financial \n     officer of the defendant participant shall certify under \n     penalty of law the completeness and accuracy of the financial \n     statements provided under this sub-paragraph.\n       (3) The chairman, chief executive officer, and chief \n     financial officer of the defendant participant shall certify \n     that any projected information and analyses submitted to the \n     Administrator were made in good faith and are reasonable and \n     attainable.\n       (3) Inequity adjustments.--\n       (A) In general.--A defendant participant--\n       (i) may qualify for an adjustment based on inequity by \n     demonstrating that the amount of its payment obligation under \n     the statutory allocation is exceptionally inequitable--\n\n       (I) when measured against the amount of the likely cost to \n     the defendant participant net of insurance of its future \n     liability in the tort system in the absence of the Fund;\n       (II) when measured against the likely cost of past and \n     potential future claims in the absence of this Act;\n       (III) when compared to the median payment rate for all \n     defendant participants in the same tier; or\n       (IV) when measured against the percentage of the prior \n     asbestos expenditures of the defendant that were incurred \n     with respect to claims that neither resulted in an adverse \n     judgment against the defendant, nor were the subject of a \n     settlement that required a payment to a plaintiff by or on \n     behalf of that defendant;\n\n       (ii) shall be granted a two-tier main tier and a two-tier \n     subtier adjustment reducing the defendant participant's \n     payment obligation based on inequity by demonstrating that \n     not less than 95 percent of such person's prior asbestos \n     expenditures arose from claims related to the manufacture and \n     sale of railroad locomotives and related products, so long as \n     such person's manufacture and sale of railroad locomotives \n     and related products is temporally and causally remote, and \n     for purposes of this clause, a person's manufacture and sale \n     of railroad locomotives and related products shall be deemed \n     to be temporally and causally remote if the asbestos claims \n     historically and generally filed against such person relate \n     to the manufacture and sale of railroad locomotives and \n     related products by an entity dissolved more than 25 years \n     before the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (iii) shall be granted a two-tier adjustment reducing the \n     defendant participant's payment obligation based on inequity \n     by demonstrating that not less than 95 percent of such \n     participant's prior asbestos expenditures arose from asbestos \n     claims based on successor liability arising from a merger to \n     which the participant or its predecessor was a party that \n     occurred at least 30 years before the date of enactment of \n     this Act, and that such prior asbestos expenditures exceed \n     the inflation-adjusted value of the assets of the company \n     from which such liability was derived in such merger, and \n     upon such demonstration the Administrator shall grant such \n     adjustment for the life of the Fund and amounts paid by such \n     defendant participant prior to such adjustment in excess of \n     its adjusted payment obligation under this clause shall be \n     credited against next succeeding required payment \n     obligations; and\n       (iv) may, subject to the discretion of the Administrator, \n     be exempt from any payment obligation if such defendant \n     participant establishes with the Administrator that--\n\n       (I) such participant has satisfied all past claims; and\n       (II) there is no reasonable likelihood in the absence of \n     this Act of any future claims with costs for which the \n     defendant participant might be responsible.\n\n       (B) Payment rate.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the \n     payment rate of a defendant participant is the payment amount \n     of the defendant participant as a percentage of such \n     defendant participant's gross revenues for the year ending \n     December 31, 2002.\n       (C) Term.--Subject to the annual availability of funds in \n     the defendant inequity adjustment account established under \n     subsection (k), an inequity adjustment under this subsection \n     shall have a term of 3 years.\n       (D) Renewal.--A defendant participant may renew an inequity \n     adjustment every 3 years by demonstrating that the adjustment \n     remains justified.\n       (E) Reinstatement.--\n       (i) In general.--Following the termination of an inequity \n     adjustment under subparagraph (A), and during the funding \n     period prescribed under subsection (a), the Administrator \n     shall annually determine whether there has been a material \n     change in conditions which would support a finding that the \n     amount of the defendant participant's payment under the \n     statutory allocation was not inequitable. Based on this \n     determination, the Administrator may, consistent with the \n     policies and legislative intent underlying this Act, \n     reinstate any or all of the payment obligations of the \n     defendant participant as if the inequity adjustment had not \n     been granted for that 3-year period.\n       (ii) Terms and conditions.--In the event of a reinstatement \n     under clause (i), the Administrator may require the defendant \n     participant to pay any part or all of amounts not paid due to \n     the inequity adjustment on such terms and conditions as \n     established by the Administrator.\n\n[[Page S1290]]\n\n       (4) Limitation on adjustments.--The aggregate total of \n     inequity adjustments under paragraph (3) in effect in any \n     given year shall not exceed $300,000,000, except to the \n     extent that additional monies are available for such \n     adjustments as a result of carryover of prior years' funds \n     under subsection (k)(3) or as a result of monies being made \n     available in that year under subsection (l)(1)(A).\n       (B) the Administrator determines that the $300,000,000 is \n     insufficient and additional adjustments as provided under \n     paragraph (5) are needed to address situations in which a \n     defendant participant would otherwise be rendered insolvent \n     by its payment obligations without such adjustment.\n       (6) Rulemaking and advisory panels.--\n       (A) Appointment.--The Administrator may appoint a Financial \n     Hardship Adjustment Panel and an Inequity Adjustment Panel to \n     advise the Administrator in carrying out this subsection.\n       (B) Membership.--The membership of the panels appointed \n     under subparagraph (A) may overlap.\n       (C) Coordination.--The panels appointed under subparagraph \n     (A) shall coordinate their deliberations and advice. The \n     Administrator may adopt rules consistent with this Act to \n     make the determination of hardship and inequity adjustments \n     more efficient and predictable.\n       (f) Limitation on Liability.--The liability of each \n     defendant participant to pay to the Fund shall be limited to \n     the payment obligations under this Act, and, except as \n     provided in subsection (f) and section 203(b)(2)(D), no \n     defendant participant shall have any liability for the \n     payment obligations of any other defendant participant.\n       (g) Consolidation of Payments.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of determining the payment \n     levels of defendant participants, any affiliated group \n     including 1 or more defendant participants may irrevocably \n     elect, as part of the submissions to be made under paragraphs \n     (1) and (3) of subsection (j), to report on a consolidated \n     basis all of the information necessary to determine the \n     payment level under this subtitle and pay to the Fund on a \n     consolidated basis.\n       (2) Election.--If an affiliated group elects consolidation \n     as provided in this subsection--\n       (A) for purposes of this Act other than this subsection, \n     the affiliated group shall be treated as if it were a single \n     participant, including with respect to the assessment of a \n     single annual payment under this subtitle for the entire \n     affiliated group;\n       (B) the ultimate parent of the affiliated group shall \n     prepare and submit each submission to be made under \n     subsection (i) on behalf of the entire affiliated group and \n     shall be solely liable, as between the Administrator and the \n     affiliated group only, for the payment of the annual amount \n     due from the affiliated group under this subtitle, except \n     that, if the ultimate parent does not pay when due any \n     payment obligation for the affiliated group, the \n     Administrator shall have the right to seek payment of all or \n     any portion of the entire amount due (as well as any other \n     amount for which the affiliated group may be liable under \n     sections 223 and 224) from any member of the affiliated \n     group;\n       (C) all members of the affiliated group shall be identified \n     in the submission under subsection (j) and shall certify \n     compliance with this subsection and the Administrator's \n     regulations implementing this subsection; and\n       (D) the obligations under this subtitle shall not change \n     even if, after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     beneficial ownership interest between any members of the \n     affiliated group shall change.\n       (3) Cause of action.--Notwithstanding section 221(e), this \n     Act shall not preclude actions among persons within an \n     affiliated group with respect to the payment obligations \n     under this Act.\n       (h) Determination of Prior Asbestos Expenditures.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of determining a defendant \n     participant's prior asbestos expenditures, the Administrator \n     shall prescribe such rules as may be necessary or appropriate \n     to assure that payments by indemnitors before December 31, \n     2002, shall be counted as part of the indemnitor's prior \n     asbestos expenditures, rather than the indemnitee's prior \n     asbestos expenditures, in accordance with this subsection.\n       (2) Indemnifiable costs.--If an indemnitor has paid or \n     reimbursed to an indemnitee any indemnifiable cost or \n     otherwise made a payment on behalf of or for the benefit of \n     an indemnitee to a third party for an indemnifiable cost \n     before December 31, 2002, the amount of such indemnifiable \n     cost shall be solely for the account of the indemnitor for \n     purposes under this Act.\n       (3) Insurance payments.--When computing the prior asbestos \n     expenditures with respect to an asbestos claim, any amount \n     paid or reimbursed by insurance shall be solely for the \n     account of the indemnitor, even if the indemnitor would have \n     no direct right to the benefit of the insurance, if--\n       (A) such insurance has been paid or reimbursed to the \n     indemnitor or the indemnitee, or paid on behalf of or for the \n     benefit of the indemnitee; and\n       (B) the indemnitor has either, with respect to such \n     asbestos claim or any similar asbestos claim, paid or \n     reimbursed to its indemnitee any indemnifiable cost or paid \n     to any third party on behalf of or for the benefit of the \n     indemnitee any indemnifiable cost.\n       (4) Treatment of certain expenditures.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of this Act, where--\n       (A) an indemnitor entered into a stock purchase agreement \n     in 1988 that involved the sale of the stock of businesses \n     that produced friction and other products; and\n       (B) the stock purchase agreement provided that the \n     indemnitor indemnified the indemnitee and its affiliates for \n     losses arising from various matters, including asbestos \n     claims--\n       (i) asserted before the date of the agreement; and\n       (ii) filed after the date of the agreement and prior to the \n     10-year anniversary of the stock sale,\n     then the prior asbestos expenditures arising from the \n     asbestos claims described in clauses (i) and (ii) shall not \n     be for the account of either the indemnitor or indemnitee.\n       (i) Minimum Annual Payments.--\n       (1) In general.--The aggregate annual payments of defendant \n     participants to the Fund shall be at least $3,000,000,000 for \n     each calendar year in the first 30 years of the Fund, or \n     until such shorter time as the condition set forth in \n     subsection (a)(2) is attained.\n       (2) Guaranteed payment account.--To the extent payments in \n     accordance with sections 202 and 203 (as modified by \n     subsections (b), (e), (g), (h), and (n) of this section) fail \n     in any year to raise at least $3,000,000,000, after \n     applicable reductions or adjustments have been taken \n     according to subsections (e) and (n), the balance needed to \n     meet this required minimum aggregate annual payment shall be \n     obtained from the defendant guaranteed payment account \n     established under subsection (k).\n       (j) Procedures for Making Payments.--\n       (1) Initial year: tiers ii-vi.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 90 days after enactment of \n     this Act, each defendant participant that is included in \n     Tiers II, III, IV, V, or VI shall file with the \n     Administrator--\n       (i) a statement of whether the defendant participant \n     irrevocably elects to report on a consolidated basis under \n     subsection (g);\n       (ii) a good-faith estimate of its prior asbestos \n     expenditures;\n       (iii) a statement of its 2002 revenues, determined in \n     accordance with section 203(a)(2);\n       (iv) payment in the amount specified in section 203 for the \n     lowest subtier of the tier within which the defendant \n     participant falls, except that if the defendant participant, \n     or the affiliated group including the defendant participant, \n     had 2002 revenues exceeding $3,000,000,000, it or its \n     affiliated group shall pay the amount specified for Subtier 3 \n     of Tiers II, III, or IV or Subtier 2 of Tiers V or VI, \n     depending on the applicable Tier; and\n       (v) a signature page personally verifying the truth of the \n     statements and estimates described under this subparagraph, \n     as required under section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of \n     2002 (15 U.S.C. 7201 et seq.).\n       (B) Relief.--\n       (i) In general.--The Administrator shall establish \n     procedures to grant a defendant participant relief from its \n     initial payment obligation if the participant shows that--\n\n       (I) the participant is likely to qualify for a financial \n     hardship adjustment; and\n       (II) failure to provide interim relief would cause severe \n     irreparable harm.\n\n       (ii) Judicial relief.--The Administrator's refusal to grant \n     relief under clause (i) is subject to immediate judicial \n     review under section 303.\n       (2) Initial year: tier i.--Not later than 60 days after \n     enactment of this Act, each debtor shall file with the \n     Administrator--\n       (A) a statement identifying the bankruptcy case(s) \n     associated with the debtor;\n       (B) a statement whether its prior asbestos expenditures \n     exceed $1,000,000;\n       (C) a statement whether it has material continuing business \n     operations and, if not, whether it holds cash or other assets \n     that have been allocated or earmarked for asbestos \n     settlements;\n       (D) in the case of debtors falling within Subtier 1 of Tier \n     I--\n       (i) a statement of the debtor's 2002 revenues, determined \n     in accordance with section 203(a)(2);\n       (ii) for those debtors subject to the payment requirement \n     of section 203(b)(2)(B)(ii), a statement whether its prior \n     asbestos expenditures do not exceed $10,000,000, and a \n     description of its business operations sufficient to show the \n     requirements of that section are met; and\n       (iii) a payment under section 203(b)(2)(B);\n       (E) in the case of debtors falling within Subtier 2 of Tier \n     I, an assignment of its assets under section 203(b)(3)(B);\n       (F) in the case of debtors falling within Subtier 3 of Tier \n     I, a payment under section 203(b)(4)(B), and a statement of \n     how such payment was calculated; and\n       (G) a signature page personally verifying the truth of the \n     statements and estimates described under this paragraph, as \n     required under section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 \n     (15 U.S.C. 7201 et seq.).\n       (3) Initial year: tier vii.--Not later than 90 days after \n     enactment of this Act, each defendant participant in Tier VII \n     shall file with the Administrator--\n       (A) a good-faith estimate of all payments of the type \n     described in section 203(h)(1) (as modified by section \n     203(h)(6));\n       (B) a statement of revenues calculated in accordance with \n     sections 203(a)(2) and 203(h);

and\n       (B) publish in the Federal Register a notice--\n       (i) setting forth the criteria in this Act, and as \n     prescribed by the Administrator in accordance with this Act, \n     for paying under this subtitle as a defendant participant and \n     requiring any person who may be a defendant participant to \n     submit such information; and\n       (ii) that includes a list of all defendant participants \n     notified by the Administrator under subparagraph (A), and \n     provides for 30 days for the submission by the public of \n     comments or information regarding the completeness and \n     accuracy of the list of identified defendant participants.\n       (5) Response required.--\n       (A) In general.--Any person who receives notice under \n     paragraph (4)(A), and any other person meeting the criteria \n     specified in the notice published under paragraph (4)(B), \n     shall provide the Administrator with an address to send any \n     notice from the Administrator in accordance with this Act and \n     all the information required by the Administrator in \n     accordance with this subsection no later than the earlier \n     of--\n       (i) 30 days after the receipt of direct notice; or\n       (ii) 30 days after the publication of notice in the Federal \n     Register.\n       (B) Certification.--The response submitted under \n     subparagraph (A) shall be signed by a responsible corporate \n     officer, general partner, proprietor, or individual of \n     similar authority, who shall certify under penalty of law the \n     completeness and accuracy of the information submitted.\n       (C) Consent to audit authority.--The response submitted \n     under subparagraph (A) shall include, on behalf of the \n     defendant participant or affiliated group, a consent to the \n     Administrator's audit authority under section 221(d).\n       (6) Notice of initial determination.--\n       (A) In general.--\n       (i) Notice to individual.--Not later than 60 days after \n     receiving a response under paragraph (5), the Administrator \n     shall send the person a notice of initial determination \n     identifying the tier and subtier, if any, into which the \n     person falls and the annual payment obligation, if any, to \n     the Fund, which determination shall be based on the \n     information received from the person under this subsection \n     and any other pertinent information available to the \n     Administrator and identified to the defendant participant.\n       (ii) Public notice.--Not later than 7 days after sending \n     the notification of initial determination to defendant \n     participants, the Administrator shall publish in the Federal \n     Register a notice listing the defendant participants that \n     have been sent such notification, and the initial \n     determination identifying the tier and subtier assignment and \n     annual payment obligation of each identified participant.\n       (B) No response; incomplete response.--If no response in \n     accordance with paragraph (5) is received from a defendant \n     participant, or if the response is incomplete, the initial \n     determination shall be based on the best information \n     available to the Administrator.\n       (C) Payments.--Within 30 days of receiving a notice of \n     initial determination requiring payment, the defendant \n     participant shall pay the Administrator the amount required \n     by the notice, after deducting any previous payment made by \n     the participant under this subsection. If the amount that the \n     defendant participant is required to pay is less than any \n     previous payment made by the participant under this \n     subsection, the Administrator shall credit any excess payment \n     against the future payment obligations of that defendant \n     participant. The pendency of a petition for rehearing under \n     paragraph (10) shall not stay the obligation of the \n     participant to make the payment specified in the \n     Administrator's notice.\n       (7) Exemptions for information required.--\n       (A) Prior asbestos expenditures.--In lieu of submitting \n     information related to prior asbestos expenditures as may be \n     required for purposes of this subtitle, a non-debtor \n     defendant participant may consent to be assigned to Tier II.\n       (B) Revenues.--In lieu of submitting information related to \n     revenues as may be required for purposes of this subtitle, a \n     non-debtor defendant participant may consent to be assigned \n     to Subtier 1 of the defendant participant's applicable tier.\n       (8) New information.--\n       (A) Existing participant.--The Administrator shall adopt \n     procedures for requiring additional payment, or refunding \n     amounts already paid, based on new information received.\n       (B) Additional participant.--If the Administrator, at any \n     time, receives information that an additional person may \n     qualify as a defendant participant, the Administrator shall \n     require such person to submit information necessary to \n     determine whether that person is required to make payments, \n     and in what amount, under this subtitle and shall make any \n     determination or take any other act consistent with this Act \n     based on such information or any other information available \n     to the Administrator with respect to such person.\n       (9) Subpoenas.--The Administrator may request the Attorney \n     General to subpoena persons to compel testimony, records, and \n     other information relevant to its responsibilities under this \n     section. The Attorney General may enforce such subpoena in \n     appropriate proceedings in the United States district court \n     for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena was \n     addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.\n       (10) Rehearing.--A defendant participant has a right to \n     obtain rehearing of the Administrator's determination under \n     this subsection of the applicable tier or subtier of the \n     Administrator's determination under subsection (e) of a \n     financial hardship or inequity adjustment, and of the \n     Administrator's determination under subsection (n) of a \n     distributor's adjustment, if the request for rehearing is \n     filed within 30 days after the defendant participant's \n     receipt of notice from the Administrator of the \n     determination. A defendant participant may not file an action \n     under section 303 unless the defendant participant requests a \n     rehearing under this paragraph. The Administrator shall \n     publish a notice in the Federal Register of any change in a \n     defendant participant's tier or subtier assignment or payment \n     obligation as a result of a rehearing.\n       (k) Defendant Inequity Adjustment Account.--\n       (1) In general.--To the extent the total payments by \n     defendant participants in any given year exceed the minimum \n     aggregate annual payments required under subsection (i), \n     excess monies up to a maximum of $300,000,000 in any such \n     year shall be placed in a defendant inequity adjustment \n     account established within the Fund by the Administrator.\n       (2) Use of account monies.--Monies from the defendant \n     inequity adjustment account shall be preserved and \n     administered like the remainder of the Fund, but shall be \n     reserved and may be used only--\n       (A) to make up for any relief granted to a defendant \n     participant for demonstrated inequity under subsection (d) or \n     to reimburse any defendant participant granted such relief \n     after its payment of the amount otherwise due; and\n       (B) if the condition set forth in subsection (a)(2) is met, \n     for any purpose that the Fund may serve under this Act.\n       (3) Carryover of unused funds.--To the extent the \n     Administrator does not, in any given year, use all of the \n     funds allocated to the account under paragraph (1) for \n     adjustments granted under subsection (e), remaining funds in \n     the account shall be carried forward for use by the \n     Administrator for adjustments in subsequent years.\n       (l) Defendant Guaranteed Payment Account.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to subsections (i) and (k), if \n     there are excess monies paid by defendant participants in any \n     given year, including any bankruptcy trust credits that may \n     be due under section 222(d), such monies--\n       (A) at the discretion of the Administrator, may be used to \n     provide additional adjustments under subsection (e), up to a \n     maximum aggregate of $50,000,000 in such year; and\n       (B) to the extent not used under subparagraph (A), shall be \n     placed in a defendant guaranteed payment account established \n     within the Fund by the Administrator.\n       (2) Use of account monies.--Monies from the defendant \n     guaranteed payment account shall be preserved and \n     administered like the remainder of the Fund, but shall be \n     reserved and may be used only--\n       (A) to ensure the minimum aggregate annual payment required \n     under subsection (i), after applicable reductions or \n     adjustments have been taken according to subsections (e) and \n     (m) is reached each year; and\n       (B) if the condition set forth in subsection (a)(2) is met, \n     for any purpose that the Fund may serve under this Act.\n       (n) Adjustments for Distributors.--\n       (1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term \n     ``distributor'' means a person--\n       (A) whose prior asbestos expenditures arise exclusively \n     from the sale of products manufactured by others;\n       (B) who did not prior to December 31, 2002, sell raw \n     asbestos or a product containing more than 95 percent \n     asbestos by weight;\n       (C) whose prior asbestos expenditures did not arise out \n     of--\n       (i) the manufacture, installation, repair, reconditioning, \n     maintaining, servicing, constructing, or remanufacturing of \n     any product;\n       (ii) the control of the design, specification, or \n     manufacture of any product; or\n       (iii) the sale or resale of any product under, as part of, \n     or under the auspices of, its own brand, trademark, or \n     service mark; and\n       (D) who is not subject to assignment under section 202 to \n     Tier I, II, III or VII.\n       (2) Tier reassignment for distributors.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding section 202, the \n     Administrator shall assign a distributor to a Tier for \n     purposes of this title under the procedures set forth in this \n     paragraph.\n       (B) Designation.--After a final determination by the \n     Administrator under section 204(j), any person who is, or any \n     affiliated group in which every member is, a distributor may \n     apply to the Administrator for adjustment of its Tier \n     assignment under this subsection. Such application shall be \n     prepared in accordance with such procedures as\n\n[[Page S1292]]\n\n     the Administrator shall promulgate by rule. Once the \n     Administrator designates a person or affiliated group as a \n     distributor under this subsection, such designation and the \n     adjustment of tier assignment under this subsection are \n     final.\n       (C) Payments.--Any person or affiliated group that seeks \n     adjustment of its Tier assignment under this subsection shall \n     pay all amounts required of it under this title until a final \n     determination by the Administrator is made under this \n     subsection. Such payments may not be stayed pending any \n     appeal. The Administrator shall grant any person or \n     affiliated group a refund or credit of any payments made if \n     such adjustment results in a lower payment obligation.\n       (D) Adjustment.--Subject to paragraph (3), any person or \n     affiliated group that the Administrator has designated as a \n     distributor under this subsection shall be given an \n     adjustment of Tier assignment as follows:\n       (i) A distributor that but for this subsection would be \n     assigned to Tier IV shall be deemed assigned to Tier V.\n       (ii) A distributor that but for this subsection would be \n     assigned to Tier V shall be deemed assigned to Tier VI.\n       (iii) A distributor that but for this subsection would be \n     assigned to Tier VI shall be deemed assigned to no Tier and \n     shall have no obligation to make any payment to the Fund \n     under this Act.\n       (E) Exclusive to inequity adjustment.--Any person or \n     affiliated group designated by the Administrator as a \n     distributor under this subsection shall not be eligible for \n     an inequity adjustment under subsection 204(e).\n       (3) Limitation on adjustments.--The aggregate total of \n     distributor adjustments under this subsection in effect in \n     any given year shall not exceed $50,000,000. If the aggregate \n     total of distributors adjustments under this subsection would \n     otherwise exceed $50,000,000, then each distributor's \n     adjustment shall be reduced pro rata until the aggregate of \n     all adjustments equals $50,000,000.\n       (4) Rehearing.--A defendant participant has a right to \n     obtain a rehearing of the Administrator's determination on an \n     adjustment under this subsection under the procedures \n     prescribed in subsection (j)(10).\n\n     SEC. 205. STEPDOWNS AND FUNDING HOLIDAYS.\n\n       (a) Stepdowns.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the minimum \n     aggregate annual funding obligation under section 204(i) \n     shall be reduced by 10 percent of the initial minimum \n     aggregate funding obligation at the end of the tenth, \n     fifteenth, twentieth, and twenty-fifth years after the date \n     of enactment of this Act. Except as otherwise provided in \n     this paragraph, the reductions under this paragraph shall be \n     applied on an equal pro rata basis to the funding obligations \n     of all defendant participants.\n       The reductions under this subsection shall not apply to \n     defendant participants in Tier I, subtiers 2 and 3, and class \n     action trusts. For defendant participants whose payment \n     obligation has been limited under section 204(c) or who have \n     received a financial hardship adjustment under section \n     204(e)(2), aggregate potential reductions under this \n     subsection shall be calculated on the basis of the defendant \n     participant's tier and subtier without regard to such \n     limitation or adjustment. If the aggregate potential \n     reduction under this subsection exceeds the reduction in the \n     defendant participant's payment obligation due to the \n     limitation under section 204(c) and the financial hardship \n     adjustment under section 204(e)(2), then the defendant \n     participant's payment obligations shall be further reduced by \n     the difference between the potential reduction provided under \n     this subsection and the reductions that the defendant \n     participant has already received due to the application of \n     the limitation provided in section 204(c) and the financial \n     hardship adjustment provided under section 204(e)(2). If the \n     reduction in the defendant participant's payment obligation \n     due to the limitation provided in section 204(c) and any the \n     financial hardship adjustment provided under section \n     204(e)(2) exceeds the amount of the reduction provided in \n     this subsection, then the defendant participant's payment \n     obligation shall not be further reduced under this paragraph.\n       (2) Limitation.--The Administrator shall suspend, cancel, \n     reduce, or delay any reduction under paragraph (1) if at any \n     time the Administrator finds, in accordance with subsection \n     (c), that such action is necessary and appropriate to ensure \n     that the assets of the Fund and expected future payments \n     remain sufficient to satisfy the Fund's anticipated \n     obligations.\n       (b) Funding Holidays.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Administrator determines, at any \n     time after 10 years following the date of enactment of this \n     Act, that the assets of the Fund at the time of such \n     determination and expected future payments, taking into \n     consideration any reductions under subsection (a), are \n     sufficient to satisfy the Fund's anticipated obligations \n     without the need for all, or any portion of, that year's \n     payment otherwise required under this subtitle, the \n     Administrator shall reduce or waive all or any part of the \n     payments required from defendant participants for that year.\n       (2) Annual review.--The Administrator shall undertake the \n     review required by this subsection and make the necessary \n     determination under paragraph (1) every year.\n       (3) Limitations on funding holidays.--Any reduction or \n     waiver of the defendant participants' funding obligations \n     shall--\n       (A) be made only to the extent the Administrator determines \n     that the Fund will still be able to satisfy all of its \n     anticipated obligations; and\n       (B) be applied on an equal pro rata basis to the funding \n     obligations of all defendant participants, except as \n     otherwise provided under this paragraph. The reductions or \n     waivers provided under this subsection shall not apply to \n     defendant participants in Tier I, subtiers 2 and 3, and class \n     action trusts. For defendant participants whose payment \n     obligation has been limited under section 204(c0 or who have \n     received a financial hardship adjustment under section \n     204(e)(2), aggregate potential reductions or waivers under \n     this subsection shall be calculated on the basis of the \n     defendant participant's tier and subtier without regard to \n     such limitation or adjustment. If the aggregate potential \n     reductions or waivers under this subsection exceed the \n     reduction in the defendant participant's payment obligation \n     due to the limitation under section 204(c) and the financial \n     hardship adjustment under section 204(e)(2), then the \n     defendant participant's payment obligation shall be further \n     reduced by the difference between the potential reductions or \n     waivers provided under this subsection and the reductions \n     that the defendant participant has already received due to \n     the application of the limitation provided in section 204(c) \n     and the financial hardship adjustment provided under section \n     204(e)(2). If the reduction in the defendant participant's \n     payment obligation due to the limitation provided in section \n     204(c) and any the financial hardship adjustment provided \n     under section 204(e)(2) exceeds the amount of the reductions \n     or waivers provided in this subsection, then the defendant \n     participant's payment obligation shall not be further reduced \n     under this paragraph.\n       (4) New information.--If at any time the Administrator \n     determines that a reduction or waiver under this section may \n     cause the assets of the Fund and expected future payments to \n     decrease to a level at which the Fund may not be able to \n     satisfy all of its anticipated obligations, the Administrator \n     shall revoke all or any part of such reduction or waiver to \n     the extent necessary to ensure that the Fund's obligations \n     are met. Such revocations shall be applied on an equal pro \n     rata basis to the funding obligations of all defendant \n     participants, except defendant participants in Subtiers 2 and \n     3 of Tier I and class action trusts, for that year.\n       (c) Certification.--\n       (1) In general.--Before suspending, canceling, reducing, or \n     delaying any reduction under subsection (a) or granting or \n     revoking a reduction or waiver under subsection (b), the \n     Administrator shall certify that the requirements of this \n     section are satisfied.\n       (2) Notice and comment.--Before making a final \n     certification under this subsection, the Administrator shall \n     publish a notice in the Federal Register of a proposed \n     certification and a statement of the basis therefor and \n     provide in such notice for a public comment period of 30 \n     days.\n       (3) Final certification.--\n       (A) In general.--The Administrator shall publish a notice \n     of the final certification in the Federal Register after \n     consideration of all comments submitted under paragraph (2).\n       (B) Written notice.--Not later than 30 days after \n     publishing any final certification under subparagraph (A), \n     the Administrator shall provide each defendant participant \n     with written notice of that defendant's funding obligation \n     for that year.\n\n     SEC. 206. ACCOUNTING TREATMENT.\n\n       Defendant participants payment obligations to the Fund \n     shall be subject to discounting under the applicable \n     accounting guidelines for generally accepted accounting \n     purposes and statutory accounting purposes for each defendant \n     participant. This section shall in no way reduce the amount \n     of monetary payments to the Fund by defendant participants as \n     required under section 202(a)(2).\n\n                Subtitle B--Asbestos Insurers Commission\n\n     SEC. 210. DEFINITION.\n\n       In this subtitle, the term ``captive insurance company'' \n     means a company--\n       (1) whose entire beneficial interest is owned on the date \n     of enactment of this Act, directly or indirectly, by a \n     defendant participant or by the ultimate parent or the \n     affiliated group of a defendant participant;\n       (2) whose primary commercial business during the period \n     from calendar years 1940 through 1986 was to provide \n     insurance to its ultimate parent or affiliated group, or any \n     portion of the affiliated group or a combination thereof; and\n       (3) that was incorporated or operating no later than \n     December 31, 2003.\n\n     SEC. 211. ESTABLISHMENT OF ASBESTOS INSURERS COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established the Asbestos \n     Insurers Commission (referred to in this subtitle as the \n     ``Commission'') to carry out the duties described in section \n     212.\n       (b) Membership.--\n       (1) Appointment.--The Commission shall be composed of 5 \n     members who shall be appointed by the President, by and with \n     the advice and consent of the Senate.\n       (2) Qualifications.--\n       (A) Expertise.--Members of the Commission shall have \n     sufficient expertise to fulfill their responsibilities under \n     this subtitle.\n       (B) Conflict of interest.--\n       (i) In general.--No member of the Commission appointed \n     under paragraph (1) may be an employee or immediate family \n     member of an employee of an insurer participant. No\n\n[[Page S1293]]\n\n     member of the Commission shall be a shareholder of any \n     insurer participant. No member of the Commission shall be a \n     former officer or director, or a former employee or former \n     shareholder of any insurer participant who was such an \n     employee, shareholder, officer, or director at any time \n     during the 2-year period ending on the date of the \n     appointment, unless that is fully disclosed before \n     consideration in the Senate of the nomination for appointment \n     to the Commission.\n       (ii) Definition.--In clause (i), the term ``shareholder'' \n     shall not include a broadly based mutual fund that includes \n     the stocks of insurer participants as a portion of its \n     overall holdings.\n       (C) Federal employment.--A member of the Commission may not \n     be an officer or employee of the Federal Government, except \n     by reason of membership on the Commission.\n       (3) Period of appointment.--Members shall be appointed for \n     the life of the Commission.\n       (4) Vacancies.--Any vacancy in the Commission shall be \n     filled in the same manner as the original appointment.\n       (5) Chairman.--The President shall select a Chairman from \n     among the members of the Commission.\n       (c) Meetings.--\n       (1) Initial meeting.--Not later than 30 days after the date \n     on which all members of the Commission have been appointed, \n     the Commission shall hold its first meeting.\n       (2) Subsequent meetings.--The Commission shall meet at the \n     call of the Chairman, as necessary to accomplish the duties \n     under section 212.\n       (3) Quorum.--No business may be conducted or hearings held \n     without the participation of a majority of the members of the \n     Commission.\n\n     SEC. 212. DUTIES OF ASBESTOS INSURERS COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Determination of Insurer Payment Obligations.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Definitions.--For the purposes of this Act, the terms \n     ``insurer'' and ``insurer participant'' shall, unless stated \n     otherwise, include direct insurers and reinsurers, as well as \n     any run-off entity established, in whole or in part, to \n     review and pay asbestos claims.\n       (B) Procedures for determining insurer payments.--The \n     Commission shall determine the amount that each insurer \n     participant shall be required to pay into the Fund under the \n     procedures described in this section. The Commission shall \n     make this determination by first promulgating a rule \n     establishing a methodology for allocation of payments among \n     insurer participants and then applying such methodology to \n     determine the individual payment for each insurer \n     participant. The methodology may include 1 or more allocation \n     formulas to be applied to all insurer participants or groups \n     of similarly situated participants. The Commission's rule \n     shall include a methodology for adjusting payments by insurer \n     participants to make up, during the first 5 years of the life \n     of the Fund and any subsequent years as provided in section \n     405(f) for any reduction in an insurer participant's annual \n     allocated amount caused by the granting of a financial \n     hardship or exceptional circumstance adjustment under this \n     section, and any amount by which aggregate insurer payments \n     fall below the level required under paragraph (3)(C) by \n     reason of the failure or refusal of any insurer participant \n     to make a required payment, or for any other reason that \n     causes such payments to fall below the level required under \n     paragraph (3)(C). The Commission shall conduct a thorough \n     study (within the time limitations under this subparagraph) \n     of the accuracy of the reserve allocation of each insurer \n     participant, and may request information from the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission or any State regulatory agency. Under \n     this procedure, not later than 120 days after the initial \n     meeting of the Commission, the Commission shall commence a \n     rulemaking proceeding under section 213(a) to propose and \n     adopt a methodology for allocating payments among insurer \n     participants. In proposing an allocation methodology, the \n     Commission may consult with such actuaries and other experts \n     as it deems appropriate. After hearings and public comment on \n     the proposed allocation methodology, the Commission shall as \n     promptly as possible promulgate a final rule establishing \n     such methodology. After promulgation of the final rule, the \n     Commission shall determine the individual payment of each \n     insurer participant under the procedures set forth in \n     subsection (b).\n       (C) Scope.--Every insurer, reinsurer, and runoff entity \n     with asbestos-related obligations in the United States shall \n     be subject to the Commission's and Administrator's authority \n     under this Act, including allocation determinations, and \n     shall be required to fulfill its payment obligation without \n     regard as to whether it is licensed in the United States. \n     Every insurer participant not licensed or domiciled in the \n     United States shall, upon the first payment to the Fund, \n     submit a written consent to the Commission's and \n     Administrator's authority under this Act, and to the \n     jurisdiction of the courts of the United States for purposes \n     of enforcing this Act, in a form determined by the \n     Administrator. Any insurer participant refusing to provide a \n     written consent shall be subject to fines and penalties as \n     provided in section 223.\n       (D) Issuers of finite risk policies.--\n       (i) In general.--The issuer of any policy of retrospective \n     reinsurance purchased by an insurer participant or its \n     affiliate after 1990 that provides for a risk or loss \n     transfer to insure for asbestos losses and other losses (both \n     known and unknown), including those policies commonly \n     referred to as ``finite risk'', ``aggregate stop loss'', \n     ``aggregate excess of loss'', or ``loss portfolio transfer'' \n     policies, shall be obligated to make payments required under \n     this Act directly to the Fund on behalf of the insurer \n     participant who is the beneficiary of such policy, subject to \n     the underlying retention and the limits of liability \n     applicable to such policy.\n       (ii) Payments.--Payments to the Fund required under this \n     Act shall be treated as loss payments for asbestos bodily \n     injury (as if such payments were incurred as liabilities \n     imposed in the tort system) and shall not be subject to \n     exclusion under policies described under clause (i) as a \n     liability with respect to tax or assessment. Within 90 days \n     after the scheduled date to make an annual payment to the \n     Fund, the insurer participant shall, at its discretion, \n     direct the reinsurer issuing such policy to pay all or a \n     portion of the annual payment directly to the Fund up to the \n     full applicable limits of liability under the policy. The \n     reinsurer issuing such policy shall be obligated to make such \n     payments directly to the Fund and shall be subject to the \n     enforcement provisions under section 223. The insurer \n     participant shall remain obligated to make payment to the \n     Fund of that portion of the annual payment not directed to \n     the issuer of such reinsurance policy.\n       (2) Amount of payments.--\n       (A) Aggregate payment obligation.--The total payment \n     required of all insurer participants over the life of the \n     Fund shall be equal to $46,025,000,000, less any bankruptcy \n     trust credits under section 222(d).\n       (B) Accounting standards.--In determining the payment \n     obligations of participants that are not licensed or \n     domiciled in the United States or that are runoff entities, \n     the Commission shall use accounting standards required for \n     United States licensed direct insurers.\n       (C) Captive insurance companies.--No payment to the Fund \n     shall be required from a captive insurance company, unless \n     and only to the extent a captive insurance company, on the \n     date of enactment of this Act, insures the asbestos \n     liability, directly or indirectly, of (and that arises out of \n     the manufacture, sale, distribution or installation of \n     materials or products by, or other conduct of) a person or \n     persons other than and unaffiliated with its ultimate parent \n     or affiliated group or pool in which the ultimate parent \n     participates or participated, or unaffiliated with a person \n     that was its ultimate parent or a member of its affiliated \n     group or pool at the time the relevant insurance or \n     reinsurance was issued by the captive insurance company.\n       (D) Several liability.--Unless otherwise provided under \n     this Act, each insurer participant's obligation to make \n     payments to the Fund is several. Unless otherwise provided \n     under this Act, there is no joint liability, and the future \n     insolvency by any insurer participant shall not affect the \n     payment required of any other insurer participant.\n       (3) Payment of criteria.--\n       (A) Inclusion in insurer participant category.--\n       (i) In general.--Insurers that have paid, or been assessed \n     by a legal judgment or settlement, at least $1,000,000 in \n     defense and indemnity costs before the date of enactment of \n     this Act in response to claims for compensation for asbestos \n     injuries arising from a policy of liability insurance or \n     contract of liability reinsurance or retrocessional \n     reinsurance shall be insurer participants in the Fund. Other \n     insurers shall be exempt from mandatory payments.\n       (ii) Inapplicability of section 202.--Since insurers may be \n     subject in certain jurisdictions to direct action suits, and \n     it is not the intent of this Act to impose upon an insurer, \n     due to its operation as an insurer, payment obligations to \n     the Fund in situations where the insurer is the subject of a \n     direct action, no insurer subject to mandatory payments under \n     this section shall also be liable for payments to the Fund as \n     a defendant participant under section 202.\n       (B) Insurer participant allocation methodology.--\n       (i) In general.--The Commission shall establish the payment \n     obligations of individual insurer participants to reflect, on \n     an equitable basis, the relative tort system liability of the \n     participating insurers in the absence of this Act, \n     considering and weighting, as appropriate (but exclusive of \n     workers' compensation), such factors as--\n\n       (I) historic premium for lines of insurance associated with \n     asbestos exposure over relevant periods of time;\n       (II) recent loss experience for asbestos liability;\n       (III) amounts reserved for asbestos liability;\n       (IV) the likely cost to each insurer participant of its \n     future liabilities under applicable insurance policies; and\n       (V) any other factor the Commission may determine is \n     relevant and appropriate.\n\n       (ii) Determination of reserves.--The Commission may \n     establish procedures and standards for determination of the \n     asbestos reserves of insurer participants. The reserves of a \n     United States licensed reinsurer that is wholly owned by, or \n     under common control of, a United States licensed direct \n     insurer shall be included as part of the direct insurer's \n     reserves when the reinsurer's financial results are included \n     as part of the direct insurer's United States operations, as \n     reflected in footnote 33 of its filings with the National \n     Association of Insurance Commissioners or\n\n[[Page S1294]]\n\n     in published financial statements prepared in accordance with \n     generally accepted accounting principles.\n       (C) Payment schedule.--The aggregate annual amount of \n     payments by insurer participants over the life of the Fund \n     shall be as follows:\n       (i) For years 1 and 2, $2,700,000,000 annually.\n       (ii) For years 3 through 5, $5,075,000,000 annually.\n       (iii) For years 6 through 27, $1,147,000,000 annually.\n       (iv) For year 28, $166,000,000.\n       (D) Certain runoff entities.--A runoff entity shall include \n     any direct insurer or reinsurer whose asbestos liability \n     reserves have been transferred, directly or indirectly, to \n     the runoff entity and on whose behalf the runoff entity \n     handles or adjusts and, where appropriate, pays asbestos \n     claims.\n       (E) Financial hardship and exceptional circumstance \n     adjustments.--\n       (i) In general.--Under the procedures established in \n     subsection (b), an insurer participant may seek adjustment of \n     the amount of its payments based on exceptional circumstances \n     or severe financial hardship.\n       (ii) Financial adjustments.--An insurer participant may \n     qualify for an adjustment based on severe financial hardship \n     by demonstrating that payment of the amounts required by the \n     Commission's methodology would jeopardize the solvency of \n     such participant.\n       (iii) Exceptional circumstance adjustment.--An insurer \n     participant may qualify for an adjustment based on \n     exceptional circumstances by demonstrating--\n\n       (I) that the amount of its payments under the Commission's \n     allocation methodology is exceptionally inequitable when \n     measured against the amount of the likely cost to the \n     participant of its future liability in the tort system in the \n     absence of the Fund;\n       (II) an offset credit as described in subparagraphs (A) and \n     (C) of subsection (b)(4); or\n       (III) other exceptional circumstances.\n\n     The Commission may determine whether to grant an adjustment \n     and the size of any such adjustment, but except as provided \n     under paragraph (1)(B), subsection (f)(3), and section \n     405(f), any such adjustment shall not affect the aggregate \n     payment obligations of insurer participants specified in \n     paragraph (2)(A) and subparagraph (C) of this paragraph.\n       (iv) Time period of adjustment.--Except for adjustments for \n     offset credits, adjustments granted under this subsection \n     shall have a term not to exceed 3 years. An insurer \n     participant may renew its adjustment by demonstrating to the \n     Administrator that it remains justified.\n       (F) Funding holidays.--\n       (i) In general.--If the Administrator determines, at any \n     time after 10 years following the date of enactment of this \n     Act, that the assets of the Fund at the time of such \n     determination and expected future payments are sufficient to \n     satisfy the Fund's anticipated obligations without the need \n     for all, or any portion of, that year's payment otherwise \n     required under this subtitle, the Administrator shall reduce \n     or waive all or any part of the payments required from \n     insurer participants for that year.\n       (ii) Annual review.--The Administrator shall undertake the \n     review required by this subsection and make the necessary \n     determination under clause (i) every year.\n       (iii) Limitations of funding holidays.--Any reduction or \n     waiver of the insurer participants' funding obligations \n     shall--\n\n       (I) be made only to the extent the Administrator determines \n     that the Fund will still be able to satisfy all of its \n     anticipated obligations; and\n       (II) be applied on an equal pro rata basis to the funding \n     obligations of all insurer participants for that year.\n\n       (iv) New information.--If at any time the Administrator \n     determines that a reduction or waiver under this section may \n     cause the assets of the Fund and expected future payments to \n     decrease to a level at which the Fund may not be able to \n     satisfy all of its anticipated obligations, the Administrator \n     shall revoke all or any part of such reduction or waiver to \n     the extent necessary to ensure that the Fund's obligations \n     are met. Such revocations shall be applied on an equal pro \n     rata basis to the funding obligations of all insurer \n     participants for that year.\n       (b) Procedure for Notifying Insurer Participants of \n     Individual Payment Obligations.--\n       (1) Notice to participants.--Not later than 30 days after \n     promulgation of the final rule establishing an allocation \n     methodology under subsection (a)(1), the Commission shall--\n       (A) directly notify all reasonably identifiable insurer \n     participants of the requirement to submit information \n     necessary to calculate the amount of any required payment to \n     the Fund under the allocation methodology; and\n       (B) publish in the Federal Register a notice--\n       (i) requiring any person who may be an insurer participant \n     (as determined by criteria outlined in the notice) to submit \n     such information; and\n       (ii) that includes a list of all insurer participants \n     notified by the Commission under subparagraph (A), and \n     provides for 30 days for the submission of comments or \n     information regarding the completeness and accuracy of the \n     list of identified insurer participants.\n       (2) Response required by individual insurer participants.--\n       (A) In general.--Any person who receives notice under \n     paragraph (1)(A), and any other person meeting the criteria \n     specified in the notice published under paragraph (1)(B), \n     shall respond by providing the Commission with all the \n     information requested in the notice under a schedule or by a \n     date established by the Commission.\n       (B) Certification.--The response submitted under \n     subparagraph (A) shall be signed by a responsible corporate \n     officer, general partner, proprietor, or individual of \n     similar authority, who shall certify under penalty of law the \n     completeness and accuracy of the information submitted.\n       (3) Notice to insurer participants of initial payment \n     determination.--\n       (A) In general.--\n       (i) Notice to insurers.--Not later than 120 days after \n     receipt of the information required by paragraph (2), the \n     Commission shall send each insurer participant a notice of \n     initial determination requiring payments to the Fund, which \n     shall be based on the information received from the \n     participant in response to the Commission's request for \n     information. An insurer participant's payments shall be \n     payable over the schedule established in subsection \n     (a)(3)(C), in annual amounts proportionate to the aggregate \n     annual amount of payments for all insurer participants for \n     the applicable year.\n       (ii) Public notice.--Not later than 7 days after sending \n     the notification of initial determination to insurer \n     participants, the Commission shall publish in the Federal \n     Register a notice listing the insurer participants that have \n     been sent such notification, and the initial determination on \n     the payment obligation of each identified participant.\n       (B) No response; incomplete response.--If no response is \n     received from an insurer participant, or if the response is \n     incomplete, the initial determination requiring a payment \n     from the insurer participant shall be based on the best \n     information available to the Commission.\n       (4) Commission review, revision, and finalization of \n     initial payment determinations.--\n       (A) Comments from insurer participants.--Not later than 30 \n     days after receiving a notice of initial determination from \n     the Commission, an insurer participant may provide the \n     Commission with additional information to support adjustments \n     to the required payments to reflect severe financial hardship \n     or exceptional circumstances, including the provision of an \n     offset credit for an insurer participant for the amount of \n     any asbestos-related payments it made or was legally \n     obligated to make, including payments released from an \n     escrow, as the result of a bankruptcy judicially confirmed \n     after May 22, 2003, but before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (B) Additional participants.--If, before the final \n     determination of the Commission, the Commission receives \n     information that an additional person may qualify as an \n     insurer participant, the Commission shall require such person \n     to submit information necessary to determine whether payments \n     from that person should be required, in accordance with the \n     requirements of this subsection.\n       (C) Revision procedures.--The Commission shall adopt \n     procedures for revising initial payments based on information \n     received under subparagraphs (A) and (B), including a \n     provision requiring an offset credit for an insurer \n     participant for the amount of any asbestos-related payments \n     it made or was legally obligated to make, including payments \n     released from an escrow, as the result of a bankruptcy \n     confirmed after May 22, 2003, but before the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (5) Examinations and subpoenas.--\n       (A) Examinations.--The Commission may conduct examinations \n     of the books and records of insurer participants to determine \n     the completeness and accuracy of information submitted, or \n     required to be submitted, to the Commission for purposes of \n     determining participant payments.\n       (B) Subpoenas.--The Commission may request the Attorney \n     General to subpoena persons to compel testimony, records, and \n     other information relevant to its responsibilities under this \n     section. The Attorney General may enforce such subpoena in \n     appropriate proceedings in the United States district court \n     for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena was \n     addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.\n       (6) Escrow payments.--Without regard to an insurer \n     participant's payment obligation under this section, any \n     escrow or similar account established before the date of \n     enactment of this Act by an insurer participant in connection \n     with an asbestos trust fund that has not been judicially \n     confirmed by final order by the date of enactment of this Act \n     shall be the property of the insurer participant and returned \n     to that insurer participant.\n       (7) Notice to insurer participants of final payment \n     determinations.--Not later than 60 days after the notice of \n     initial determination is sent to the insurer participants, \n     the Commission shall send each insurer participant a notice \n     of final determination.\n       (c) Insurer Participants Voluntary Allocation Agreement.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the \n     Commission proposes its rule establishing an allocation \n     methodology under subsection (a)(1), direct insurer \n     participants licensed or domiciled in the United States, \n     other direct insurer participants, reinsurer participants \n     licensed or domiciled in the\n\n[[Page S1295]]\n\n     United States, or other reinsurer participants, may submit an \n     allocation agreement, approved by all of the participants in \n     the applicable group, to the Commission.\n       (2) Allocation agreement.--To the extent the participants \n     in any such applicable group voluntarily agree upon an \n     allocation arrangement, any such allocation agreement shall \n     only govern the allocation of payments within that group and \n     shall not determine the aggregate amount due from that group.\n       (3) Certification.--The Commission shall determine whether \n     an allocation agreement submitted under subparagraph (A) \n     meets the requirements of this subtitle and, if so, shall \n     certify the agreement as establishing the allocation \n     methodology governing the individual payment obligations of \n     the participants who are parties to the agreement. The \n     authority of the Commission under this subtitle shall, with \n     respect to participants who are parties to a certified \n     allocation agreement, terminate on the day after the \n     Commission certifies such agreement. Under subsection (f), \n     the Administrator shall assume responsibility, if necessary, \n     for calculating the individual payment obligations of \n     participants who are parties to the certified agreement.\n       (d) Commission Report.--\n       (1) Recipients.--Until the work of the Commission has been \n     completed and the Commission terminated, the Commission shall \n     submit an annual report, containing the information described \n     under paragraph (2), to--\n       (A) the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate;\n       (B) the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (C) the Administrator.\n       (2) Contents.--The report under paragraph (1) shall state \n     the amount that each insurer participant is required to pay \n     to the Fund, including the payment schedule for such \n     payments.\n       (e) Interim Payments.--\n       (1) Amount of interim payment.--Within 90 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, insurer participants shall \n     make an aggregate payment to the Fund not to exceed 50 \n     percent of the aggregate funding obligation specified under \n     subsection (a)(3)(C) for year 1.\n       (2) Reserve information.--Within 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, each insurer participant shall submit \n     to the Administrator a certified statement of its net held \n     reserves for asbestos liabilities as of December 31, 2004.\n       (3) Allocation of interim payment.--The Administrator shall \n     allocate the interim payment among the individual insurer \n     participants on an equitable basis using the net held \n     asbestos reserve information provided by insurer participants \n     under subsection (a)(3)(B). Within 60 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall publish in the \n     Federal Register the name of each insurer participant, and \n     the amount of the insurer participant's allocated share of \n     the interim payment. The use of net held asbestos reserves as \n     the basis to determine an interim allocation shall not be \n     binding on the Administrator in the determination of an \n     appropriate final allocation methodology under this section. \n     All payments required under this paragraph shall be credited \n     against the participant's ultimate payment obligation to the \n     Fund established by the Commission. If an interim payment \n     exceeds the ultimate payment, the Fund shall pay interest on \n     the amount of the overpayment at a rate determined by the \n     Administrator. If the ultimate payment exceeds the interim \n     payment, the participant shall pay interest on the amount of \n     the underpayment at the same rate. Any participant may seek \n     an exemption from or reduction in any payment required under \n     this subsection under the financial hardship and exceptional \n     circumstance standards established under subsection \n     (a)(3)(E).\n       (4) Appeal of interim payment decisions.--A decision by the \n     Administrator to establish an interim payment obligation \n     shall be considered final agency action and reviewable under \n     section 303, except that the reviewing court may not stay an \n     interim payment during the pendency of the appeal.\n       (f) Transfer of Authority From the Commission to the \n     Administrator.--\n       (1) In general.--Upon termination of the Commission under \n     section 215, the Administrator shall assume all the \n     responsibilities and authority of the Commission, except that \n     the Administrator shall not have the power to modify the \n     allocation methodology established by the Commission or by \n     certified agreement or to promulgate a rule establishing any \n     such methodology.\n       (2) Financial hardship and exceptional circumstance \n     adjustments.--Upon termination of the Commission under \n     section 215, the Administrator shall have the authority, upon \n     application by any insurer participant, to make adjustments \n     to annual payments upon the same grounds as provided in \n     subsection (a)(3)(D). Adjustments granted under this \n     subsection shall have a term not to exceed 3 years. An \n     insurer participant may renew its adjustment by demonstrating \n     that it remains justified. Upon the grant of any adjustment, \n     the Administrator shall increase the payments, consistent \n     with subsection (a)(1)(B), required of all other insurer \n     participants so that there is no reduction in the aggregate \n     payment required of all insurer participants for the \n     applicable years. The increase in an insurer participant's \n     required payment shall be in proportion to such participant's \n     share of the aggregate payment obligation of all insurer \n     participants.\n       (3) Credits for shortfall assessments.--If insurer \n     participants are required during the first 5 years of the \n     life of the Fund to make up any shortfall in required insurer \n     payments under subsection (a)(1)(B), then, beginning in year \n     6, the Administrator shall grant each insurer participant a \n     credit against its annual required payments during the \n     applicable years that in the aggregate equal the amount of \n     shortfall assessments paid by such insurer participant during \n     the first 5 years of the life of the Fund. The credit shall \n     be prorated over the same number of years as the number of \n     years during which the insurer participant paid a shortfall \n     assessment. Insurer participants which did not pay all \n     required payments to the Fund during the first 5 years of the \n     life of the Fund shall not be eligible for a credit. The \n     Administrator shall not grant a credit for shortfall \n     assessments imposed under section 405(f).\n       (4) Financial security requirements.--Whenever an insurer \n     participant's A.M. Best's claims payment rating or Standard \n     and Poor's financial strength rating falls below A-, and \n     until such time as either the insurer participant's A.M. \n     Best's Rating or Standard and Poor's rating is equal to or \n     greater than A-, the Administrator shall have the authority \n     to require that the participating insurer either--\n       (A) pay the present value of its remaining Fund payments at \n     a discount rate determined by the Administrator; or\n       (B) provide an evergreen letter of credit or financial \n     guarantee for future payments issued by an institution with \n     an A.M. Best's claims payment rating or Standard & Poor's \n     financial strength rating of at least A+.\n       (g) Accounting Treatment.--Insurer participants' payment \n     obligations to the Fund shall be subject to discounting under \n     the applicable accounting guidelines for generally accepted \n     accounting purposes and statutory accounting purposes for \n     each insurer participant. This subsection shall in no way \n     reduce the amount of monetary payments to the Fund by insurer \n     participants as required under subsection (a).\n       (h) Judicial Review.--The Commission's rule establishing an \n     allocation methodology, its final determinations of payment \n     obligations and other final action shall be judicially \n     reviewable as provided in title III.\n\n     SEC. 213. POWERS OF ASBESTOS INSURERS COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Rulemaking.--The Commission shall promulgate such rules \n     and regulations as necessary to implement its authority under \n     this Act, including regulations governing an allocation \n     methodology.

A court may dismiss any such action on its motion. \n     If the court denies the motion to dismiss, it shall stay \n     further proceedings until final disposition of any appeal \n     taken under this Act.\n       (5) Removal.--\n       (A) In general.--If an action in any State court under \n     paragraph (3) is preempted, barred, or otherwise precluded \n     under this Act, and not dismissed, or if an order entered \n     after the date of enactment of this Act purporting to enter \n     judgment or deny review is not rescinded and replaced with an \n     order of dismissal within 30 days after the filing of a \n     motion by any party to the action advising the court of the \n     provisions of this Act, any party may remove the case to the \n     district court of the United States for the district in which \n     such action is pending.\n       (B) Time limits.--For actions originally filed after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the notice of removal shall be \n     filed within the time limits specified in section 1441(b) of \n     title 28, United States Code.\n       (C) Procedures.--The procedures for removal and proceedings \n     after removal shall be in accordance with sections 1446 \n     through 1450 of title 28, United States Code, except as may \n     be necessary to accommodate removal of any actions pending \n     (including on appeal) on the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (D) Review of remand orders.--\n       (i) In general.--Section 1447 of title 28, United States \n     Code, shall apply to any removal of a case under this \n     section, except that notwithstanding subsection (d) of that \n     section, a court of appeals may accept an appeal from an \n     order of a district court granting or denying a motion to \n     remand an action to the State court from which it was removed \n     if application is made to the court of appeals not less than \n     30 days after entry of the order.\n       (ii) Time period for judgment.--If the court of appeals \n     accepts an appeal under clause (i), the court shall complete \n     all action on such appeal, including rendering judgment, not \n     later than 180 days after the date on which such appeal was \n     filed, unless an extension is granted under clause (iii).\n       (iii) Extension of time period.--The court of appeals may \n     grant an extension of the 180-day period described in clause \n     (ii) if--\n\n       (I) all parties to the proceeding agree to such extension, \n     for any period of time; or\n       (II) such extension is for good cause shown and in the \n     interests of justice, for a period not to exceed 30 days.\n\n       (iv) Denial of appeal.--If a final judgment on the appeal \n     under clause (i) is not issued before the end of the period \n     described in clause (ii), including any extension under \n     clause (iii), the appeal shall be denied.\n       (E) Jurisdiction.--The jurisdiction of the district court \n     shall be limited to--\n       (i) determining whether removal was proper; and\n       (ii) determining, based on the evidentiary record, whether \n     the claim presented is preempted, barred, or otherwise \n     precluded under this Act.\n       (6) Credits.--\n       (A) In general.--If, notwithstanding the express intent of \n     Congress stated in this section, any court finally determines \n     for any reason that an asbestos claim is not barred under \n     this subsection and is not subject to the exclusive remedy or \n     preemption provisions of this section, then any participant \n     required to satisfy a final judgment executed with respect to \n     any such claim may elect to receive a credit against any \n     assessment owed to the Fund equal to the amount of the \n     payment made with respect to such executed judgment.\n       (B) Requirements.--The Administrator shall require \n     participants seeking credit under this paragraph to \n     demonstrate that the participant--\n       (i) timely pursued all available remedies, including \n     remedies available under this paragraph to obtain dismissal \n     of the claim; and\n       (ii) notified the Administrator at least 20 days before the \n     expiration of any period within which to appeal the denial of \n     a motion to dismiss based on this section.\n       (C) Information.--The Administrator may require a \n     participant seeking credit under this paragraph to furnish \n     such further information as is necessary and appropriate to \n     establish eligibility for, and the amount of, the credit.\n       (D) Intervention.--The Administrator may intervene in any \n     action in which a credit may be due under this paragraph.\n\n     SEC. 404.

and\n       (ii) the resolution of claims for reimbursement or coverage \n     of liability or paid or incurred loss for which notice was \n     provided to the insurer before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (E) Scheduled payment amounts.--The term ``scheduled \n     payment amounts'' means the future payment obligation to the \n     Fund under this Act from a defendant participant in the \n     amount established under sections 203 and 204.\n       (F) Unearned erosion amount.--The term ``unearned erosion \n     amount'' means the difference between the deemed erosion \n     amount and the earned erosion amount.\n       (2) Quantum and timing of erosion.--\n       (A) Erosion upon enactment.--The collective payment \n     obligations to the Fund of the insurer and reinsurer \n     participants as assessed by the Administrator shall be deemed \n     as of the date of enactment of this Act to erode remaining \n     aggregate products limits available to a defendant \n     participant only in an amount of 38.1 percent of each \n     defendant participant's scheduled payment amount.\n       (B) No assertion of claim.--No insurer or reinsurer may \n     assert any claim against a defendant participant or captive \n     insurer for insurance, reinsurance, payment of a deductible, \n     or retrospective premium adjustment arising out of that \n     insurer's or reinsurer's payments to the Fund or the erosion \n     deemed to occur under this section.\n       (C) Policies without certain limits or with exclusion.--\n     Except as provided under subparagraph (E), nothing in this \n     section shall require or permit the erosion of any insurance \n     policy or limit that does not contain an aggregate products \n     limit, or that contains an asbestos exclusion.\n       (D) Treatment of consolidation election.--If an affiliated \n     group elects consolidation as provided in section 204(g), the \n     total erosion of limits for the affiliated group under \n     paragraph (2)(A) shall not exceed 38.1 percent of the \n     scheduled payment amount of the single payment obligation for \n     the entire affiliated group. The total erosion of limits for \n     any individual defendant participant in the affiliated group \n     shall not exceed its individual share of 38.1 percent of the \n     affiliated group's scheduled payment amount, as measured by \n     the individual defendant participant's percentage share of \n     the affiliated group's prior asbestos expenditures.\n       (E) Rule of construction.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section, nothing in this Act shall be \n     deemed to erode remaining aggregate products limits of a \n     defendant participant that can demonstrate by a preponderance \n     of the evidence that 75 percent of its prior asbestos \n     expenditures were made in defense or satisfaction of asbestos \n     claims alleging bodily injury arising exclusively from the \n     exposure to asbestos at premises owned, rented, or controlled \n     by the defendant participant (a ``premises defendant''). In \n     calculating such percentage, where expenditures were made in \n     defense or satisfaction of asbestos claims alleging bodily \n     injury due to exposure to the defendant participant's \n     products and to asbestos at premises owned, rented, or \n     controlled by the defendant participant, half of such \n     expenditures shall be deemed to be for such premises \n     exposures. If a defendant participant establishes itself as a \n     premises defendant, 75 percent of the payments by such \n     defendant participant shall erode coverage limits, if any, \n     applicable to premises liabilities under applicable law.\n       (3) Method of erosion.--\n       (A) Allocation.--The amount of erosion allocated to each \n     defendant participant shall be allocated among periods in \n     which policies with remaining aggregate product limits are \n     available to that defendant participant pro rata by policy \n     period, in ascending order by attachment point.\n       (B) Other erosion methods.--\n       (i) In general.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the \n     method of erosion of any remaining aggregate products limits \n     which are subject to--\n\n       (I) a coverage-in-place or settlement agreement between a \n     defendant participant and 1 or more insurance participants as \n     of the date of enactment; or\n       (II) a final and nonappealable judgment as of the date of \n     enactment or resulting from a claim for coverage or \n     reimbursement pending as of such date, shall be as specified \n     in such agreement or judgment with regard to erosion \n     applicable to such insurance participants' policies.\n\n       (ii) Remaining limits.--To the extent that a final \n     nonappealable judgment or settlement agreement to which an \n     insurer participant and a defendant participant are parties \n     in effect as of the date of enactment of this Act \n     extinguished a defendant participant's right to seek coverage \n     for asbestos claims under an insurer participant's policies, \n     any remaining limits in such policies shall not be considered \n     to be remaining aggregate products limits under subsection \n     (a)(1)(A).\n       (5) Payments by defendant participant.--Payments made by a \n     defendant participant shall be deemed to erode, exhaust, or \n     otherwise satisfy applicable self-insured retentions, \n     deductibles, retrospectively rated premiums, and limits \n     issued by nonparticipating insolvent or captive insurance \n     companies. Reduction of remaining aggregate limits under this \n     subsection shall not limit the right of a defendant \n     participant to collect from any insurer not a participant.\n       (6) Effect on other insurance claims.--Other than as \n     specified in this subsection, this Act does not alter, \n     change, modify, or affect insurance for claims other than \n     asbestos claims.\n       (b) Dispute Resolution Procedure.--\n       (1) Arbitration.--The parties to a dispute regarding the \n     erosion of insurance coverage limits under this section may \n     agree in writing to settle such dispute by arbitration. Any \n     such provision or agreement shall be valid, irrevocable, and \n     enforceable, except for any grounds that exist at law or in \n     equity for revocation of a contract.\n       (2) Title 9, united states code.--Arbitration of such \n     disputes, awards by arbitrators, and confirmation of awards \n     shall be governed by title 9, United States Code, to the \n     extent such title is not inconsistent with this section. In \n     any such arbitration proceeding, the erosion principles \n     provided for under this section shall be binding on the \n     arbitrator, unless the parties agree to the contrary.\n       (3) Final and binding award.--An award by an arbitrator \n     shall be final and binding between the parties to the \n     arbitration, but shall have no force or effect on any other \n     person. The parties to an arbitration may agree that in the \n     event a policy which is the subject matter of an award is \n     subsequently determined to be eroded in a manner different \n     from the manner determined by the arbitration in a judgment \n     rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction from which no \n     appeal can or has been taken, such arbitration award may be \n     modified by any court of competent jurisdiction upon \n     application by any party to the arbitration. Any such \n     modification shall govern the rights and obligations between \n     such parties after the date of such modification.\n       (c) Effect on Nonparticipants.--\n       (1) In general.--No insurance company or reinsurance \n     company that is not a participant, other than a captive \n     insurer, shall be entitled to claim that payments to the Fund \n     erode, exhaust, or otherwise limit the nonparticipant's \n     insurance or reinsurance obligations.\n       (2) Other claims.--Nothing in this Act shall preclude a \n     participant from pursuing any claim for insurance or \n     reinsurance from any person that is not a participant other \n     than a captive insurer.\n       (d) Finite Risk Policies Not Affected.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, except subject to section 212(a)(1)(D), this Act \n     shall not alter, affect or impair any rights or obligations \n     of--\n       (A) any party to an insurance contract that expressly \n     provides coverage for governmental charges or assessments \n     imposed to replace insurance or reinsurance liabilities in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act; or\n       (B) subject to paragraph (2), any person with respect to \n     any insurance purchased by a participant after December 31, \n     1990, that expressly (but not necessarily exclusively) \n     provides coverage for asbestos liabilities, including those \n     policies commonly referred to as ``finite risk'' policies.\n       (2) Limitation.--No person may assert that any amounts paid \n     to the Fund in accordance with this Act are covered by any \n     policy described under paragraph (1)(B) purchased by a \n     defendant participant, unless such policy specifically \n     provides coverage for required payments to a Federal trust \n     fund established by a Federal statute to resolve asbestos \n     injury claims.\n\n[[Page S1305]]\n\n       (e) Effect on Certain Insurance and Reinsurance Claims.--\n       (1) No coverage for fund assessments.--Subject to section \n     212(a)(1)(D), no participant or captive insurer may pursue an \n     insurance or reinsurance claim against another participant or \n     captive insurer for payments to the Fund required under this \n     Act, except under a written agreement specifically providing \n     insurance, reinsurance, or other reimbursement for required \n     payments to a Federal trust fund established by a Federal \n     statute to resolve asbestos injury claims or, where \n     applicable, under finite risk policies under subsection (d).\n       (2) Certain insurance assignments voided.--Any assignment \n     of any rights to insurance coverage for asbestos claims to \n     any person who has asserted an asbestos claim before the date \n     of enactment of this Act, or to any trust, person, or other \n     entity not part of an affiliated group as defined in section \n     201(1) of this Act established or appointed for the purpose \n     of paying asbestos claims which were asserted before such \n     date of enactment, or by any Tier I defendant participant \n     shall be null and void.

or\n       (B) the average number of claims that qualify for \n     compensation under a claim level or designation is less than \n     75 percent of the number of claims expected to qualify for \n     compensation under that claim level or designation in the \n     most recent Congressional Budget Office estimate of asbestos-\n     injury claims for any 3-year period, the Administrator shall \n     conduct a review of a statistically significant sample of \n     claims deemed ineligible for compensation under the \n     appropriate claim level or designation.\n       (2) Determinations.--The Administrator shall examine the \n     best available medical evidence and any recommendation made \n     under subsection (b)(5) in order to determine which 1 or more \n     of the following is true:\n       (A) Without a significant number of exceptions, all of the \n     claimants who qualified for compensation under the claim \n     level or designation suffer from an injury or disease for \n     which exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing \n     factor.\n       (B) A significant number of claimants who qualified for \n     compensation under the claim level or designation do not \n     suffer from an injury or disease for which exposure to \n     asbestos was a substantial contributing factor.\n       (C) A significant number of claimants who were denied \n     compensation under the claim level of designation did suffer \n     from an injury or disease for which exposure to asbestos was \n     a substantial contributing factor.\n       (D) The Congressional Budget Office projections \n     underestimated or overestimated the actual number of persons \n     who suffer from an injury or disease for which exposure to \n     asbestos was a substantial contributing factor.\n       (3) Recommendations concerning claims criteria.--If the \n     Administrator determines that a significant number of the \n     claimants who qualified for compensation under the claim \n     level under review do not suffer from an injury or disease \n     for which exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing \n     factor, or that a significant number of the claimants who \n     were denied compensation under the claim level under review \n     suffered from an injury or disease for which exposure to \n     asbestos was a substantial contributing factor, the \n     Administrator shall recommend to Congress, under subsection \n     (f), changes to the compensation criteria in order to ensure \n     that the Fund provides compensation for injury or disease for \n     which exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing \n     factor, but does not provide compensation to claimants who do \n     not suffer from an injury or disease for which asbestos \n     exposure was a substantial contributing factor.\n       (e) Recommendations of Administrator and Advisory \n     Committee.--\n       (1) Referral.--If the Administrator recommends changes to \n     this Act under subsection (d), the recommendations and \n     accompanying analysis shall be referred to the Advisory \n     Committee on Asbestos Disease Compensation established under \n     section 102 (in this subsection referred to as the ``Advisory \n     Committee'').\n       (2) Advisory committee recommendations.--The Advisory \n     Committee shall hold\n\n[[Page S1306]]\n\n     expedited public hearings on the alternatives and \n     recommendations of the Administrator and make its own \n     recommendations for reform of the program under titles I and \n     II.\n       (3) Transmittal to congress.--Not later than 90 days after \n     receiving the recommendations of the Administrator, the \n     Advisory Committee shall transmit the recommendations of the \n     Administrator and the recommendations of the Advisory \n     Committee to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and \n     the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (f) Shortfall Analysis.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Analysis.--If the Administrator concludes, at any time, \n     that the Fund may not be able to pay claims as such claims \n     become due at any time within the next 5 years and to satisfy \n     its other obligations, the Administrator shall prepare an \n     analysis of the reasons for the situation, an estimation of \n     when the Fund will no longer be able to pay claims as such \n     claims become due, a description of the range of reasonable \n     alternatives for responding to the situation, and a \n     recommendation as to which alternative best serves the \n     interest of claimants and the public. The report may include \n     a description of changes in the diagnostic, exposure, or \n     medical criteria of section 121 that the Administrator \n     believes may be necessary to protect the Fund. The \n     Administrator shall submit such analysis to the Committee on \n     the Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the House of Representatives. Any \n     recommendations made by the Administrator for changes to the \n     program shall, in addition, be referred to the Advisory \n     Committee on Asbestos Disease Compensation established under \n     section 102 for review.\n       (B) Range of alternatives.--The range of alternatives under \n     subparagraph (A) may include--\n       (ii) reform of the program set forth in titles I and II of \n     this Act (including changes in the diagnostic, exposure, or \n     medical criteria, changes in the enforcement or application \n     of those criteria, enhancement of enforcement authority, \n     changes in the timing of payments, changes in contributions \n     by defendant participants, insurer participants (or both such \n     participants), or changes in award values); or\n       (iii) any measure that the Administrator considers \n     appropriate.\n       (2) Considerations.--In formulating recommendations, the \n     Administrator shall take into account the reasons for any \n     shortfall, actual or projected, which may include--\n       (A) financial factors, including return on investments, \n     borrowing capacity, interest rates, ability to collect \n     contributions, and other relevant factors;\n       (B) the operation of the Fund generally, including \n     administration of the claims processing, the ability of the \n     Administrator to collect contributions from participants, \n     potential problems of fraud, the adequacy of the criteria to \n     rule out idiopathic mesothelioma, and inadequate flexibility \n     to extend the timing of payments;\n       (C) the appropriateness of the diagnostic, exposure, and \n     medical criteria, including the adequacy of the criteria to \n     rule out idiopathic mesothelioma;\n       (D) the actual incidence of asbestos-related diseases, \n     including mesothelioma, based on epidemiological studies and \n     other relevant data;\n       (E) compensation of diseases with alternative causes; and\n       (F) other factors that the Administrator considers \n     relevant.\n       (4) Resolved claims.--For purposes of this section, a claim \n     shall be deemed resolved when the Administrator has \n     determined the amount of the award due the claimant, and \n     either the claimant has waived judicial review or the time \n     for judicial review has expired.\n\n     SEC. 406.

The \n     trustees may adopt the matrix of award amounts of section 131 \n     or such other matrix that the trustees determine provides \n     similar benefits for similar claims and fairly reflects the \n     liability of the entities whose liabilities were channeled to \n     the asbestos trusts and any class action trust.\n       (K) Payments to Claimants.--The trustees shall pay each \n     qualifying claimant a benefit equal to the product of the \n     master trust payment percentage and the award amount to such \n     claimant.

Any individual with a valid asbestos claim \n     against any asbestos trust or class action trust shall be \n     entitled to seek relief on account of such claim from the \n     master trust described in subparagraph (7) in accordance with \n     the provisions of such subparagraph.''\n       On page 357, strike lines 12 through 24 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(B) Remaining Obligations.--For purposes of subparagraph \n     (A)(ii)(II), the remaining obligations to the asbestos trust \n     of the debtor and the class action trust shall be determined \n     by multiplying the amount of assets transferred to the Fund \n     by such debtor or class action trust by the applicable \n     percentage set forth in the following schedule depending on \n     the year in which a termination shall take effect under \n     paragraph (2).
