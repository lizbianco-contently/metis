Today we will be returning to the Defense authorization \nbill. I think this is our sixth day on the bill. We spent 5 or 6 days \non it several months ago. Under the consent agreement from last \nThursday, we will debate the final amendments to the Defense \nauthorization bill today and then tomorrow morning we will have a \nseries of votes on the remaining amendments, concluding with a vote on \nfinal passage of that bill. Those amendments include two amendments \nrelating to our policies in Iraq and second-degree amendments to the \nGraham amendments on the status of detainees. We will start those votes \nat about 10:45 tomorrow morning, and therefore we will finish the \nDefense authorization bill prior to our normal recess that we take on \nTuesdays for our respective policy lunches.\n  I also want to remind my colleagues that at 4:30 today, we will begin \nan hour of debate on the Energy and Water appropriations conference \nreport. This will be our sixth conference report. We have done Homeland \nSecurity, Interior, Agriculture, Legislative Branch, and then Foreign \nOperations. This will be No. 6 as we continue to bring these bills \nacross the floor one by one.\n  We will have a vote at about 5:30 today, after an hour of debate on \nEnergy and Water appropriations. In addition to those two matters, we \nhave a whole host of other important issues to address prior to \nadjourning for Thanksgiving.\n  The most common question I get is on the schedule and what time we \nwill be getting out for Thanksgiving and, of course, the holidays in \nDecember as well. In the short term, this week we may consider tax \nreconciliation under the statutory time limitation as provided by the \nBudget Act. The Budget Act provides for up to 20 hours of debate on \nthat bill, and therefore we could have late nights during this week in \norder to finish that tax bill. We have five remaining appropriations \nconference reports, and we will consider them over the course of the \nweek as they become available. We have Defense, Labor-HHS, MILCON, the \nTransportation-HUD bill, and DC appropriations.\n  As I mentioned, we will finish the Energy and Water conference report \ntoday, and we are ready to lock in a short time agreement on the \nCommerce, Justice, and Science conference report, which is now at the \ndesk.\n  Following that one--today we will do six--we will have done seven of \nthe appropriations conference reports. I expect the remainder to become \navailable over the course of the week. As they become available, we \nwill set aside time and have, hopefully, very tight time agreements and \ndeal with them accordingly.\n  In addition to the DOD authorization bill and the conference reports, \nwe have other things to address this week. On the conference report on \nthe PATRIOT Act, which is expected this week, there has been a lot of \nwork done over the course of the last 2 weeks and over the course of \nthe weekend. We will complete that prior to our Thanksgiving time away \nas well.\n  Another item that we have worked on a lot over the last 5 or 6 weeks \nthat\n\n[[Page S12722]]\n\nwill be back on the floor is pension legislation. We are very close to \nan agreement on that. We will be able to do that before Thanksgiving, \nas well, if we continue to make the progress that we have made over the \nlast 2 weeks. We are hoping to reach a unanimous consent agreement that \nwould allow the Senate to proceed on that pensions bill in a reasonable \nperiod of time.\n  I keep stressing reasonable period of time, keeping time requirements \ndown, because in order to accomplish all of this, it is going to take a \nlot of organization, efficiency, understanding, and tolerance on the \npart of all of our colleagues as we go through.\n\n  Finally, I mention our continued efforts on the Executive Calendar, \nas well as a number of other legislative items that will be in wrapup. \nWe will consider those nominations and clear legislation each day this \nweek as they become available, a lot of work over a very short period \nof time.\n  That gets us through this week. Then people ask, what about next \nweek? Until we see the pacing over the next several days, it is going \nto be impossible for me to really know exactly when we are going to be \nout. But I remain hopeful that we can work through the issues that I \njust mentioned and finish this week.\n  The next question: When does this week end? Does it end Friday \nafternoon, Saturday, or Sunday? I cannot answer that yet until we get a \nlittle bit further.\n  There is a chance we could do all of that by late Friday afternoon. \nHowever, if it becomes necessary to stay longer, either into the \nweekend on Saturday or into next week, then we will certainly do just \nthat. Senators are going to have to remain flexible with their \nschedules beyond Friday. I do want to at least throw out that a weekend \nschedule would be possible because I know a lot of people have things \nscheduled. So please keep your calendars flexible.\n  In December, I can also say the following just for planning purposes, \nand that is that we will not be in for votes in December before Monday, \nDecember 12. I will not know until later this week, Saturday night or \nmaybe Monday night of next week exactly what the plans will be for the \nweek beginning December 12. So again I ask our colleagues to keep their \nschedule flexible in case we have no choice but to return sometime \nduring that week.\n  What I have just said is going to stir the pot with lots of questions \ncoming forward, but that is about as much as I know right now. I will \nshare the information on schedule with colleagues as soon as it becomes \napparent to me based on how much work we get done today, tomorrow, the \nnext day, and over the course of this week.\n  On another issue, but related to the bill that we are returning to \nshortly, we are resuming consideration of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act of 2006, day No. 6, and we will complete that bill \ntomorrow. I do want to thank Senator Warner for his steady leadership. \nUnder the guidance of our chairman, we have been able to proceed in a \nvery orderly and smooth manner on a very important bill.\n  Last month, I sent a request to the minority leader asking for his \nagreement to keep amendments limited to issues that are important to \nour military personnel and armed services and that are within the \njurisdiction of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Fortunately, we \nwere able to reach agreement and do just that. I do want to thank our \ncolleagues for their patience and cooperation in allowing us to move \nforward on a bill that is central to America's national security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/14/senate-section/article/S12722-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12722-S12723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MOMENTOUS AND HISTORIC TIMES FOR AMERICA\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, these are momentous and historic times for \nAmerica. In just 4 years, we have toppled two of the most brutal \nregimes in human history and liberated 50 million people from tyranny. \nAfghanistan and Iraq are now governed by the consent of the people \nunder constitutions that have been ratified by the popular vote. Many \npeople simply would not have believed that just several years ago.\n  Next month, on December 15, the Iraqi people will vote to form a \npermanent government. On that day, they will show, once more, their \ntremendous courage, boldness, and fortitude in moving their country \ntoward full democracy and independence.\n  While the news media focuses on the terrorist activity and the \nterrorist insurgency, by any standard of history, Iraq and Afghanistan \nare making remarkable progress. Only 4 years ago, Saddam Hussein and \nthe Taliban seemed like permanent, malignant fixtures in the Middle \nEast, but today Saddam sits in prison on trial for his life, and the \nTaliban no longer rules the Afghani people.\n  Meanwhile, progress is cropping up all over the region. Again, the \nnews media simply does not cover it, and we always hear excuses why \nthat might be the case. But if one just looks back, they will see that \nEgypt has just held its freest elections in history.\n  I had the opportunity to be in Lebanon about a month after this, in \nApril. But this spring, on March 14, the Lebanese people rose up in a \nremarkable protest that was indeed televised throughout the world. We \nall saw it. After 30 years of occupation, Syria was forced to withdraw. \nLibya has given up its weapons of mass destruction program and is now \ncooperating with international inspectors. Kuwait has granted full \npolitical rights to women, and democracy is slowly beginning to take \nroot in Saudi Arabia.\n  All of this has been made possible by the bravery, valor, and \nstrength of our men and women in uniform. They deserve our deepest \nrespect, gratitude, and our unwavering commitment to the success of \ntheir mission. These young people heard the call of duty and they went \nto the frontlines to defend America.\n  Every day, at risk to their own lives, our soldiers are helping the \nIraqis secure a democratic future. They are training Iraqi forces to \ndefend and protect the Iraqi people, and real progress is being made. \nThe Iraqis are getting stronger and they are getting more skilled at \nthe dangerous work of facing down the terrorist enemy.\n  In the recent Tal Afar operation, Iraqi forces outnumbered coalition \nforces for the first time in a major engagement. Eleven Iraqi combat \nbattalions were independently employed in Tal Afar, twice the number \nthan in Fallujah operations this year. That is progress.\n  Currently, 116 Iraqi security forces are conducting operations, and \nIraqi civilians are gaining confidence handling the matters there and \nin providing tips and information to help defeat the insurgents in the \nregion.\n  Meanwhile, Iraq continues to build and improve its infrastructure. \nAgain, you don't see it on the nightly news or on the 24-hour coverage. \nSince the liberation, coalition forces have helped complete over 4,000 \nreconstruction projects, including 3,400 public schools, 304 water \nprojects, 257 fire and police stations, and 149 health facilities.\n  Under Saddam, Iraq's infrastructure was in shambles. Citizens were \nnot allowed free access to the media or to communicate freely with one \nanother. Saddam maintained his iron grip by keeping his people fearful \nand totally cut off from the outside world. But now that has changed. \nSlowly but surely, under the democratic leadership, Iraq is emerging as \na modern country. Internet subscribers have risen from 5,000 to \n196,000. It is opening up. Light is shining into the country and to the \npeople of Iraq.\n  Now over 4.5 million Iraqis have telephone service, and that is a \nfourfold increase to what it was before the war. Under Saddam there was \nnothing such as that. There was no independent media. Today, Iraq has \nmore than 100 newspapers and magazines. There are over 40 commercial \ntelevision stations broadcasting to an eager Iraqi public. They are \nhearing and seeing things for the first times in their lives.\n  We hear the critics hurtle invective and level false charges against \nthe administration. That is disappointing. We know some are, indeed, \ntrying to rewrite history. We hear it on the Senate floor and we see it \non the television news shows. This rewriting of history is wrong. It \nshows, to my mind, very little respect for the very things--the \nfreedom, the democracy, the transparency, letting the light shine in--\nthe sort of things our men and women are fighting for overseas.\n  At the same time that we hear this invective and these false charges, \nbrave men and women--American and, as I just mentioned, Iraqi coalition \nforces,\n\n[[Page S12723]]\n\nand Afghanis--are working hard to promote democracy and freedom in the \nheart of the Middle East. We salute them.\n  Governments that were once sworn enemies of the United States are now \nsworn enemies of the terrorists they once harbored and people who \nfeared their government are now active participants in its \ntransformation. It is huge progress.\n  The Defense authorization bill before us provides our soldiers with \nthe resources and the training, the technology, equipment, and the \nauthorities they need to win this global war on terror. From cutting-\nedge technologies to personnel protection systems, the authorization \nbill keeps our military system strong so our men and women in uniform \ncan keep America safe.\n  I look forward to passage of the Defense authorization bill tomorrow. \nThe Senate has no higher duty than to protect and defend our fellow \ncitizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/14/senate-section/article/S12723-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12723-S12724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             JULIE DAMMANN\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President it is both with deep gratitude and regret \nthat I announce to my colleagues the liberation of my Chief of Staff, \nJulie Dammann, from the public sector.\n  Julie has been with me since I came to town in 1987 and has been a \nperfectly reliable source of sound judgment, energy, and friendship.\n  Within any successful enterprise, there is the heart of the \noperation. In the case of Julie, she has been the heart, the legs, the \nmind, the backbone, and the can-do spirit of my staff.\n  In addition to her professional service, she always subsumed her \ninterests to mine, to the Senate, to the public interest, and most \nimportant, to our country. For the Nation, she has been a loyal public \nservant of the first order and a true patriot.\n  For me, from the time she first marched into my office, she has been \nmy friend. Remarkably, from that first day to the present, through 19 \nCongressional sessions, 3 reelections, marriage, motherhood, and her \nbravely defiant and prevailing fight against cancer, she has never \nstopped. Chemotherapy met its match. She never rested, and she never \nlet me rest either. F. Scott Fitzgerald once said that ``action is \ncharacter,'' In that case, Julie is character. Some who have dealt with \nher would say ``character'' is entirely appropriate.\n  Among her many unique talents is what I have learned is referred to \nas multitasking. At any given time, she can be talking with me, \nlistening to C-SPAN, Blackberrying instructions to staff, while \nchecking out statistics of the previous Vikings game and evaluating the \npotential draft picks 9 months in advance. When she is talking, we all \nlisten as fast as we can, but it can be very hard to keep up.\n  Our great country sends a lot of talent and integrity to Washington \nto staff our congressional offices and Julie is as good as I have seen.\n  Few understand the high-profile issues that are in the papers every \nday. Julie comprehends those ``big'' issues, but is extraordinary with \nthe issues that are low on visibility and high on complexity. She has \nhandled issues including farm credit, patent protection, voting reform, \npostal reform, highway transportation funding formulas, and \nCalifornia's clean air enforcement regulations, just to mention a few. \nHer intellectual dexterity has earned her extraordinary respect among \nher colleagues who have worked with her; and particularly those who \nhave worked against her.\n  Julie began her work for the Senate in 1979, as an intern with \nSenator Rudy Boschwitz, eventually coming to Washington in 1982 as one \nof his legislative assistants--where one of her first major assignments \nwas the Highway bill.\n  In 1987, after joining my staff as Legislative Director, she met Rolf \nDammann at the National Republican Senatorial Committee who was \napparently interested in more than her highly-regarded agricultural \nacumen. Rolfs new found interest in Budget and appropriations issues \neventually paid off and they were married--after the 1988 election, of \ncourse. They both enjoy politics, history, golf, and German beer. As \nlegendary Green Bay Packers coach once said, ``On third and long, I'll \ntake the beer drinkers to milk drinkers any day.'' But more on the \nlegendary Packers later.\n  Rolf and Julie are the proud parents of two daughters, Monika who is \nnow 10, and Paula 8.\n  In 1997, Julie became my Chief of Staff.\n  During consideration of the Fiscal Year 1988 Va/HUD appropriations \nbill, we were able to expedite completion of the bill by successfully \nappealing to Senators that Julie needed to leave the floor to have her \nsecond daughter who was due to arrive that very day. Betting on the \nSenate internally to be family-friendly was a bold strategy Julie \nsuggested, but it worked.\n\n  I noted to the Senate that:\n\n       I want to make a special mention of my chief of staff, \n     Julie Dammann, whose second child was due today and she \n     stayed with us throughout all the proceedings and wanted to \n     see the VA-HUD bill delivered first. She has been an \n     invaluable help in all legislative activities and helped us \n     shepherd this through, So, a very special thank you, and best \n     wishes to Julie, to Rolf and their other daughter, Monika. \n     Again, I express my appreciation.\n\n  Senator Mikulski echoed the comments saying:\n\n       I hope that she can go home, rest easy, put her feet up and \n     we are looking forward to being the proud Godparents of Bond-\n     Mikulski. Maybe we will name something after her in \n     conference.\n\n  In any event, the bill passed, and Paula arrived.\n  Julie was born in Roseville, MN and graduated from the University of \nMinnesota while also becoming a diehard Gopher, Vikings and Twins fan. \nFor those indiscretions, she was forced to undertake an amnesty program \nand extensive, but unsuccessful, Bond-office Missouri rehabilitation \nprogram.\n  The fact that she was able to stay in my employ after the Twins-\nCardinals World Series of 1987 an epic tragedy which occurred in the \nhorrible chamber the twins call a baseball stadium, speaks volumes to \nher otherwise high value.\n  In fact, the only successful indoctrination resulted in the staff \nbeing forced to root against the arch-rival Green Bay Packers. Even one \nof my leatherneck Marines on staff, a Packer fan, minds his football \nmanners around Julie.\n  Rolfs father, a native of Germany, bought Julie a 2-foot-tall Packers \nNFL action figure for Christmas one year as a joke--it sat in the \ngarage unopened for over a year until it was re-gifted to a friend in \nGermany. Julie believes that the opposition should be given little room \nto breath and that U.S. citizenship is a privilege which should not be \nabused.\n  But while competitive, she always respected the process and the \npeople on both sides working diligently to pursue the agenda they were \nelected or hired to pursue.\n  Through all the pressures, high expectations, and fast city life, I \nthink that Julie may be proudest of her terrific family and, proudest \nthat to this day, she quite obviously remains a small town Minnesota \ngal--hard work, loyalty, integrity, optimism, enthusiasm, and courage, \nwhich can often be misinterpreted in Julie's case as stubbornness.\n  Her parents, the late Dr. Paul Hasbargen and Mrs. Ervina Hasbargen \nmade Washington a better place by producing Julie and lending her to \nthe Federal Government.\n  For me, having Julie has been one of my greatest blessings in public \nlife. In this case, it is unlike losing one member of the family \nbecause I am simultaneously losing a colleague, a trusted advisor, and, \nyes, at times a mother. We know that she will be very successful in the \nprivate sector, with her intelligence, experience and drive.\n  Julie, with the deepest affection, we have been honored to be near \nyou for so many years. We will miss you. We wish you and your family \nthe very best.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I was just asked by a news reporter about \nthe President's trip to Asia. The President is now going to Japan, \nKorea, and China and will be talking, presumably, about a wide range of \nissues, including trade. My hope certainly is that he will talk about \ntrade.\n  Last month, we had a trade deficit of $66 billion--in 1 month--one-\nthird of it from China. When the President goes to China, he could \nvisit a lot of American jobs because the jobs that used to be here in \nAmerica exist now in China--jobs that made bicycles, Radio Flyer's \nLittle Red Wagon, Tony Lama boots. The jobs that used to make a wide \nrange of products now exist in China. An American President--any \nAmerican President--visiting China could visit a lot of American jobs. \nThey are not the same kind of jobs that existed in America because in \nAmerica, in most cases, those jobs were performed by employees who made \na decent wage and who had benefits. No longer, in most cases. Those \njobs in China are being performed by people who are being paid a small \namount of money and no benefits.\n  By the way, if they complain about the working conditions, they will \nbe either fired or put in prison.\n  As the President goes to China in the shadow of last month's \ndevastating announcement of a $66 billion monthly trade deficit, one-\nthird of it coming from China, what should the President do? It seems \nto me the President, with respect to China, Japan, and Korea--all three \nof those countries--should begin to get tough and exhibit on the part \nof this country a backbone that says to countries with whom we do \nbusiness, we expect and demand and deserve fair trade.\n  Fair trade means it is mutually beneficial. It is not fair, and it is \nnot mutually beneficial when last month--when the last month for which \nwe had reporting--we bought one dollar's worth of goods from China, and \nfor every dollar's worth of goods from China we sold them 10 cents' \nworth. A dollar and 10 cents--that is not fair trade. With a $66 \nbillion trade deficit, with nearly 20 percent of it coming from the \ncountry of China, we ought to expect something substantially different.\n  The Commerce Department announced that the trade deficit that \nshattered all records was in the month of September. Our country had a \ntrade deficit of $66 billion.\n  This is what it looks like. Our country is choking in red ink. Behind \nthis red are American jobs leaving for China. Companies know they can \nsimply get rid of their American workers and save a lot of money by \nhiring people in Third World countries--in this case, China--and they \ncan presumably boost their profits believing, apparently, that people \nare like wrenches and pliers. You just get rid of them when you are \ndone with them and find something less expensive. Go and hire that less \nexpensive commodity--in this case ``commoditizing'' labor.\n  This is what our trade deficit looks like with China. We have a $220 \nbillion annual deficit with China. You can see what has happened. We \nare sinking into a deep abyss with respect to the trade deficit with \nChina.\n  One of the reasons for the trade deficit is piracy and \ncounterfeiting. That is just one of the reasons.\n  Let me describe something interesting. This happens to be the logo \nfor the 2008 Chinese Olympics. It says: Beijing 2008. It is a great-\nlooking logo. It actually belongs to the Chinese. The Chinese know how \nvaluable a logo like this is because in Greece they had the logo for \nthe Greek Olympics, and I am told they raised something over $850 \nmillion with this logo. So the Chinese know.\n\n  First of all, this logo belongs to them. Secondly, it is very \nvaluable. And some people on the streets of China decided they were \ngoing to counterfeit this logo. They decided, We are going to pirate \nthis logo. They started selling mugs, coffee mugs, banners, all kinds \nof things with the official Chinese logo on it for the 2008 Olympics.\n  Guess what. The Chinese Government can, in fact, control piracy and \ncounterfeiting. They demonstrated it.\n  The President, if he gets out of the car and walks down the street in \nBeijing, will not find someone selling counterfeit goods. They are \ngone. They are in prison. They are off the streets. The Chinese \nGovernment shut them down, just like that, in an instant.\n  So when it is their money that is at stake, they understand how to \nstop piracy and counterfeiting. They do it.\n  Two-thirds of all counterfeit and pirated goods coming into this \ncountry come from China. Does China lift a finger to stop it? Not a \nfinger; don't care; doesn't matter to them. It mattered when it was \ngoring their ox, when they were about ready to lose money. Then it \nmattered.\n  So the question is, What do we do about this? I could put up a chart \nthat shows Japan, a $60 billion to $70 billion a year--every single \nyear--trade deficit.\n  I could put up a chart that shows Korea and talk about my favorite \nsubject with Korea: that little old Dodge pickup truck called the Dodge \nDakota. I kind of like the name because it is named after my State--\nDakota. It is so wonderful they named a pickup truck after it.\n  At a time when 700,000 vehicles come into this country over the high \nseas from Korea to be sold to the American consumers, we are able to \nsell, if we are lucky, about 3,800 to 3,900 vehicles in Korea. So \n700,000 this way, and 3,800 to 3,900 going to Korea.\n  Why is that? The Koreans don't want American cars in Korea, and 99 \npercent of the vehicles on the roads in Korea are Korean-made vehicles. \nThat is what the Korean Government wants.\n  The Dodge Dakota folks thought they would have a niche in Korea \nselling Dodge Dakota pickup trucks. For the first 3 or 4 months they \nstarted selling some. All of a sudden, the Korean Government shut them \ndown just like that. With Japan, with Korea, and with China, the fact \nis, in all of these cases, governments take action to complete trade \narrangements with us that are not mutually beneficial--trade \narrangements that hurt us, ship our jobs overseas and help them.\n  This trip by the President is very important. The question is, Will \nthis country stand up for its own economic interests? There is no \nevidence in the past that it will.\n  My colleague, Senator Graham, and I have offered several pieces of \nlegislation on these very issues. But there is a giant yawn on the part \nof the U.S. Congress, not very interested; giant yawn at the White \nHouse, not very interested.\n  Why is that? It is because most of these policies--I am talking about \npolicies that affect the jobs of our citizens, policies that affect \nthis country's economy, and whether we grow or not, whether people have \na good job that pays well with benefits--are viewed through the lens of \nsoft-headed foreign policy and not hard-nosed economic policy.\n  That is the problem. You have to run all these things by the U.S. \nState Department to see if we could begin to be a little bit tough and \ntake some action, maybe, with respect to some unfair trade practices of \nthe Chinese. Oh, no. We are worried about offending the Chinese. Don't \ndo it.\n  They are engaged in managed trade and hard-nosed economic issues, and \nwe are engaged in soft-headed foreign policy.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I don't know if anyone has done an analysis of our trade \ndeficit. What percentage does the Senator believe is directly \nattributable to unfair trade practices on behalf of the Chinese? It is \none thing to be outworked. If people work harder than you do and are \nsmarter than you are, shame on you. But I believe, as the Senator does, \nthat a lot of the market share that we are losing in the trade deficit \nexplosion has to do with Chinese Government policy when it comes to \ntrade behavior rather than just simply outworking the American worker.\n  What is the Senator's view on that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I don't have a numeric answer to that. But I think it is \nself-\n\n[[Page S12725]]\n\nevident that most of the trade deficit we have with China has to do not \nwith fair competition but a manipulation of currency, a refusal to deal \nwith piracy and counterfeiting, a refusal to open their markets. I \nthink that is what it is about.\n  To give you a point of reference, the U.S Trade Ambassador's Office, \non April 29 of this year, issued its report. This is our official \nGovernment report. It concludes that Chinese piracy was at epidemic \nlevels and that the Chinese had broken promises.\n  Despite the fact the Chinese continued to break promises, piracy of \nour intellectual properties was at epidemic levels, and two-thirds of \nthe pirated products coming into this country are coming from China, \ndespite that, our Trade Ambassador says it is not ready to file a WTO \ncase against China. Why? Because, instead, we are going to put China on \na watch list. Boy, that will teach them. You put somebody on a watch \nlist, and that will strike fear in the hearts of almost anybody. A \npriority watch list.\n  Here are the deficits with China. Going back to 1996, $39 billion. Go \nback another 7 years, and we had a balanced trade with China. But it is \nsinking deeper and deeper into this abyss. Now, all of a sudden we are \ngoing to put them on a priority watch list.\n  On behalf of farmers in North Dakota, I can say I know that inside \nthe administration, in the Trade Policy Review Group, they made a \nrecommendation that we should take action against China with respect to \nunfair trade dealing with wheat. But the State Department said they \nthought it would be too much ``in your face.'' So they wouldn't do it. \nThey ran it through the State Department. Would this offend somebody if \nwe decided they ought to play fair?\n  Yes. It might offend them. Let us not do that.\n  I have said many times there is not anyone in this Chamber whose job \nis jeopardized by this unfair trade with these three Asian countries.\n  I could also describe it with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union \nas well. But because the President is on a trip to Asia, I am talking \nabout the problems we confront there. It is safe to say there is no one \nin this Chamber serving in the Senate who is going to lose his or her \njob due to a bad trade agreement, or due to us not having the backbone \nto demand of other countries that they play fair. Nobody here is going \nto lose their job. We will just sit around, thumb our suspenders, toot \nour horn, and put on our blue suits every morning. But nobody's job is \nin jeopardy. It is just a lot of other people's jobs that are in \njeopardy.\n  Do you remember that little Etch A Sketch? Everybody played with Etch \nA Sketch. There were two knobs on it. You had some sand in there, and \nyou tried to draw a picture on your Etch A Sketch. Gone--gone to China. \nThey are all gone.\n  I could go through a list of 100 companies. In fact, I should bring \nover just the first 6 months of this year, the Department of Labor's \nreport which is 33 pages, on both sides, single-spaced, of the names of \ncompanies that have sourced jobs off our shores. It is 33 pages, \nsingle-spaced, the names of companies--not people, companies.\n  It is unbelievable what is happening. They are selling this country \npiece by piece. When today we import $2 billion more than we export, \nthe financial transaction is we put in the hands of foreigners the \ncurrency or securities by which they own part of America. Each day they \nbuy $2 billion more of this country. It doesn't seem to mean a whit to \nanybody.\n  Last week was the announcement of the $66 billion monthly trade \ndeficit. Did you hear any outcry from this Chamber? I came over and \ngave a little speech--but nothing. It is almost like everybody pulls \ntheir sombrero down and takes a big siesta and sleeps forever on this \nsubject.\n  Then what is going to happen someday--because I think every economist \nunderstands this cannot stand. You can't keep doing this. You add this \n$700 billion trade deficit to a $550 billion budget debt increase this \nyear--yes, this year--that is $1.2 trillion that we sunk deeper in debt \nin this country. We cannot keep doing that. Every economist understands \nthat. But nobody is saying much because we are all for the jingoistic \n``free trade.''\n\n  Give folks some tambourines and robes, put them on the street corner, \nand let them bang around out there chanting ``free trade.'' But when \nthe American people have had enough of it, they will say stop already. \nWe fought for 100 years for good jobs with good benefits and the right \nto organize; now you will pole-vault over that and ship the jobs \nelsewhere and go visit them as you talk about trade? At some point when \nthis collapses--and it will; this cannot continue--when it collapses of \nits weight, we are all going to stand around, thumbing our pockets and \nsaying: We knew it could not last.\n  Really? Read the Washington Post. By the way, if you do read the \nWashington Post, you will not read both sides of this debate because \nthe Washington Post will run only one side. I have actually gone back \nfor 6 years. We did a column appraisal of what the Washington Post runs \nwith respect to trade. If you are for free trade, which is jingoistic \nnonsense about shipping America's jobs overseas and running our trade \npolicy through the eye of the needle called foreign policy, if you are \nfor that, God bless you, send some op-ed pieces our way, we would love \nto run them. If you are on the other side, if you believe in fair trade \nand that free trade and the monumental deficits are hurting this \ncountry and shipping jobs overseas, try to get an op-ed piece published \nin the Washington Post. Good luck. Take some medicine, it will take \nsome while. It just will not happen. The whole town is like that on \nthis issue.\n  I understand, when we have that much invested in failure, you \ncertainly want to defend it. But there will come a time, in my \njudgment, when everyone has to understand this is not representing the \nlong-term economic interests of our country.\n  Producing products for 30 cents an hour with kids working 7 days a \nweek so you can ship them to a big box retailer in this country and \nsell them for pennies might be good, in the short term, for corporate \nprofits, but it is not good for the long-term economic interests of \nthis country. One day enough Members will wake up. It has not happened \nyet. It did not happen on the Central America Free Trade Agreement \nwhich we had in this Senate, another chapter in the book of failures. \nIt did not happen. Enough said.\n  First, let's agree that we will bind our hands and not allow any \namendments. So agree not to be original and let's not think about this \nstuff. And second, when we have the vote, we will also agree to vote \nfor a treaty--and it is a treaty but was called an agreement so it does \nnot need 67 votes--we will agree to something that was negotiated \nbehind closed doors somewhere else. And we will continue to open the \nnew testament of trade dogma believing that somehow it will have a \nhappy ending. It will not.\n  President Bush is on his way to Asia. I want him to succeed. But I \ndoubt whether he will raise these hard-nosed, tough trade issues in a \nsignificant way that tells these countries, ``Enough is enough.'' I \nwant our country to stand up for its economic interests. Its economic \ninterest is rooted, yes, in some expanded trade. No question about \nthat. But it is rooted especially in the demand to require full trade.\n  If I might make one additional observation, the same companies \nshipping companies overseas all in the name of profit because they do \nnot say the Pledge of Allegiance in those boardrooms anymore, those \nsame companies do not want to pay taxes in most cases. Here is an \ninteresting statistic: In the Cayman Islands, there is a five-story \nwhite building. That five-story white building is home to 12,748 \ncorporations. They do not all live there. No, no, they get their mail \nthere. It is a mail box. The mail box is for the purpose of being able \nto say they belong to the Grand Cayman Islands and they can avoid \npaying taxes in the United States.\n  Isn't that interesting, and also disgusting, that 12,000 companies \nare claiming one white five-story building in the Cayman Islands as \ntheir home?\n  Finally, as part of all of this, this Congress--yes, this Congress--\ndecided to give a special gift to those that have exported jobs. The \ngift was to say that in this year, if you have moved jobs overseas, if \nyou have created foreign subsidiaries and you are doing business \noverseas, we will allow you to repatriate your foreign earnings on \nwhich\n\n[[Page S12726]]\n\nyou expected someday to pay a tax in the United States, we will allow \nyou to repatriate those earnings, and you get a special income tax rate \nthat no other American gets. It is a 5.25 rate. Does Mrs. Smith pay \nthat? Mr. Jones? Mr. Johnson? The people of North Dakota pay that? The \npeople of Tennessee? No, no, only one group. Just the group that moved \ntheir jobs overseas, made a lot of money overseas, who expect to have \nto pay income taxes on it. When they bring it back to this country, \nthey are told, Bring it back, we will give you a sweetheart deal, 5.25 \npercent.\n  That was called a JOBS Act. In fact, we now see the result. Companies \nare bringing somewhere around $300 billion back, and the very companies \nthat are repatriating these earnings and paying 5.25 percent income \ntaxes--a fraction of what the lowest income American is paying--they \nare cutting jobs and moving jobs overseas.\n  My colleague who sat in this desk, the amendment that would have \nstripped that little sweetheart deal for these companies. I supported \nhim, spoke for him, and he lost. Why? Because as in the rest of trade, \nthere are sufficient numbers who will stand up in this Senate and say: \nSign me up. Let me give a special deal to those companies that not only \ndo business in that five-story white building in the Caymans but also \ngive them an opportunity to pay 5.25 percent income tax when they \nrepatriate the money to the United States.\n  I hope one day all of those workers in America who had good jobs, who \nwere proud of them, and who were taking care of their families someday \nmarch on this Capitol and ask the question: Where is my job? What did \nyou do to my job? How much did you reward the people that took my job \nand moved it overseas? It would be an interesting question and one that \nought to be answered by people in this Senate, by people in the White \nHouse, and people in the House as well.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator from Florida ask that he be allowed to \nproceed as in morning business?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be \nallowed to proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

I thank the Senator and I thank the Senators \nfrom South Carolina and Michigan for giving me the privilege to share \nwith the Senate what I have experienced since I have returned from a \nmeeting in West Palm Beach with senior citizens concerned about the \nimplementation of the prescription drug benefit for Medicare which \nstarts tomorrow.\n  This prescription drug benefit, which many in this Senate opposed \nbecause it was faulty, it was a meager benefit, and it broke the \nprinciples of free enterprise economics by not allowing the Federal \nGovernment, through Medicare, to negotiate the prices of prescription \ndrugs downward by bulk purchases, as has been the case in Government \nfor the past two decades through the Veterans' Administration, as well \nas the Department of Defense. Veterans today pay $7 per month for their \nprescription drugs. Part of that is subsidized. But a large part of \nthat is the fact that the Veterans' Administration buys prescription \ndrugs in huge quantities and therefore negotiates a lower price.\n  Not so with the prescription drug benefit passed for Medicare in this \nSenate, of which almost half--maybe not quite half of the Senate, \nincluding this Senate--voted against. But, nevertheless, it is the law. \nIt is being implemented tomorrow.\n  The current law says the senior citizens of this country have until \nnext May in order to make a determination which one of these plans--\noften they may be through an HMO or they may be through some \norganization created for the dispensing of the drugs--but which one of \nthese plans they will choose, or choose nothing, especially if their \nformer employer, now that they are retired, is providing under their \nretirement a prescription drug plan.\n  It sounds, on the surface, that a decision could be made. But the \nfact is a senior citizen in West Palm Beach this morning told me there \nwere 103 plans that senior citizens were trying to choose between. \nThere is confusion. There is concern. There is fear that if they do not \nchoose the right plan, then they are not going to be able to change for \na whole year.\n  There is all of this confusion and additional concerns. Maybe the \nsenior citizen lives in a small town that has only one or two \npharmacies, and naturally the senior citizen wants to continue to get \ntheir prescription drugs from that pharmacy. But what happens if the \nplan they choose does not use that pharmacy? Again, concern for \ninstability, concern for not being able to get the kind of drugs they \nwant and need.\n  Another concern voiced to me this morning in that meeting in West \nPalm Beach was, What if I choose a plan that, in fact, provides the \ndrugs my doctor prescribes for me now, but what happens if the doctor \nchanges the prescription to a drug that is not covered by that \nparticular plan? They are stuck, and they are stuck for a year, until \nat the end of that year when they can change plans.\n  These are the questions senior citizens are asking all around this \nNation. And they are asking these questions in my State of Florida.\n  What should we do? A very practical approach is to extend the \ndeadline so senior citizens will have more time to make up their mind, \nto evaluate the plans, to be counseled in order to get the right plan. \nRemember, with the advances of modern medicine through the miracles of \nprescription drugs, so often the quality of life is dependent upon the \nright prescription and that prescription being available to the person \nand especially so to the senior citizen. It is my hope the Senate will \nrecognize we need to buy some time for our seniors.\n  I have filed a bill that extends the deadline from May until \nDecember. That legislation would also allow, in the course of that \nyear, up to the end of 2006, if the senior citizen makes a mistake and \nchooses the wrong plan and then realizes their mistake, they will be \nable to change their plan. Furthermore, for those with the great \nuncertainty of whether they are going to stick with their former \nemployer-based prescription drug plan, that if they choose and make a \nmistake and want to go back to their employer, they have that grace \nperiod of 1 year up to the end of December of next year in order to be \nable to go back to their employer-based plan.\n  Is this too much to ask for our seniors? Out of all of the confusion, \nout of all the concern and what is now turning into fright for our \nseniors, this is, after all, what was enacted, and was supposed to help \nsenior citizens.\n  The Department of HHS, so you can clarify this, Mr. Senior Citizen, \nsays you can go on our Web site. Senators, I bet you all have a number \nof senior citizens who are not accustomed to using the computer and \ngoing on the Web. We need to give them some relief.\n  Now, the bill I filed, I am looking for the legislative vehicle to \nattach it to as an amendment.\n  I wanted the Senate to know, directly expressed to me in this meeting \nthis morning, the great confusion and consternation that is being felt \nout there among many of those in what Tom Brokaw labeled the ``Greatest \nGeneration,'' those who have helped us to enjoy the freedoms we have. I \nthink for us to do less than to help them out would certainly be less \nthan the honor we should pay to our seniors.\n  At an appropriate time, with an appropriate legislative vehicle, I \nwill offer this bill as an amendment.\n  In the meantime, I thank the leadership of our Senate Armed Services \nCommittee for the great job they have all done in handling this \nlegislation. And I thank them for the privilege of serving on that \ncommittee. It has been a great blessing to me to work with people of \nthe caliber we have on our Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/14/senate-section/article/S12726-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Florida leaves the \nfloor, I wish to do two things. First, I want to thank him for the \nenergy and the perception he has shown in pointing out some of the \nproblems with this prescription drug benefit which was voted on.\n  He has a lot of seniors in his State, and he is uniquely aware of, \nsensitive to, and determined to see if we cannot make some changes in \nthis process which will make what we have done a lot more friendly to \nseniors. I cannot think of anybody in this body who knows more about \nthis subject or is more determined to make the changes necessary for \nthe benefit of our seniors.\n  Because of the confusion out there, the uncertainty is rife. We do \nnot have quite as many seniors in our State as they do in Florida, but \nour seniors are telling me pretty generally what the seniors down in \nFlorida are saying to the Senator from Florida. I thank him and commend \nhim for the leadership he is taking and for the proposed change he is \nproposing.\n  Secondly, I thank him for his service on the Armed Services \nCommittee. We have a wonderful committee. It is a bipartisan committee. \nThe Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, makes an important contribution \nto it. He is there all the time with very perceptive questions that are \nintended to support the men and women in our military. I thank him for \nhis participation.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico, I believe, now is ready \nto offer an amendment which is referred to in the unanimous consent \nagreement. I will yield to him 15 minutes, should he so need 15 \nminutes, on our side of the debate for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan for \nyielding.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2523 to Amendment No. 2515\n\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and I ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2523 to amendment No. 2515.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                  (Purpose: To improve the amendment)\n\n       Strike subsection (d) and insert the following:\n       (d) Judicial Review of Detention of Enemy Combatants.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \n     Circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction to consider an \n     application for writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf \n     of an alien outside the United States (as that term is \n     defined in section 101(a)(38) of the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(38))--\n       (A) who is, at the time a request for review by such court \n     is filed, detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo \n     Bay, Cuba; and\n       (B) for whom a Combatant Status Review Tribunal has been \n     conducted, pursuant to applicable procedures specific by the \n     Department of Defense.\n       (2) Exceptions.--This subsection does not apply to the \n     following:\n       (A) An individual charged with an offense before a military \n     commission.\n       (B) An individual who is not designated as an enemy \n     combatant following a combatant status review, but who \n     continues to be held by the United States Government.\n       (3) Venue.--Review under paragraph (1) shall commence in \n     the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit.\n       (4) Claims reviewable.--The United States Court of Appeals \n     for the District of Columbia Circuit may not, in a review \n     under paragraph (1) with respect to an alien, consider claims \n     based on living conditions, but may only hear claims \n     regarding--\n       (A) whether the status determination of the Combatant \n     Status Review Tribunal with regard to such alien was \n     consistent with the procedures and standards specified by the \n     Secretary of Defense for Combatant Status Review Tribunals;\n       (B) whether such status determination was supported by \n     sufficient evidence and reached in accordance with due \n     process of law, provided that statements obtained through \n     undue coercion, torture, or cruel or inhuman treatment may \n     not be used as a basis for the determination; and\n       (C) the lawfulness of the detention of such alien.\n       (5) Termination on release from custody.--The jurisdiction \n     of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit with respect to the claims of an alien under \n     this subsection shall cease upon the release of such alien \n     from the custody or control of the United States.\n       (6) Effective date.--This subsection shall apply to any \n     application or other action that is pending on or after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, before describing the amendment, let me \ntalk briefly in opposition to Senator Graham's amendment, the \nunderlying amendment that was adopted by the Senate on Thursday, and \naddress some of the mistaken claims that were made last week during the \ndebate on that amendment.\n  There were a lot of statements made last week. It is important to be \nclear about what the Graham amendment does. The amendment, as drafted, \nas voted on last week in the Senate, would overrule a Supreme Court \ncase issued earlier this year that recognized the longstanding right to \nfile a petition for habeas corpus. This right is absolutely \nfundamental. It is the right of an individual who is being detained by \nthe executive branch of our Government to question the legality of that \nperson's detention.\n  Contrary to what Senator Graham has said, I do not believe we are \ngiving prisoners new rights in the amendment that I just sent to the \ndesk or in the underlying bill. I believe we need to keep in place the \nrights that have already existed, that currently exist, and that the \nSupreme Court has recognized. We need to prevent the courts from being \nstripped of the authority they have and have always had.\n  Let me take a moment to address the notion that we should not care \nabout these individuals because these individuals are terrorists. \nFrankly, I have no doubt that some of the individuals being detained at \nGuantanamo are a threat, and it is for this reason I have never \nadvocated that we release these prisoners. But we need to recognize \nthat not all of these prisoners are necessarily terrorists in the sense \nthat we are debating that here.\n  There is a January 2005 Wall Street Journal article stating:\n\n       American commanders acknowledge that many of the prisoners \n     shouldn't have been locked up here in the first place because \n     they weren't dangerous and didn't know anything of value.\n\n  The article also quoted BG Jay Hood, the commander at Guantanamo, \nsaying:\n\n       Sometimes, we just didn't get the right folks.\n\n  The deputy commander, GEN Martin Lucenti, was also quoted as saying:\n\n       Most of these guys weren't fighting. They were running.\n\n  My point is simple. It is reasonable to insist that when the \nGovernment deprives a person of his or her liberty--and in this case \nfor an indefinite period of time--the individual have a meaningful \nopportunity to challenge the legality of their detention and challenge \nwhether they are being wrongfully detained. This is not a radical \nproposition I have enunciated. It is enshrined in our Constitution. It \nwas recently reaffirmed by our own Supreme Court in the Rasul decision.\n  That brings me to the second point. Last week, Senator Kyl compared \nchallenges by Guantanamo prisoners to a frivolous prisoner lawsuit \nfiled by an inmate in Arizona who was unhappy\n\n[[Page S12728]]\n\nwith the type of peanut butter he was being served at his meals.\n  Let's be clear. We are not talking about depriving a person of their \nright to eat a certain type of peanut butter. We are talking about \nindividuals challenging their indefinite imprisonment. If a claim is \nfiled that is frivolous, a court can simply refuse to hear the claim.\n  We are also not talking about suits against U.S. soldiers. There were \nstatements made in last week's debate about ``we don't want these \nprisoners going and suing our soldiers.'' There is nothing in what I am \nproposing or what is currently in place that permits that. We are \ntalking about suits challenging the legality of a person's imprisonment \nby our own Government. The right to challenge the legality of one's \ndetention by the Government is one of the most fundamental human \nrights, the right to be free from being unlawfully detained by the \nGovernment.\n  It was also argued, last week, that by refusing to overrule the Rasul \ndecision, which was issued by our Nation's highest Court this last \nyear, we are giving Guantanamo prisoners access to rights that even our \nown soldiers do not enjoy.\n  Last week, Senator Graham asserted:\n\n       Here is the one thing I can tell you for sure as a military \n     lawyer. A POW or an enemy combatant facing law of armed \n     conflict charges has not been given the right of habeas \n     corpus for 200 years because our own people in our own \n     military facing court-martials, who could be sentenced to \n     death, do not have the right of habeas corpus. It is about \n     military law. I am not changing anything. I am getting us \n     back to what we have done for 200 years.\n\n  Frankly, that statement is completely an incorrect representation of \nwhat the Graham amendment does. If a U.S. soldier is detained for \ncommitting a crime, then that soldier is charged, provided an attorney, \nand tried pursuant to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Military \npersonnel can challenge a court-martial conviction by filing a writ \nof habeas corpus in a U.S. district court pursuant to 28 USC 2241. \nCases such as Dodson v. Zeliz, which is a Tenth Circuit decision in \n1990, demonstrate that they are provided such habeas corpus relief or \nthe opportunity to file for habeas corpus.\n\n  One could also look at CPT Dwight Sullivan's article, ``The Last Line \nof Defense: Federal Habeas Review of Military Death Penalty Cases,'' in \nthe Military Law Review, from 1994, to see that U.S. servicemen are \nalso allowed to seek habeas review in death penalty cases.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter sent to me by \nthe chief defense counsel for the Office of Military Commissions, COL \nDwight Sullivan, that flushes out these points, be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. With regard to these Guantanamo prisoners, the \nadministration has refused to apply the laws of war, and only a handful \nof the 500 prisoners held at Guantanamo have been charged. None have \nbeen tried as yet, and it is unreasonable to say that these prisoners \nare being granted more rights than our military personnel.\n  I would also like to take a moment to read to you the names of some \nof the many people who oppose the Graham amendment: John Hudson, a \nformer Judge Advocate General of the Navy, has written to me indicating \nhis strong opposition; John Gibbons, a former Nixon appointee who \nserved on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals; Eugene Fidell, the \npresident of the National Institute of Military Justice; Dwight \nSullivan, the chief defense counsel for the Office of Military \nCommissions. And I have a long list of other distinguished former \nofficials of our military. They have joined, and I will enter letters \nthey have given to me as part of the Record in a moment.\n  These leaders have dedicated their lives to fighting for and \npreserving our freedom, democracy, human rights, and respect for the \nrule of law. They oppose the Graham amendment because they see it as \ncontrary to the values and rights that the men and women of our armed \nservices have fought for.\n  I have no doubt that some of my colleagues are concerned that if they \nvote against the Graham amendment, they would face 30-second attack ads \naccusing them of being soft on terrorism. But this is not about our \nresolve to defeat terrorists. This is about our resolve to maintain in \nplace the legal protections on which our country was established. These \nare hard decisions. They are tough votes. This is the Senate. We have \ntaken an obligation to uphold the Constitution of the United States, \neven in times of war.\n  The amendment I offer would maintain the right to seek a meaningful \njudicial review. Specifically, the amendment would allow individuals--\nany individual--to seek habeas review but would provide that the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit would have \nexclusive jurisdiction to hear these claims. It would also limit the \nability of a court to consider claims regarding one's living \nconditions, such as whether they were given peanut butter of a \nparticular type or access to particular DVDs or whatever other \nfrivolous claim might be envisioned. It would, however, allow a person \nto seek review regarding whether he or she is being unlawfully \nimprisoned. If a court determines that the detention is lawful, the \ncourt can simply deny the petitioner's application.\n  There are good provisions in the Graham amendment, but there are also \nsome extremely problematic sections. Both the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee argued on the Senate floor, last \nThursday, that this is an issue that needs careful consideration before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. Unfortunately, it appears this proposal \nmay have the votes to move forward.\n  The amendment I am offering will keep in place the necessary \nprotections in our Constitution and in our common law, and it will also \ntake the necessary steps to ensure there is a proper and expedited \nprocedure for these proceedings.\n  Mr. President, let me, briefly, before I yield the floor, call my \ncolleagues' attention to some of these letters that I think are \nextremely important and make the case extremely well. I have previously \nalluded to the letter I received from COL Dwight Sullivan, U.S. Marine \nCorps Reserve, Chief Defense Counsel for the Office of Military \nCommissions. This is the office that was established in the Department \nof Defense to defend people who are charged by military commissions.\n  Colonel Sullivan goes step by step through the various statements \nthat have been made in support of the Graham amendment and refutes \nthose contentions at every step.\n  I also have a letter from the National Institute of Military Justice, \nwritten by Eugene Fidell. Let me read it to my colleagues:\n\n       On behalf of the National Institute of Military Justice \n     (and as a retired Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Coast \n     Guard Reserve), I am writing to express NIMJ's strong \n     opposition to Senator Graham's amendment to the Defense \n     Authorization Bill, withdrawing federal court authority to \n     grant writs of habeas corpus on the petition of non-citizens \n     in military custody as enemy combatants.\n       The proposed amendment would sanction unreviewable \n     Executive detention that cannot be harmonized with our \n     Nation's longstanding adherence to the rule of law. Military \n     detention without due process is antithetical to our \n     fundamental values, values that our men and women in uniform \n     put their lives on the line to protect.\n       The practical effect of the amendment would be to validate \n     actions by non-democratic countries around the world. Some of \n     these countries may try to jail our citizens (including but \n     not limited to GIs) on trumped-up grounds and then deny them \n     access to judicial forums in which they might at least try to \n     gain their freedom or fairer treatment. We should not take a \n     step we would be unwilling to see others apply to our fellow \n     citizens. We disable ourselves from objecting to flagrant \n     lawlessness elsewhere when we shut the doors to our courts, \n     which are the jewel in the crown of our democracy.\n       I will only add that oftentimes when NIMJ considers taking \n     a position on a matter of public policy our directors and \n     advisors have a range of views. That is one of our strengths \n     as an organization. On this one, we are emphatically of one \n     mind.\n\n  I also have letters from the Brennan Center for Justice in opposition \nto the Graham amendment, from the Franklin Pierce Law Center in \nopposition to the amendment, and a letter signed by nine former \ngenerals and admirals in the military indicating their opposition, also \nsigned by Scott Silliman, former U.S. Air Force Judge Advocate, \nindicating their strong opposition to the Graham amendment unless it is \nchanged as my amendment would change it.\n\n[[Page S12729]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to print those letters in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Brennan Center for Justice\n\n\n                                         at NYU School of Law,\n\n                                   New York, NY, November 9, 2005.\n     Re: Graham Jurisdiction-Stripping Amendment to Defense \n         Appropriations Bill\n\n       Dear Senator: The Brennan Center for Justice at New York \n     University School of Law strongly urges you to oppose an \n     amendment, sponsored by Senator Lindsey Graham, expected to \n     be offered as early as today, that would strip all courts, \n     including the United States Supreme Court, of jurisdiction to \n     consider habeas corpus petitions or ``any other action \n     challenging any aspect of the detention'' of foreign \n     detainees held at Guantanamo Bay. We urge you to reject the \n     Graham Amendment because it would violate key constitutional \n     principles and would inflict great damage on both the \n     reputation of the United States and our ability to persuade \n     other countries to lend critical cooperation in counter-\n     terrorism efforts.\n       The Brennan Center, founded in 1995, unites thinkers and \n     advocates in pursuit of a vision of inclusive, effective, and \n     just democracy. Our Liberty & National Security Project, \n     initiated in July 2004, promotes thoughtful and informed \n     debate about how to maximize security and safeguard civil \n     liberties. It has published on the problem of classified \n     evidence in terrorism trials and litigates on matters related \n     to the Graham Amendment. Our scholarship and litigation \n     experience suggest that the amendment neither reflects our \n     long-standing constitutional traditions nor furthers our \n     present counter-terrorism efforts.\n       In many ways, the war on terror is new. But it cannot \n     justify shredding our oldest constitutional principles. \n     Constant revelations of how the United States is treating \n     detainees at Guantanamo and elsewhere have damaged our image \n     around the world. It would be ironic indeed if the Congress's \n     response were not to address the underlying problems but \n     instead to make it more difficult for rights to be vindicated \n     and facts to be learned.\n       In June 2004, the Supreme Court squarely rejected the \n     federal government's position that Guantanamo Bay is a legal \n     no-man's land, outside the reach of American courts. The rule \n     of law now applies to Guantanamo Bay, and the federal courts \n     have the authority to review government actions there to \n     determine whether they are unconstitutional or otherwise \n     illegal. Just last Friday, the Senate overwhelming and \n     courageously voted to affirm the rule of law by bolstering \n     the prohibition against government torture and cruel, \n     inhuman, and degrading treatment. Yet the Graham Amendment \n     would suspend the rule of law, including the anti-torture \n     rule, for those detained at Guantanamo Bay. Even more \n     troublingly, the amendment may extend to any and all aliens \n     who lawfully reside in the United States.\n       Nothing is more emblematic of the rule of law than judicial \n     review and the availability of habeas corpus in the courts. \n     And nothing is a greater marker of the absence of the rule of \n     law than the lack of judicial review of government action, \n     especially the legality of executive detention. Stripping the \n     courts of their historic habeas jurisdiction would violate \n     separation-of-powers principles and undermine the checks-and-\n     balances on which our Constitution rests.\n       This suspension of the rule of law has clear, long-term \n     costs for our nation's efforts to combat terrorists. The \n     Graham Amendment would terminate ongoing litigation on behalf \n     of detainees at Guantanamo who have never had a fair hearing \n     to prove their innocence. International condemnation of the \n     perceived ``legal black hole'' of Guantanamo has been \n     persistent and wide-ranging. Our allies have expressed broad \n     concerns about the legality and morality of placing \n     individuals beyond the rule of law. The Graham Amendment \n     purports to achieve a short-term goal of minimizing \n     government litigation but, rather, would only create a wave \n     of new litigation. It would do this at the cost of tremendous \n     damage to the United States' reputation overseas by sending \n     the message that we cannot defend the decision to detain \n     those at Guantanamo in a court of law.\n       The Brennan Center strongly urges you to reject the Graham \n     Amendment to the Defense Department authorization bill. \n     Please do not hesitate to call us at 212-992-8632 if you have \n     any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael Waldman,\n       Executive Director.\n     Aziz Huq,\n       Associate Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Franklin Pierce Law Center,\n\n                                    Concord, NH, November 9, 2005.\n     Senator Arlen Specter,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: As Dean of a law school and as former \n     Judge Advocate General of the Navy, I am writing in strong \n     opposition to the amendment which I understand Senator Graham \n     intends to offer to S. 1042, the Defense Department \n     Authorization Bill. Among other things, the proposed Graham \n     Amendment would strip U.S. courts of jurisdiction to hear \n     habeas corpus petitions from aliens who are detained by the \n     United States or any other action which would challenge any \n     aspect of their detention.\n       This amendment, however well-intentioned, is the wrong law \n     at the wrong time. It appears aimed at fixing a problem that \n     doesn't exist, and creates a raft of new problems of its own.\n       For generations, the United States has stood firm for the \n     rule of law. It is not the rule of law if you apply it when \n     it is convenient and toss it over the side when it is not. \n     The Great Writ of Habeas Corpus has been at the heart of U.S. \n     law since the first drafts of the Constitution. Indeed, it \n     has been part of Western culture for 1000 years, since the \n     Magna Carta. Creating broad exceptions that would \n     categorically deny the writ to thousands of those subject to \n     the full detention power of the U.S. Government should be \n     done, if at all, only with the utmost care, serious debate \n     and consideration, and attention to the practical effects of \n     such a limit. The restriction on habeas contemplated by the \n     Graham Amendment would be a momentous change. It is certainly \n     not a change in the landscape if U.S. jurisprudence we should \n     tack on to the Defense Department Authorization Bill at the \n     last minute.\n       In any case, the practical effects of such a bill would be \n     sweeping and negative. America's great strength isn't our \n     economy or natural resources or the essentially island nature \n     of our geography. It is our mission, and what we stand for. \n     That's why other nations look to us for leadership and follow \n     our lead. Every step we take that dims that bright, shining \n     light undermines our role as a world leader. As we limit the \n     rights of human beings, even those of the enemy, we become \n     more like the enemy. That makes us weaker and imperils our \n     valiant troops. I am proud to be an American. This Amendment, \n     well intentioned as it may be, will diminish us.\n       More immediately, the Graham Amendment would be viewed by \n     our allies and enemies alike as just another example of the \n     United States taking a step down the slippery slope from the \n     high road to the low road. It would increase the likelihood \n     that our own troops, who daily face the risk of capture by \n     any number of our enemies abroad, will be subject to ad hoc \n     justice at the hands of those who would seize upon any \n     excuse. I believe it is the duty of those who would put our \n     troops in harm's way to deny our enemies any such an excuse.\n       I urge you to insist at the least upon full and forthright \n     consideration of this Amendment by the Judiciary Committee. \n     And I urge you to advocate vigorously for its defeat.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John D.

We write to express our opposition to the court-\n     stripping provisions of Amendment 2516 to S. 1042, the \n     Defense Department Authorization Bill.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: I am the Chief Defense Counsel for \n     the Office of Military Commissions. Please note that I am \n     writing in my capacity as Chief Defense Counsel for the \n     Office of Military Commissions and I do not purport to speak \n     for the Department of Defense.\n       Please accept my congratulations for your arguments in \n     opposition to certain portions of Amendment No. 2515. I also \n     wholeheartedly endorse your proposal to eliminate detainees \n     being tried by military commission from the class of \n     detainees whose access to habeas relief would be abolished. I \n     am writing to provide specific legal support for some of the \n     points you raised in your debate with Senator Graham and to \n     point out some of the specific errors in Senator Graham's \n     arguments.\n       In his initial floor speech supporting the Amendment, \n     Senator Graham stated, ``Never in the history of the law of \n     armed conflict has an enemy combatant, irregular component, \n     or POW been given access to civilian court systems to \n     question military authority and control, except here.'' 151 \n     Cong. Rec. S12656 (daily ed. Nov. 10, 2005). That claim \n     simply is not true. As discussed in greater detail below, the \n     Supreme Court considered habeas petitions filed on behalf of \n     seven of the eight would-be German saboteurs in Ex parte \n     Quirin, 317 U.S. 1 (1942), and on behalf of a Japanese \n     general who was a prisoner of war in In re Yamashita, 327 \n     U.S. 1 (1946). Senator Graham also described Ex parte Quirin \n     by stating, ``We had German POWs who tried to come into \n     Federal court, and our court said: As a member of an armed \n     force, organized against the United States, you are not \n     entitled to a constitutional right of habeas corpus.'' 151 \n     Cong. Rec. at S12663. In fact, the Supreme Court said nothing \n     of the sort. Rather, the Court said almost the exact \n     opposite. Again, Senator Graham erred when he stated that \n     ``[i]t has been the history of the law of armed conflict that \n     when you have somebody tried for a violation of law of armed \n     conflict, you don't go to Federal court.'' Id. at S12664.\n       Contrary to Senator Graham's arguments, the Supreme Court \n     bas held repeatedly held that enemy combatants can pursue \n     federal habeas litigation to challenge their susceptibility \n     to trial by military commission. In Ex parte Quirin, which \n     dealt with the trial of the would-be German saboteurs who \n     were captured in 1942, the Supreme Court considered the \n     merits of the enemy combatants' habeas petition. Ex parte \n     Quirin, 317 U.S. 1 (1942). While the Court ultimately denied \n     the petitioners' applications for leave to file petitions for \n     habeas corpus, the Court specifically observed that neither \n     President Roosevelt's military order convening the commission \n     ``nor the fact that they are enemy aliens forecloses \n     consideration by the courts of petitioners' contentions that \n     the Constitution and laws of the United States \n     constitutionally enacted forbid their trial by military \n     commission.'' Id. at 25 (emphasis added). Quirin has been \n     celebrated for giving the individuals the right to file such \n     habeas corpus petitions, even though the President had tried \n     to bar it. See. e.g., Louis Fisher, Nazi Saboteurs on Trial \n     173 (2003).\n       In re Yamashita similarly involved an application for leave \n     to file a petition for writ of habeas corpus with the Supreme \n     Court. 327 U.S. 1 (1946). General Yamashita, who had \n     commanded the Imperial Japanese Army's Fourteenth Army Group \n     in the Philippines, was tried by a U.S. Army \n     military commission, found guilty, and sentenced to death. \n     Id. at 5. After unsuccessfully seeking a writ of habeas \n     corpus from the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, \n     Yamashita sought both a writ of certiorari and an original \n     writ of habeas corpus from the United States Supreme \n     Court. Citing Ex parte Quirin, the Supreme Court \n     reemphasized that in considering such a request for habeas \n     relief arising from trial by military commission, ``[w]e \n     consider . . . only the lawful power of the commission to \n     try the petitioner for the offense charged.'' Id. at 8. \n     So, while the Supreme Court emphasized the limited scope \n     of review, it reemphasized that the federal courts we \n     available to consider habeas petitions filed by enemy \n     combatants challenging trial by military commission. In \n     language specifically relevant to the debate over \n     Amendment No. 2515, the Supreme Court observed, ``The \n     courts may inquire whether the detention complained of is \n     within the authority of those detaining the petitioner.'' \n     Id. The Court added: ``Finally, we held in Ex parte \n     Quirin, [317 U.S. at] 24, 25, as we hold now, that \n     Congress by sanctioning trials of enemy aliens by military \n     commission for offenses against the law of war had \n     recognized the right of the accused to make a defense. Cf \n     Ex: parte Kawato, 317 U.S. 69. It has not foreclosed their \n     right to contend that the Constitution or laws of the \n     United States withhold authority to proceed with the \n     trial. It has not withdrawn, and the Executive branch of \n     the Government could not, unless there was suspension of \n     the writ, withdraw from the courts the duty and power to \n     make such inquiry into the authority of the commission as \n     may be made by habeas corpus.''\n       Id. at 9. In fact, in his dissent Justice Murphy went out \n     of his way to praise the majority for doing exactly the \n     opposite of what Senator Graham said--for providing the \n     unlawful combatants the right to habeas corpus: ``This Court \n     fortunately has taken the first and most important step \n     toward insuring the supremacy of law and justice in the \n     treatment of an enemy belligerent accused of violating the \n     laws of war. Jurisdiction properly has been asserted to \n     inquire ``into the cause of restraint of liberty'' of such a \n     person. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 452. Thus the obnoxious doctrine \n     asserted by the Govermnent in this case, to the effect that \n     restraints of liberty resulting trom military trials of war \n     criminals are political matters completely outside the arena \n     of judicial review, has been rejected fully and \n     unquestionably. This does not mean, of course, that the \n     foreign affairs and policies of the nation are proper \n     subjects of judicial inquiry. But when the liberty of any \n     person is restrained by reason of the authority of the United \n     States the writ of habeas corpus is available to test the \n     legality of that restraint, even though direct court review \n     of the restraint is prohibited. The conclusive presumption \n     must be made, in\n\n[[Page S12731]]\n\n     this country at least, that illegal restraints are \n     unauthorized and unjustified by any foreign policy of the \n     Government and that commonly accepted juridical standards are \n     to be recognized and enforced. On that basis judicial inquiry \n     into these matters may proceed within its proper sphere.''\n       In re Yamashita, 327 U.S. at 30 (Murphy, J., dissenting).\n       Additionally, in response to a point made by Senator Levin, \n     Senator Graham stated: ``Here is the one thing I can tell you \n     for sure as a military lawyer. A POW or an enemy combatant \n     facing law of armed conflict charges has not been given the \n     right to habeas corpus for 200 years because our own people \n     in our own military facing court-martials, who could be \n     sentenced to death, do not have the right of habeas corpus.\n       Again, Senator Graham's argument is factually incorrect. \n     U.S. servicemembers do have a right to challenge court-\n     martial proceedings through habeas petitions, in addition to \n     the direct appeal rights provided by Articles 66, 67, and 67a \n     of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. In Burns v. Wilson, \n     which was a habeas challenge to an Air Force capital court-\n     martial, the Supreme Court observed: ``In this case, we are \n     dealing with habeas corpus applicants who assert--rightly or \n     wrongly--that they have been imprisoned and sentenced to \n     death as a result of proceedings which denied them basic \n     rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The federal civil \n     courts have jurisdiction over such applications.'' Burns v. \n     Wilson, 346 U.S. 137, 139 (1953) (plurality opinion). \n     Interestingly, in reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court \n     cited In re Yamashita, 327 U.S. 1, 8 (1946), thus drawing a \n     historical parallel to the right of a U.S. servicemember to \n     seek a writ of habeas corpus and the right of an enemy \n     combatant detained by the United States military to do the \n     same. Federal courts continue to review habeas challenges to \n     court-martial convictions and occasionally grant relief. See, \n     e.g., Monk v. Zelez, 901 F.2d 885 (10th Cir. 1990) (ordering \n     petitioner's release from the United States Disciplinary \n     Barracks due to constitutionally-deficient reasonable doubt \n     instruction); Dodson v. Zelez, 917 F.2d 1250 (10th Cir. 1990) \n     (finding a due process violation where the military judge's \n     sentencing instructions did not require the members to reach \n     a three-fourths majority vote in order to impose life \n     imprisonment).\n       An important policy consideration also suggests the need to \n     reassess the amendment. In its current form, Amendment No. \n     2515 would provide detainees seeking review of Combatant \n     Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) with greater access to \n     federal courts than a detainee who has been sentenced to \n     imprisonment for life, or even death, by a military \n     commission. This result is anomalous for two reasons. First, \n     generally due process protections increase in direct \n     proportion to the magnitude of the interest at stake. Because \n     military commissions are literally empowered to take a life, \n     the recourse to Article III courts for those sentenced by \n     these tribunals should be at least equal to that of \n     individuals who are merely challenging their susceptibility \n     to continued detention. Second, the burden on the federal \n     judiciary is far greater in the case of review of CSRTs than \n     the review of commission proceedings. During the floor \n     debate, Senator Graham noted that there are currently 160 \n     habeas petitions filed by or on behalf of Guantanamo \n     detainees pending in federal courts. But only three \n     individuals being tried by military commissions have filed \n     habeas petitions challenging those trials. The total number \n     of individuals with approved charges before military \n     commissions is only nine. There can be little doubt that \n     nowhere near 160 of the Guantanamo detainees will ever face \n     trial by military commission. Accordingly, while the federal \n     courts' burden of resolving habeas challenges to continued \n     detention might be large, the burden of resolving habeas \n     challenges to military commission proceedings will be quite \n     minimal. The resources that will be devoted to the District \n     of Columbia Circuit's review of CSRTs will likely dwarf the \n     resources that would be necessary to litigate every habeas \n     petition that has or will be filed by an accused before a \n     military commission.\n       I will be happy to provide any additional information that \n     might be helpful. You can reach me at my office, at home, or \n     by e-mail. Unfortunately, I am currently scheduled to leave \n     for Guantanamo Bay on the morning of Tuesday, November 15. If \n     you or a member of your staff would like to reach me after \n     today, please leave a voice mail on my work phone and I will \n     return your call.\n           Very Respectully,\n                                               Dwight H. Sullivan,\n        Colonel, USMCR, Chief Defense Counsel, Office of Military \n                                                      Commissions.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. How much time remains of the 15 minutes I am allotted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I retain that minute and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will be glad to get a letter from the \nprosecutor at the military commission about the procedures. I will bet \n$100 he will say they are great. The point is, we are talking about two \ndifferent things. My amendment is designed to get us back to what we \nhave been doing for a couple hundred years. What I am concerned about \nis that an enemy prisoner, not someone charged with a crime, is having \naccess to Federal courts to sue our own troops about the food, about \nthe mail, about whether they should have Internet access, about whether \nthey should get DVDs. There are 160 lawsuits now in Federal court suing \nto stop interrogations unless a Federal judge oversees the \ninterrogation.\n  Never in the history of the law of armed conflict has a military \nprisoner, an enemy combatant, been granted access to any court system, \nFederal or otherwise, to have a Federal judge come in and start running \nthe prison and determining what is in bounds and what is out. The \nmilitary is the proper body to determine who an enemy combatant is and \nhow to run a war and how to interrogate people, not Federal judges who \nare not trained in the art of military science.\n  Here is what these lawsuits are about. Here is why I am so adamant \nthat we stop it. No. 1, what are we stopping? We are not stopping a \nconstitutional right that exists under our law for an enemy prisoner in \nour hands to be able to question their detention through Federal court \naction. There is no constitutional right under habeas corpus in \nAmerican jurisprudence for an enemy prisoner to go to Federal court and \nchallenge whether they should have Internet access or DVD access, all \nthe other things they are suing the people for, medical malpractice. \nThat has never been the case. None of the Germans in World War II who \nwere housed in the United States, and the Japanese prisoners, were \nallowed to go to Federal court and get a Federal judge to come in and \noversee their treatment. We don't allow that. That is not part of the \nlaw of armed conflict.\n  Habeas petitions are not coming from the Constitution. They are \ncoming from an interpretation of section 2241. The Rasul case was a \nSupreme Court case that said that contrary to the Government's \nargument, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba is in the effective control of the \nUnited States, even though it is not part of our own territories. \nBecause of the lease arrangements and because the Department of Defense \nis an agency covered by the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, the \nargument that it is outside the jurisdiction of Federal courts because \nof its location was defeated. That led to the decision that since you \nare within the control of our jurisdiction at Guantanamo Bay, section \n2241 applies unless Congress says otherwise.\n  Here is the question I will ask every Member of this body: Does the \nSenate want enemy terrorists, al-Qaida members being detained at \nGuantanamo Bay, to have unlimited access to our Federal courts to sue \nour troops about the following:\n  A Canadian detainee, who threw a grenade that killed an American Army \nmedic in a firefight and who comes from a family of longstanding al-\nQaida ties, moves for preliminary injunction forbidding interrogation \nof him or engaging in cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment of him. \nThat was a lawsuit brought in a Federal court by a person who blew up \none of our medics, who wanted a Federal judge to supervise his military \ninterrogation. If we start doing that, we might as well close \nGuantanamo Bay down.\n  These are not people being charged. They are being kept off the \nbattlefield because they have been captured on the battlefield, and \nthey have been labeled enemy combatants. The procedures I am trying to \nget in place will comply with the law of armed conflict. Twelve of the \npeople have been let go at Guantanamo Bay. Over 200 in total have been \nlet go. They have been found no longer to have intelligence value or to \nbe a threat to the United States. Once those two determinations are \nmade, they are let go, even if they are an enemy combatant. Twelve of \nthem have been recaptured. A couple of them have been killed. They have \ngone back to the fight.\n  The people at Guantanamo Bay are captured as part of the war on \nterror, and some of them may be running. The point is, when you join \nal-Qaida, whether you stand or fight or run, you have lost your rights \nto be considered anything other than what you are--an enemy combatant \ntaking up arms against the United States.\n\n[[Page S12732]]\n\n  Here is my message to the terrorists: If you join a terrorist \norganization taking up arms against the United States and you get \ninvolved in combat, you are likely to get killed. If you get captured, \nyou will be taken off the battlefield as long as necessary to make sure \nour country is protected from you.\n  Under the law of armed conflict, there is no right to try them or let \nthem go. Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11, is in U.S. control \nright now. He is not a criminal, but you have to charge within 90 days \nor let go. He is an enemy combatant, the mastermind of 9/11, and 9/11 \nwas an act of war. It was not a crime. The law of war needs to \napply. Anybody who suggests that Shaikh Mohammed should have unlimited \naccess to the Federal courts to get a Federal judge to supervise his \ninterrogation is fundamentally changing the law of war and making us \nless safe. He will not be let go. If you don't want to be captured and \ndetained for a long time, don't join al-Qaida.\n\n  Listen to this: Kuwaiti detainees seek court orders that they be \nprovided dictionaries in contravention of GTMO's force protection \npolicy and that their counsel be given high-speed Internet access at \ntheir lodging on the base and be allowed to use classified DOD \ntelecommunications facilities, all on the theory of the right to \ncounsel. A motion by a high-level al-Qaida detainee complaining about \nbase security procedures, speed of mail delivery, and medical \ntreatment, seeking an order that he be transferred to the least onerous \nconditions at GTMO and asking the court to order that GTMO allow him to \nkeep any books and reading materials sent to him and to report to the \ncourt on his opportunities for exercise, communication, recreation, and \nworship. A man captured on the battlefield, engaged in a war against \nthe United States, because of 2241's interpretation where Congress \nhasn't spoken, is petitioning a court to supervise his opportunity to \nexercise, communicate, recreate, and worship, and where he should be \nhoused.\n  In other words, Federal judges are going to determine how we run the \nwar, not the people fighting the war. Never in the history of warfare \nhas an enemy prisoner been allowed to do such things. It didn't happen \nin World War II. Why? Because we have a right, as a country capturing \nenemy prisoners, to take them off the battlefield. They are not common \ncriminals. We have an obligation to treat them humanely under the law \nof armed conflict.\n  An emergency motion seeking a court order requiring GTMO to set aside \nits normal security policies and show detainees DVDs that are purported \nto be family videos. One hundred sixty of these cases, another 40 or 50 \nsuing our own people, one for $100 million, suing the doctor who \ntreated the guy. This is an absurd result.\n  I proudly stand before the Senate asking the Senate to fix this \nabsurd result. The court in Rasul is asking the Senate and the House, \ndo you intend for al-Qaida terrorists, enemy combatants, to have access \nto Federal courts under habeas rights to challenge their detention as \nif they were American citizens? The answer should be, no, we never \nintended that. That is what my amendment does. It says to the courts \nand to the world that an enemy combatant is not going to have the \nrights of an American citizen, and we are going to stop all these \nlawsuits undermining our ability to protect ourselves.\n  What have I done in place? I have stopped a procedure that has never \nbeen granted before because it is totally out of bounds of what we need \nto be doing and have done. I allow Federal courts to review each enemy \ncombatant's determination at the Circuit Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia to look at whether the combat status review \ntribunal, the group deciding whether you are an enemy combatant, \nfollowed the procedures and standards we set up.\n  What do the Geneva Conventions give our own troops, if our own troops \nfall into enemy hands under the Geneva Conventions? If there is a \nquestion about their status, it says a competent tribunal has the \nability to challenge. The combat status review tribunal that we have \nset up at Guantanamo Bay since August of 2004 is Geneva Conventions \nprotection on steroids. They have a full-blown hearing, a right every \nyear to have their status redetermined. And what do you look at? Were \nthey an enemy combatant engaged in armed conflict against the United \nStates? Do they present intelligence value or a continuing threat to \nthe United States? That determination is made every year, a full-blown \nadversarial process way beyond what the Geneva Conventions require in \nsuch situations.\n  We have added to that Federal court oversight to see if the people at \nGuantanamo Bay are following the rules and procedures set up in \naccordance with the law of armed conflict.\n  Senator Bingaman is a very fine man, a fine Senator. I deeply \ndisagree with him. And any letter that anybody writes, I have my own \nletters from JAGs.\n  It is a simple proposition. His amendment allows unlimited habeas \npetitions regarding detention to come to the Circuit Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia. The type lawsuits that we see now will \ncontinue: A motion by Kuwaiti detainees unsatisfied with the Koran they \nare provided and want another version, a filing by a detainee \nrequesting a stay of litigation pending related appeals, an emergency \nmotion by a detainee accusing military health professionals of gross \nand intentional malpractice.\n\n  They are swamping the system. Americans are losing their day in court \nbecause somehow we have allowed enemy combatants, people who have \nsigned up to kill us all, to take us into Federal court and sue us \nabout everything.\n  That is not part of the law of armed conflict. Our troops are not \ngoing to get that right if they are in the hands of someone else. What \nI am asking for is for us to treat enemy combatants humanely and in \naccordance with the law of armed conflict. I am asking for us to \nprovide due process in accordance with the Geneva Conventions and then \nsome. I am even allowing a Federal court review of the process down \nthere. But I will not now or ever sit on the sidelines and give rights \nto enemy combatants who have been caught on the battlefield in the war \nof terror the unending, endless right to think of every reason in the \nworld to take our own troops into court. We will keep having this \ndebate and we will keep having this argument until the cows come home \nbecause I am not going to sit on the sidelines and watch that happen.\n  There has never been a constitutional right for that to happen. \nSection 2241 is what we are talking about here. Congress wrote it. \nCongress has restricted habeas rights for illegal immigrants. Congress \nhas restricted habeas rights of its own citizens numerous times because \nthese petitions can get out of control and take over a courtroom.\n  The question for this Congress is whether you, after 9/11, want to \ngive enemy combatants detained at Guantanamo Bay who have been captured \non the battlefield the unlimited right to go into any Federal court in \nthis land and to sue over everything they can think of. If you do, then \nwe have made a huge mistake in the war on terror. I suggest that you \nsay no to Senator Bingaman's amendment and get us back to where we have \nbeen for 200 years. Apply the law of armed conflict. Once you have been \ndetermined to be an enemy combatant, you get the due process of the \nGeneva Conventions. We have done that and then some to allow a limited \nFederal court review, more than anybody has ever gotten in history. We \nget back on track. And when it comes to military commissions and those \nwho will be charged with the law of armed conflict violations, I am \nworking with Senator Levin and others to try to find a way to get a \nFederal court appeal right.\n  How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will try to retain 1 minute.\n  Let it be said that the people who attacked us on 9/11 committed an \nact of war, not a crime, and they are going to be tried under military \ncommissions, not in our Federal courts, because they are engaged in a \nwar and they are violating the law of armed conflict. They will get \ntheir day in court and we will come up with a fair process to make sure \nthey have their day in court, but we are not going to take a war and \nturn it into a crime.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S12733]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me use the remaining 1 minute I have \nand then I will ask permission to speak for another 4 minutes, if \npossible.\n  Let me say that I think the Senator obviously hasn't read the \namendment I have offered. The amendment I have offered makes it very \nclear that the Federal court is available only to hear claims regarding \nwhether the determination of the combat status review tribunal is \nconsistent with the procedures and standards specified by the \nDepartment of Defense, whether the status determination was supported \nby sufficient evidence, and to determine the lawfulness of the \ndetention of the alien. They are not permitted under my amendment to \nconsider whether the DVDs are the ones that the prisoner would like. \nThey are not permitted to consider whether the peanut butter is the \npeanut butter the prisoner would like, or anything else.\n  To try to trivialize this debate by suggesting that is what we are \ntalking about I think does a disservice to the issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for an \nadditional 4 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I don't mind if the Senator wants 4 more minutes to speak \non his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate my colleague's courtesy.\n  Mr. President, first let me say we have a real difference of opinion \nhere as to what has been the law of this land for the last couple \nhundred years.\n  The Senator from South Carolina continues to say we have never \nrecognized a right for people in conflict, armed conflict, to petition \nfor habeas corpus. The truth is we have. The truth is the Supreme Court \nhas--in the Ex parte Quirin case, the In re Yamashita case. There are a \nvariety of cases where this has been the case. The Supreme Court has \nrepeatedly held that enemy combatants can pursue Federal habeas \nlitigation to challenge that you are susceptible to trial by military \ncommission. It is very clear that that right has been there.\n  All I am trying to do is to be sure we do not strip the courts of the \nright to consider these types of petitions. If we strip the courts of \nthe right to consider petitions in these cases, how many other areas \ncan we find where we will deny people within the jurisdiction of our \nFederal court system the right to proceed with a petition for habeas \ncorpus in the Federal judiciary?\n  This is the most fundamental right any of us can conceive of. When \nyou start talking about imprisoning a person and not allowing that \nperson any opportunity to have a court review of the legality of that \nimprisonment, you are talking about the most fundamental of rights.\n  Unfortunately, that is what the amendment by Senator Graham would do. \nIt would deny that right. It would be an unfortunate act by this \nCongress. It would be an extraordinary act by this Congress to do that, \nand I believe would be very contrary to the traditions this country was \nbuilt on. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the amendment I have \noffered which maintains the right to petition for habeas corpus on the \npart of everybody because there is nothing in our Constitution, there \nis nothing in the history and tradition of this country that says this \nis only available for citizens. It is available for all individuals who \nbecome imprisoned within the confines of the United States and within \nthe jurisdiction of the Federal courts. Our Department of Defense tried \nto locate these prisoners outside the jurisdiction of Federal courts \nand put them in Guantanamo and it argued to the Federal court they are \nnow outside your jurisdiction, and the Federal court said, no, they are \nnot. The United States Government is the sovereign in Guantanamo. We \nhave a 100-year lease on that property, we operate that facility, and \nwe are responsible for the treatment of those individuals.\n\n  So the Federal courts have authority to look at whether the \ndetentions that occur there are legal or illegal. That is the law as it \nhas always been in this country. That is the law today. We should not \nchange that by allowing the Graham amendment to remain as it is. We \nneed to adopt a refinement of that amendment, an improvement of that \namendment, and that is the second-degree amendment I have offered at \nthis point.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor. I think my colleague wants to \nrespond.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I may have the same courtesy and have 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No. 1, we have a fundamental difference. I do not want \neveryone to have habeas rights. I do not want the enemy combatant al-\nQaida terrorist to be able to go in our courts and start to sue our own \ntroops. I don't want it. I don't think people in this body want it. I \ndo not think the American people want it. I want al-Qaida members to be \ndetained in armed conflict. They should not have due process rights \nbeyond what the Geneva Conventions ever envisioned.\n  As to Senator Bingaman's amendment, he talks about they can't base \nclaims on living conditions, but listen to this: Whether the status \ndetermination was supported by sufficient evidence and reached in \naccordance with due process of law, provided that statements obtained \nthrough undue coercion, torture, or cruel or inhuman treatment may not \nbe used as a basis for the determination, and consideration of \nlawfulness of the detention of such alien. You could drive an army of \ntrucks through those legal exceptions. What it would do is legitimize \nthis request by a Canadian detainee, who threw a grenade and killed an \nAmerican medic, in moving for a preliminary injunction forbidding the \ninterrogation of him or engaging in cruel, inhumane, or degrading \ntreatment of him. In other words, under this amendment, that claim \nstands. He could come in and ask a Federal judge: I want you sitting \nthere while they interrogate me. And we are turning the war away from \nmilitary people to Federal judges. We can't do that. We will compromise \nour own defense, our own freedom.\n  As to the people at Guantanamo Bay who are going to be charged with a \ncrime, I am working with Senator Levin to come up with a military \ncommission model we all can be proud of. There are 490 enemy combatants \ndown there who are not going to be charged with crimes, and if we \nallowed them unfettered freedom to have courts, to have judges control \nmilitary interrogation and get into the bowels of running this war--not \nonly has it never been done, but I challenge anybody to bring one case \ndown here where an enemy prisoner has been able to go into Federal \ncourt and complain about their detention. Once you have a combatant \ncharged with a crime, you are working with 490 of them who are going to \nhave unfettered access under 2241 unless Congress acts. If you want to \nstop this kind of litigation and not turn over the war to Federal \njudges, then you need to tell the courts that 2241 does not apply. No \nlaw in the history of armed conflict has allowed this to happen and it \nneeds to not happen now. Twelve people have been released down there \nunder the procedures we already have, and they have gone back to try to \nkill us.\n  Nothing is perfect. Nothing is perfect. We may let some people go who \ngo back to the fight, but what we are going to do is we are going to \nhave a process we can be proud of that fairly determines who an enemy \ncombatant is and who is not following the Geneva Conventions law of \narmed conflict. We are not going, with my amendment, to turn the al-\nQaida member into an American citizen suing us for anything they can \nthink of about due process of law and as to where they have been \ndetained.\n  This is a fundamental moment in terms of values in the law of armed \nconflict. The American value system is being maintained by due process \nand then some. The American value system that you can allow people who \nare trying to kill you unfettered access to the Federal courts to sue \nyour own troops--if that becomes our value, we are going to lose this \nwar.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S12734]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan.\n  In March 2003, the brave men and women of our Armed Forces were sent \ninto war in Iraq. Now, over 2\\1/2\\ years later, that war continues and \nthose brave men and women are waiting for what they should have gotten \nlong ago--a clear, realistic military mission with a flexible timetable \nfor achieving that mission. And, of course, that timetable has to \ninclude a plan for withdrawing our troops from Iraq when their mission \nis done.\n  On Tuesday, the Senate can start to put our Iraq policy on the right \ncourse by demanding a public plan and a flexible timetable for \nachieving our military goals and bringing our troops home. The absence \nof any kind of timetable is not fair to our troops and their families. \nIt is making the American people increasingly anxious. And it is \nhurting, not helping, our Iraq policy and our broader national security \nstrategy.\n  Why is it hurting us? Well, for one thing, the perception that U.S. \ntroops will be there indefinitely discourages Iraqi ownership of the \npolitical process. It also fuels the insurgency, which thrives on \nconspiracy theories about our intentions and presence in Iraq. The \nfailure to put forth a timetable is helping the recruitment of foreign \nfighters and unifying elements of the insurgency that might otherwise \nturn on each other. Former Republican Defense Secretary and Wisconsin \nCongressman Melvin Laird recognized that when he said that ``our \npresence is what feeds the insurgency.'' GEN George Casey recognized \nthat when he said that the perception of occupation in Iraq ``fuels the \ninsurgency.'' So did one of the top military commanders I spoke with in \nIraq, who told me off the record that nothing would take the wind out \nof the sails of the insurgents more than a public timetable for \nfinishing the mission.\n  Drawing down our troops in Iraq is also essential if we are going to \nprevent the U.S. army from being hollowed out and ensure our military \nreadiness. And it is essential if we are going to make sure that our \nIraq policy is consistent with our broader national security priority--\ngoing after the global terrorist networks that threaten the U.S. \nDespite the administration's desperate efforts to link them, Iraq has \nbeen a dangerous and self-defeating diversion from that central fight \nagainst global terrorism.\n  Unfortunately, the President is one of the dwindling group of people \nwho don't support a timetable. They argue that a timetable will \nembolden the insurgency. Actually, it will undermine the insurgency. \nThey argue that fighting insurgents in Iraq means we won't have to \nfight them elsewhere. That is just wishful thinking, of course--the \nidea that all of our terrorist enemies will be irresistibly drawn to \nIraq like bees to honey doesn't make a whole lot of sense. They argue \nthat the insurgents will wait us out if we have a timetable. Of course, \nthe insurgents could do that now if that is what they wanted--lay low \nand wait until we leave. They argue that if we leave prematurely, Iraq \nwill fall into chaos. The only problem is that the insurgency isn't \nletting up and there is not much expectation it will, as long as our \ntroops remain with no endgoal in sight.\n  For months, I have been calling on the President to provide a \nflexible, public timetable for our mission in Iraq. I am not calling \nfor a rigid timetable--I mean one that is tied to clear and achievable \nbenchmarks, with estimated dates for meeting those benchmarks. Today, I \nam pleased to join with some of my distinguished colleagues in the \nSenate in offering an amendment that demands just that. I hope that the \nSenate will finally tell the administration that ``stay the course'' \nisn't a strategy for success--it is not even a strategy. We need to \ncorrect the course we are on. To do that, we need openness, we need \nhonesty, and we need clarity about our military mission in Iraq. The \nAmerican people, and our troops in Iraq, have been waiting for that for \nfar too long. We can't afford to wait any longer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have letters in \nsupport of my amendment printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Birmingham, AL, November 13, 2005.\n     Hon. Lindsey O. Graham,\n     c/o Ms. Meredith Beck, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: Congratulations on your success in \n     obtaining Senate adoption of your amendment (Senate Amendment \n     2516 to S. 1042) to restrict the ability of terrorist \n     detainees held at Guantanamo, to gain access to the U.S. \n     Districts Courts through habeas corpus applications.\n       I understand that Amendment opponents will make an effort \n     on Monday, November 14, to remove the habeas corpus \n     restrictions in the Amendment so that detainees can continue \n     to contest various issues regarding their detention and the \n     conduct of the Global War on Terror in the U.S. Federal Court \n     System.\n       While I strongly support Senator McCain's efforts to \n     prohibit cruel and degrading treatment against detainees in \n     American custody, I am not in favor of granting detainees' \n     access to our civilian court system. There are effective and \n     adequate procedures for detainees to question their status \n     through the Combatant Status Review Tribunal and the \n     Administrative Review Board without granting aliens outside \n     the United States access to our federal civilian courts.\n       I urge you to make the strongest effort possible to resist \n     efforts to weaken your amendment. If the habeas restrictions \n     are removed we can expect a logjam of litigation with the \n     attendant adverse effects on our ability to gather \n     intelligence and prosecute the Global War on Terrorism.\n           Very Respectfully,\n                                                 Robert W.

Graham,\n     c/o Ms. Meredith Beck, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I support your efforts to keep Senate \n     Amendment 2516 (the ``Amendment'') in S. 1042, the FY 06 \n     National Defense Authorization Act.\n       Habeas corpus applications, brought on behalf of \n     terrorist--Guantanamo detainees, to which the Amendment will \n     put a stop, have become a means to advance efforts to \n     frustrate the Global War on Terror. The detainees appear to \n     have become secondary to anti-war efforts.\n       On the Senate floor, during last Thursday's debate on the \n     Amendment, you appropriately cited the Michael Ratner \n     interview in Mother Jones Magazine (The Torn Fabric of the \n     Law: An Interview with Michael Ratner, Mother Jones Magazine, \n     March 21, 2005.) I read Mr. Ratner's interview and I note \n     that, to him, the disruptive results of litigation brought \n     against the United States (under the guise of habeas corpus \n     applications) appear to be more important than his detainee--\n     clients. ``While we may not be having many victories in \n     freeing people, we're winning heavily in the litigation.'' \n     That litigation, according to Mr. Ratner, as you pointed out,\n       ``. . . is brutal for them [the United States]. It's huge. \n     We have over one hundred lawyers now from big and small firms \n     working to represent these detainees. Every time an attorney \n     goes down there, it makes it that much harder to do what \n     they're [the United States] doing. You can't run an \n     interrogation and torture camp with attorneys. What are they \n     [the United States] going to do now that we're getting court \n     orders to get more lawyers down there?''\n       Thank you for your strong efforts made in securing adoption \n     of the Amendment and in its preservation.\n       Thank you for your time and interest.\n           Very respectfully,\n\n                                     Edward F.

That will enable \n     detainees to continue to contest all manner of issues related \n     to their detention and the conduct of the Global War on \n     Terror in the US civilian court system.\n       Detainees have ample opportunity to contest their combatant \n     status through the Combatant Status Review Tribunal \n     (``CSRT'') process, especially now since other provisions of \n     the Amendment provide for the exclusion of statements made \n     under undue coercion and for the appeal of adverse CSRT \n     rulings to the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.\n       I urge you to hold fast and to prevent any watering down of \n     the Amendment.

This\n\n[[Page S12735]]\n\n     is a true ``floodgates of litigation'' scenario. This is no \n     way to run a terrorist detention facility and a war against \n     foreign terrorists attacking our security. It would be a \n     significant setback in our resolve to defeat terrorists who \n     do not respect human rights and the rule of law.\n       It is ironic that we would knowingly facilitate foreign \n     terrorists to have access to our Constitutional safeguards to \n     condemn and attack them. The Constitutional safeguards and \n     rights that we have and protect should not be a tool for \n     foreign terrorists.\n       Thank you for your strong efforts made in securing adoption \n     or the Amendment and in its preservation.\n           Very Respectfully,\n                                                   Bohdan Danyliw,\n        Brig.

Graham,\n     c/o Ms. Meredith Beck, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: A world in which non-state actors \n     engaged in terrorist activities can be our greatest security \n     threat requires legal mechanisms that allow us to deal \n     effectively with these threats while remaining true to our \n     values. I believe Senate Amendment 2516 to S. 1042 \n     accomplishes these purposes.\n       When I was a Military Judge during the Viet Nam conflict, a \n     defense counsel who regularly appeared before me said that he \n     loved military juries. They always followed orders, and he \n     said that when a judge told a court to acquit if there was \n     reasonable doubt, they did their duty and would acquit \n     regardless of how difficult that decision might be. The CSRT \n     assures that detainee status decisions will be made by \n     persons with both the backbone, and the background, to get it \n     right. Simply stated, the members of the CSRT are in the best \n     position to make the necessary findings, and any review \n     process must take this into account.\n       Establishing the D.C. Circuit as the singular court for \n     review of CSRT decisions will promote consistency and \n     fairness. Similarly, the exclusion of statements made under \n     undue coercion promotes the integrity of the decision process \n     and is consistent with our core values.\n       I am pleased to offer my support for the Amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Gilbert J. Regan,\n     Brig. Gen. USAF (Ret.).\n                                  ____\n\n                                                November 11, 2005.\n     Hon. Lindsey O. Graham,\n     c/o Ms. Meredith Beck, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I write to support Senate Amendment \n     2516 (the ``Amendment'') to S. 1042, the FY 06 National \n     Defense Authorization Act.\n       You proposed the Amendment to restrict the ability of \n     Global War on Terror detainees, held at Guantanamo, to gain \n     access to U.S. District Courts through habeas corpus \n     applications, among other things.\n       Yesterday, you succeeded in persuading the Senate to adopt \n     the Amendment by a vote of 49 to 42.\n       I understand that, when the Senate reconvenes on Monday, \n     the Amendment's opponents will make a strong effort to strip \n     away the habeas restriction so that detainees can continue to \n     contest all manner of issues related to their detention and \n     the conduct of the Global War On Terror in the U.S. civilian \n     court system.\n       Detainees have ample opportunity to contest their combatant \n     status through the Combatant Status Review Tribunal \n     (``CSRT'') process, especially now since other provisions of \n     the Amendment provide for the exclusion of statements made \n     under undue coercion and for the appeal of adverse CSRT \n     rulings to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n       I urge you to hold fast and to prevent any watering down of \n     the Amendment. If the habeas restriction is struck from the \n     Amendment, then the pending 160 habeas applications will be \n     only the tip of the iceberg. This is a true ``floodgates of \n     litigation'' scenario. This is no way to run a terror \n     detention facility, much less a war.\n       Thank you for your strong efforts made in securing adoption \n     of the Amendment and in its preservation.\n           Very respectfully,\n                                             Olan G. Waldrop, Jr.,\n                                       Brig. Gen., USAF (Retired).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that in the absence \nof a speaker on the Republican side, the time between now and 4:30 p.m. \nbe divided as follows: the Senator from Massachusetts be recognized for \n30 minutes, then the Senator from Connecticut be recognized for 10 \nminutes. If, during that period, the floor manager on the Republican \nside indicates\n\n[[Page S12736]]\n\ntime is required on the Republican side, we would then do our best to \nmake arrangements for that to happen, perhaps delaying the 4:30 p.m. \ntimetable. We are trying to accommodate two Senators, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, who needs a half hour, and the Senator from Connecticut, \nwho needs 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So I have to pick whom I like best?\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are trying to accommodate colleagues and make sure you \nare protected. I suggest the following: the Senator from Massachusetts \nspeak for a half hour; the Senator from Connecticut speak for 10 \nminutes, unless the Senator from South Carolina knows of someone on his \nside; and then if our people or a person on their side, Mr. President, \nneeds some time, the 4:30 p.m. shift to the appropriations bill be \ndelayed by 5 or 10 minutes to accommodate the Republican side. I can't \nthink of anything better without knowing exactly who wants to speak.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I agree.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts be recognized for 30 minutes, the Senator from \nConnecticut for 10 minutes, and the remainder of the time between now \nand 4:30 p.m. not be assigned at this time, and we will do our best to \naccommodate the Republican side should there be speakers after the \nSenator from Connecticut speaks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the managers, particularly Senator \nGraham and Senator Levin.\n  Veterans Day is a very special day in our country's history. There \nare a lot of veterans who believe Veterans Day is just plain sacred--a \nlot of families, Gold Star mothers, wives for whom it is a day set \naside to memorialize the unbelievable sacrifice of generations of \nAmericans who have given themselves for our country. Veterans Day is \nsacred. It is a day to honor veterans, not a day to play attack \npolitics. The President, who is Commander in Chief, should know and \nrespect this.\n  Veterans Day originally marked the 11th hour of the 11th day of the \n11th month when the guns of World War I, the war to end all wars, \nfinally fell silent. Instead of honoring that moment, instead of laying \na wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington, instead of \nlaying out a clear plan for success in Iraq, the President laid into \nhis critics with an 11th hour rhetorical assault that I believe \ndishonors that day and does a disservice to veterans and to those \nserving today. He did so even as he continued to distort the truth \nabout his war of choice.\n  Perhaps most striking of all is that his almost desperate sounding \nVeterans Day attack on those who have told the truth about his \ndistortion was itself accompanied by more distortion. Does the \nPresident really think the many generals, former top administration \nofficials, and Senators from his own party who have joined over two-\nthirds of the country in questioning the President's handling of the \nwar in Iraq--are they all unpatriotic, too? This is America, a place \nwhere we thrive on healthy debate. That is something we are trying to \ntake to Afghanistan and Iraq. It is something we are trying to export \nto the rest of the world. The President does not have a monopoly on \npatriotism, and this is not a country where only those who agree with \nhim support the troops or care about defending our country.\n  You can care just as much about defending our country and have just \nas much support for the troops by being a critic of policies. No matter \nwhat the President says, asking tough questions is not pessimism, it is \npatriotism. And fighting for the right policy for our troops sends them \nexactly the right message that all of us here take very seriously the \ndecision to put them in harm's way and that our democracy is alive and \nwell.\n  Ironically, the President even used the solemn occasion of Veterans \nDay to continue his campaign of misrepresenting the facts and throwing \nup smokescreens. His statement that Democrats saw and heard the same \nintelligence he did is just flat-out untrue, unless, of course, the \nPresident and the administration did not do their job and study the \nadditional intelligence given only to them and not the Congress.\n  As the Washington Post said on Saturday, Bush and his aides had \naccess to much more voluminous intelligence information than lawmakers \nwho were dependent on the administration to provide the material. But \nthat whole discussion is nothing more than an effort to \ndistract attention from the issue that matters most and can be answered \nmost simply: Did the administration go beyond what even the flawed \nintelligence would support in making the case for war? Did they use \nobviously inaccurate intelligence, despite being told clearly and \nrepeatedly not to? Did they use the claims of known fabricators and \nrely on those claims of known fabricators? The answer to each and every \none of these questions is yes. The only people who are now trying to \nrewrite that history are the President and his allies.\n\n  There is no greater breach of the public trust than knowingly \nmisleading the country into war. In a democracy, we simply cannot \ntolerate the abuse of this trust by the Government.\n  To the extent this occurred in the lead-up to the war in Iraq, those \nresponsible must be held accountable. That is precisely why Democrats \nhave been pushing the Senate Intelligence Committee to complete a \nthorough and balanced investigation into the issue. When the President \ntried to pretend on Friday that the Intelligence Committee had already \ndetermined that he had not manipulated intelligence and misled the \nAmerican public, he had to have known full well they have not yet \nreported on that very question. That is precisely why Democrats were \nforced to shut down the Senate in secret session and go into that \nsecret session in order to make our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle take this issue seriously.\n  When the President said his opponents were throwing out false \ncharges, he knew all too well that these charges are anything but \nfalse. But the President and the Republicans seem far more interested \nin confusing the issue and attacking their opponents than in getting \nhonest answers.\n  Let's be clear, Mr. President, let's be clear, my fellow Americans: \nThere is no question that Americans were misled into the war in Iraq. \nSimply put, they were told that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass \ndestruction when he did not. The issue is whether they were misled \nintentionally.\n  Just as there is a distinction between being wrong and being \ndishonest, there is a fundamental difference between relying on \nincorrect intelligence and making statements that you know are not \nsupported by the intelligence.\n  The bottom line is that the President and his administration did \nmislead America into war. In fact, the war in Iraq was and remains one \nof the great acts of misleading and deception in American history. The \nfacts are incontrovertible.\n  The act of misleading was pretending to Americans that no decision \nhad really been made to go to war and that they would seriously pursue \ninspections when the evidence now strongly suggests that they had \nalready decided as a matter of policy to take out Saddam Hussein, were \nanxious to do it for ideological reasons, and hoped that inspections, \nwhich Vice President Cheney had opposed and tried to prevent, would not \nget in their way.\n  The President misled America about his intentions and the manner in \nwhich he would make his decision. We now know that his speech in \nCincinnati right before the authorization vote was carefully \norchestrated window dressing where, again, he misled America by \npromising, ``If we have to act, we will take every precaution that is \npossible, we will plan carefully, and we will go with our allies.'' We \ndid not take every precaution possible, we did not plan--that is \nevident for every American to see--and except for Great Britain, we did \nnot go in with our allies.\n  The act of misleading was just going through the motions of \ninspections while it appears all the time the President just could not \nwait to kick Saddam Hussein out of power. The act of misleading was \npretending to Americans the real concern was weapons of mass \ndestruction when the evidence suggests the real intent was to finish\n\n[[Page S12737]]\n\nthe job his father wisely refused and remove Saddam Hussein in order to \nremake the Middle East for modern times.\n  The act of misleading was saying in a Cincinnati speech that \n``approving this resolution does not mean that military action is \nimminent or unavoidable,'' when the evidence suggests that all along \nthe goal was always to replace Saddam Hussein through an invasion. For \nmost of us in Congress, the goal was to destroy the weapons of mass \ndestruction. For President Bush, weapons of mass destruction were just \nthe first public relations means to the end of removing Saddam Hussein. \nFor most of the rest of us, removing Saddam Hussein was incidental to \nthe end of removing any weapons of mass destruction. In fact, the \nPresident was misleading America right up until 2 days before launching \nhis war of choice when he told Americans that we had exhausted all \nother avenues.\n  The truth is that on the Sunday preceding the Tuesday launch of the \nwar, there were offers of Security Council members to pursue an \nalternative to war, but the administration, in its race and rush to go \nto war, rebuffed them, saying the time for diplomacy is over.\n  By shortcutting the inspections process and sidestepping his own \npromises about planning, coalition building, and patience, the \nPresident used WMD as an excuse to rush to war, and that was an act of \nmisleading contrary to everything the President told Americans about \nthe walkup to war.\n\n  The very worst that Members of Congress can be accused of is trusting \nthe intelligence we were selectively given by this administration and \ntaking the President at his word. Imagine that, taking a President of \nthe United States at his word. But unlike this administration, there is \nabsolutely no suggestion that the Congress intentionally went beyond \nwhat we were told by the facts. That is the greatest offense by this \nadministration. Just look at the most compelling justification for war: \n``Saddam's nuclear program and his connections with al-Qaida.''\n  The facts speak for themselves. The White House has admitted that the \nPresident told Congress and the American public in his State of the \nUnion Address that Saddam was attempting to acquire fuel for nuclear \nweapons despite the fact that the CIA specifically told the \nadministration three times in writing and verbally not to use this \nintelligence. Obviously, Democrats did not get that memo. In fact, \nsimilar statements were removed from a prior speech by the President, \nand Colin Powell refused to use it in his presentation to the U.N. This \nis not relying on faulty intelligence as Democrats did, it is knowingly \nand admittedly misleading the American public on a key justification \nfor going to war.\n  This is what the administration was trying so desperately to hide \nwhen it attacked Ambassador Wilson and compromised national security by \nouting his wife. It is shameful that to this day, Republicans continue \nto attack Ambassador Wilson rather than condemning the fact that those \n16 words were ever spoken and that so many lies were told to cover it \nup.\n  How are the same Republicans who tried to impeach a President over \nwhether he misled a nation about an affair going to pretend it does not \nmatter if the administration intentionally misled the country into war?\n  The State of the Union was hardly an isolated event. In fact, it was \npart of a concerted campaign to twist the intelligence, to justify a \nwar that had already been decided was more preferable. Again playing on \npeople's fears after 9/11, the administration made statements about the \nrelationship between al-Qaida and Iraq that went beyond what the \nintelligence supported. As recently reported by the New York Times in \nthe Cincinnati Address, the President said, We have learned that Iraq \nhas trained al-Qaida members in bombmaking and poisons and deadly \ngases, despite the fact that the Defense Intelligence Agency had \npreviously concluded that the source was a fabricator.\n  The President went on to say that Iraq has a growing fleet of \nunmanned and manned aerial vehicles that could be used to disburse \nchemical or biological weapons, despite the fact that the Air Force \ndisagreed with that conclusion. As the Wall Street Journal reported: \nThe Air Force dissent was kept secret, even as the President publicly \nmade the opposite case before a congressional vote on the war \nresolution.\n  That is two more memos that the Congress never got. In fact, when \nfaced with the intelligence community's consensus conclusion that there \nwas no formal relationship between Saddam and al-Qaida, the \nadministration then proceeded to set up their own intelligence shop at \nDOD to get some answers that were better suited to their agenda. Again, \nthere is a fundamental difference between believing incorrect \nintelligence and forcing or making up your own intelligence.\n  Where would the Republicans and the President draw the line? How else \nwould 70 percent of the American public be led to conclude that Saddam \nHussein was involved in 9/11? That was not an accident. In fact, I \nremember correcting the President of the United States at our first \ndebate when he said to America it was Saddam Hussein who attacked us.\n  Why else did Vice President Cheney cite intelligence about a meeting \nbetween one of the 9/11 hijackers and Iraqis that the intelligence \ncommunity and the 9/11 Commission concluded never took place? Why else \nmake false statements about Saddam's ability to launch a chemical or \nbiological weapon attack in under an hour without ever clearing that \nstatement with the CIA, which in itself mistrusted the source and \nrefused to include it in the National Intelligence Estimate? Why else \nwould they say we would be greeted by liberators when their own \nintelligence reports said we could be facing a prolonged and determined \ninsurgency? Why else tell Americans that Iraqi oil would pay for the \ninvasion when they had to know that the dilapidated oil infrastructure \nwould never permit that to happen?\n  What about the President's promises to Congress that he would work \nwith allies, that he would exhaust all options, that he would not rush \nto war? If the President wants to use quotes of mine from 2002, he \nmight just look at the ones that were not the result of relying on \nfaulty intelligence and trusting the President's word. As I said in my \nformer statement before the authorizing vote--I wish the President had \nread this--if we go it alone without reason, we risk inflaming an \nentire region, breeding a new generation of terrorists, a new cadre of \nanti-American zealots, and we will be less secure, not more secure, at \nthe end of the day. Let there be no doubt or confusion about where we \nstand on this. I will support a multilateral effort to disarm him by \nforce if we ever exhaust those other options, as the President has \npromised, but I will not support a unilateral U.S. war against Iraq \nunless that threat is imminent and the multilateral effort has proven \nnot possible.\n  In my speech at Georgetown on the eve of the war, I said: The United \nStates should never go to war because it wants to. The United States \nshould go to war because we have to. And we do not have to until we \nhave exhausted the remedies available, built legitimacy, and earned the \nconsent of the American people.\n  We need to make certain that we have not unnecessarily twisted so \nmany arms, created so many reluctant partners, abused the trust of \nCongress, or strained so many relations that the longer term and more \nimmediate vital war on terror is made more difficult. I say to the \nPresident, show respect for the process of international diplomacy \nbecause it is not always right but it can make America stronger, and \nshow the world some appropriate patience in building a genuine \ncoalition. Mr. President, do not rush to war.\n  Today, our troops continue to bear the burden of that promise broken \nby this administration. We need to move forward with fixing the mess \nthe administration has created in Iraq. I have laid out in detail on \nfive or six occasions my views about exactly how we can accomplish that \nand how we can get our troops home within a reasonable period of \ntime. But that does not excuse our responsibility to hold the \nadministration accountable if they knowingly misled the country when \nAmerican lives were at stake. We need to do both.\n\n  Those colleagues on the other side of the aisle need to stop \npretending that it does not matter if the administration stretched the \ntruth beyond recognition and they need to start working to find out the \nreal answers that\n\n[[Page S12738]]\n\nthe country deserves and the real leadership that our troops in Iraq \ndeserve. They deserve it from a Commander in Chief, not just a \n``campaigner in chief.''\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I believe the Senator from Rhode Island had an \ninquiry.\n  Mr. REED. Parliamentary inquiry: What is the status of the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The routine is the Senator from Connecticut is \ndue to be recognized for 10 minutes, followed by a Republican.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Tennessee will \nseek recognition after the Senator from Connecticut. How much time did \nthe Senator want?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of Senator \nDodd's time, Senator Alexander be recognized for 3 minutes, and at the \nconclusion of Senator Alexander's time I be recognized for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Reserving the right to object, how does this affect the \ndebate on the Energy and Water conference report?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If this request is approved, it would delay \nthe beginning of consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. By how long?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By approximately 6 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I have no objection.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, what I think might be the \nappropriate way to do it, since I do not want to have my remarks on \nIraq to necessarily go directly from that to the celebration of the \nyear of dealing with premature babies, I suggest that at the conclusion \nof my remarks on the subject matter that I wish to speak on that we \nthen turn to the Senator from Tennessee about the issue for 3 minutes, \nwhich I may ask him to yield for a minute of time just to comment \nbecause we worked together on this issue, and then turn to my colleague \nfrom Rhode Island. Is that all right?\n  Mr. REED. That is perfectly all right. I think to expedite \nconsideration of the Energy bill, I revise my consent rather than 15 \nminutes, 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As I understand, it is 10 minutes, 3 minutes, \n10 minutes. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in these 10 minutes I will address the issue \nof an amendment offered by my colleague from Michigan, and several \nothers including this Senator, which we have worked on over the last \nweek or so. This amendment will be voted on tomorrow, and we have tried \nhere to come up with some ideas that could build bipartisan support for \nhow we go from where we are today in Iraq to a successful conclusion of \nthat conflict.\n  I think all of us recognize that we have ourselves in a mess in Iraq, \nno matter how one wants to characterize it. I was disappointed that the \nPresident used Veterans Day last week as an opportunity to attack those \nwho have agreed with him at certain points and disagreed with him at \nothers. It seems to me that what we need from the administration is far \nmore clarity, a greater sense of vision, some concrete ideas on how we \nintend to conclude our involvement in Iraq, and a strategy for \nincreasing the likelihood that the Iraqi people can build a stable \ngovernment.\n  As we know, from the very beginning, the rationale for going to war \nin Iraq was filled with misrepresentations, deceits, and the \nfalsification of many facts. There was no Iraqi purchase of uranium \nfrom Niger. There were no aluminum tubes being used to construct \nnuclear centrifuges. There were no stockpiles of biological and \nchemical weapons. We now know that allegations linking Iraqi officials \nto al-Qaida were untrue. To make matters worse, in my view, the \nadministration's penchant for discarding international norms with \nrespect to our missions in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, has \nunraveled decades of American diplomacy dedicated to enshrining the \nrule of law.\n  The course set by this administration has cost America its treasure, \nbut it has also cost the lives of more than 2,000 of our service men \nand women. More than 14,000 others have sustained serious injuries. We \nare now spending somewhere around $4-$6 billion every month for U.S. \nmilitary operations alone in that country.\n  There have been intangible costs as well most--significantly, the \ncost to America's favorable public image at home and abroad--a cost \nthat has seriously impaired our ability to shape global responses to \nglobal challenges.\n  These challenges include North Korea's nuclear weapons, Iran's \nambitions to develop its own weapons capability, genocide in Sudan's \nDarfur region, political instability in Lebanon and Syria, and a \nfestering Arab-Israeli conflict. Anti-American nationalism is spreading \nthroughout our own hemisphere as we saw in recent days during the \nsummit meetings of the Americas; and the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the \npossibility of an avian flu epidemic all are being held hostage because \nof the missteps we have taken in Iraq.\n  These missteps have tarnished America's image, and have allowed the \ndisaffected in Iraq and elsewhere to capitalize on these misfortunes \nand to distort our values and intentions, in order to inspire violence \nfor their own purposes. We saw it in recent protests in Argentina. We \nare seeing it to a certain extent in the ongoing youth violence in \nFrance. We saw it several days ago in the tragic bombings in Amman, \nJordan. We see it every day in Iraq as American and Iraqi soldiers and \ncivilians are randomly attacked by angry, nameless, and faceless \nindividuals. It is not enough to simply decry past mistakes or \nAmerica's tarnished reputation. We have to do something to correct \nthese mistakes and restore America's prestige.\n  In short, what we need is a plan for success in Iraq, and what better \nplace to start than in that war-torn nation. Last month, while visiting \nBaghdad with my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, I had the \nopportunity to meet with U.S. commanders on the ground and to visit \nwith our men and women in uniform who in some cases are on their second \nor third tours of duty in that nation.\n  I cannot say how impressed I was with these heroes who risk their \nlives every single day in the service of our Nation, and with the \nsenior military officers who lead them. We owe these brave Americans a \nhuge debt of gratitude for their courage, sacrifice, and \nprofessionalism. But we owe them much more than that. We owe them a \nstrategy and a framework for completing this mission. We owe them a \nsense of conviction that this is not going to be an indefinite \nstruggle. That is why I joined with Senator Levin and others in \ncrafting this amendment, which we hope will be embraced on a bipartisan \nbasis. This amendment would require the President to publicly lay out \nfor the first time a strategy and framework for our troops to follow so \nthat they can successfully complete the mission in Iraq and come home.\n  Recently, the President told the American people that Iraq has made \nincredible political progress: from tyranny, to liberation, to national \nelections, to a new constitution in the space of 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  I agree with that assessment, but that is not a strategy for success. \nIt is a statement of discrete events that have thus far occurred in \nIraq, albeit positive events. Our troops and the American people \ndeserve more than that, in my view. They certainly deserve more than \nsimply being told that the strategy is: When they stand up, we will \nstand down. What our troops are looking for, what I believe the \nAmerican people are looking for, what Iraq and Iraq's neighbors are \nlooking for, is a clearly articulated strategy, a timetable which \nculminates in the election of a sovereign, inclusive Iraqi government \nwith the expertise and experience to govern effectively. Thus far, the \nadministration has failed to articulate such a strategy or such a \ntimetable.\n  Before success can be a reality, however, competent Iraqi security \nand police forces, respectful of the civilian authority, must be at the \nready to secure Iraq's borders and provide security within its \nterritory.\n  And fundamental to achieving success, in my view, is ensuring that \nthe vast majority of Iraqi Kurds, Sunnis, and Shi'as have bought into \nwhatever political architecture emerges from the upcoming elections. At \nthe moment, that is not a given.\n\n[[Page S12739]]\n\n  Some but not all Iraqis have decided that the road to reconciliation \nand inclusion is the right road. Others remain mistrustful and \nuncertain. Although the latter may be a minority, it is painfully \nevident that they have the capacity to derail progress for all Iraqis.\n  With more than 160,000 American servicemen in Iraq, our presence and \nour policies are going to be pivotal in helping to shape Iraq's future. \nBut the United States, despite all of its military strength, cannot, \nthrough force alone, remake Iraq. Moreover, the longer U.S. troops \nremain an occupying force there, the greater the hatred and \ndisaffection among Iraqis and the larger attraction for foreign \njihadists.\n  That is why it is especially important that the administration \nproceed with some sense of urgency in setting forth its strategy for \ninvolving Iraq's neighbors in addressing the political, ethnic, and \ntribal divisions that exist in Iraq and fuel instability, particularly \nso in light of the size of the ``no'' vote cast by Sunni voters against \nthe new constitution.\n  The Levin amendment imbues the administration with that urgency. It \nstates that U.S. forces should not remain in Iraq indefinitely. It \nestablishes expectations that calendar year 2006 should be a period of \nsignificant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, thereby creating the \nconditions for the phased redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq. It \nstresses the need for compromise among Iraqis to achieve a sustainable \nsovereign government. And most important, it calls upon the President \nno later than 30 days after enactment of this bill to tell the American \npeople his campaign plan and estimated dates for the redeployment of \nU.S. forces.\n  The pending amendment provides concrete ideas for completing our \nmission in Iraq successfully, for phased redeployment of U.S. combat \nforces, for reassuring Iraq and its neighbors that we have no ulterior \nmotives with respect to Iraq's future, and for restoring America's \ninfluence and prestige.\n  A successful strategy for Iraq will free-up critical resources and \npersonnel to enable America to address urgent homeland security \npriorities: protecting schools and hospitals, water and power stations, \nand other vital locations; equipping our firefighters and other first \nresponders who are the first line of defense in our communities against \nacts of terror; and fortifying our Nation's transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  Today, America is less secure than it was 5 years ago, as resources \nhave been diverted from programs to maintain the readiness of our Armed \nForces, and to strengthen our homeland security, in order to pay for \nthe continuing occupation of Iraq. It is time for the Bush \nadministration to make a major course correction in our policy in Iraq \nif we are going to be successful, one that will bring our military \ninvolvement nearer to a close. It is time for the administration to \nrefocus attention and resources on our Nation's real priorities--\nkeeping America strong, secure, and prosperous for the 21 century.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a good look at the Levin amendment. It \nhas been worked on for the last week by a number of us who have tried \nto come up with a plan for success, recognizing the achievements that \nhave occurred but also laying out a strategy of how to succeed in the \ncoming months. We cannot continue on the path we are on indefinitely. \nIt will not work. It has cost us dearly at home and abroad.\n  I think that this amendment is one that many of my colleagues could \nbe drawn to. It doesn't lay out timetables definitely, but it does lay \nout a framework, a strategy for success. I urge my colleagues to vote \nto adopt this amendment when it comes to a vote tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   National Prematurity Awareness Day\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. While my friend, the Senator from Connecticut, is on \nthe floor, I would like to change the subject for just 2 or 3 minutes \nand talk about the issue of babies born prematurely, an area he and I \nhave been working on together. Premature infants are 14 times more \nlikely to die in the first year of their lives. This is Prematurity \nAwareness Month. Tomorrow is Prematurity Awareness Day. It is the No. 1 \ncause of infant death in the first month of life in the United States. \nPremature babies who survive may suffer lifelong consequences, \nincluding cerebral palsy, mental retardation, chronic lung disease, \nvision and hearing loss. Half the cases of premature birth have no \nknown cause, and any pregnant woman is at risk.\n  That is why the Senator from Connecticut and I have introduced the \nPrematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers Who Deliver \nInfants Early Act, which we call the PREEMIE Act. It expands research \ninto the causes and prevention of prematurity and increases education \nand support services related to prematurity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be added to our \nlegislation in honor of Prematurity Awareness Day, which is tomorrow: \nSenators Bennett, Bingaman, Clinton, Bond, Cochran, Collins, Hagel, \nInouye, Lieberman, Lugar, Obama, Lautenberg, Lincoln, and Talent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The March of Dimes is our partner, a strong advocate \nfor the PREEMIE bill. It is leading the prematurity campaign. It will \nsponsor a symposium on prematurity research here in Washington, DC, on \nNovember 21 and 22.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would the Senator add my name, please?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent to add the name of the Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It calls for a Federal research plan. I thank our \ncolleagues for joining us in this effort. We hope the legislation will \npass Congress this year.\n  With the permission of the Senator from Rhode Island, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from Connecticut have a minute to make his \ncomments on the legislation.\n  Mr. REED. I have no objection.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. I am pleased to join with my \ncolleague from Tennessee in this effort. I commend our colleagues from \naround the country who joined us, including our friend from South \nCarolina, the most recent cosponsor of this legislation.\n  One out of every eight babies in our country is born prematurely--\nthat is 1,300 infants every day and over 470,000 every year. The \nproblems associated with prematurity are legion. We are making \nincredible advances in how we treat these children, but we need to do a \nlot more. I am not going to go to great length here except to commend \nmy colleague from Tennessee and tell him how much I have enjoyed \nworking with him on this issue.\n  This is a critically important issue. It is the kind of issue that \ndeserves more attention. We hope to get that attention with these \nefforts. I commend him for his leadership. I am pleased to be a partner \nin this effort, and I am grateful to my colleagues for joining us in \nthis endeavor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the \namendment offered by Senator Levin from Michigan. I was pleased to work \nwith a number of my colleagues on this amendment, including Senator \nLevin, Senator Biden, Senator Harry Reid, Senator Kerry, Senator \nFeingold, Senator Kennedy, Senator Durbin, and particularly Senator \nDodd. Senator Dodd and I had the privilege of traveling together \nthrough Iraq just about 3 weeks ago. Our trip was very illuminating. \nHis participation is one I deeply appreciated.\n  We all understand that there are over 160,000 American troops in \nIraq. They are serving magnificently, and they have paid a difficult \nprice for their service. We have lost soldiers and sailors and airmen \nand marines. We know how important it is to succeed in Iraq.\n  But the American people are concerned. A Pew Research poll conducted \nlast week found that those polled believed that Iraq was the most \nimportant problem facing the country today. A second poll conducted by \nNBC News and the Wall Street Journal, however, found that 64 percent of \nthose polled disapproved of the way President Bush is handling this \nsituation in Iraq.\n  At the heart of that, I believe, is a sense that there is no plan. \nThere are slogans--``Stay the course.'' There are\n\n[[Page S12740]]\n\nslogans--``When the Iraqis stand up, we stand down.'' But a slogan is \nnot a plan, and the American people and this Congress should demand a \nplan.\n  That is the essence of the Levin amendment. We are not collectively a \nCommander in Chief. We should not presume to think so. He is \nresponsible for such a plan, and he has to provide, not just to us but \nto the American people, a sense that there is a plan that is leading to \nan outcome which is successful in a timeframe which is feasible. What \nthe American people are seeing, however, is chaos without a plan.\n\n  I did not vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq. At that time, \nmy concerns were, after the initial decisive military victory, that we \nwould be swept up in a difficult situation. That is what has come to \npass. I thought the cost would be huge then, but I did not expect that \nwe would enter the phase after military operations, the conventional \nattack, with essentially no plan. That was a surprise to me and a \nsurprise to so many others.\n  According to an article in the Philadelphia Inquirer, when a \nlieutenant colonel briefed war planners and intelligence officers in \nMarch 2003 on the administration's plans in Iraq, the slide for the \nrebuilding operations or phase 4-C, as it is known in the military, was \nsimply this: ``To be provided.'' We are still waiting. We are still \nwaiting for a plan that works, that is measurable, and that will give \nthe American public the confidence that our course ahead will lead to \nsuccess.\n  We all know in February of 2003 when General Shinseki was asked about \nthe troop strength we needed there, he said several hundred thousand \nsoldiers. He was dismissed--and that is a kind word for the treatment \nhe received. Secretary Rumsfeld said the estimate was `` . . . far from \nthe mark.'' Secretary Wolfowitz called it ``outlandish.'' In fact, it \nwas very accurate, very perceptive--prophetic, indeed, because after \nour initial entry into Iraq, after the first days of fighting, it \nbecame more and more obvious we needed more troops to, among other \nthings, secure ammo dumps that were prolific throughout the country. \nPerhaps we have lost that window where more troops will make a \ndifference, but we certainly have not gone past the point where a good \nplan will make a difference, and we need that good plan.\n  The Congressional Research Service has summarized dozens of reports \nand articles, cataloging mistake after mistake. In their words:\n\n       The lack of reconstruction plan; the failure to adequately \n     fund reconstruction early on; unrealistic application of U.S. \n     views to Iraqi conditions by, for example, emphasizing \n     privatization policy; the organizational incompetence of the \n     CPA; changing deadlines . . .\n\n  Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n  I could add, a very unwise de-Baathification process and the \ndisestablishment of the Iraqi army. But the litany goes on and on. It \nwas ad hoc, off the cuff. It was not a plan that worked and it is not \nworking today.\n  We need this plan. That is what the Levin amendment calls for. Give \nus a plan. Not just us, but give the American people a plan. We have \nmade progress in Iraq. We have had elections. But that progress is \nfragile and reversible. We have to have a coherent way ahead. And \nagain, hope is not a plan.\n  This amendment is not, as some would characterize it, cut and run. It \nasks the President to lay out conditions. It asks to define a mission. \nIt asks to catalog the resources necessary. Then it anticipates--and I \nthink this is prudent--that we would have a phased redeployment of \ntroops.\n  Just today, in London, Prime Minister Blair talked about British \ntroops coming out next year, 2006. Jalal Talabani, the Iraqi President, \nsaid the troops are coming out in 2006. British Defense Secretary John \nReid--no relation--said that we are likely to see troops come out next \nyear if conditions allow. So the idea of looking ahead with a good plan \nand making a good-faith estimate as to troop levels seems to me the \nappropriate thing to do. It is a campaign plan. It is a campaign plan \nwhich will give us an idea of how long we will be there.\n  We need not simply to reflect what is happening on the ground in \nIraq. We cannot sustain indefinitely 160,000 American troops in Iraq.\n  It will bring our land forces, our Army, our Marines to their knees. \nThey are overstretched. They have a billion dollars of built-up \nmaintenance on helicopters and vehicles. And the personnel turmoil is \nexcruciating. We owe it to them to have a plan. And we must be able to \nshow how we are paying for this plan.\n  This plan would also ask the President to talk about a definition of \n``success,'' talk about the conditions, talk about situations which \nwould cause those conditions to be reevaluated. The Levin amendment is \nasking for the obvious. Show us the way ahead, not in a slogan but in \nconcrete, measurable elements that will constitute a good plan. We have \nbeen waiting for 2\\1/2\\ years for such a plan.\n  What is the mission? It has changed. One of the initial missions was \nto deny the Iraqi Government weapons of mass destruction. We find they \nhad none.\n  Then, of course, the mission was to root out terrorist insurgents \nthat might be collaborating with Saddam Hussein's regime. The evidence \nstrongly suggests there was no such material collaboration. But today \nthere are thousands of hardened terrorists that we are in the process \nof rooting out--after the attack, not before.\n  Then, of course, there was the mission of creating a democratic oasis \nin Iraq that would be transformative of the entire region.\n  Is that still the mission? If it is the mission, we are going to need \nmany decades, billions of dollars, and to mobilize the strength of this \ncountry, not just militarily but for technical and political \nassistance, and we haven't done that.\n  The President doesn't suggest--from everything I have heard and from \neverything I have seen--that he intended to do that.\n  What is the mission? What are the resources? We are spending about $4 \nbillion to $6 billion a month in Iraq and Afghanistan. How long will we \nspend that much money, and when we finish how much will we have to \nspend to reconstitute our equipment, to reorganize our troops? Tell us. \nIt is important because we make decisions on this floor that are based \nupon assumptions about how much we will be spending years ahead in \nIraq, and we have to have those numbers. We need the conditions. More \nthan that, we need all this tied into our troop strength in Iraq.\n  That is essentially what the American people are looking at very \nconsciously.\n  How long will their sons and daughters be committed to this struggle?\n  I believe we have to succeed, and I am here because we can't succeed \nwithout a coherent plan, not one that is made up of slogans and good \nintentions but one that is premised on real conditions, hardnosed, and \nsomething that will help us and help the American people to understand \nour commitment and help us to succeed in that commitment.\n  I hope very strongly that the Levin amendment is agreed to. The \nRepublican counterpart makes a few changes, but the critical change is \nit essentially takes out the notion of a plan.\n  The opposing amendment would strip out something vital in the Levin \namendment; that is, a campaign plan that would help show, project, the \nphased redeployment of American troops. I think that is essential.\n  If Tony Blair can speak off the cuff in London today about the phased \nwithdrawal of British troops, and Talabani, the Iraqi President can do \nit, and John Reid, the Defense Secretary of Great Britain can do it, \nthen certainly the President of United States can do it. And we ask him \nto do it. In fact, if we agree to this amendment, it will require him \nto do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/14/senate-section/article/S12740-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12740-S12751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2006--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The hour of 4:30 having arrived, \nthe Senate will proceed to the consideration of the conference report \nto accompany H.R. 2419, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislation clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill, H.R. \n     2419, making appropriations for energy and water development \n     for the fiscal year ending\n\n[[Page S12741]]\n\n     September 30, 2006, and for other purposes, having met, have \n     agreed that the House recede from its disagreement to the \n     amendment of the Senate, and agree to the same with an \n     amendment, and the Senate agree to the same, signed by all of \n     the conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the proceedings of the House in \nthe Record of November 7, 2005.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided between the bill managers, with 15 \nminutes under the control of the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, and \n15 minutes under the control of the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n\n\n                         Defense Authorization\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think we indicated last week that while \nthe time is limited, as it had been prior to this point in terms of \ndebate on the Iraq amendments, there would be time either on the \namendments themselves or in morning business tonight after the vote. \nThere is a very limited period of time under the unanimous consent \nagreement for tomorrow. We had hoped that could have been expended, but \napparently there is no agreement to that.\n  I remind colleagues who have not had a chance to speak on the Iraq \namendments which are pending that the best time to do that, given the \nvery limited time remaining on tomorrow on these amendments, would be \nafter the vote on the appropriations bill tonight.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 5 minutes \nof my time be reserved intact prior to the vote at 5:30, and I object \nfor the other side.\n  How much time remains, and how is it allotted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each side has 10 minutes at this time, and \nthere are four Senators to equally divide the 10 minutes. Each of the \nfour Senators has 10 minutes. The vote will be 40 minutes from now.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I didn't understand. Do we know the names of the \nSenators? Reed, Domenici.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And Senators McCain and Coburn.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right.\n  I ask consent to call up conference authority to accompany H.R. 2419 \nand ask it be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The report is before the Senate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President it is my pleasure to bring the Energy and \nWater conference report for fiscal year 2006 to the floor for \nconsideration.\n  The bill provides $30.495 billion, consistent with the conference \nallocation and $748 million above the request and the House level and \nbudget request and $750 million below the Senate allocation. This bill \nis a product of extensive compromise on both sides.\n  U.S. Army Corps; $5.38 billion: +$636 million above the House, $84 \nmillion above the Senate and $57 million below fiscal year 2005 levels \nand +$1.05 billion above the request.\n  In the wake the hurricanes, this budget rejects the direction of the \nPresident's proposed budget. It is clear that we need to invest more in \ncritical water infrastructure, not less.\n  This also funds an $8 million study to investigate various storm \nprotection needs for New Orleans and vicinity, as well as $10 million \nfor the Louisiana coastal area.\n  The report does not provide for the supplemental needs of Louisiana, \nMississippi, Texas or Florida, nor does it repay any of the projects \nthat have been tapped to support the Corps' post hurricane operations. \nThe Congress will address this as part of the emergency supplemental.\n  Bureau of Reclamation $1.06 billion. This is: +$53.5 million above \nthe House, -$16 million below the Senate, +$114 million above the \nrequest.\n  Mr. President--$24.29 billion is provided to the Department. This is \n$76 million above the request and consistent with fiscal year 2005 \nlevels. NNSA received $9.196 billion. This is $217 above fiscal year \n2005 levels and $200 million below the request, $348 million above the \nHouse and -$250 below the Senate.\n  The Conferees have agreed to increase funding for the Reliable \nReplacement Warhead Program. This innovative approach is intended to \nchallenge weapons designers to enhance the existing warheads to improve \nthe safety, surety and manufacturability.\n  The conference agreement provides no funding for a modern pit \nfacility. I do not believe the administration has made the case that \nthis costly new project is necessary at this point. The Department must \nfocus on improving the manufacturing capability of pits at Los Alamos \nrather than experimental activities.\n  Lab Directed Research and Development, LDRD. The bill increases the \nLDRD amount to 8 percent. As an experiment, it applies overhead costs, \nbut also ensures that overall LDRD funding does not fall below the 6 \npercent overall.\n  NNSA's Office of Nuclear Nonproliferation is provided $1.63 billion. \nThis is a slight decrease below the President's request. However, the \nconferees were able to provide needed funding for key nonproliferation \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, $220 million is provided to initiate construction of \nthe mixed oxide conversion plant at Savannah River Site in South \nCarolina this fiscal year. This level of funding will permit the \nDepartment to move ahead with construction in fiscal year 2006.\n  The conference report provides $309 million, an increase of $42 \nmillion above the request and $85 million above fiscal year 2005, for \nthe Nuclear Detection Research and Development account. This is \ncritical funding provided to the labs to stay a step ahead of \nterrorists and other threats.\n  The conferees provide $427 million, an increase of $83 million, to \nprotect nuclear materials in Russia that was negotiated as part of the \nBratislava Summit in February 2005 between President's Bush and Putin.\n  This will allow the administration to secure several new Russian \nweapons sites that have previously not been open to the U.S. to make \ncritical security upgrades to protect Russian nuclear warheads. Russian \nsites have traditionally been poorly protected despite the fact that \nthe sites store nuclear warheads.\n  The conferees provide the Office of Science $3.63 billion, an \nincrease of $170 million above the request. The conferees provide an \nadditional $30 million for advanced computing at Oak Ridge.\n  Fossil Energy R will receive $597 million, up $26 million from \nfiscal year 2005 and $106 million above the request. The conferees \ndefer the use of $257 million to be used to support the construction of \nthe FutureGen coal plant.\n  The conference report provides $1.8 billion for Energy Supply and \nConservation research and development. This is $24 million above fiscal \nyear 2005 and $81 million above the request.\n  For fiscal year 2006, the conferees have provided $240 million for \nweatherization assistance. This is a $15 million increase above the \nrequest and will provide important funding to offset rising energy \ncosts this winter.\n  In fiscal year 2006, the conferees provide $7 billion in funding for \nenvironmental management activities. Within this amount the defense \ncleanup activities receive $6.19 billion, an increase of $177 million \nabove the request.\n  Yucca Mountain is facing serious delays regarding the filing of the \nlicense application and the EPA established radiation standard. In \naddition, this facility will be too small to address all our Nation's \nspent fuel and defense waste needs.\n  We need to find ways to reduce the amount of spent fuel to be sent to \nthe repository and encourage the Department to find ways to do more \nthrough spent fuel recycling.\n  Recently, the Secretary of Energy Sam Bodman outlined his vision for \nthe future of nuclear power, which includes investment in commercial \nspent fuel recycling and to minimize the proliferation threats.\n  The conference agreement provides $50 million for the Denali \nCommission, an increase of $47 million over the President's request.\n  The conference agreement provides $65 million for the Appalachian \nRegional Commission, consistent with the President's request.\n\n[[Page S12742]]\n\n  The conference agreement provides $12 million for the Delta Regional \nAuthority.\n  The conference agreement provides a total budget of $734 million for \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the same as the Senate bill and is \n$41 million above the request. NRC is charged with new security \ninvestigations, as well as supporting the filing of new reactor license \nrequests.\n  The conference report provides $5.4 billion for the Army Corps of \nEngineers. This is approximately $57 million less than enacted in \nfiscal year 2005.\n  The conference report provides $1.05 billion more for the Corps than \nwas proposed by the budget request. It also includes $636 million more \nthan the House Bill and $85 million more than the Senate bill.\n  This significant increase signifies a congressional commitment to \nrestore our aging water resources infrastructure.\n  For too long we have not provided sufficient resources for our water \ninfrastructure and we are now paying the price.\n  Navigation channels are not being dredged, which limits commerce.\n  Preventive maintenance is not being performed, resulting in \nunscheduled outages of projects.\n  Construction of new infrastructure is being delayed and constructed \ninefficiently due to funding constraints.\n  Studies of water resource needs are being delayed or deferred due to \nfunding constraints.\n  This conference report attempts to set us on the right path to \nrecapitalize our water resources infrastructure by providing $2.4 \nbillion for construction projects and $2 billion for Operations and \nMaintenance of existing projects.\n  Some of the construction highlights of the bill include: All of the \nDam Safety projects are funded at the Corps' full capability; $90 \nmillion for continued construction of the Olmsted Lock and Dam; $101 \nmillion for continued construction of the New York-New Jersey Harbor; \n$70 million for continued construction of the McAlpine Lock and Dam, on \nthe Ohio River; $28 million for continued construction of the West Bank \nand Vicinity, New Orleans, Louisiana flood control project; and $137 \nmillion for continuation of the Everglades Restoration Projects in \nFlorida.\n  Some of the operation and maintenance items include: $24 million for \nthe maintenance of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway; $62.4 million for \noperations and maintenance of the Upper River navigation system; $55 \nmillion for operation and maintenance of the Ohio River navigation \nsystem; $17 million for maintenance of the Columbia River jetties; and \ndredging funds were included for most of our smaller ports and \nwaterways as well.\n  The Mississippi River and Tributaries Project was funded at $400 \nmillion. This project provides for comprehensive navigation and flood \ncontrol improvements on the Mississippi River and its tributaries below \nSt. Louis, MO.\n  The conference report includes $10 million for continued studies of \nhow to restore Louisiana's Coastal Wetlands. Additional funding and \nauthorization for wetland recovery work is included in the \nadministration's emergency supplemental proposal.\n  The conference bill contains a proviso concerning a comprehensive \nhurricane protection study for south Louisiana that would afford \nprotection from a category 5 storm surge and would exclude the normal \npolicy considerations in determining the benefits of this protection \nlevel.\n\n  It is my understanding that previous studies undertaken by the Corps \nof Engineers balanced the level of protection with the benefits that \nestablished policies allowed.\n  None of the existing studies provide detailed analysis of what is \nnecessary to provide Category 5 protection for south Louisiana.\n  This study would provide that analysis. In order to expedite the \nwork, the Corps is directed to provide a plan for short term protection \nwithin 6 months of enactment, a plan for interim protection within 12 \nmonths of enactment and long term comprehensive protection within 24 \nmonths of enactment.\n  This study would rely heavily on existing studies with projections of \nnecessary actions to achieve Category 5 protection. The study would \nalso integrate flood, coastal and hurricane protection measures into a \nseamless line of protection for south Louisiana.\n  On August 29, Hurricane Katrina came ashore on the Louisiana and \nMississippi Gulf coast. This storm devastated the region.\n  The conference report does not include funding that has been \nrequested by the administration for hurricane recovery efforts along \nthe gulf coast; rather, these efforts will continue to be funded \nthrough emergency supplemental appropriations.\n  The administration has proposed spending $1.6 billion to restore the \nlevees to prehurricane strength and make repairs to existing Corps \ninfrastructure located in the hurricane's path.\n  The conference report provides $1.065 billion for the Bureau of \nReclamation. This is approximately $47 million more than was enacted in \nfiscal year 2005.\n  The conference report provides $114 million more for Reclamation than \nwas proposed by the budget request. It also includes $53.5 million more \nthan the House bill and $16 million less than the Senate bill.\n  The conference report provides sufficient funding to allow \nReclamation to continue their mission of providing water and power to \nthe West.\n  Some of the major highlights include: $129.4 million for the various \ndivisions of the Central Valley Project in California; $52.2 million \nfor the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund; $34.4 million for the \nCentral Utah Project; $56 million to continue construction of the \nAnimas-La Plata Project; $16 million for the Ft. Peck-Dry Prairie Rural \nWater System in Montana; $21 million for the Klamath Project, $37 \nmillion for the California Bay-Delta Restoration program.\n  These ongoing water resource projects provide benefits to our \ncitizens by making large parts of the western United States habitable.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nuse 5 minutes of Senator McCain's allotted time under the UC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for just a few moments, I rise to recognize \nthe work that has been done on H.R. 2419, the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Appropriations Act of 2006.\n  For a good number of years, some of us who work on the physical \nsciences in the Senate--by that I mean on committees that recognize the \nkind of research dollars that are applied to new technologies beyond \nhealth care, but more in the physical sciences--have been increasingly \nconcerned that we have dedicated almost exclusively all research money \nto health care, medical science, biological sciences, and not to the \nphysical sciences.\n  We had once invested heavily in the space program, and for decades it \nadvanced our country beyond all other countries in technology, in all \nof the high-tech that has led our economy today and is now leading the \nworld economy. Much of that was a spinoff from the early days of the \ninvestment in the space program. When few saw the opportunities or the \nbenefits, some in Congress did, and it was well funded.\n  While I am not standing on the floor in any way to criticize our \ninvestment in the biological sciences or health care--and clearly that \nhas advanced technology today well beyond where we thought we could go, \nand in a much more rapid way to look at cancer and diabetes and other \nof our chronic illnesses in this country that are causing tremendous \nproblems and death loss-- the one thing that has been obvious in tight \nbudget years is that we have not been willing to commit the kind of \ninvestment dollars to the physical sciences this bill begins to speak \nto clearly today. For example, we are spending more money than ever \nbefore on nuclear energy, pushing the technology curve once again to \nbecome leaders in the world on a technology that we once led on but we \nlet move away. Now for a variety of reasons,\n\n[[Page S12743]]\n\nmost importantly because of a need for clean energy, we are recognizing \nonce again we have to put the hard dollars back into the technology \nthat takes us beyond the lightwater reactor to the high temperature gas \nreactor and even beyond that some day, out there 40 or 50 or 60 years \nto technologies such as fission. That is in part what this budget and \nthis appropriations bill speaks to.\n\n  Certainly I come to the floor to thank the chairman of the \nAppropriations subcommittee, Pete Domenici, for his vision, his \nfarsightedness in recognizing and fighting for some of the new money \nthat advances us at our national laboratories that are tremendous \ntreasures to advance these types of technologies. Once weapons \nlaboratories during the Cold War, they are transforming themselves into \nlead research facilities well beyond what they were a decade or two \nago. Clearly, that is true, whether it is in my State of Idaho or in \nNew Mexico or California or in the other States that have the privilege \nof housing these laboratories and the quality of work they do.\n  While this conference did not come about easily, while there are many \nmore dollars that could be spent productively to advance our country \nand our leadership in the world of science, this is a major step in the \nright direction under tight budget constraints.\n  I am proud to be a conservative. I believe in balanced budgets. I \nbelieve in bringing down deficits. I believe that all parts of the \nappropriating process have to share in that responsibility. Clearly, we \nhave shared in it in the Energy and Water Development appropriations \nlegislation. At the same time we have worked cooperatively with the \nHouse and, in a common cause, advanced a variety of the technologies \nthat are embodied within this appropriations bill that is critically \nimportant.\n  I thank the chairman for the work he has done to advance a variety of \nthe technologies I have spoken to, and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. Let me reciprocate. He, too, is a \nvery significant part and plays a very important role in not only the \nmatters he discussed but many others in this bill. I commend him for \nit. His State has a magnificent laboratory. They are performing some \ngreat activity in terms of the future generation of civilian nuclear \npower. That is important for our and the world's future.\n  I take a moment to thank the staff and recognize their hard work, \nlong hours, many discussions: From the majority staff, Scott O'Malia, \nRoger Cockrell, and Emily Brunini; on the minority staff, Drew Willison \nand Nancy Olkewicz. Everybody should understand that these \nappropriations bills are put together by a small, excellent, and \nprofessional staff. Some people think that more oversight should occur. \nI hope the authorizers will do that. We can't do it in detail. We do \nour best.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I make a couple of points that I think are \nworth making on this most important bill. First, I express my \nappreciation to Senator Domenici. He and I have worked on this bill for \na long time. When I say ``this bill,'' year after year we work hard to \nput a bill together. Some years are easier than others. This was not an \neasy year. It was a very difficult year. We have a lot of Senators who \nare not happy with what we have been able to do, but we have done the \nbest we can under very trying circumstances.\n  Our conference allocation is $750 million above the President's \nrequest. Of that amount, $600 million went to the Corps of Engineers \nfor flood control and navigation projects. This is in relation to the \npost-Katrina world in which it is certainly obvious why we needed to do \nthis. This is a wise investment of our Nation's resources. The scrutiny \nof the Corps' activities is only going to increase in coming years. So \nit is imperative that they conduct themselves in a completely open and \ntransparent manner moving forward.\n  Unfortunately, the result of placing such a high priority on flood \ncontrol is that important programs of the Department of Energy are \nessentially flat. This will not be an easy year for renewable and \nenergy-efficient programs, the Office of Science, or the critically \nimportant environmental cleanups at nuclear weapons sites nationwide. \nWe must do better in future years. In fact, we have to find more \nresources for these important activities.\n  Secondly, this conference report is the product of thousands of \ncompromises, not hundreds. None of the four principal subcommittee \nconferees agrees with every provision contained in this conference \nreport, and that is an understatement. For example, as far as I am \nconcerned, we are carrying a small amount of funding and some report \nlanguage directing the Department to set a nationwide competition to \nsee if there is a State out there willing to voluntarily accept a spent \nfuel reprocessing facility. While I have always supported processing \nresearch as a prudent investment, I have never supported moving forward \nin any way on an actual reprocessing facility for many of the same \nreasons that I oppose centralized storage--the danger of transportation \noutweighs the benefits.\n\n  However, I completely respect the desire of Chairman Hobson, Chairman \nDomenici, and Ranking Member Visclosky to do something--I appreciate \nand congratulate and applaud each of them--to change the dynamics \nsurrounding what I believe is the failed Yucca Mountain project. I have \nworked with Senator Domenici for many years. He is my friend. It goes \nwithout saying that we have difficulties in this bill, but it is never \nanything personal. We have communication that is as good as any two \nSenators in this Congress. It is a good give-and-take process. Senator \nDomenici understands that legislation is the art of compromise. We are \nboth realists. I have been the chairman of this subcommittee on a \nnumber of occasions, and he has been the ranking member. We have always \nworked well together.\n  I thank both the House and the Senate staff for doing a tremendous \njob under the most trying circumstances. A lot of times we are at home, \nin the safety and security of our homes and we have staff members \nworking well into the night, into the morning, trying to come up with a \nproduct they can submit to us that we can get through this body. This \nhas been a long, difficult road this year. My hat is off to all the \nHouse and Senate staff for sticking with it and bringing forward the \nrecommendations that will be accepted this evening.\n  On the House side, thanks to Kevin Cook, Scott Burnison, John Blazey, \nTerry Tyborowski, Tracy LaTurner, Tanya Berquam, Dixon Butler, Peder \nMorebeer, and Felicia Kirksey.\n  On the Senate side, thanks to Scott O'Malia, Emily Brunini, Roger \nCockrell, and Nancy Olkewicz. I probably shouldn't spend too much time \non Drew Willison, but I couldn't spend too much time. What he has done \nin working to craft this legislation, not for me, not for Senator \nDomenici, not for the Senate, but for the people of this country, words \ncannot express adequately my appreciation for his good work. No one--I \nsay that without qualification or reservation--knows this bill better \nthan he does. His work is something the American people should \nunderstand they have gotten their money's worth from the work he has \ndone. It was a tough year. It is a product we can all be proud of.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. REID. I yield back all of the time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back his time.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I know there is \nanother Senator, but if he doesn't come by 5:30, I understand we are \ngoing to vote; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the vote will \noccur at 5:30.\n  Mr. REID. I have yielded back my time. How much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico reserved 5 minutes \nprior to the vote and has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I must say, if the Senator from Oklahoma isn't here by \n5:30, we can't yield back his time, but we are supposed to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n[[Page S12744]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am not trying to take his time. I am going to speak \nbecause I have time. If he comes, I will give him whatever I have.\n  Senator Reid talked about renewables. While we weren't able to do \neverything in each of the R programs, we are over the budget with \nreference to conservation, wind, biomass, solar, and hydrogen. We are \nhigher than the budget request in each of those. We are pleased about \nthat.\n  Move over to the nonproliferation budget, which everybody says is \nterrifically important for our country. That is up. An area which the \noccupant of the Chair is familiar with, that is the MOX, the mixed \noxide, which is a part of nonproliferation but is America's first \nsignificant effort in moving ahead with reprocessing. It starts by a \ngiant step at converting plutonium that comes from thousands of nuclear \nweapons that have been reduced, eliminated, and the plutonium remains. \nWe are trying to convert it. The Savannah River Project has accepted \nit. While the House had zeroed it out--a big mistake, in my opinion--we \nwere able to fund it by long and hard negotiations. It was one of the \nitems that held this bill up. It is funded not as much as it should be \nbut sufficient to keep this valuable, almost necessary, project going. \nThat is good.\n  Likewise, there should be no doubt, harkening back to \nnonproliferation, that the President was right in his budget. He asked \nfor a big increase, while the rest was either zeroed out, slightly \nreduced. There was an 11 or 12-percent increase. We retained that, and \nit will now see us make a very major effort in the detection, the \ncleanup, the safety of items that could proliferate in all the areas, \nbut predominantly in the area of nuclear.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields the floor.\n\n\n             Protecting the Treaty Fishing Rights of Tribes\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to address some lingering \nconcerns about certain report language in the fiscal year 2006 Energy \nand Water Appropriations Conference Report and to seek clarification. \nDuring my many years as chairman and vice chairman of the Indian \nAffairs Committee, I became acutely aware of the importance of \nprotecting the treaty fishing rights of tribes in the Northwest and \nspent much time discussing this issue with many of the Northwest tribal \nleaders. I know that without independent technical data and analyses on \nthe status of salmon and steelhead runs in the Columbia Basin, it will \nbe difficult for them to act professionally as comanagers of the \nresource. The final conference report contains language directing the \nBonneville Power Administration, BPA, to cease funding an important \nindependent scientific research center based in the Pacific Northwest, \nknown as the Fish Passage Center, FPC. The language directs BPA and the \nNorthwest Power and Conservation Council, NPCC, to transfer the \nfunctions of the Fish Passage Center in a way that ensures ``seamless \ncontinuity of activities'' without giving direction about how this \ntransfer should take place.\n  The Northwest Power Act called for the NPCC to establish a fish and \nwildlife program. That program has called for BPA to fund the Fish \nPassage Center for the past 20 years. The data and analyses the center \nhas provided has been invaluable to the States and tribal fishery \nmanagers of the Columbia Basin. Can the distinguished chairman of the \nEnergy and Water Subcommittee tell me if this language was in any way \nintended to supersede the NW Power Act or the specific provisions in \nthe NPCC's present fish and wildlife program calling for a number of \nkey functions to be performed and whether the state and tribal fishery \nmanagers will have input into how the center is reconstituted?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The premise of the longtime member of the Indian \nAffairs Committee is correct. We do not intend this language to \nsupersede the Northwest Power Act or the Council's fish and wildlife \nprogram. Certainly both the Bonneville Power Administration and the \nNPCC are expected to work closely with the State and tribal fishery \nmanagers in determining a suitable entity that could take over these \nfunctions so that the fishery managers, including the tribes, continue \nto receive independent analyses as they have in the past.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I appreciate the attention of my colleagues \nto this regional issue regarding the Fish Passage Center and would like \nto make a few comments to clarify the intent of the language.\n  This language is not about treaty rights; this issue is about \nensuring accurate data is used in recovering the species. Removal of \nfunding to the FPC does not mean the current functions will disappear. \nIt is my understanding that other institutions in the region now \nperform most of the data collection and dissemination that is performed \nby the FPC. Reduced redundancies mean increased efficiency and \neffectiveness in the regional fish and wildlife program. The end result \nis a more focused program and the region moves forward toward recovery \nof the species.\n  While BPA has contracted the FPC for the last 20 years, many \nquestions have arisen regarding the reliability of the technical data. \nThe Northwest Power and Conservation Council's Independent Scientific \nAdvisory Board, ISAB, issued a report in 2003 in which it raised \nserious questions about the FPC's analyses. The ISAB said FPC's ``basic \nmodel and methods of presentation are now inadequate to make confident \npredictions for management, and other interpretations of the \naccumulated data are needed.'' Clearly, I am not alone in questioning \nFPC's reliability. Data cloaked in advocacy create confusion. False \nscience leads people to false choices. We do not have to choose dams or \nsalmon. They can, and should, continue to coexist.\n  I am confident the BPA and NPCC will work with the region, both \nStates and tribes, to ensure a seamless transition of functions. I \nthank the chairman for allowing me to speak on this matter.\n\n\n                        mixed oxide fuel project\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern \nregarding the Mixed Oxide fuel project. This project is vital to reduce \nthe threat of terrorists or rogue nations obtaining nuclear weapon \nmaterials. By resulting in the disposal of 34 metric tons--64 tons in \ntotal--of surplus weapon-grade plutonium, enough for thousands of \nnuclear weapons, the MOX program helps accomplish one of our most \nimportant nonproliferation goals. This plutonium, once converted into \nfuel for commercial nuclear power plants, is a real ``swords into \nplowshares'' program.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have been a forceful advocate of the permanent \ndisposal of the 34 tons of excess weapons-grade plutonium from the U.S. \nand Russian stockpiles. This material equals the same amount of \nplutonium as contained in 8,000 warheads. This is the largest non-\nproliferation effort undertaken by the U.S. and G-8 partners. In the \nFiscal Year 1999 Energy and Water bill, I included $200 million in \nemergency/funding to provide the initial investment in the Plutonium \nDisposition program. Excess weapons grade plutonium in Russia is a \nclear and present danger. For that reason, the committee considers the \nDepartment's material disposition program of utmost importance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Despite this importance, the Department of Energy has not \nrequested full funding for this project in the President's Fiscal Year \n2004, Fiscal Year 2005 and Fiscal Year 2006 budget request as \noriginally proposed in the report to Congress entitled ``Disposition of \nSurplus Defense Plutonium at Savannah River Site, February 2002.'' The \nfunding shortfalls will add to the existing 3-year delay caused by the \nnegotiations between the Russian and U.S. Governments regarding \nliability for the project. However, with agreement between the U.S. and \nRussia on liability, the administration has no reason not to request \nfull funding in next year's budget. It is vital that in the next budget \nthe administration proposes fully funding the MOX program at a level \nthat will bring this project closer to its original schedule.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree with the Senator from South Carolina that the \nadministration needs to fully fund this project in fiscal year 2007 and \nthereafter. Without a viable disposal solution, the cleanup of the \nHanford Site and arrangements for decreasing inventories of plutonium \nat Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the\n\n[[Page S12745]]\n\nPantex Plant will cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars \nannually for storage and related security costs.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Never hesitant to support missions in support of our \nnational defense, the residents of South Carolina took considerable \nrisk by allowing shipments of defense plutonium to be sent to the \nSavannah River Site from Rocky Flats and other DOE sites in advance of \nthe construction of the MOX plant. In addition to supporting DOE's \nefforts to consolidate plutonium and accomplish the goals of the \nplutonium disposition program, this agreement greatly assisted DOE's \nefforts to expeditiously close Rocky Flats, resulting in considerable \ncost savings for DOE.\n  In a sign of good faith to the State of South Carolina, language was \nnegotiated between the State of South Carolina and the Federal \nGovernment that required the Department of Energy to convert one metric \nton of defense plutonium into fuel for commercial nuclear reactors by \n2011 or face penalties of $1 million per day up to $100 million per \nyear until the plutonium is either converted into the fuel or removed \nfrom the State. It has never been the intention of South Carolina to \nreceive penalty payments; the residents of the State simply sought \nreassurances that weapons-grade plutonium would not remain at SRS \nindefinitely. South Carolina would not have accepted plutonium without \nthis statute. However, until the plant is operational, it is critical \nto maintain the protections provided in Section 4306 of the Atomic \nEnergy Defense Act, 50 USC 2566. This is the reassurance the Federal \nGovernment gives to South Carolina that it is DOE's intention to see \nthis project through.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I recognize the importance of that language. The \nappropriations bill includes a 3-year delay in the penalty payment \nlanguage to reflect the delays caused by the Russians in negotiating a \nliability agreement. This delay does not allow DOE to withdraw support \nfor the program. Any effort to eliminate funding for this project will \nlikely foreclose a disposal pathway for plutonium stored at Savannah \nRiver causing the Department to pay the State of South Carolina up to \n$100,000,000 per year in fines starting in 2014.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It is also my intention to make a technical correction, \nin the future, to language contained in the conference report to the \nFiscal Year 2006 Energy and Water Appropriations Act. This conference \nreport contains a change to important authorizing language that would \nmake these penalty payments ``subject to the availability of \nappropriations.'' I appreciate the willingness of the Senator from New \nMexico to see that this is resolved.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand the concerns of the Senator from South \nCarolina. I will work with the Senator to find a fair solution that \ndoes not impact existing Department of Energy programs, and in the \nevent that the Department is unable to meet the statutory requirements \nfor the Mixed Oxide Fuel Conversion facility, the solution ensures that \nSouth Carolina does not become the permanent storage site for defense \nplutonium.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator from New Mexico and look forward to \nworking with him to continue to fully support the construction and \noperation of the MOX facility.\n\n\n                         Clarification on Funds\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would like to ask the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, \nfor clarification on funding that was included in the fiscal year 2006 \nEnergy and Water appropriations conference report. Under the fossil \nenergy research and development section, the report provided $6,000,000 \nfor the Energy and Environmental Research Center for cooperative \nresearch and development. Was it not the intent of the conference \ncommittee that the funding identified for the Energy and Environmental \nResearch Center be split with their partners in the fossil fuel \nresearch, the Western Research Institute, WRI, in Wyoming?\n  Mr. REID. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Was it also the case that the $1,000,000 in funding for \nthe Energy and Environmental Research Center under the fuels & powers \naccount was meant to be exclusively for the Energy and Environmental \nResearch Center in North Dakota as described in the report?\n  Mr. REID. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n             Department of Energy National User Facilities\n\n  Ms. CLINTON. First, I want to compliment the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Energy and Water Subcommittee for their hard and \nsuccessful work in leading the development of the Energy and Water bill \nthat is before the body today. I know it is especially difficult to \nfund all of the important programs under the jurisdiction of this \nsubcommittee, particularly in light of the significant needs of the \nArmy Corps of Engineers to respond to the calamitous impact of \nHurricane Katrina on the lives of so many Americans.\n  However, it seems to me that the funding pressures faced by the \nsubcommittee resulted in the programs of the Office of Science being \nfunded at a level significantly below the value of these programs to \nthe future security and economic health of the Nation.\n  When the Senate passed the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, an \nappropriation of $419,741,000 was included for the Department of \nEnergy's nuclear physics program, an increase of $49 million over the \nPresident's budget request, according to the Committee on \nAppropriations' report, to ensure full utilization of experimental \nfacilities. The House-passed bill included an amount of $408,341,000, \nalso including adequate funds to restore operation time of the \nfacilities in the nuclear physics program.\n  The conference report accompanying the bill before the Senate \nprovides $370,741,000, the amount of the President's budget request. \nDue to severe budget constraints, the conferees were unable to retain \nthe increases provided in the House and Senate bills for national user \nfacilities, including the increase for the Relativistic Heavy Ion \nCollider, RHIC, at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York and \nthe Jefferson Laboratory in Virginia. I understand the allocation for \nthe conference bill reduced the total amount available. I also \nunderstand the Senate-passed bill was about $1.5 billion above the \nHouse bill and that the conference bill allocation provided for a split \nof that additional amount leaving an increase of $750 million over the \nHouse-passed bill. I further understand that the vast majority of the \n$750 million in new funding was provided to the Army Corps of Engineers \nfor flood control and navigation projects in the wake of Hurricanes \nKatrina, Ophelia, Wilma and others. Under the circumstances, this was a \nwise investment of our Nation's resources.\n  However, an unintended consequence of these cutbacks is a negative \nimpact on the Brookhaven National Laboratory in my State of New York, \nwhere the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, known as RHIC, is a key \nnuclear physics facility with many user groups in our region and \nelsewhere. I am told that this amazing major facility will be severely \nimpacted by the amount approved by the conference agreement for nuclear \nphysics. We had urged the Committee to approve additional funds above \nthe President's budget request to ensure the continued operations of \nthis facility at last year's level. The budget request was inadequate \nto begin with, principally because of the increased power costs that \nhave occurred in our area to operate the facility for experiments for \napproximately 30 weeks operating time. Unfortunately, the situation \nwith the power costs has worsened.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are facing similar problems at the Jefferson \nLaboratory in Virginia. As the chairman knows, the Jefferson Lab in \nNewport News, VA, is one of our basic research labs that would be \nnegatively impacted by this funding level.\n  Specifically, as a result of this cut the Jefferson Lab will have to \nreduce the physics output of this world-leading laboratory by 25 \npercent. Just last month the National Academy of Sciences issued a \nreport titled ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' That report \nunderscored that the Nation's economic health is seriously at risk \nwithout a sustained investment in science. The report noted that in \nGermany, 36 percent of undergraduates receive their degrees in science \nand engineering. In China the figure is 59 percent, and in Japan 66 \npercent. In the United States the corresponding figure is 32 percent.\n\n[[Page S12746]]\n\n  It seems to me that this is a time when the Nation needs to invest in \nscience, not cut science programs. At the Jefferson Lab we need to \ninvest in the 12GeV upgrade necessary to sustain the pace of scientific \ndiscovery, not cut programs.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. My understanding is that the conference amount for \nnuclear physics may not provide sufficient funds for the RHIC facility. \nBecause of the increased power costs and other factors, I am advised \nthat without an increase in funding it is possible that there will not \nbe any experimental operations in this fiscal year. I think we can all \nagree that is a bad and unintended outcome.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chairman, you and Senator Reid, the ranking member, \nhave long been strong supporters of our national labs and specifically \nthe work done at the Jefferson Lab and Brookhaven National Lab. The \nquestions that we collectively pose relate to how we can repair the \nunintended damage done by this funding level. It is my understanding \nthat the actual bill only provides funding for the Office of Science \nand that the Department has wide discretion to reallocate those funds \namong the various programs. Does the Department of Energy have the \nflexibility and authority to move funds around or to reprogram funding \nto help to alleviate situations such as this?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Department does, indeed, have broad reprogramming \nauthority.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I understand that these reallocations or reprogramming \nusually require approval by the subcommittee. Will both the chairman \nand ranking member join us, in writing, in an effort to urge the \nDepartment to reprogram funds to ensure reasonable operating times for \nthese vital national user facilities during fiscal year 2006?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you for highlighting this matter. Senator Reid \nand I agree that the programs of the Office of Science, including \nnuclear physics, merit appropriate consideration for additional funding \nunder the circumstances. I appreciate the efforts of the Senators to \nprovide examples of the impacts on one of our basic research \nlaboratories of the funding levels provided by this conference \nagreement. I pledge my efforts to work with the Department and other \nCongressional leaders to help resolve this issue.\n  Mr. REID. I also pledge to work with the Department and affected \nMembers of this body to reach an acceptable outcome.\n\n\n                               auburn dam\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to address a provision in the \nEnergy and Water appropriations conference report, which requires the \nBureau of Reclamation to produce a special report analyzing costs and \nbenefits associated with constructing an Auburn Dam.\n  As part of that report, I believe it is critical that the Secretary \nof the Interior should utilize the expertise of U.S. Geological Survey \nto produce an up-to-date assessment of the seismic hazards associated \nwith Auburn Dam.\n  I would also like to make it clear that this Auburn study cannot \nbecome a distraction from the vital work that needs to be done right \naway to protect Sacramento from a tragic flood.\n  I am deeply concerned with the lack of adequate flood protection for \nSacramento. Sacramento is the only major United States city without \n100-year flood protection.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers has reviewed six other major flood-prone \ncities: New Orleans, St. Louis, Dallas, Kansas City, Omaha, and Tacoma. \nAll of these cities have at least 200-year flood protection.\n  Our top priority has to be to quickly shore up levees and improve \nFolsom Dam to protect Sacramento from a 200-year flood. Until this is \ncomplete, 300,000 people are at risk from catastrophic flood.\n  With respect to the conference provision, there are other issues \ninvolved with Auburn Dam, such as who would pay for the project, and \nthe potential environmental effects of flooding 50 miles of the \nAmerican River. But today I would like to focus on the seismic risk \nissue.\n  This is not the first time that building an Auburn Dam has been \nproposed. In the late 1960s construction began on an Auburn Dam. \nConstruction continued, and $200 million was spent, until 1975, when an \nearthquake occurred nearby on a previously unknown fault. This \nearthquake forced a reexamination of the risks involved.\n  According to a 1980 Bureau of Reclamation report, if an earthquake \ncaused the Auburn Dam to fail, Folsom Dam would be overtopped by a \nwater surge only minutes later.\n  Most of the Sacramento area, an area inhabited by 750,000 people, \nwould be flooded in a matter of hours, making evacuation difficult. \nFloodwater would be fast-moving and as deep as 40 feet, destroying \nhouses and lowering chances of rooftop survival.\n  The risk of earthquake and its effects, which stopped construction \nback then, has not gone away. That's why it is so critical that \nCongress know what the risks are, and take this into consideration when \ndeciding whether to go forward with this dam.\n  It has now been 30 years since work at the proposed site was halted, \nand as a result, the seismic risk assessments are out-of-date.\n  The most recent comprehensive study of seismic hazard issues \nassociated with the dam project was produced by the U.S. Geological \nSurvey in 1996, nearly 10 years ago. Even when this report was written, \nthe science of seismic hazard assessment had already progressed \nconsiderably since most of the data on the dam project were collected \nin the 1970s.\n  The report called for additional study and analysis, much of which \nwas never undertaken. This need for study and analysis still exists.\n  The Auburn Dam, if constructed, would sit on part of the Foothills \nfault system. The faults in the area of the proposed dam site are \ncurrently considered inactive, but were active in the past. The U.S. \nGeological Survey should use the best science available to evaluate \npast earthquakes, as well as the potential for future earthquakes, in \nthe vicinity of the proposed dam.\n  One potential risk comes from a ``reservoir triggered earthquake.'' \nFilling a reservoir is well-established as a potential trigger for \nseismic activity. Even inactive faults may experience seismic events \nafter reservoirs are built on top of them.\n  The weight and pressure of the water in the reservoir increases \nstress and weakens the effective strength of the rock. Water seeps into \nfissures and pores in the rock, and may lubricate faults, allowing \nmovement even in some cases where friction would have held dry rock in \nplace.\n  It has been suggested that the Oroville earthquake, a Richter scale \nmagnitude 5.8 earthquake that occurred in 1975, may have been caused by \nfilling the reservoir behind the Oroville Dam. The Auburn Dam, if \nconstructed, would be built along the same fault system as the Oroville \nDam.\n  Many other instances of these ``reservoir triggered earthquakes'' \nhave been studied around the world. Recent global reviews list nearly \n100 sites where filling reservoirs may have triggered seismic activity.\n  These studies show that the increased risk of earthquakes may last \nfor years after a reservoir is filled. Both flood-control-only and \npermanent-waterstorage dams entail some risk.\n  The 1996 U.S. Geological Survey report for Auburn took this \npossibility very seriously. The report devoted a lengthy section to its \nconsideration, and called for additional study.\n  The new report must address this issue. This is essential information \nthat will influence Congress's decision on whether to proceed beyond \npreliminary feasibility studies. Do my colleagues agree?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand the 1996 U.S. Geological Survey report \ncalled for a reevaluation of the dam design based on seismic data. A \nreevaluation should be performed using the best available science and \nthe U.S. Geological Survey should produce an analysis integrating new \ndata.\n  Mr. REID. I also concur. The potential consequences in this region \nare enormous. In California, assessing earthquake risks for a major \nproject like this is an important part of the process. Concern about \nthe possibility of earthquakes contributed to putting the project on \nhold in the first place. This concern remains important and should be \naddressed before deciding whether to proceed. The best way to do this \nis for the U.S. Geological Survey\n\n[[Page S12747]]\n\nto produce an updated analysis on the risks involved.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank my colleagues.\n\n\n                   Lake Sakakawea Recreation Upgrades\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to commend the Senator from \nNew Mexico, Mr. Domenici, and the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, for \ntheir work in completing the fiscal year 2006 Energy and Water \nappropriations bill and conference report. I am aware of the very \ndifficult choices they had to make in order to fall within their tight \nspending allocation. I appreciate their leadership on this important \npiece of legislation.\n  If I could, I would like to ask the Senator from Nevada a question \nregarding an activity at Lake Sakakawea, a Federal lake in North Dakota \noperated by the Army Corps of Engineers. For the past couple of years, \nCongress has asked the Corps of Engineers to extend docks and boat \nramps around Lake Sakakawea as a result of the low lake levels.\n  Is it not the expectation of the conference committee that the Army \nCorps of Engineers continue its work on these recreation upgrades \nwithin the Corps' fiscal year 2006 operation and maintenance budget for \nLake Sakakawea?\n  Mr. REID. It is true that while we were unable to provide funding \nabove the President's request for this activity, the intent of the \nconference committee was that this activity would continue within its \nregular operation and maintenance allocation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator from Nevada, and I yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. REID, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n\n                           FutureGen Funding\n\n Mr. BYRD. Senator Reid, I want to thank you for your support \nand assistance in shepherding this conference report to this point \ntoday. I plan to support this bill, but I have a specific point of \nclarification that I would like to discuss with you regarding the \nprovisions related to the fiscal year 2006 FutureGen funding.\n  I have not opposed the FutureGen program and have supported the \nadministration's requests for this project over the last 3 years. \nHowever, I have and will continue to raise concerns about how this \nadministration is going to fund the FutureGen program when it has not \nbeen able to provide adequate and sustained funding for core key fossil \nresearch and development programs. This situation appears only more \nominous as our budgetary constraints worsen by the year and, adding to \nthat, are new energy programs that were authorized in the Energy Policy \nAct of 2005 which will further heighten and constrain funding \npressures.\n  The fiscal year 2006 Energy and Water Conference Report provides the \n$18 million for FutureGen that the administration has requested. \nHowever, even larger funding requests are going to be required if this \ninitiative is to move forward according to its schedule. It is my \nunderstanding that the Congress has deferred $237 million of clean coal \ntechnology funding until fiscal year 2007 and will give full \nconsideration to the administration's funding requests for the \nFutureGen initiative utilizing these funds. Would it be your \nexpectation that the Congress will only consider the administration's \nFutureGen requests from the deferred amount contingent upon the \nadministration providing full funding requests for the clean coal and \nother fossil energy research, development, and demonstration programs, \nespecially the Clean Coal Power Initiative that was woefully \nunderfunded in fiscal year 2006?\n  Mr. REID. Senator, that would be my understanding and expectation.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator for that clarification. When there are \nso many other unmet fossil energy funding needs, as I have and will \ncontinue to reiterate, I cannot and will not support such a transfer \nfrom deferred funds, in whole or in part, to the FutureGen initiative \nuntil all other critical fossil energy programs are fully funded to the \nsatisfaction of the Appropriations Committee in fiscal year 2007 and \nfuture years. I will certainly consider new moneys requested in the \nadministration's budget request, but I will first prioritize other key \nfossil energy programs and other needs as a priority above the \nFutureGen program from deferred funds. This administration has been \nplaying shell games with FutureGen. They have been attempting to rob \nPeter to pay Paul which is simply masking the underlying problem of \ncontinued inadequate funding commitments for other core fossil energy \nprograms.\n  Would it also be the Senator's understanding that other fossil energy \nprograms have equal, if not greater, funding needs and that there is no \nguarantee that any portion of the $237 million in the deferred clean \ncoal technology fund will be transferred to the FutureGen program in \nfiscal year 2007 or future years. Should the administration or other \ninterested parties expect that the deferred amount will be set aside, \nin whole or in part, for FutureGen in fiscal year 2007 or beyond?\n  Mr. REID. Senator, I agree that the administration needs to provide \nmore adequate funding to the fossil energy research, development, and \ndemonstration accounts. I also agree with you that there should be no \nassumption by the administration, Members of Congress, State \ngovernments, or any other parties that there is a guarantee that any \nfunding, including the administration's future budget request for \nFutureGen will be provided by the Congress, given the austere budget \nenvironment that we are in. It is my understanding that $237 million is \ndeferred and is available in fiscal year 2007 and beyond for a number \nof pressing fossil energy funding needs. The FutureGen program will \nonly be given consideration for such deferred amounts if and only if \nall other critical fossil energy programs are fully funded, especially \nthe Clean Coal Power Initiative.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the second storm surge from Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita--high energy prices--threatens to overwhelm working \nfamilies and senior citizens. The Energy Information Administration \nforecasted that households heating with natural gas will spend $306, or \n41 percent, more for fuel this winter than last winter; households \nprimarily using heating oil can expect to pay $325, or 27 percent, \nmore; and households heating primarily with propane can expect to pay \n$230, or 21 percent, more.\n  Low-income families and seniors need assistance from the Federal \nGovernment in order to guarantee energy security in this high price \nenvironment. To provide immediate help this winter, I am working with \nSenator Collins to secure $5.1 billion in funding for the Low-Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program. Over the last 4 weeks, we have offered \ntwo amendments to increase funding for LIHEAP. While a majority of the \nSenate supported these amendments, we have been unable to reach the \nrequired 60 vote supermajority needed to waive the budget point of \norder on emergency spending.\n  Oil companies reported record profits for the third quarter of this \nyear. As oil prices go up, low-income hard working Americans struggle \nto pay their heating bills. That is why fully funding LIHEAP is vital, \nand I believe oil companies should help shoulder the cost through a \ntemporary, one-year windfall profit tax on integrated oil companies.\n  The President also has been silent, failing to ask for any funding \nfor LIHEAP in the supplemental appropriations request he sent to \nCongress. In addition, Energy Secretary Bodman has repeatedly stated \nthat the administration is against a windfall profits tax.\n  The Administration's National Energy Policy Report, the National \nPetroleum Council's report, Balancing Natural Gas Policy, and the \nNational Commission on Energy Policy's report, Ending the Energy \nStalemate, emphasized that energy efficiency is essential to managing \nthe nation's short- and long-term energy challenges. Unfortunately, \ndespite all of the agreement, federal funding for energy efficiency is \nnot keeping pace.\n  In September, Senator Snowe and I wrote a bipartisan letter signed by \n33 of our colleagues urging the Administration to request $500 million \nfor the Weatherization Assistance Program, WAP, and $100 million for \nthe State Energy Program, SEP, in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita. President Bush and Secretary Bodman called on the American people \nto conserve energy and invest in energy efficiency,\n\n[[Page S12748]]\n\nand the American people are responding. I am disappointed that the \nadministration did not seek additional funding for these key programs \nin their supplemental appropriations request.\n  Indeed, SEP helps states implement energy efficiency and energy \nemergency preparedness programs in all sectors of the economy, thereby, \nreducing energy consumption for residential consumers, schools, \nhospitals, the agricultural sector, commercial enterprises, and \nindustry. For every Federal dollar invested in SEP, over $7 is saved in \nenergy costs. SEP funds would immediately be directed to energy \nefficiency projects to bring energy usage down. Instead of our \nbipartisan request of $100 million, the Energy and Water Appropriations \nConference Report provides only $36 million for the program in FY2006. \nThis is almost a 20-percent cut from this year's funding level. This \ncut means States will not be able to provide rebates to homeowners for \nenergy conservation, schools and hospitals will be ill-equipped to \nreduce energy usage, and small business will not receive needed energy \nefficiency upgrades. Basically, every sector of the economy will be \nharmed in the midst of an energy crisis.\n  I hope that the Senate will provide more funding for LIHEAP, SEP, and \nthe weatherization program before the worst of the winter season hits.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today we are voting on the conference \nreport for the 2006 Energy and Water Development appropriations Act. On \nthe whole, the conference report contains many items well worth \nsupporting, including funding for a number of important water and \nenergy projects in New Mexico.\n  Regardless of my support for the report as a whole, I would like to \ntake this opportunity to express my strong concern with a provision \ninserted into the legislation without any debate, and which I believe \nrepresents a setback to sound public policy.\n  Section 121(b) of the bill is a very short provision addressing \nendangered species issues in the Middle Rio Grande in New Mexico. It \namends an existing law enacted in Public Law 108-447 which holds that a \nMarch 2003 biological opinion addressing water operations in the Middle \nRio Grande fully satisfies the requirements of the Endangered Species \nAct, ESA. I had supported the original provision because a thorough \nreview of that biological opinion indicated that it was based on a \ncredible interpretation of the best available science and contained re-\nopeners that ensured the biological opinion would be amended if it \nfailed to meet its objectives.\n  Section 121(b) goes much farther and provides legal protection to any \namendments to the 2003 biological opinion. The result of section 121(b) \nis that Congress will now take the unprecedented step of providing \nlegal protection to the environmental analysis and decisions of a \nFederal agency before we know what the analysis looks like, or have a \nchance to assess the impacts of any decisions. The ESA requires that \nany analysis be based on, and reflect the use of, the best available \nscientific and commercial data. Section 121(b) undermines that \nrequirement and gives the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service a blank check in \nissuing a modified opinion that can have far-reaching impacts to both \nthe environment and the rights of water users in the Middle Rio Grande \nbasin.\n  There are a variety of scenarios that could develop over the next \ndecade necessitating significant changes to the biological opinion. I \nam very uncomfortable with providing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService, or any Federal agency for that matter, unchecked power when it \nhas the potential to significantly impact the rights and interests of \nso many people. Looking at the bigger picture, I am equally disturbed \nthat Congress, by disallowing any opportunity to challenge a Federal \nagency, is now effectively casting aside the use of the best available \nscience as the standard by which environmental analysis and subsequent \ndecisions should be measured. I don't think this represents good public \npolicy.\n  Finally, over the last few years, there has been a commitment by a \ndiverse group of interests in the Middle Rio Grande region to cooperate \non creative approaches to address endangered species needs. The goal of \nthis effort is to balance the need for environmental restoration with a \nrecognition of the need to protect the interests of water users who are \ndependent on the limited supply provided by the Rio Grande. This group, \nwhich includes relevant Federal, State, and local entities, is capable \nof developing workable solutions to any future developments that may \nnecessitate amendments to the 2003 biological opinion. I hope that \nsection 121(b), by eliminating the ability to hold the Federal agencies \nto an objective standard, does not undermine the efforts of this group \nor its collaboration on these issues.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to share my views on the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 2419, the Energy and Water \nappropriations bill. While I support this legislation, I do have \nsignificant reservations about certain provisions of the conference \nreport before the Senate today. Most significantly, I am very \ndisappointed with the funding level included for Hanford Site cleanup.\n  The Federal Government has a legal and moral obligation to cleanup \nthe Hanford site and its nuclear legacy. The President budget sets the \ntone for the appropriations process. I was very concerned when the \nPresident's request slashed funds by more than $290 million from last \nyear levels, jeopardizing compliance with cleanup milestones and \nputting the health and safety of our citizens at risk.\n  Among the most important risk reduction projects are the cleanup and \ntreatment of waste stored in underground storage tanks near the \nColumbia River. At the Hanford site there are 177 underground storage \ntanks containing more than 53 million gallons of radioactive and toxic \nwaste. Sixty-seven of these tanks are known to have leaked, allowing at \nleast 1 million gallons of waste to seep into the soil.\n  Tank waste cleanup is critical to the overall effort in Hanford. I am \nextremely concerned about a recent report from the Department of Energy \nInspector General that found significant problems with the \nadministration's plan for tank waste cleanup in the C-Tank Farm. The \naudit found that the Department of Energy was overly optimistic and \nfailed to account for problems encountered during previous retrieval \noperations.\n  The Department has known since January of this year, before the \npresentation of the President's budget, that the scheduled C-Tank \ncompletion date of September 2006 would likely be missed and project \ncosts would more than double. Falling behind on the C-Tank Farm cleanup \nwill jeopardize long term tank cleanup commitments.\n  Despite those challenges, the Department cut the tank cleanup program \nby $62 million in its fiscal year 2006 request. That request forced \nCongress to work within an incredibly limited budget environment to \nrestore at least some of the funding necessary to keep tank cleanup on \ntrack. Fortunately, we could add $27 million in the conference report.\n  I remain concerned, however, that the Department has yet to publicly \nacknowledge that it will miss the C-Tank Farm Tri Party Agreement \nmilestone, nor has it committed to adequate funding in fiscal year \n2007. I urge the Department of Energy to quickly respond and propose a \nnew appropriate cost estimate and cleanup schedule.\n  In order to fully reduce risk we must have the facilities necessary \nto treat the toxic and radioactive waste from Hanford tanks. The timely \nconstruction of the vitrification plant is critical to reducing risk \nand protecting our citizens. The facility was designed to treat most of \nthe waste removed from the 177 underground tanks before its storage at \nthe Hanford site or a national depository.\n  But in the face of design challenges, the administration's budget cut \nfunding for vitrification plant construction--setting it at $58 million \nless than fiscal year 2005 funding levels. The Department said it \nneeded to reduce funding in order to address the seismic issues with \nthe design of the facility.\n  Despite both Houses of Congress supporting funding levels for the \nvitrification plant at least at the President's request level, this \nconference report reduces funding to $100 million below the already-low \nfiscal year 2006 request. This level of funding would be $158 million \nless than the fiscal year 2005 appropriations level.\n  Remarkably, the President has proposed a rescission of an additional \n$100\n\n[[Page S12749]]\n\nmillion in previously appropriated vitrification plant construction \nfunds to address hurricane recovery efforts. In his letter to the \nCongress, the President labeled plant construction as a lower priority \nFederal program.\n  This cut comes at the same time that the administration has noted \nthat the cost of the vitrification plant has increased by at least 25 \npercent. And language in the underlying report estimates that the cost \nof the plant may rise to $9.3 billion. Yet this administration \ncontinues to cut funding, jeopardizing long-term cleanup milestones.\n  I urge the administration to drop its proposed $100 million \nrescission, set forth a clear cost and schedule for the completion of \nthe vitrification plant, and fund the vitrification plant in a way that \ndoes not jeopardize the health and safety of our region.\n  I do not support the funding levels for Hanford cleanup in this year \nconference report and hope that the administration will make a clear \ncommitment with its fiscal year 2007 request. The Federal Government \nmust keep its commitment. I hope the current administration will back \nits words with clear action.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I appreciate the work that went into the \nbill this year, recognizing how difficult it was given the allocation \nand given the level of support by the administration. I am particularly \nconcerned about some specific levels within the bill, like funding for \nour Nation's environmental management program within the Department of \nEnergy's cleanup responsibilities. Specifically, the Waste Treatment \nPlant, or Vitrification Plant, at the Hanford site is one of those \nnationally important projects. The Hanford site played a critical role \nin support of national security efforts in World War II and the Cold \nWar. As a result, tens of millions of gallons of radioactive waste was \nleft behind. It is the obligation of the U.S. Government to clean up \nthat site and the Department of Energy identified the Vit Plant as the \nflagship project in that cleanup effort.\n  Officials at DOE claim the administration is 100 percent dedicated to \nthe project. Actions speak louder than words. The request for this \nfiscal year was $64 million below necessary funding, according to the \nDepartment's own out-year projections. On top of that, the supplemental \npackage sent to Congress came with rescissions for ``lower-priority'' \nprograms including a $100 million cut for the Vit Plant. How can \ncleaning up one of the most polluted sites in our country be deemed a \nlower priority? Given this lack of support from the administration, I \nunderstand how difficult the project is to defend this year, and \nunderstand the hesitation on the part of this subcommittee to go beyond \nthe official request by this White House.\n  And while the cuts to the funding are deep, and while I have deep \nconcerns about what they will mean for our Nation's commitment to \ncleaning up this dangerous waste, I do concede that it could have been \nworse.\n  I specifically thank Senator Reid and his staff for his last-minute \nassistance in limiting the cuts to the Vit Plant and I thank the \nchairman for being receptive. When I met with Senator Reid last week, \nhe shared my concern for this project, and together we were able to \nfight back additional cuts.\n  I will continue to support the cleanup efforts at the Hanford site.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the fiscal \nyear 2006 Energy and Water appropriations conference report.\n  One of the most important things about this conference report is a \nprogram that it does not fund. The Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator--\nalso known as the ``bunker buster''--is not funded in this bill. I am \nproud that Congress--for the second year in a row--has stated clearly \nand unambiguously that we should not spend taxpayer dollars on this \nprogram. I hope the administration gets the message and does not \nrequest funding for developing this new generation of nuclear weapons \nnext year.\n  This conference report includes $327 million for the National \nIgnition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. This \nfunding means that construction of the National Ignition Facility, NIF, \ncan continue. When it is completed in a few years, the NIF will help \nkeep the United States nuclear weapons stockpile reliable, without \nfacing the dangers of underground nuclear testing. A completed NIF is a \nkey component of the National Nuclear Security Administration's \nStockpile Stewardship Program to maintain the safety, reliability, and \neffectiveness of our Nation's nuclear stockpile. There are also many \nCalifornia-specific needs met in this bill. city\n  I am pleased that the conference report provides $37 million for the \nFederal-State partnership for California Bay-Delta Restoration, CalFed. \nThe CalFed reauthorization took considerable effort on the part of many \nin Congress, but that effort has paid off, in this, the first \nauthorized CalFed appropriations in 5 years. I am grateful to Senator \nDomenici and Senator Reid for providing $2 million over the President's \nBudget request for this program in the Senate bill and I am pleased \nthat this allocation was maintained in conference with the House.\n  These funds will contribute to the much needed improvement of \nCalifornia's water supply infrastructure and protection of aquatic \necosystems. Among the elements of a balanced CalFed program that are in \nprogress are feasibility studies on the enlargement of several \nreservoirs, improved water conveyance, ecosystem restoration, and water \nquality projects. The improvements we make to California's water \ninfrastructure now will head off a supply crisis with water, similar to \nthe one we faced with energy a few years ago.\n  This conference report inc1udes funding for specific flood control \npriorities in California. My State faces a number of significant flood \nthreats. The city of Sacramento, the surrounding areas like Marysville \nand Rancho Cordova, and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta face some of \nthe greatest flood danger in the Nation. Currently, much of Sacramento \nis below 100-year flood protection. This legislation allocates $39 \nmillion to improve flood control in Sacramento and provides funding to \nensure that other regional flood control projects are ready to go to \nconstruction next year.\n  While the funds in this bill are a good start, I will continue to \nseek additional funding to protect the Sacramento metropolitan area \nfrom catastrophic flooding.\n  The conference report also includes $5 million for Upper Newport Bay \nRestoration. Upper Newport Bay is the largest functioning full tidal \nwetland in southern California. However, the bay's ability to sustain \nwildlife is threatened due to decades of increasing sedimentation \nrelated to rapid urbanization of the watershed. As a result, open water \nareas are disappearing in the bay, tidal circulation has diminished, \nand shoaling is occurring within Federal and local navigation channels \nand slips. This project will restore degraded habitat and reestablish \nwetland and wildlife habitat areas.\n  I am also pleased that the conference report includes $61.65 million, \n$11.65 million above the President's Budget request, for the Santa Ana \nRiver Mainstem Project. These funds will construct flood control \nimprovements to protect over 3 million people in Orange, Riverside, and \nSan Bernardino counties.\n  One issue that concerns me in this conference report is a requirement \nfor the Bureau of Reclamation to complete a special report to update \nthe analysis of costs and associated benefits of the Auburn Dam on the \nAmerican River. I am concerned that the reporting requirements do not \ninclude an updated assessment of the risks of an earthquake, risks that \nare serious enough to have caused the termination of earlier work on \nthe Auburn Dam in 1975.\n  I again want to express my congratulations to Chairman Domenici and \nSenator Reid and want to thank them for the level of support given to \nCalifornia in this conference report.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the U.S. is to remain competitive \nand keep pace with its growing energy demands, then we must take stock, \nas a nation, of our energy security, economic growth, and environmental \nprotection and make these issues top national priorities. We cannot \nachieve greater energy security with our continued, piece-meal efforts. \nIt is time to devote new innovation and ingenuity to energy policy and \nblaze a path forward. We must strive to be free\n\n[[Page S12750]]\n\nof the chains of foreign oil. To do that, we must seriously invest in \nthe energy resources that we have here at home, and coal should be at \nthe heart of that effort.\n  The Energy Policy Act of 2005, which I supported and which was signed \nby the President in August 2005, made many promises to the country on \nenergy policy. To make good on those promises, the administration must \nbe willing to put financial support behind these initiatives. Will this \nadministration do so in subsequent budget requests for the clean coal \nand many other important energy programs?\n  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is only a way station on a long journey \nand more work remains ahead. It is a start, and I am committed to \ncontinuing to work toward that goal. Yet I continue to be concerned \nabout this administration's commitment to funding fossil energy \nresearch, especially because new clean coal and other energy programs \nwere authorized in the Energy bill. There is only so much blood that \none can squeeze out of a turnip. So where are we going to find the \nfunding for these new programs?\n  In related matters, H.R. 2419, the fiscal year 2006 Energy and Water \nConference Report provides sufficient funding for the fossil energy \nresearch and development, R, programs for the Department of Energy, \nDOE. But this effort requires a much more sustained and increased \ncommitment in future years if this Nation is to be successful in going \nbeyond an incremental approach toward new breakthroughs on the use of \nfossil energy resources. In this conference report, I worked to ensure \nthat there was adequate funding for coal R at the National Energy \nTechnology Laboratory, the Nation's premier Fossil Energy Laboratory.\n  In addition to coal, other energy research investments that must not \nbe overlooked are within the oil and natural gas R programs. Oil and \nnatural gas provide 60 percent of America's energy needs, and demand \nfor both will continue to rise, resulting in significant price \nincreases. By 2025, U.S. reliance on fossil fuels is expected to grow \nfrom the current 85 percent to 90 percent. But the administration's \nbudget proposal for oil and natural gas technology R for fiscal year \n2006 was reduced by 75 percent from fiscal year 2005 levels. The \nadministration's fiscal year 2006 budget request was $20 million for \nboth programs. The funds were to be used to conclude the oil and \nnatural gas programs. The DOE's R spending for oil and natural gas \nhas consistently ranked at the bottom of the scale. If the United \nStates is to maintain its ability to produce its domestic supplies for \noil and natural gas at a reasonable cost to consumers, then Federal \nexpenditures on R must fill some of the void left by the private \nsector, primarily independent producers.\n  Furthermore, how is this administration going to fund FutureGen when \nit has not been able to provide adequate and sustained funding for \nother fossil energy programs? The fiscal year 2006 Energy and Water \nConference Report provides the $18 million for FutureGen that the \nadministration has requested. However, even larger funding requests are \ngoing to be required if this initiative is to move forward according to \nits schedule. I stand behind the agreement reached in the conference \nreport, but the Congress will consider its FutureGen requests \ncontingent upon the Administration maintaining adequate funding for \nother clean coal and fossil energy programs.\n  When there are so many other unmet fossil energy funding needs, I \ncannot and will not support the transfer of monies from the clean coal \ntechnology account to a FutureGen account. In fiscal year 2007 and \nbeyond, I will not support the transfer of any moneys, in whole or in \npart, to the FutureGen initiative that are not a part of the \nadministration's request unless and until other critical fossil energy \nprograms are fully funded. This is simply robbing Peter to pay Paul and \nmasks the underlying problem of continued inadequate funding \ncommitments for the fossil energy programs by this administration. \nThere are other fossil energy programs that have equal, if not greater, \nfunding needs.\n  Additionally, the Clean Coal Power Initiative, CCPI, is a program \nthat was initiated in 2001, to demonstrate the economically and \nenvironmentally acceptable use of coal. The CCPI was the successor to \nthe long and successful Clean Coal Technology Program that I initiated \nin 1985. The CCPI program, if pursued, will continue to lead to the \nsuccessful development of a set of coal-based technologies that will be \ncost effective and highly efficient and achieve greater control of air \nand water emissions compared to currently available technology.\n  President Bush committed to funding the CCPI program during his first \ncampaign speech made in West Virginia in 2000. The President pledged to \nprovide $2 billion over 10 years for this program, yet the \nadministration's budget requests have not met that goal. Over a period \nof 5 years, the President has requested a total of approximately $530 \nmillion, including only $50 million this year. This is barely more than \nhalf of the funding pledged to the program. A great deal more funding \nwill be required in fiscal year 2007 and beyond if the program is to \nremain on a schedule consistent with the President's commitment.\n  The DOE is in the practice of issuing a solicitation every other year \nand has done so twice to date. This practice has been required in order \nto collect enough appropriations for a single solicitation. While I am \nfully aware of the fiscal limits we currently face and the immense \npressure on the budget, it is crucial that the CCPI reach the necessary \nfunding level in order to initiate a solicitation in fiscal year 2007. \nThe fiscal year 2007 CCPI budget request must be substantially higher \nthan the fiscal year 2006 request in order to maintain a schedule of \nsolicitations every second year, and I strongly encourage the \nadministration to submit a request in an amount sufficient to initiate \na third CCPI solicitation in fiscal year 2007.\n  Finally, the Office of Fossil Energy has been lacking in leadership \nfor far too long. There remains a strong team in place, along with a \nnew director, at the National Energy Technology Laboratory, but that \nmust be matched with a strong Fossil Energy Assistant Secretary. This \nposition has now been vacant for at least 20 months. This post should \nbe filled by someone who can bring strong technical, policy, and \nmanagerial experience and who can work well with a variety of \nconstituencies.\n  In conclusion, I would like to thank Senators Domenici and Reid for \ntheir leadership and assistance on this conference report. I would also \nlike to thank Senator Domenici's staff Scott O'Malia, Roger Cockrell, \nand Emily Brunini as well as Senator Reid's staff, Drew Willison and \nNancy Olkewicz for their hard work. This is the first year that fossil \nenergy R programs were included in the Energy and Water \nAppropriations bill. This is a good conference report given the very \ntough fiscal circumstances that we faced. I have urged Senators \nDomenici and Reid to give greater oversight and scrutiny to the \nadministration's fossil energy requests and look forward to working \nwith them on this important matter next year. Because our Nation's \nenergy security is so important, the fossil energy R programs, \nespecially the clean coal programs, require strong support. I will \nremain ever watchful and strongly supportive of them in the coming \nyears.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nwish to inform Senators that when we return to the bill, I know the \ndistinguished colleague from Michigan and I are going to debate the two \namendments that are pending relating to Iraq, one submitted by this \nside of the aisle and one by that side of the aisle, and then such \ndiscussions as the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from \nMichigan may have on the habeas corpus issue, will that be dealt with \nat all tonight?\n  Mr. LEVIN.

The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We should again put our colleagues on notice that there is \nvery limited time tomorrow morning under the unanimous consent \nagreement. There was an effort made to extend that time. The effort did \nnot succeed. So there will literally be 30 minutes tomorrow morning \nequally divided between both Iraq amendments and the habeas corpus \nmatter, which is a very small window of time tomorrow morning. We would \nurge, I think my good friend from Virginia would agree, that the \nSenators who wish to speak on either of those matters should make a \nreal effort to get here tonight.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would only say let us not leave the \nimpression that this side of the aisle is rushing to judgment. This \nframework of votes and amendments were carefully worked out on Thursday \nevening. The Senate has been in session since 2 today. There has been \nquite a bit of activity and opportunity for Senators to speak. I \nrepeat, we are going to continue on shortly after our two colleagues \nfinish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Hawaii will be recognized for 5 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/14/senate-section/article/S12751-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN HONOR OF NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate one of the most \nimportant books in the history of mankind: the Bible. As the Senate \ncochairman of the 2005 National Bible Week, it is my honor to join the \nNational Bible Association and our Nation's citizens in celebrating the \nGood Book and its teachings. During the week of November 20 to 27, I \nencourage everyone to participate in this fine tradition by reading and \nreflecting on the important lessons of the Bible.\n  As a child growing up in Hawaii, my parents introduced me to the \nBible and it has always played an important role in my life. I turn to \nit on a regular basis in search of inspiration, guidance and strength. \nThe Bible is a resource of profound but fundamental truths that retain \nrelevance throughout the ages. They are the lessons that serve as the \nbuilding blocks of good citizens, good families, good communities and \ngood government.\n  One of my favorite scriptures in the Bible teaches us that God loved \nus so that He sent us His only begotten Son so that we might live \nthrough Him. Because God so loved us, we ought also to love one another \nand His love will be perfected in us. In this time of international \nstrife, natural disaster, and political turmoil, this basic instinct of \ncaring for our fellow man, of love for our neighbor, is a good place to \nbegin.\n  The Holy Bible is one of man's greatest legacies. I congratulate and \ncommend the National Bible Association for its efforts to promote the \nGood Book and to encourage better understanding of its universal truths \namong people of all faiths. Aloha ke Akua. God is love.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is the understanding of the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan and myself that the Senator from \nMinnesota has a period of time to speak with regard to the bill. Is \nthat our understanding?\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then the distinguished Senator from South Carolina \ndesires to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan relative to the amendments by the Senator from South Carolina. \nAm I not correct on that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. If he is ready, I am happy to proceed.\n  Mr. WARNER. That will immediately follow the remarks of Senator \nDayton.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I don't want to deceive the chairman. My remarks are \nrelated to the remarks of last Veterans Day rather than the bill \ndirectly. I ask either that be accommodated or I speak as in morning \nbusiness for a period of up to 12 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are in a period of morning business. The Senator is in \nno way restricted in what he wishes to address. We thought it was \nrelated to the bill, but whatever he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota will be recognized \nto speak as in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/14/senate-section/article/S12751-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12751-S12752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, last Friday, on Veterans Day, President \nBush attacked those of us who questioned or criticized his conduct of \nthe Iraq war. Once again, he tried to portray his critics as opposing \nour own troops or aiding their enemies. Once again, he was wrong. Once \nagain, he tried to blame others for his mistakes and for the failures \nof his policies--mistakes and failures that have trapped 158,000 of \nAmerica's best and bravest soldiers in Iraq for over 2\\1/2\\ years, \nsince the fall of Saddam Hussein, with no end in sight.\n  Let's be clear that every person in this Senate supports our troops \n1,000 percent. We provided every dollar requested for defense \nauthorizations, appropriations, and supplementals with overwhelming \nbipartisan and often unanimous support. Some of us have tried to \nprovide more funding than the administration would support for our\n\n[[Page S12752]]\n\nreturning troops and veterans. We have never accused them of being \nagainst our troops or un-American.\n  Together, on the Senate Armed Services Committee on which I am proud \nto sit, Republicans and Democrats have repeatedly asked our civilian \nand military commanders: What more do you need to win this war as soon \nas possible? What do you need to bring our troops home as safely and \nquickly as possible, with the victory that they won in 3 weeks in the \nspring of 2003 secured, finally, by the Iraqis? Tell us what you need, \nand it is yours.\n  This Senate has not failed our troops. This Senator, a critic of your \npolicies, has not failed our troops. You, sir, have failed our troops; \nand you, sir, have failed the American people by the failures of your \npolicies in Iraq.\n  Last Friday, President Bush stood in front of a banner that said: \n``Strategy For Victory.'' Two and a half years ago, he stood on the \naircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln before a banner: ``Mission \nAccomplished.'' Unfortunately, he had the banners mixed up. If he had a \n``Strategy For Victory'' 2\\1/2\\ years ago, we would have ``Mission \nAccomplished'' today.\n  The President accuses his critics of rewriting the history of this \nwar. Nonsense. The history of this war was clearly enunciated by this \nadministration and is available for all to reread. The President, the \nVice President, and their top advisers repeatedly presented their \nrationales for this war and predicted its outcomes, and they were \nrepeatedly wrong. On just about everything, they were wrong. I say that \nwith sorrow because when the President of the United States is wrong, \nall Americans suffer the consequences.\n  There is no better or worse summary of the administration's prewar \nfallacies than the transcript of Vice President Cheney's appearance on \n``Meet The Press'' with Tim Russert the Sunday before the invasion \nbegan. I excerpted those remarks for brevity but without altering their \nmeaning.\n  The Vice President said on the program, as he had said repeatedly \nduring the past 7 months:\n\n       We believe Saddam Hussein has in fact reconstituted nuclear \n     weapons.\n       We know he's out trying once again to produce nuclear \n     weapons and we know he has a longstanding relationship with \n     various terrorist groups, including the al-Qaida \n     organization.\n\n  When Mr. Russert queried:\n\n       And even though the International Atomic Energy Agency said \n     he does not have a nuclear program, we disagree?\n\n  Vice President Cheney replied:\n\n       I disagree, yes. . . .We believe he has, in fact, \n     reconstituted nuclear weapons. I think Mr. ElBaradei frankly \n     is wrong.\n       Mr. Russert: If your analysis is not correct, and we're not \n     treated as liberators, but as conquerors, and the Iraqis \n     begin to resist, particularly in Baghdad, do you think the \n     American people are prepared for a long, costly, and bloody \n     battle with significant American casualties?\n       Vice President Cheney: Well, I don't think it's likely to \n     unfold that way, Tim, because I really do believe that we \n     will be greeted as liberators. I've talked with a lot of \n     Iraqis in the last several months myself, had them to the \n     White House. . . . The read we get on the people of Iraq is \n     there is no question but what they want to get rid of Saddam \n     Hussein and they will welcome as liberators the United States \n     when we come to do that.\n       Mr. Russert: The army's top general said that we would have \n     to have several hundred thousand troops there for several \n     years in order to maintain stability.\n       Vice President Cheney: I disagree. . . . But to suggest \n     that we need several hundred thousand troops there after \n     military operations cease, after the conflict ends, I don't \n     think is accurate. I think that's an overstatement.\n       Mr. Russert: We have had 50,000 troops in Kosovo for \n     several years, a country of just five million people. This is \n     a country of 23 million people. It will take a lot in order \n     to secure it.\n       Vice President Cheney: . . . There's no question but what \n     we'll have to have a presence there for a period of time. \n     It is difficult now to specify how long. We will clearly \n     want to take on responsibilities in addition to conducting \n     military operations and eliminating Saddam Hussein's \n     regime. We need to be prepared to provide humanitarian \n     assistance, medical care, food, all of those other things \n     that are required to have Iraq up and running again. And \n     we are well-equipped to do that. We have got a lot of \n     effort that's gone into that.\n       Mr. Russert: Every analysis said this war itself would cost \n     over $80 billion, recovery of Baghdad, perhaps of Iraq, about \n     $10 billion per year. We should expect as American citizens \n     that this would cost at least $100 billion for a two-year \n     involvement.\n       Vice President Cheney: I can't say that, Tim. . . . In Iraq \n     you've got a nation that's got the second-largest oil \n     reserves in the world, second only to Saudi Arabia. It will \n     generate billions of dollars a year in cash flow if they get \n     back to their production of roughly three million barrels of \n     oil a day, in the relatively near future.\n\n  On every one of those key assertions, Vice President Cheney was \nwrong. Whether he was misinformed, misguided, mistaken, or knowingly \nmisleading the American people, I cannot say. I can say that he was \nconsistently wrong. And because he and the President were wrong, over \n2,000 of our best and bravest Americans have lost their lives in Iraq. \nMany thousands more have returned home wounded or maimed for life. \nHundreds of thousands more have been separated from their families for \nyears, with more separations for more years still to come.\n  Because the Bush administration's assumptions and expectations were \nwrong, because their preparations for post-Saddam Hussein Iraq were \nwrong, and because their predictions before and after the war began \nwere wrong, America's standing in the world is worse than before. The \nterrorist organizations that hate the United States are stronger than \nbefore, and our national security is tragically and terribly weaker \nthan before this war began.\n  When I voted against the Iraq war resolution in October of 2002, I \nsaid I hoped I was wrong and the war's proponents were right because \nthe stakes were too high for partisanship. When I disagreed with \nPresident Bush's decision to invade Iraq in March of 2003, I said I \nhoped I was wrong and he was right because the stakes were too high for \nanything but patriotism.\n  I deeply regret when he has been wrong. I deeply regret the mistakes \nof his policies and the failures of his practices because a President's \nmistakes and failures become America's mistakes and failures. And \nAmerica, the greatest Nation on Earth, the leader of the world's hopes \nand opportunities for peace and prosperity, America cannot afford \nmistakes and failures in this difficult and dangerous world, and this \nworld cannot afford America's mistakes and failures.\n  Two and a half years after our troops toppled Saddam Hussein is too \nlong for 158,000 of Americas's soldiers, the world's best and bravest, \nto still be doing the patroling, the policing, the fighting, the \nbleeding, and the dying in Iraq--too long, and there is no end in \nsight. It is because we support our troops, because they are our sons \nand daughters and we love them, that we want to bring them home safely \nas soon as possible with their military successes of 2\\1/2\\ years ago \nsecured by Iraqis, not Americans.\n  The President and the Vice President could show their support for our \ntroops by telling them and us what the strategy for victory in Iraq \nreally is and how and when we will achieve it and what are the \ntimetables and measures of that success or lack of it so our courageous \nfighting men and women and their families and their fellow Americans \ncan know how they will win, when they will win. Those are the answers \nthey and we deserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, at this time I would like to, in \nconjunction with my colleague Senator Levin, lay down this amendment, \ngive a brief explanation of what it is designed to do, and I think we \nwill vote on it tomorrow after we vote on Senator Bingaman's amendment.\n  No. 1, Senator Levin and his staff have been working on this, along \nwith Senator Kyl and other Senators, for the last couple of days. I do \nnot know how to say it other than it has been a lot of fun. It has been \ntough at times, but I think we have come out with a product that the \nSenate can be proud of, and hopefully the country can be proud of when \nit comes to how to treat detainees at Guantanamo Bay.\n  Here is what we are trying to do. With my amendment, which we voted \non last week, the concern I had was we were about to criminalize the \nwar because of the Rasul case. Section 2241 of the habeas statute had \nbeen interpreted not to prohibit foreign alien enemy terror suspects \nfrom seeking habeas petitions in Federal court about their confinement \nand detainment as enemy combatants. The Rasul case was the result of \nthe Supreme Court rejecting the Government's argument that Guantanamo \nBay was outside the jurisdiction of the Federal court. They ruled that \nGuantanamo Bay was constructively within the jurisdiction of the \nFederal court, and in that opinion basically challenged the Congress.\n  Now that we have decided that, since there are no due process rights \nin place at the time, we are going to provide habeas petitions to these \ndetainees until Congress comes in and says otherwise.\n  My amendment was, Congress being on record that the 2241 habeas \nstatute has been used to provide habeas corpus rights by Congress to \nAmerican citizens, that we do not intend for an enemy combatant or \nforeign national--someone captured in conflict against the United \nStates--to have habeas rights before our Federal courts to complain \nabout their confinement and their detention. In other words, we are not \ngoing to allow enemy prisoners of war the right to go into civilian \ncourt and start challenging their detention. The military commissions \nare operating at Guantanamo Bay with a different purpose. They are \ngoing to try people who are charged with violations of the law. Right \nnow there are about 10 or 15 cases. There are almost 500 people who are \nbeing detained as enemy combatants. Last week, when Senator Levin was \narguing with me about my amendment, I think he made some very good \npoints. By working with him and others, Senator Kyl and others, we have \naddressed some of the weaknesses in my original amendment. Senator \nBingaman will have another amendment, and I think we deal with some of \nhis concerns, too. I do see this as a win-win.\n  What we are trying to do, instead of changing what has been the rule \nof law for 200 years in terms of enemy prisoner rights, is create a \nprocess that not only mirrors the Geneva Convention but goes well \nbeyond the Geneva Convention.\n  An enemy combatant is a legal term of art. It applies to those people \ninvolved in hostilities against the United\n\n[[Page S12754]]\n\nStates but are not part of a Geneva Convention-recognized Army. The \nGeneva Convention uses the term ``irregular combatant.'' We have case \nlaw in the United States talking about enemy combatant. It deals with \nGerman saboteurs; those people who commit hostilities are engaged in \nacts of war but shed the cloak of being part of a uniformed force. So \nthe term ``enemy combatant'' has been well recognized in our law.\n  What we do with an enemy combatant, once a person has been determined \nto be an enemy combatant, we can detain them similar to a prisoner of \nwar. The Geneva Convention says if there is a question about whether a \nperson's status is rightfully conferred whether you are a prisoner of \nwar, enemy combatant, irregular combatant, or a civilian who has done \nnothing wrong, the Geneva Convention requires the host country to have \na competent tribunal set up to determine status.\n  Since August of 2004, at Guantanamo, the Combatant Status Review \nTribunal system has been in place. In my opinion, it is Geneva \nConvention article 5 tribunals on steroids. It gives a right to \nconfront. It gives adversarial process to the suspected enemy \ncombatant. It also allows a yearly review of an enemy combatant status. \nWhat they are looking at, at Guantanamo Bay, is whether a person was \nengaged in hostile acts against the United States in a regular fashion, \nwhether the person has intelligence value to the United States or poses \na threat. If one or two of those three conditions are met, they can be \ndetained at Guantanamo Bay, and every year there is a reevaluation.\n  We have had some people caught up in the net, and we found later \nprobably did not have all three requirements and they have been let go. \nWe have also had about a dozen people caught up in the net in the war \non terror who we thought were no longer a threat to the United States. \nWe released them and a dozen at least have gone back to fighting. Some \nhave been killed. Some have been captured yet again.\n  The process we use is important, but no process is perfect. We are \ntrying to come up with a process the country can be proud of that \napplies the law of armed conflict standard and does not turn the war on \nterror into a crime. Right now every person sent to Guantanamo Bay will \nbe offered a Combatant Status Review Tribunal hearing, which is well \nbeyond what the Geneva Convention requires, to determine their status.\n  In addition to the yearly review, working with Senator Levin, Senator \nKyl, and others, we have come up with a right of every enemy combatant \nto go to Federal court. Instead of having unlimited habeas corpus \nopportunities under the Constitution, we give every enemy combatant, \nall 500, a chance to go to Federal court, the Circuit Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia. On top of everything else we are doing, \nthey can challenge their status determination in a Federal court. The \nFederal court will look at the process involved in their individual \ncase to see if it complied with the CSRT standards in terms of \nprocedure and the standards that were to be used to determine whether a \nperson was properly detained--the evidentiary standards, all other \nstandards.\n  This will allow a Federal court oversight of any combatant status. It \nwill be a one-time deal. It will not be an opportunity for the enemy \nprisoner to sue us about everything they can think of.\n  Now, that to me is unprecedented. That is well beyond what the Geneva \nConvention requires or envisions but is something we ought to do and we \ncan be proud of because it is a Federal court oversight of a military \naction in a way that doesn't erode the military's ability to conduct a \nwar. We can go to other people in the world and say, Our courts are now \ninvolved in looking at what we do. We can also say that Congress is \nfinally involved because in addition to the rights I have described, \nunder our amendment, the person who determines whether an enemy \ncombatant is retained or released will be confirmed by the Senate. That \nwill give the Senate a connection to what is going on in Guantanamo \nBay.\n  If you change the CSRT regulations in any way, you have to send those \nchanges to the Congress. That way we are involved. And we have a \nstatement in our bill to make sure you do not use statements that were \na result of undue coercion to determine if you are an enemy combatant.\n  So now we have Congress involved in an oversight function. We have \nthe courts involved in oversight function. We have a due process right \nwell beyond the Geneva Convention requirements. That is something we \nshould be proud of.\n  Military commissions. There are 10 or 20 people potentially facing a \nmilitary commission trial for what are violations of law of armed law \nconflict. The flaw in my amendment is it did not have a right of appeal \nfrom a military commission verdict to a Federal court. In World War II, \nthe enemy saboteurs I described before were all tried by military \ncommissions that President Roosevelt created by Executive order. Four \nof the six were sentenced to death. The Supreme Court reviewed the \nmilitary commission process in the Quirin case and found that military \ncommissions were lawful if the person being tried was truly an enemy \ncombatant. So there is a historical precedent in our country for the \nFederal courts, the Supreme Court, to look at military commission \ntrials to make sure they are lawfully constituted.\n  What we have done, working with Senators Levin, Kyl, and others, we \nhave created that same type appeal process for all military commission \ndecisions. Under the amendment that we have come up with, any case \nresulting in a capital punishment finding--any person who is given the \ndeath penalty by the military commission--has an automatic direct right \nof appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nand the court will determine if they were tried in a court up to the \nmilitary commission standards and procedures and whether the military \ncommission was constitutional.\n  Anyone who receives a sentence of 10 years or more will also have an \nautomatic right to appeal the same court. If you receive a sentence \nless than 10 years, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia will determine whether they want to hear your case based on a \npetition for certiorari or something akin to it.\n  That, in essence, is what we are trying to do. In both instances, the \nCSRT procedures and the military commission procedures will be reviewed \nby Federal courts and the court will have the ability to determine \nwhether they are constitutional and will have an ability in an \nindividual case to determine whether the enemy combatant or the person \ntried under the military commission procedures will be reviewed by \nFederal courts to decide whether they are constitutional according to \nthe rules and procedures that have been set up.\n\n  I defer to my friend and colleague, Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from South Carolina for working on this \nmatter as hard as he has. The Senator from Arizona has also worked \nhard. Many Members on this side have worked on this issue as well as \nthe Republican side. There is a lot of thought that has been given to \nthis matter.\n  The amendment approved last Thursday had some real problems with it, \nin my judgment, and I voted against it, as did 41 Senators. The \namendment which was approved last Thursday, which is the one now \nawaiting this amendment, would have provided for review only for status \ndeterminations and not of convictions by military commissions.\n  As my friend from South Carolina pointed out, that is an omission \nwhich he and others acknowledge. It is a real indication of his \ncommitment to try to figure out what the right course of action is, \nthat he does acknowledge that omission. One of the reasons I voted \nagainst the amendment last Thursday is that it did not provide for that \ndirect judicial review of convictions by military commissions. That is \nthe major change in the amendment before the Senate, the so-called \nGraham-Levin-Kyl amendment which is before the Senate.\n  There are a number of other changes as well, but of all the changes, \nwhat this amendment does is add to the Graham amendment, which was \nagreed to last Thursday, adds a direct appeal for convictions by \nmilitary commissions--not just for status determinations--and that \ndirect appeal would, of course, go to a Federal court.\n\n[[Page S12755]]\n\n  The amendment which we are going to consider tomorrow morning, after \nwe consider the Bingaman amendment, will also provide for review of \nwhether the standards and procedures which are referred to in the \namendment are consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates. Those are important words because all Members believe we must \noperate according to our Constitution. Our laws and the review which is \nprovided for now, if we agree to this amendment to the adopted Graham \namendment, would explicitly make it clear that the review of a court \nwould look at whether standards and procedures that have been agreed to \nare consistent with our Constitution and our laws.\n  The other problem which I focused on last Thursday with the first \nGraham amendment was that it would have stripped all the courts, \nincluding the Supreme Court, of jurisdiction over pending cases. What \nwe have done in this amendment, we have said that the standards in the \namendment will be applied in pending cases, but the amendment will not \nstrip the courts of jurisdiction over those cases. For instance, the \nSupreme Court jurisdiction in Hamdan is not affected.\n  However, what our amendment does, as soon as it is enacted and the \nenactment is effective, it provides that the standards we set forth in \nour amendment will be the substantive standards which we would expect \nwould be applied in all cases, including cases which are pending as of \nthe effective date of this amendment.\n  We will first vote on the Bingaman amendment tomorrow. I will vote \nfor that amendment. It does preserve some habeas corpus review of \nconstitutional issues relative to the detention of enemy combatants at \nGuantanamo Bay. It avoids habeas corpus review of less consequential \nissues, while enumerating the important issues which it would provide \nor permit habeas review of.\n  However, I cosponsored the Graham amendment with Senator Graham \nbecause I believe it is a significant improvement over the provision \nwhich the Senate approved last Thursday, specifically for the two main \nreasons I identified. The direct review will provide for convictions by \nthe military commissions, and because it would not strip courts of \njurisdiction over these matters where they have taken jurisdiction, it \ndoes, again, apply the substantive law and assume that the courts would \napply the substantive law if this amendment is agreed to. However, it \ndoes not strip the courts of jurisdiction.\n  My friend from South Carolina has pointed out what the scope of the \nreview would be if this amendment was agreed to. I will read something \nwhich he made reference to that is important it be very clear as to \nwhat this grant of review is on page 6, paragraph B:\n\n       (i) with respect to a capital case in which the alien was \n     sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 10 years or more, \n     shall be as of right; or\n       (ii) with respect to any other case, shall be at the \n     discretion of the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia Circuit.\n\n  The scope of review is set forth. It gets the Congress back into the \nbusiness of laying out the ground rules for these reviews, which has \nbeen the main goal of the Senator from South Carolina. It is a goal \nwhich I hope all share. We may disagree as to what the ground rules \nare, but I hope all Members share in that goal that Congress become \nreinvolved in setting the ground rules for both the commissions and for \nthe tribunals which make the status determinations.\n  Again, it has been a very constructive effort on the part of Senator \nGraham, myself, Senator Kyl, and others who cosponsored and will vote \nfor this. It makes a significant improvement over what the Senate did \nlast Thursday. Again, I as one Senator will first support the Bingaman \namendment, but if it is not agreed to, I will strongly urge our \ncolleagues to vote for the Graham-Kyl amendment.\n  I support my friend from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, my hope is, as Senator Levin indicated, we \nare all doing this because we believe Congress has a role in this war. \nThe executive branch has the job to lay the battle plans in place and \nto go after the enemy and be the Commander in Chief. But the Congress \nregulates captives of land and sea. The Congress is involved in issues \nabout the detention, interrogation, and prosecution of enemy combatants \nand those who are trying to do harm to the country.\n  My goal over the last week was to do two things: get the Congress \ninvolved and for us to start thinking, what do we want, as a nation, to \nhappen in this war now and down the road? What do we want to happen to \nthe Sheik Mohammeds and people such as he? Do we want them to be common \ncriminals? No. We want them to be people considered under the law of \narmed conflict.\n  My amendment last week was a direct result of what I think was a \ngrowing problem for our country. Section 2241 habeas rights were being \nexercised by noncitizen, foreign terrorist suspects to the point they \nwere flooding our courts. They were bringing lawsuits.\n  I will give you an example. One Canadian detainee, who threw a \ngrenade that killed an Army medic in a firefight and who comes from a \nfamily with longstanding al-Qaida ties, moved for a preliminary \ninjunction forbidding the interrogation of him or engaging in ``cruel, \ninhuman, or degrading'' treatment of him.\n  In other words, he wanted the judge to come in and stop his \ninterrogation before it started and to sit there basically and \nsupervise it.\n  Another al-Qaida detainee complained about basic security procedures, \nthe speed of mail delivery and medical treatment. He was seeking an \norder that he be transferred to the ``least onerous conditions'' at \nGitmo and asking the court to order that Gitmo allow him to keep any \nbooks and reading materials sent to him and to ``report to the Court'' \non ``his opportunities for exercise, communication, recreation, \nworship, etc.''\n  As I said last week, we never allowed enemy prisoners to go into \ncivilian courts and ask judges to come over and take over the military \nprison in a time of war.\n  The Nazis did not get that right in World War II. We had plenty of \nNazi prisoners housed in military prisoners all over the United States. \nThey were not able to go to Federal court and complain about the books \nand the DVDs--they didn't have DVDs then--whatever they were asking \nfor.\n  There is an ``emergency'' motion seeking a court order requiring \nGitmo to set aside its normal security policies and show detainees DVDs \nthat are purported to be family videos.\n  There is another lawsuit wanting the lawyer to have Internet access \nat Guantanamo Bay. That is what I objected to. This is not the law of \narmed conflict being applied. This is giving an enemy prisoner a right \nthat no enemy prisoner has ever enjoyed before in the law of armed \nconflict. It was creating litigation against our troops.\n  There was one medical malpractice claim. There are over 40 cases \nsuing for monetary damages. Can you imagine, after 9/11, if the Senate \nwere asked the question, Do you want an al-Qaida suspect who is \ncaptured to be able to go into Federal court, in unlimited fashion, and \nbring lawsuits against our own troops for their behavior? The answer is \nno.\n  But Senator Levin was right. The military commission, part of it is \nwritten in a way without a direct appeal to Federal courts. There is \nhistorical precedent for doing it in-house, but there is a Supreme \nCourt review precedent. So I am willing to take that part of the \namendment that was not really the focus of the lawsuit abuse and come \nup with a compromise the country should be proud of.\n  Now, as to Senator Bingaman's attempt to strike my language, I will \nvote against Senator Bingaman's amendment, and I will urge all those \nwho voted for me last time to stand with me. Senator Bingaman is trying \nto create a right to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals for all enemy \ncombatants to bring habeas petitions similar to an American citizen, \nnot what we have done in our amendment but a true habeas petition under \nsection 2241.\n  The question is, Does the Congress want al-Qaida members to have \nhabeas rights similar to American citizens? I say no. Senator Bingaman \nallows that right to still exist. He addressed some of the concerns I \nraised. He says the\n\n[[Page S12756]]\n\nhabeas petition cannot consider claims based on living conditions. \nBecause I have described how outrageous these claims are--about the \nexercise regime, the reading materials--most Americans would be highly \noffended to know that terrorists are suing us in our own courts about \nwhat they read.\n  He has two exceptions, however. They can still bring habeas lawsuits \nsimilar to an American citizen, ``whether such status determination was \nsupported by sufficient evidence and reached in accordance with due \nprocess of law, provided that statements obtained through undue \ncoercion, torture, or cruel or inhuman treatment may not be used as a \nbasis for the determination; and (C) the lawfulness of the detention of \nsuch alien.''\n  The reason I am going to vote no on the Bingaman amendment is that \nthese exceptions--the lawfulness of the detention of such alien--would \nallow a court, if they chose, to look at every condition of the enemy \nprisoner's life and do, again, what we are trying to prevent, that you \ncould go into Federal court and start asking for a Federal judge to \nintervene in your interrogation before it even starts. My belief is the \nmilitary is the best group to run the war, not Federal judges.\n  So I am going to oppose Senator Bingaman's amendment because it \npreserves habeas rights for noncitizen, foreign terrorists to come into \nFederal court at the District Court of Appeals, DC Court of Appeals, to \nput a wide variety of issues on the table. I do not think that is good \nfor us. I do not think it is good for the war.\n  Now, I will vote with Senator Levin on our comprehensive package when \nit comes to how we are going to conduct the war on terror.\n  I will end with this thought. For the first time I know of, since \nSeptember 11, 2001, we have sat down as a Congress and an \nadministration to start thinking this thing through. We have come up \nwith, I believe, a darn good package.\n  I say to Senator Levin, I have enjoyed working with him on this. I \nhave been a military lawyer for over 20 years. There are a lot of \nthings that go on in the Senate I do not know as well as I should. But \nI feel very comfortable that the war on terror is truly a war, that 9/\n11 was an act of war, it was not a crime, and if we will apply the law \nof armed conflict, we can be proud as a nation.\n\n  I say to the Senator, your amendment and my amendment together have \ngotten us back to where we should have been years ago, applying the law \nof armed conflict to these terror suspects in a way that goes beyond \nthe Geneva Conventions because we are a nation that wants to do it \nright and then some. But we are also preserving our own ability to \ndefend ourselves.\n  So to the world, if you are wondering what is going on in America \nnow, if anybody goes to Guantanamo Bay, the Congress will be told about \nwhat goes on, and we will have a say about what goes on. If anybody at \nGuantanamo Bay is determined to be an enemy combatant, not only will \nCongress be involved in how they are kept and how long they are kept, \nour Federal courts will review the actions of our military to see if \nthey comply with the Constitution of our Nation. And that is a huge \nchange.\n  I say to the Senator, I congratulate you for working with me--working \ntogether--to come up with a review process, where the world can know \nfor sure that what we are doing meets our own constitutional standards. \nEnemy combatants are going to get a chance to go to Federal court. The \nFederal court is going to look at the big picture and see whether what \nwe have done is constitutional, and when it comes to that individual's \ncase, to look at whether the procedures and standards that were \ninvolved were properly applied. The world should respect us for that. I \nam proud to have been part of that process.\n  To those who go to court and have their liberty interests dealt with, \nthose who are going to be tried for law of armed conflict violations, \nwe can tell the world that those people who will be tried at Guantanamo \nBay will not be tried in secret. They will be tried in public to the \nextent that we can.\n  There is an op-ed piece today in the Washington Post by a defense \ncounsel--and God bless him; I have been a defense counsel, and I want \nevery right I can get as a defense counsel--saying that the trials at \nGuantanamo Bay are a lot different than the ones at Nuremberg. He is \nright in this regard. Nuremberg was trying people after the war was \nover. We will be trying people at Guantanamo Bay while the war is going \non.\n  What we want to do is make sure the public knows as much as possible \nabout the process, that the defendants understand the evidence against \nthem, that they have the right to challenge the evidence, call \nwitnesses, and testify. And they are presumed innocent. It is a very \ngood infrastructure. But there may be some evidence down there about a \nparticular defendant that has to be classified because to divulge that \nevidence would tip our enemy off as to what we are doing and how we are \ndoing it.\n  We are still at war. It is important we understand we are still at \nwar. But we can tell the world that for every person who goes through a \nmilitary commission trial, we will be as open as we possibly can be \nwithout compromising our own security.\n  When that verdict is rendered, the Federal courts of the United \nStates of America will look at the military action to see if it \ncomports with the Constitution of our Nation, the preeminent legal \ndocument in the world, and will also review the individual's case. I am \nproud of that. It is going further than we probably absolutely have to, \nbut it is doing the American thing. It is putting American values on \ndisplay.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, tomorrow is a historic day in the \nwar on terror. You have a chance to put some legal infrastructure in \nplace that will be a model for the world, that will help us win this \nwar on our terms. I am proud to have been part of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from South \nCarolina and my colleague from Michigan whom I have worked with these \nmany years.\n  If the Senator from South Carolina will retake his seat for a minute \nwhile the chairman speaks, I wish to say I thank my distinguished \ncolleague because I look upon the work by Members of the Senate toward \na resolution of these very difficult issues regarding prisoners taken \nin this series of conflicts, seeing what we have witnessed in \nterrorism, where there are no clear precedents, in many ways, in \nhistory for this nonstate-sponsored aggression.\n  As we witnessed in the tragedy in Jordan, it is not restricted to \nIraq and Afghanistan. As General Abizaid has briefed the Senate and, \nindeed, briefed the American public on television, this is a worldwide \nmovement that goes all the way from Spain to Indonesia. And you do not \nknow where they will hit next or whom they will hit or by what means \nthey will hit.\n  But I do believe as to the work initiated by our distinguished \ncolleague from Arizona, Mr. McCain, which you and I worked with him on, \nthis matter, which you and Senator Levin have worked on, and to a \nlimited extent--I am supporting you--I have had a voice, this is--and I \nsay this with great respect to the President and the administration--a \ncoequal branch of Government, the Senate. The Congress has a very clear \nmandate in the Constitution that we shall take care of the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces. And this is part of that.\n  So I say to my good friends who have worked on this, well done. You \nare profiles in courage.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 2518 and 2519\n\n  Now, Mr. President, as announced earlier, we will continue the \nremarks regarding the two amendments, one by my distinguished colleague \nfrom Michigan with his distinguished leader, the Senator from Nevada, \nand one by myself together with Senator Frist.\n  Now, I wish to make an opening comment, and then I would like to \nyield the floor for such time as my distinguished colleague may speak, \nand then I will make some closing comments.\n  But it is important in our bill, and particularly on the last day, to \naddress the situation in Iraq. But, indeed, it is broader than Iraq. It \nis, as I said a moment ago, the militant Jihadists attacking from Spain \nto Indonesia, wherever they want to bring freedom and current \ngovernment to a standstill.\n  So we could have devised on this an entire amendment out of whole \ncloth,\n\n[[Page S12757]]\n\nbut it seemed to me--and I am going to take responsibility--it seemed \nto me that we could show the maximum bipartisanship if we took the \namendment, as drawn by my distinguished colleague from Michigan, \nSenator Reid, and others, and made a minimal number of changes.\n  That is exactly the posture of these proper amendments. That, to me, \nindicates how much we really agree upon, page after page, paragraph \nafter paragraph. It is carefully drawn so, first, the Senate expresses \nthe sense of the Senate, not binding on the executive branch, it is the \nsense of the Senate. Then the second portion is a reporting \nrequirement. But those reporting requirements are looking forward. We \nare not going back to debate history. History will debate that fully. \nWe are going forward because the next 120 days, with Iraq in particular \nin mind, with the election in December, the formation of a new \ngovernment, this next 120 days we must maintain stability, a clarity of \nunderstanding among the American people and the Iraqi people, and we \ncannot adopt any language, be it sense of the Senate or reporting \nlanguage, that in any way raises speculation. Everything we say about \nthe implementation of our Armed Forces should be with complete clarity.\n  The amendment by my good friend from Michigan left only the option, \nin the reporting to the President, of putting out unclassified \ninformation. That, to the maximum, the executive branch will do. But \nthere are certain aspects--and every Member should be cognizant of \nthis--of this very complicated war on terrorism that have to be given \nto the Congress in a classified version.\n  So that is the sum and substance of our amendment. Take away any \nindication of timetable, give the President the option to do \nunclassified and classified and have a forward-looking approach as we \ngo into these next 120 critical days. This document can be referred to, \nhopefully, as a bipartisan instrument.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend from Virginia for \nhis positive comments. As always, he seeks to build bridges and to \novercome differences and to reach across the aisle. It is typical of \nhim, and it has been that way since the first day I met him many years \nago.\n  The Levin-Reid amendment--there are two amendments pending--is an \neffort to, indeed, try to improve the situation in Iraq, to try to \nchange the course for the better. There is no date for withdrawal in \nour amendment. It is not saying that we will withdraw troops at any \nparticular specific date. We have done that because we think it would \nbe a mistake to set a specific date, at least most of us do. On the \nother hand, we believe it is essential that we change course in a \nnumber of directions in order to improve the chances of Iraq becoming a \nsuccess.\n  America is going to be less secure if Iraq is a failed state. \nEverybody agrees on that. The question is, How can we improve the \nchances of Iraq not becoming a failed state? What could we do here, \ncarrying out our responsibility, what contribution can we make here to \nsuccess in Iraq? Things are not working very well in Iraq in many ways. \nI know there are people who will point to progress in Iraq and, \nobviously, there are things to which one could point. But on the other \nhand, there are things that are not working well, and this amendment \nintends to address those in a constructive and positive way.\n  Staying the course is not a strategy; that is a slogan. How do we \nimprove the chances for success? How do we modify our course so that we \ncan achieve or help the Iraqis achieve--more accurately--a nation? And \nhow can we also look forward to the day when our troops come out sooner \nrather than later?\n  This amendment looks at the year 2006 as a transition year, with \nIraqi forces taking over security functions to a far greater extent. \nFor that to happen, this amendment points out that a number of things \nneed to happen. First, we have to advise the Iraqis that we are not \nthere for an indefinite period of time, that they must take the steps \nnecessary to achieve a broad-based political settlement which is so \nessential to defeating the insurgency. Our military advisers are \nunanimous on this point. There is no purely military solution unless \nthe Iraqis come together politically. Unless they unify politically, \nthey will not be able to defeat the insurgents. It is a point which \nmust be made to the Iraqis. They cannot simply continue to squabble \nover the content of a constitution. They have to come together or else \nthey are not going to succeed, and we are not going to succeed in \nhelping them to achieve the security they want.\n  We need to advise the Iraqis we are not there indefinitely. They have \nto take the steps necessary to achieve a broad-based political \nsettlement which is critically important to defeating the insurgency. \nWe need a plan for success. We don't have a plan for success. I will \nspeak more about that in a moment.\n  I want to go through the amendment. I want to point out where there \nis apparently agreement and where there is disagreement and what the \nsignificance is of both. The sense of the Senate starts by saying \nsomething that I think every Member of this body would agree with:\n\n     . . . members of the United States Armed Forces who are \n     serving or have served in Iraq and their families deserve the \n     utmost respect and the heartfelt gratitude of the American \n     people for their unwavering devotion to duty, service to the \n     Nation, and selfless sacrifice under the most difficult \n     circumstances.\n\n  We start with that. Our troops and their families deserve the very \nbest in equipment, training, and support, but also in our thinking. \nThat doesn't mean there is going to be unanimity around. People who \ndisagree on what the next step should be should not be pilloried in any \nway or criticized as being less American than those who support the \nadministration's policy lock, stock, and barrel. There is a place for \nconstructive criticism, for different points of view in a democracy. \nThat is what our troops have always fought for. That is what men and \nwomen have died for, so that we would have an opportunity to have the \nkind of debate on policy which is going on now.\n  First, our heartfelt gratitude to our troops. Second, the sense of \nthe Senate recognizes that the Iraqi people have made enormous \nsacrifices and that the overwhelming majority of Iraqis want to live in \npeace and security. There is no disagreement on that. The alternative \namendment that we will be voting on does not differ with that.\n  The next paragraph there is no difference on either. Both amendments \nhave the same language. There is no change in our version from the \nFrist-Warner version. That is:\n\n     . . . calendar 2006 should be a period of significant \n     transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi security \n     forces taking the lead for the security of a free and \n     sovereign Iraq, thereby creating the conditions for the \n     phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq.\n  That is in paragraph 3 of the sense of the Senate. There is no change \nin that language to the Frist-Warner language. That is paragraph \n(b)(3). Creating the conditions for the phased redeployment of U.S. \nforces from Iraq surely ought to be a goal.\n\n       (4) United States military forces should not stay in Iraq \n     indefinitely and the Iraqi people should be so advised.\n\n  That is an important statement to the Iraqi people, and it is an \nimportant statement to our people. We should not be staying in Iraq \nindefinitely. That is the wrong message to send for a number of reasons \nto the Iraqi people.\n  What the Warner version does is, it strikes the word ``indefinitely'' \nand says:\n\n       United States military forces should not stay in Iraq any \n     longer than required and the people of Iraq should be so \n     advised.\n\n  The problem with that is, they could be required forever. That is \nopen-ended. It is unlimited. It is the wrong message. That is a \ndifference, and it is the first difference.\n  The next paragraph, there is no difference on:\n\n     . . . the Administration should tell the leaders of all \n     groups and political parties in Iraq that they need to make \n     the compromises necessary to achieve the broad-based \n     political settlement that is essential for defeating the \n     insurgency . . . within the schedule that they have set for \n     themselves.\n\n  By the way, the schedule that they have set for themselves is to \nappoint a commission when the new assembly takes office in January, to \nappoint a constitutional commission to review the constitution and make \nrecommendations for changes within 4\n\n[[Page S12758]]\n\nmonths. That is their schedule. They ought to keep that.\n  Next--there is no disagreement on this language--\n\n     . . . the Administration needs to explain to Congress and the \n     American people its strategy for successful completion of the \n     mission in Iraq.\n\n  No difference on that language.\n  Now to paragraph C on the reports.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, to help those following, you have now \nconcluded that section entitled ``Sense of the Senate.'' Both \namendments have it phrased such, not binding on the administration.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. As you carefully pointed out, but I would like to repeat, \nthe entire section that you have referred to we have accepted--I \naccepted and recommended to my colleague--except for that one change of \nstriking ``indefinitely'' and using ``any longer than required.'' And \nwhen I regain the floor, I will explain why I felt that modest one-word \nchange was important. Other than that, we have accepted in its entirety \nthat section entitled ``Sense of the Senate'' accept for a one-word \nchange.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct.\n  On the report section, there is a change from 30 days to 90 days, \nwhich I will not spend time on. I think it is a fairly technical \nchange, that there is not a particular difference or problem.\n  After that first report, whether it is 30 days or 90 days--30 days in \nour version, 90 days in Senator Warner's version--every 3 months \nthereafter, until all U.S. combat brigades have been redeployed from \nIraq, the President shall submit to Congress an unclassified report on \nU.S. policy and military operations in Iraq. In our version we say:\n\n       Each report shall include the following:\n\n  What the Warner version adds is ``to the extent practicable, \nunclassified information.'' And by the way, it is clear that there is \nclassified information that cannot be in a report, and we don't suggest \nto the contrary. We just want an unclassified report to the extent you \ncan have an unclassified report on each of the following items:\n\n     . . . The current military mission and the diplomatic, \n     political, economic, and military measures, if any, that are \n     being or have been undertaken to successfully complete that \n     mission.\n\n  So far, no difference on that one.\n\n       Efforts to convince Iraq's main communities to make the \n     compromises necessary for a broad-based and sustainable \n     political settlement.\n\n  That is what I referred to before. It is so critically important that \nwe must convince the communities in Iraq that they must make the \ncompromises necessary for a broad-based, politically acceptable \nsettlement. No difference on that language; no proposed change in that.\n  Next, in our amendment, we need to engage\n\n     the international community and the region in the effort to \n     stabilize Iraq and to forge a broad-based and sustainable \n     political settlement.\n\n  No difference on that.\n  We need a report to us every 30 days on what is being done to \nstrengthen the capacity of Iraq's Government ministries; to accelerate \nthe delivery of basic services; to secure the delivery of pledged \neconomic assistance from the international community, and additional \npledges of assistance; to train Iraqi security forces and transfer \nsecurity responsibilities to those forces and the Government of Iraq.\n  No difference on that in terms of what must be in this report.\n  Next, we need in this report to know\n\n     whether the Iraqis have made the compromises necessary to \n     achieve the broad-based and sustainable political \n     settlement--\n\n  We need to keep the pressure on the Iraqis. We need the \nadministration to tell us the Iraqis have made the compromises \nnecessary. Without that kind of keeping the Iraqis' feet to the fire, \nit is less likely the Iraqis are going to make the kind of broad-based \ncompromises that are necessary--the compromises that are necessary to \nachieve that broad-based political settlement that is essential, in our \nwords, to defeat the insurgency in Iraq.\n  And now we get down to the heart of the matter where there seems to \nbe a difference, and I want to spend another couple minutes on this. \nThis report, according to our amendment--not disagreed to with the \nWarner amendment--must include specific conditions that were included \nin an April 2005 campaign action plan and any subsequent update to that \ncampaign plan that must be met in order to provide for the transition \nof security responsibility to the Iraqi security forces.\n  There seems to be no objection to that. There is no change in that. \nSo we want that document, that report from the administration to set \nforth any specific conditions that were in the April 2005 campaign \naction plan and any updates to that campaign plan that need to be met \nin order to provide for transition of security responsibility.\n  There is an acknowledgement by no change in our language that there \nis a report containing conditions, that there is a need for updates to \nthat campaign plan that need to be met in order to provide for the \ntransition of security responsibility to the Iraqi forces.\n  Now we then have language which on this whole next page is not \nobjected to, which is accepted, which is that to the extent these \nconditions are not covered, as I have just outlined, the following \nneeds to be addressed. We lay out here one, two, three, four \nconditions: number of battalions of Iraqi Armed Forces that have to \noperate independently or take the lead in counterinsurgency operations; \nnumber of Iraqi police units that have to operate independently or take \nthe lead in maintaining law and order in fighting the insurgency, the \nnumber of regular police that must be trained and equipped to maintain \nlaw and order; the ability of Iraq's ministries and provincial and \nlocal governments to independently sustain, direct, and coordinate \nIraq's security forces.\n  Now, so far there is apparently no problem. We have laid out all of \nthose conditions that need to be set forth in the report that has to \ncome every 30 days after that first report.\n  Then in subsection (6) we have a requirement in the report that is \nalso not objected to, which is a schedule for meeting such conditions. \nThere is no objection to that in the Warner amendment. There is no \nlanguage change in his version.\n  So we require a schedule for meeting those conditions which I have \noutlined and an assessment of the extent to which such conditions have \nbeen met, information regarding variables that could alter that \nschedule, and the reasons for any subsequent changes to that schedule.\n  So far, so good. No change in the language.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, for those \nfollowing, we covered first the sense of the Senate. The Senator has \nnow covered very carefully all the other provisions. It seems to me \nthat there has been no disagreement whatsoever between the two sides. \nYou pointed out, yes, I asked for 90 days; you have 30. But I don't \nthink that was particularly troublesome. And I pointed out that one \nlittle change in language, ``to the extent practicable,'' so that the \nPresident could include classified. So in essence there is absolutely \nno difference between the two amendments up to the point you are now \naddressing, which is the last paragraph; is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Not quite, because there was that one change which the \nSenator from Virginia made in the sense-of-the-Senate language.\n  Mr. WARNER. No, I pointed that out.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I know you said there has been no change other than this. \nI said there was a prior one which we agreed was a change.\n  Mr. WARNER. I was referring to now the statutory report language. \nThere is no difference until you get to the last paragraph.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would agree. Now to the last paragraph, which for \nreasons beyond me has been stricken.\n  We referred to the campaign plan--without objection. There was a \ncampaign plan we referred to which said, what are the conditions in \nthat plan that must be met in order to provide for the transition of \nsecurity responsibilities to Iraqi security forces? There is the \ncampaign plan. There are the conditions which have been laid out, which \nof those conditions must be met in order to achieve the goal which we \nhave agreed on in this document--transition of security responsibility \nto security forces.\n  Then we have agreed that the report has to contain a schedule for \nmeeting those conditions. What are the conditions? What is the schedule \nfor meeting\n\n[[Page S12759]]\n\nthem? Three times we refer to that schedule in that same paragraph. No \nobjection so far.\n  But now we say that campaign plan should also contain estimated dates \nfor the phased redeployment of the United States Armed Forces from Iraq \nas each condition is met. The conditions are already laid out. What is \nthe campaign plan with estimated dates for the phased redeployment as \nthose conditions are met?\n\n  Then we explicitly acknowledge that, with the understanding that \nunexpected contingencies may arise.\n  We have already made reference to the phased redeployment. That is \nthe first time we have made a reference to phased redeployment.\n  In the sense of the Senate, paragraph (b)(3), we have said:\n\n       Calendar year 2006 should be a period of significant \n     transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi security \n     forces taking the lead for the security of a free and \n     sovereign Iraq, thereby creating the conditions for the \n     phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq.\n\n  So in subparagraph (7), the last paragraph, which makes reference to \nthe campaign plan--we have already described what that is, with no \nobjection to it--are the estimated dates for the phased redeployment of \nthe United States Armed Forces from Iraq--we have already made \nreference to the goal of phased redeployment of United States Armed \nForces--as each condition is met. We already have agreement on \neverything up to now, talking about all those conditions and the need \nthat they be met, with the understanding that unexpected contingencies \nmay arise, which I can't imagine anybody would object to because there \nare unexpected contingencies that always arise. We have acknowledged \nthis.\n  But why it is there is objection to acknowledging what is obvious, \nthat a campaign plan needs to have dates, estimated dates for the \nphased redeployment we have already agreed is desirable, as conditions \nallow and as each condition is met? Why that would be objectionable is \nfrankly a mystery to me unless there is a reluctance to do what we do \nin an earlier paragraph, which is to say, folks, we can't stay there \nforever, we have a plan for success, where there is a takeover of the \nmajor security operations by the Iraqis so we can in a phased way \nredeploy our forces. Eliminating that part of the plan, it seems to me, \nis eliminating what is essential, what clearly follows from everything \nthat precedes it, which has been agreed to, and I think it would send \nexactly the wrong message, to agree to all of the pieces that come up \nto that conclusion, including the conditions which need to be met, the \ndesirability of phased redeployment, the fact that there is a campaign \nplan, the fact that that campaign plan has conditions in it that need \nto be met in order to provide for the transition of security \nresponsibility.\n  It is all there. It is all there in the pieces leading right up to \nparagraph (7). Suddenly in the Warner version, paragraph (7) is \nstricken.\n  Again, I close with this emphasis. We have not said in this document \nthat there should be a date for withdrawal. We said there should be a \nplan. What are the conditions for phased redeployment? What would it \ntake for this to happen? What number of battalions need to be brought \nup to capability on the part of the Iraqis in order for there to be a \nnumber of our forces that are reduced and under what conditions? What \nare those circumstances and conditions which will allow us to reduce \nour forces?\n  For the administration to resist stating to the American people what \nare the conditions that need to exist for us to reduce our forces in \nIraq it seems to me is wrong. It means there is no plan, there is no \nstrategy that they are willing to lay out for the American people and \nfor the Iraqi people as well so that there is no misunderstanding as to \nwhere this responsibility must fall ultimately, which is on the people \nof Iraq to come together politically and to take over their own \nmilitary security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, again I commend my colleague. I think I \nhave fairly clearly stated, and I believe there has been concurrence, \nthe document prepared by the Senator and others is virtually accepted \nin our amendment. The changes that I put out, the one simple change in \nthe sense of the Senate, you understood that. Then we get to the \nconditions, which is changing 120 days instead of 30. So I say to my \ncolleague--and I think the Senator has been very fair and objective \nabout it--the amendments are parallel in every respect except the last \nparagraph.\n  I say to my good friend, I say to all Senators, the next 120 days are \ncritical. If this is to become law, the President would have to start \nevery 90 days addressing the estimated dates for the phased \nredeployment of United States Armed Forces from Iraq. No mention about \nthe other coalition forces.\n  I say that few words can be interpreted by all as being the \ntimetable, and we do not in this 120 days, in my judgment, want to have \nany hint whatsoever of a timetable. It is so critical, with all the \nprogress thus far by the Iraqi people--elections and a series of \ntransitional governments, then acceptance of the constitution by \nreferendum, then the election of a new legislative body, and then they \nhave to stand up and begin to strengthen the ministries and take hold \nin such a way that it is clear to the Iraqi people and the world that \nthat government is in control. To put any language such as this in \nthere, to suggest any timetable by which we begin to withdraw forces, \nwould undermine entirely and make highly risky the next 120 days.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a correction? I inadvertently \nsaid the report would be every 30 days after the first report. I \nmisspoke. It would be every 90 days, as the Senator from Virginia \ncorrectly has stated. It would be every 90 days after the first report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this is one of those quiet moments in \nthe Senate with very few people in the Chamber when, in my opinion, \nsomething very important is happening. It is happening in good measure \nbecause of the two good men, my colleagues from Virginia and Michigan, \nwho lead the Armed Services Committee, of which I am privileged to be a \nmember. They are two gentlemen, two patriots, two people who have known \neach other for a long time, who work closely together, respect each \nother, even seem to like each other and, most important of all, trust \neach other.\n  Those qualities of personal trust and personal relationship have been \ntoo absent from our Nation's consideration of the ongoing war in Iraq \namong our political leadership. We have, I am convinced, suffered from \nit.\n  It is no surprise to my colleagues that I strongly supported the war \nin Iraq. I was privileged to be the Democratic cosponsor, with the \nSenator from Virginia, of the authorizing resolution which received \noverwhelming bipartisan support.\n  As I look back on it and as I follow the debates about prewar \nintelligence, I have no regrets about having sponsored and supported \nthat resolution because of all the other reasons we had in our national \nsecurity interest to remove Saddam Hussein from power, a brutal, \nmurdering dictator, an aggressive invader of his neighbors, a supporter \nof terrorism, a hater of the United States of America. He was for us a \nticking timebomb that if we did not remove him I am convinced would \nhave blown up, metaphorically speaking, in America's face. I am \ngrateful to the American military for the extraordinary bravery and \nbrilliance of their campaign to remove Saddam Hussein.\n  I know we are safer as a nation, and to say the obvious that the \nIraqi people are freer as a people, and the Middle East has a chance \nfor a new day and stability with Saddam Hussein gone. We will come to \nanother day to debate the past of prewar intelligence. But let me say \nbriefly the questions raised in our time are important. The \ninternational intelligence community believed Saddam Hussein had \nweapons of mass destruction. Probably most significant, and I guess \nhistorically puzzling, is that Saddam Hussein acted in a way to send a \nmessage that he had a program of weapons of mass destruction. He would \nnot, in response to one of the 17 U.N. Security Council resolutions \nthat he violated, declare he had eliminated the inventory of weapons of \nmass destruction that he reported to\n\n[[Page S12760]]\n\nthe U.N. after the end of the gulf war in 1991.\n  I do not want to go off on that issue. I want to say that the debate \nabout the war has become much too partisan in our time. And something \nis happening here tonight that I believe, I hope, I pray we will look \nback and say was a turning point and opened the road to Republican and \nDemocratic cooperation, White House and congressional cooperation, to \ncomplete the mission. As Senator Levin said, no matter what anyone \nthinks about why we got into the war and whether we should have been in \nthere, it is hard to find anybody around the Senate--I have not heard \nanybody--who does not want us to successfully complete our mission \nthere. I feel that deeply. If we withdraw prematurely from Iraq, there \nwill be civil war, and there is a great probability that others in the \nneighborhood will come in. The Iranians will be tempted to come in on \nthe side of the Shia Muslims in the south. The Turks will be tempted to \ncome in against the Kurds in the north. The other Sunni nations, such \nas the Saudis and the Jordanians, will be sorely tempted, if not to \ncome in at least to aggressively support the Sunni Muslim population. \nThere will be instability in the Middle East, and the hope of creating \na different model for a better life in the Middle East in this historic \ncenter of the Arab world, Iraq, will be gone.\n  If we successfully complete our mission, we will have left a country \nthat is self-governing with an open economy, with an opportunity for \nthe people of Iraq to do what they clearly want to do, which is to live \na better life, to get a job, to have their kids get a decent education, \nto live a better life.\n  There seems to be broad consensus on that, and yet the partisanship \nthat characterizes our time here gets in the way of realizing those \nbroadly expressed and shared goals.\n  Politics must end at the water's edge. That is what Senator Arthur \nVandenberg of Michigan said, articulating the important ideal that we \nseem to have lost too often in our time.\n  I found a fuller statement of Senator Vandenberg's position, the \nideal. I found it to be in some ways more complicated and in other ways \nmuch more compelling. I want to read from it. Senator Vandenberg said:\n\n       To me ``bipartisan foreign policy'' means a mutual effort, \n     under our indispensable two-Party system, to unite our \n     official voice at the water's edge so that America speaks \n     with maximum authority against those who would divide and \n     conquer us and the free world.\n\n  If that doesn't speak to us today--the threat of Islamist terrorism, \nthe desire they have to divide us and, in that sense, to conquer us in \nthe free world. Senator Vandenberg continued in his definition of what \nhe meant by bipartisanship in foreign policy:\n\n       It does not involve the remotest surrender of free debate \n     in determining our position. On the contrary, frank \n     cooperation and free debate are indispensable to ultimate \n     unity--\n\n  Of which I speak.\n\n       In a word, it simply seeks national security ahead of \n     partisan advantage.\n\n  I felt again in recent days and recent months how far we have strayed \ndown the partisan path from Vandenberg's ideals. The most recent \ndisconcerting evidence of this was the lead story from the Washington \nPost--it was in papers all over the country--last Saturday, November \n12. I read from that story:\n\n       President Bush and leading congressional Democrats lobbed \n     angry charges at each other Friday in an increasingly \n     personal battle over the origins of the Iraq war. Although \n     the two sides have long skirmished over the war, the sharp \n     tenor Friday resembled an election year campaign more than a \n     policy disagreement.\n\n  That from Saturday's Washington Post. Campaign rhetoric over policy \ndebate, and what about? About how we got into the war 2\\1/2\\ years ago, \nnot about how we together can successfully complete our mission in \nIraq.\n  The questions raised about prewar intelligence are not irrelevant, \nthey are not unimportant, but they are nowhere near as important and \nrelevant as how we successfully complete our mission in Iraq and \nprotect the 150,000 men and women in uniform who are fighting for us \nthere.\n  I go back to Vandenberg's phrase; the question is how Democrats and \nRepublicans can ``unite our . . . voice at the water's edge . . . \nagainst those who would divide and conquer us and the free world'' in \nIraq, I add, and beyond.\n  The danger is that by spending so much attention on the past here, we \ncontribute to a drop in public support among the American people for \nthe war, and that is consequential. Terrorists know they cannot defeat \nus in Iraq, but they also know they can defeat us in America by \nbreaking the will and steadfast support of the American people for this \ncause.\n  There is a wonderful phrase from the Bible that I have quoted before:\n\n       If the sound of the trumpet be uncertain, who will follow \n     into battle?\n\n  In our time, I am afraid that the trumpet has been replaced by public \nopinion polls, and if the public opinion polls are uncertain, if \nsupport for the war seems to be dropping, who will follow into battle \nand when will our brave and brilliant men and women in uniform in Iraq \nbegin to wonder whether they have the support of the American people? \nWhen will that begin to affect their morale?\n  I worry the partisanship of our time has begun to get in the way of \nthe successful completion of our mission in Iraq. I urge my colleagues \nat every moment, when we do anything regarding this war, that we \nconsider the ideal and we are confident within ourselves. Not that we \nare stifling free debate. Free debate, as Vandenberg said, is the \nnecessary precondition to the unity we need to maximize our authority \nagainst those who would divide and conquer us. But the point is to make \nsure we feel in ourselves that the aim of our actions and our words is \nnational security, not partisan advantage.\n  Now we come to today. After reading that paper on Saturday, I took \nthe original draft amendment submitted by Senator Warner and Senator \nFrist--it actually wasn't offered, but it was around--and Senator Levin \nand Senator Reid. I took the amendments back to Connecticut, and last \nnight I looked them over. Neither one expressed fully what I hoped it \nwould, but as I stepped back, I said that these two amendments--one \nRepublican, one Democrat, unfortunate in a way breaking by parties--\nthese amendments are not that far apart.\n  I like the way in which the Warner amendment recited again the \nfindings that led us to war against Saddam Hussein and, quite \nexplicitly, cited the progress that has been made. I do think Senator \nLevin's amendment doesn't quite do this part enough, about the \nprogress, particularly among the political leaders of Iraq. They have \ndone something remarkable in a country that lived for 30 years under a \ndictator who suppressed all political activity, encouraged the \nincreasing division and bitterness among the Shia's, the Sunnis, the \nKurds. These people, with our help and encouragement, have begun to \nnegotiate like real political leaders in a democracy. It is not always \npretty. What we do here is not always most attractive. That is \ndemocracy. Most important of all, 8 million Iraqis came out in the face \nof terrorist threats in January to vote on that interim legislation. \nAlmost 10 million came out to vote on a constitution, which is a pretty \ngood document, a historically good document in the context of the Arab \nworld.\n  What happened when the Sunnis felt they were not getting enough of \nwhat they wanted in a referendum? They didn't go to the street, most of \nthem, with arms to start a civil war; they registered to vote. That is \na miraculous achievement and a change in attitude and action. They came \nout to vote in great numbers, and they will come out, I predict, again \nin December in the elections and elect enough Sunnis to have an effect \non the Constitution next year.\n  So I wish that some of that had been stated in Senator Levin's \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I would.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My amendment is exactly the same as Senator Warner's \namendment in that regard. Senator Warner has adopted my amendment with \ntwo minor changes. He has not made any change in terms of the progress \nthat has been made or the reference to the great work of our troops. I \nthought I heard the Senator from Connecticut--and I have no dearer \nfriend in the Senate--suggest that he had wished that my amendment \nwould be more fulsome relative to progress. I\n\n[[Page S12761]]\n\njust wanted to assure the Senator that there is no change in that \nlanguage in the version which was subsequently filed by the Senator \nfrom Virginia.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Michigan. What I said, and I \nknow the Senator from Michigan was involved in a conversation, I was \nactually going back and quoting the draft of the Warner amendment that \nwas circulating at the end of last week which had statements about why \nwe went to war and marked the progress that had been made politically \nand economically since then. But the Warner amendment did not raise \nquestions about what our plan is now and how to successfully complete \nthe mission. It did not raise the questions Senator Levin's amendment \nrightly raises for progress reports from the administration about how \nwe are doing and in that sense did not create an opportunity for a \ndialogue that can get us beyond the partisan gridlock in our \ndiscussions about the war. I wrote a statement last night expressing my \nfrustration on that.\n  I had other concerns about Senator Levin's amendment, including \nparticularly the last paragraph which I believe creates a timetable for \nwithdrawal, and I think that is a mistake, particularly in the next 3 \nto 6 months as the Iraqis stand up a new government. It may not be the \nintention of the sponsors, but it does send a message that I fear will \ndiscourage our troops because it seems to be heading for the door. It \nwill encourage the terrorists, and it will confuse the Iraqi people and \naffect their judgments as they go forward.\n  Incidentally, I do thank the Senator from Michigan because I know he \nand others in the Democratic caucus worked very hard to make this \namendment an inclusive amendment. I had the opportunity to make a few \nsuggestions, some of which were accepted, some of which were not. Then \nI arrive back in Washington today and I find that the Senator from \nVirginia has decided not to put in that amendment, has seen some real \nstrengths in the amendment of the Senator from Michigan, has cut out a \nfew points as enumerated, that I personally--and Senator Warner and I \nhad no conversation about this--thought weakened or at least I found \nobjectionable. I think it is better to strike the word \n``indefinitely,'' that our troops will not stay there indefinitely. Of \ncourse they will not stay there indefinitely but to make the telling \npoint that we will stay there as long as conditions require and no \nlonger. I fear that if a timetable is put in at the end, ask for a \nseries of dates of phased deployment, even though they are based on \nthose conditions that were cited, it looks like a withdrawal plan and \ndoes not send a sound of strength, the sound of a certain trumpet.\n  The point that I wish to make is that Senator Warner has now taken \nmost of Senator Levin's amendment. The Republican leader, if I could \ntalk in partisan terms, has said to the Democratic leader: We accept \nmost of his amendment with these few changes. I think this is a turning \npoint. It is a significant development in terms of the Senate's \nconsideration of the war in Iraq and hopefully in terms of the \nadministration's consideration as well.\n  The distrust, the lack of dialogue between the executive branch and \nDemocrats in Congress is so deep and complicated now that I cannot even \nbegin to describe how we got to this point. I know it is a bad place to \nbe, particularly when we are at war.\n  I remember the words of the Secretary of War during the Second World \nWar, Henry L. Stimson--this was actually after the war. He said: \nSometimes the best way to make a person--and he really meant a nation--\ntrustworthy is to trust them. That has been lacking in the relations \nbetween the executive branch and the Democrats in Congress.\n  I believe Senator Warner, the Republican chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, in accepting almost all of the Democratic \namendment, has in some sense expanded the trust he feels for the \nranking Democrat on the committee and created a process where the \nadministration does have to report to us every 90 days, and if the \nadministration--let me put it another way, respectfully. I hope the \nWhite House, the Pentagon, sees this also as a moment of opportunity to \nengage with the Congress so that we will achieve, after free debate--\nand that is exactly what we have heard on the floor tonight--the result \nSenator Vandenberg spoke to, which is that we will, under our \nindispensable two-party system, unite our official voice at the water's \nedge so that America speaks with maximum authority against those who \nwould divide and conquer us in the free world.\n\n  It is a different kind of enemy, but the extremist Islamist \nterrorists who face us, as Senator Warner said, from Spain to \nIndonesia, it is their plan for conquer. They struck us on 9/11. They \nare preparing to strike us again. If we cannot pull together across \nparty lines to defeat this enemy to our security and our way of life, \nshame on us, particularly if we are stopped from doing so by momentary \npartisan political ambitions.\n  So I am going to vote for the Warner amendment--I believe it is a \nsignificant step forward--for the reasons I have said, because of the \ntimetable at the end particularly. I am going to respectfully vote \nagainst the Levin amendment. I hope the Levin amendment comes up first, \nand if it is not passed, I hope there is an overwhelming bipartisan \nvote for the Warner amendment.\n  I cannot resist one final quote from the great Vandenberg--succeeded \nby another great Senator, I might say, from Michigan, Mr. Levin--and \nthis is that famous speech on January 10, 1945, when he abandoned his \nlong-time isolationism and embraced an internationalist foreign policy, \nand, boy, did his words speak directly to us in our circumstances in \nIraq and around the world today. I hope they give us pause. I hope in \nsome sense--frankly, they give us a bit of discomfort about some of the \nthings that have happened in the political consideration of the war.\n  Here is what Vandenberg said:\n\n       There are critical moments in the life of every nation, \n     which call for the straightest, the plainest and most \n     courageous thinking of which we are capable. We confront such \n     a moment now. . . .\n\n  And we do today, as well.\n  Vandenberg continued:\n\n        . . . It is not only desperately important to America, it \n     is important to the world. It is important not only to this \n     generation, which lives in blood . . .\n\n  As ours sadly does, as the people who were in the Trade Towers and \nthe Pentagon and Jordan over the weekend and so many other places \naround the world.\n\n        . . . It is important to future generations if they shall \n     live in peace. No man in his right senses will be dogmatic in \n     such an hour.\n\n  I digress to thank the Senator from Virginia for coming across the \naisle a long way. I thank the Senator from Michigan for the work he did \nto make his amendment as inclusive and broad as it was so that it \nenabled the Senator from Virginia to do that.\n  Vandenberg ended:\n\n       Each of us can only speak according to his little lights--\n     and pray for a composite wisdom that shall lead us to a high, \n     safe ground.\n\n  That is exactly what we need with regard to Iraq today. We have to do \nwhat is best for our country. We have to do what is best for the \n150,000 Americans who are there. We have to do what best enables us to \ndo what we say we all want to do, which is to successfully complete \nAmerica's mission in Iraq. The sooner we do that, what is best for our \ncountry and our great military, the sooner we will succeed in Iraq, and \nthe sooner we will be able to bring our brave soldiers home.\n  This compromise amendment offered by Senator Warner, building on the \nexcellent work Senator Levin has done, is an enormous step forward \ntoward that higher ground. I thank them both for the work they have \ndone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there are rare moments in the life of the \nSenate that one shall never forget. I thank the Senator not just \nbecause he has indicated support for my amendment but for the Senator's \nvery extraordinary observations about the times, the difficulty, and \nthe need to have bipartisanship and to leave our politics at the \nwater's edge. As I said earlier, I take responsibility for adopting \nthis course rather than the earlier draft I had prepared.\n  I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, it is an \nexpression of how close we really are on the fundamental things. The \nsole point of difference is how each Senator shall read the last\n\n[[Page S12762]]\n\nparagraph. It is as simple as that. I read it as lending to the world \nan interpretation of what we have done and what we will do in the \nfuture as embracing some definitive timetable, and the President will \nhave to every 90 days address those key words and in doing so could \nwell complicate and jeopardize the next 120 days, which this Senator \nthinks is so critical.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me thank my good friend from \nConnecticut, particularly for his repeated reference to a Senator from \nMichigan whom we all hold in such huge esteem--particularly Michigan, \nbut it is not limited, obviously. We just put his portrait out in the \nreception room, one of the two Senators we have added in that reception \nroom. I believe there are only seven Senators whose portraits are \nthere. One of them is now Senator Vandenberg. I quote him often for \nmany purposes, including the bipartisan foreign policy that he \nespoused.\n  As the Senator from Connecticut pointed out, he also urged us to give \nour very best thinking and not to worry about being mischaracterized or \nbeing challenged in terms of patriotism because all of us, I believe, \nagree that when we give our best assessment of the path forward, the \nsuccess in Iraq, that we are all acting in the best of faith.\n  I know every colleague I either know of or do not know of is \noperating in the best of faith, total support for our troops, total \nsupport for their families, and how we can best succeed in Iraq. I \nbelieve we have to make some changes in our course. This amendment \nexplicitly suggests some of those changes in course. It will hopefully \nmake it more likely that we will succeed in Iraq.\n  One thing I know for sure, and that is that unless the Iraqis take \nhold, unless they put their political house in order, unless they do \nwhat this amendment says in both versions, that they make the political \ncompromises and the tough political decisions that are necessary for \nthem to be unified against the insurgency, unless they do that, there \nis no chance that they are going to succeed against this insurgency. \nThey must come together politically. That is what this amendment says.\n  This amendment provides that they also must understand that we are \nnot there for an unlimited period of time, because if they do believe \nthat we are there for an unlimited period of time, they are less likely \nto make the political compromises which must be made for them to unite \nagainst the insurgency. That is the reason the message is so important. \nAre we there for an unlimited period of time, as long as you need us? \nIs that the right message? Or is the right message that we are not \nthere for an unlimited period of time, we are not setting a date for \ndeparture, but we are putting you on notice, folks, you need to get \nyour political house in order so that you can defeat, with our \nassistance, that insurgency. And without that kind of coming together, \nthat military success is either unachievable or far more difficult.\n  That is the purpose of this amendment, and that is why the few words \nthat were in this version, which the Senator from Virginia would \nchange, are important words, to let the Iraqis know that the American \nmilitary forces are not going to be there indefinitely, because, again, \nif they think we are there as long as they need us, which is the way \nthe administration has phrased it, it is less likely that they are \ngoing to make the very difficult compromises that need to be made in \norder to put together a modified constitution around which all Iraqi \nfactions can rally.\n  That is one of the purposes of this amendment. The other purpose is \non the reports, which already, in this amendment which has been agreed \nto by my friend from Virginia, this amendment as written and as agreed \nto--there is no change to this--requires a schedule for meeting \nconditions. It requires a listing of variables that could alter a \nschedule. It requires that reasons be provided for any subsequent \nchanges to that schedule.\n  What is one of the conditions? One of the conditions is that there be \na campaign plan that must be met to provide for the transition of \nsecurity responsibility to Iraqi security forces. So that is one of the \nstated conditions, that there be this campaign plan provided to the \nCongress, and that plan provide for the transition of security \nresponsibility to Iraqi security forces.\n  Three times we make reference to a schedule and we make very clear \nthe conditions which must be laid out as to which conditions need to be \nmet when, including what are the number of the battalions in the Iraqi \nArmed Forces that can operate independently or take the lead in \ncounterinsurgency operations--all that seems to be agreed to. We have a \nschedule. We have to lay out the conditions. One of the conditions is \nhow many battalions of Iraqi Armed Forces need to be able to operate \nindependently. We lay all of that out.\n  But then in the last paragraph, when we use the words ``estimated \ndates'' rather than ``schedule,'' for some reason the use of the words \n``estimated dates'' creates a problem. Maybe it is not the words \n``estimated dates,'' maybe it is the words ``phased redeployment,'' but \nI would again remind my colleagues that, in our sense of the Senate, we \nset forth a goal that, in order to succeed in Iraq, we have to have \nsignificant transition in the year 2006, with Iraqi security forces \ntaking the lead, thereby creating the conditions for the phased \nredeployment of the United States forces. That is a goal stated and \napparently agreed to by my good friend from Virginia.\n  There is much in common here. I think the Senator from Connecticut is \nright. There is clearly a sense we have to do some things here to make \nit more likely that we are going to succeed in Iraq. That has to be \neverybody's goal, regardless of what our positions were going in or how \ncritical we are of the way this war is run. Our goal is to maximize the \nchances for success in Iraq.\n  But our amendment does have some differences. We should not paper \nover those differences. There are two differences, which the Senator \nfrom Virginia has pointed out and I have pointed out. I guess that is \nwhere it is going to rest when the Senate votes tomorrow.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, our magnificent service men and women, \nalong with allies and partners, are supporting the Iraqis as they \ndevelop their own concepts of democracy. Jointly we are improving \ninfrastructure, improving the internal security, and together \nconfronting the extremists.\n  By any fair objective political measure, the people of Iraq are \nmaking progress. In 1 year, the Iraqis elected a transitional \ngovernment, ratified a constitution, and are preparing to elect a \npermanent parliamentary government on December 15th.\n  During many hearings and briefings, the senior military commanders, \nparticularly General Abizaid has stressed that the extremist militant \njihadists are focusing on dominating a geographic area that extends \nfrom Spain to Indonesia. The tragic events in Jordan underscore the \naccuracy of that military analysis.\n  The al-Qaida group in Iraq claimed responsibility for the tragic \nattacks in Jordan against innocent Arab civilians. While portions of \nIraq remain focal points for terrorist attacks, the threat extends far \nbeyond.\n  This enemy seeks neither compromise nor coexistence with the United \nStates or others who do not share their world vision. The United \nStates, along with partners and allies, must continue their strong \nresolve and effectively address this threat. The civilized world has no \nchoice.\n  Of equal importance to the military mission in Iraq is the \ndevelopment of political structures and reconstruction of the \ninfrastructure. I, like many of you, have made a number of trips to \nIraq: I have seen progress.\n  Now I would like to specifically address the pending amendments \nrelated to our policy to achieve our military, political, and \nreconstruction goals in Iraq. While there are similarities, the \namendments differ on several major points.\n  Both amendments recognize the magnificent work being done by our \nArmed Forces; the unwavering support of their families at home; the \nimportance of political developments to take place in Iraq next year; \nthe necessity to put Iraqi Security Forces in the lead in securing \nIraq; and the requirement to keep the American people well informed of \nall aspects of the military, political, and reconstruction efforts in \nIraq.\n\n[[Page S12763]]\n\n  Both amendments call for the President to submit a quarterly report \non our progress in Iraq. While Congress already receives a number of \nreports and Members and committees in both bodies receive briefings \nfrom civilian and military leaders, this report from the President \nwould become the most comprehensive report on the situation in Iraq.\n  These are the three important differences between the two amendments.\n  No. 1 the reporting timeline--section c. The Warner-Frist amendment \ncalls for the first report 90 days after the enactment of the Act. \nNinety days allows the President sufficient time to assemble this very \nwide-ranging report. A report of this scope will require close \nconsultation with all departments and agencies of the Federal \nGovernment; American diplomats in Iraq and in the region; United States \nallied and partnered nations; and our military leaders here and in the \ntheater of operations.\n  The Levin amendment would allow for just 30 days of coordination and \nconsultation before submitting the initial report. I believe that is \ninsufficient time to produce a report as comprehensive as this.\n  No. 2 is section c. The Levin-Reid amendment calls for a completely \nunclassified report. The Warner-Frist amendment directs that the report \nbe unclassified to the extent possible. This is an important \ndistinction. Some information on international negotiations and \nagreements, and plans for Iraq's domestic security will be an integral \npart of the development of Iraqi security forces, this may be too \nsensitive to be presented in an unclassified forum. The Warner-Frist \namendment allows the President to produce a classified annex if the \nPresident and his advisors believe it is necessary.\n  No. 3 is a campaign plan with estimated dates for phased withdrawal--\nsection c(7). The Levin-Reid amendment asks for a campaign plan with \nestimated dates for the phased withdrawal of U.S. forces to be \npublished in the unclassified report. I believe that any program for \nthe withdrawal of American combat forces must be conditions-based, and \nlinked to specific, responsible benchmarks not just dates on a \ncalendar, per se. While I agree that we must continue to make it clear \nto the Iraqis that a program for withdrawal is a common goal, any \nannouncement of immediate withdrawal or even speculation of withdrawal \nbefore a secure and democratic Iraq is in place is simply not prudent.\n  I am concerned that the release of a timeline such as that in the \nlast paragraph of the Levin-Reid amendment now that announces our \nwithdrawal plans, even with estimated dates, could promote speculation \nand send an erroneous message to our troops, the Iraqi people, our \ncoalition partners, and the terrorists.\n  I urge you to vote for Warner-Frist amendment and that we follow \nLevin and Reid, rather than an entire new amendment to show how much we \ndo agree on and that this is an effort to seek partisanship.\n  We are down to two differences: the word ``indefinite,'' which to me \nprecludes the chance--could be construed as we would not leave a very \nsmall unit there to facilitate the logistic transfer, the need to bring \nup to a level of acceptability the armaments the Iraqis have; and the \ncontinuation of some security work as well as training. But I will not \nbelabor the point. I was very specific in the careful choice of words \nsubstituted for ``indefinite.''\n  The last paragraph--every Senator has to decide for himself or \nherself the clear meaning of the English language and whether that \ncannot be construed by many to invoke the thought of a timetable.\n  I say to my good friend, we have had a very good debate tonight. How \nfortunate we are that our distinguished colleague, a long-time member \nof the committee, the Senator from Connecticut, joined us.\n  I think we have done a good service to our colleagues who, in a very \nbrief period tomorrow, will be required to focus on this and cast their \nvotes accordingly.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I hope we have performed that service. I \nknow we all tried in good faith to do it. I am perfectly content, as \nthe Senator from Virginia is, that our colleagues read that last \nparagraph, read the paragraph before that making reference three times \nto schedules, read the entire resolution we have written, and then \ndetermine as to which is the better message to send to the Iraqis.\n  I am perfectly content to leave it rest there.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think the matter now is that the Senate \nshould go off the bill and I will proceed to do morning business.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Warner and ranking Member \nLevin for their leadership in bringing the fiscal year 2006 Defense \nauthorization bill, S. 1042, to the floor and shepherding it through to \nfinal passage after months of unfortunate delays.\n  Due to procedural limitations associated with the managers' amendment \nwhich included my amendments, it was impossible to have original \ncosponsors added. The following Senators are cosponsoring certain of my \namendments:\n  Senators Chafee and DeWine would like to cosponsor my amendment to \nprovide for mental health counselors under TRICARE, S.A. 2456; Senators \nNelson of Florida, Talent, Roberts and Harkin would like to cosponsor \nmy amendment to require a report on predatory lending directed at \nmembers of the Armed Forces and their dependents, S.A. 2468.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/14/senate-section/article/S12763-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On November, 7, 2005, in New York City, NY, Kyle Spidle was attacked \nnear the Monster Bar where he worked. The attack began when two men \nbegan yelling from a vehicle at Mr. Spidle about the way he was walking \ndown the street. When Mr. Spidle yelled back the pair of men got out of \nthe car and begin to beat him. According to police, the pair hurled \nhomophobic epithets at Mr. Spidle as they beat him\n  I believe that our Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nin all circumstances, from threats to them at home. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a major step forward in achieving that \ngoal. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current \nlaw, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/14/senate-section/article/S12763-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12763-S12764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     MONTANA'S BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Bryant \nElementary School, Chief Joseph Elementary School, and Huntley Project \nElementary School. Montana is proud and I am honored to recognize these \nthree schools identified as blue ribbon schools under No Child Left \nBehind.\n  As the spouse of a schoolteacher, I understand the many difficulties \nour schools face. Each and every day, parents send their children off \nto school to be educated, cared for, and disciplined. These three \nMontana schools have received this important award, and were honored \nlast week at the Department of Education. I thank the staff, teachers, \nand parents for their hard work to make such success possible. The Blue \nRibbon Award is no small achievement--students from these schools are \nin the top 10 percent of students across the State. I am honored to \nacknowledge them for their work.\n  Principals Howard Corey, Rick Knisely, and Russell Van Hook all \nunderstand the importance an education can have on the life of a child, \nas well as the significant role parents and the community play in the \ndevelopment of these future leaders. They should be\n\n[[Page S12764]]\n\ncommended for their leadership and vision which produced such \nmeaningful results.\n  I would be remiss if I did not recognize the students at each of \nthese institutions. While the adults have provided the foundation for a \npositive and educational classroom experience, ultimately the students \ndecide to succeed for themselves, meeting and exceeding the high \nstandards set for them. I am confident that we are raising the next \ngeneration of successful Americans to be productive and educated \nmembers of society. I am especially proud of the progress that these \nMontana students have made, and I urge them to keep up the good work. I \nam proud of each and every one of you. To the students, educators, and \nparents, thanks for all the good work you do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/14/senate-section/article/S12764-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING MAYOR JOHN O. COTANT\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President: I would like to pay special tribute \ntoday to a remarkable man who has dedicated the past 36 years of his \nlife to the citizens of Chubbuck, ID. Mayor John O. Cotant entered the \nChubbuck mayoral race the night before the elections in 1969. He won \nand has been mayor ever since. Through his dedication to youth and \ncommunity improvement, Chubbuck has become the thriving town of 10,000 \nit is today. Under his exemplary leadership, Chubbuck increased the \nnumber of city parks from 1 to 14. He initiated the construction of a \nmonument to veterans of our wars and his love of sports inspired him to \npromote a thriving youth sports program for the city. He brought \ncritical infrastructure improvements to the community, to position \nChubbuck for the vibrant growth it is experiencing today. John and his \nwife of 59 years, Alice, are the proud parents of 3, grandparents of 13 \nand great-grandparents of 19 children. He has been very involved in his \nchurch, serving as Bishop, the ecclesiastical teacher, of his LDS \nchurch congregation. At a robust 81, he says that he is going to pursue \nhis personal interests of genealogy and a collection of city \nmemorabilia, and make a point of not volunteering for anything \ncontroversial. I must say I understand the sentiment. Local public \nservants like John are the lifeblood of our civic community and our \ndaily lives in rural towns not just in Idaho, but across the Nation. As \na mayor of a smaller city, you are on duty and under the spotlight 24 \nhours a day. It is quite a testament to John's character, energy and \nspirit that he has served for so many years. I congratulate him on \nthree and a half decades of community commitment service and wish him \nand Alice the very best in the next exciting chapter of their life \ntogether.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/14/senate-section/article/S12764-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12764-S12766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS\n\n  The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and \nwere referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated:\n\n       POM-212. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to the ``Don't Ask, Don't \n     Tell'' military policy; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 11\n\n       Whereas, Since the 1994 codification into law by the United \n     States Congress, and by the signature of the President, the \n     policy now known as ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Pursue, \n     Don't Harass'' (National Defense Authorization Act of 1994 \n     (Public Law 103-160)) has led to the discharge of a great \n     number of lesbian and gay service members, thus ending their \n     careers and burdening them with a lifelong stigma; and\n       Whereas, The capacity of the Armed Forces of the United \n     States to carry out its missions, like the Global War on \n     Terror, is hindered when competent and qualified individuals \n     are involuntarily discharged from those forces; and\n       Whereas, The Armed Forces of the United States have been \n     forced to retain Reserve and National Guard service members \n     on active duty past standard deployment lengths in order to \n     carry out its missions during the Global War on Terror; and\n       Whereas, The ability of the Armed Forces to recruit and \n     retain the best and brightest Americans is hindered by \n     excluding a section of the population solely because of \n     sexual orientation; and\n       Whereas, Lesbian and gay service members have served \n     honorably throughout United States history and continue to \n     serve with distinction on active duty in the Global War on \n     Terror, including in Operation Enduring Freedom in \n     Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq; and\n       Whereas, These men and women have achieved military honors, \n     decorations, and promotions to the highest ranks of their \n     respective services for their valor and service to the people \n     of the United States; and\n       Whereas, America's allies in the war on terror, like the \n     United Kingdom, Australia, and Israel, all allow lesbian and \n     gay service members to serve openly; and\n       Whereas, The Department of Homeland Security, the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the \n     National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, \n     and other federal departments handling national security \n     allow their lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender \n     personnel to serve openly; and\n       Whereas, A February 2005 Government Accountability Office \n     report shows that more than 9,488 service members have been \n     discharged under the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy, \n     including at least 757 service members in ``critical \n     occupations,'' such as counterintelligence experts, at a cost \n     to taxpayers of more than $190 million; and\n       Whereas, The Department of Defense reported that 209 \n     language specialists have been discharged from the military \n     under the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy, including 54 \n     Arabic and 9 Farsi translators, vitally important positions \n     to intelligence gathering and in critical shortage; and\n       Whereas, Evidence from a study conducted by the Center for \n     the Study Of Sexual Minorities in the Military suggests that \n     the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy increases gay troops' \n     stress levels, lowers their morale, impairs their ability to \n     form trusting bonds with their peers, restricts their access \n     to medical care, psychological services and religious \n     consultations, and limits their ability to advance \n     professionally and their willingness to join and remain in \n     the services; and\n       Whereas, Every Department of Defense authorized study has \n     shown that there is no correlation between sexual orientation \n     and unit cohesion in the Armed Forces; and\n       Whereas, The majority of American citizens support keeping \n     trained and skilled openly gay and lesbian service members in \n     the military; and\n       Whereas, The United States military's readiness to protect \n     and defend our nation is severely compromised because of the \n     discriminatory ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy that is \n     arbitrarily enforced by commanders whose personal beliefs may \n     influence their disciplinary actions; and\n       Whereas, Discharges under ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' are \n     historically fewer when troop strength is low, as in times of \n     war, which denotes the tacit recognition by the military that \n     lesbian and gay service members are fit and capable of \n     military service, thereby further illustrating the arbitrary \n     enforcement of this policy; and\n       Whereas, California has 26 military bases which are home to \n     tens of thousands of military personnel and their families, \n     and, according to a 2004 Urban Institute study, an estimated \n     137,000 lesbian and gay veterans live in California; and\n       Whereas, The Legislature and courts of the State of \n     California have extended protections based on sexual \n     orientation and gender identity that affirm the equality \n     under the law of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender \n     citizens in order to prevent invidious discrimination; and\n       Whereas, In 2004 the California Legislature passed, and the \n     Governor signed, legislation that protects nonfederally \n     recognized personnel in the California State Military from \n     the threat of ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell''; and\n       Whereas, Military readiness is enhanced when every \n     qualified, capable American, regardless of sexual \n     orientation, is welcomed into our Armed Forces and has their \n     talents utilized in the best interest of our national \n     security; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of California, the \n     Assembly thereof concurring, That the Legislature of the \n     State of California respectfully urge the President and the \n     Congress of the United States to adopt the Military Readiness \n     Enhancement Act of 2005 (H.R. 1059) to end the discriminatory \n     federal policy of ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell''; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President of the United States, to \n     each Senator and Representative in the Congress of the United \n     States, and to the presiding officer of each house of each \n     state legislature of the several states.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-213. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to expressing \n     opposition to the study and construction of an international \n     border crossing in the Downriver area; to the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 57\n\n       Whereas, The Detroit-Windsor and Port Huron-Sarnia border \n     crossings of Southeast Michigan/Southwest Ontario are the \n     busiest international crossings in North America, \n     representing nearly 50 percent of the traffic volume crossing \n     the United States/Canadian border. In 2000, American trade \n     with Ontario reached $243 billion, which is larger than the \n     total U.S. trade with Japan; and\n       Whereas, More than 75,000 vehicles use the Southeast \n     Michigan/Southwest Ontario border crossings each day. Traffic \n     at the Michigan and Canadian ports of entry has grown 44 \n     percent from 19.7 million vehicles in 1990 to 28.4 million \n     vehicles in 2000. Truck traffic at these ports has more than \n     doubled from 2.5 million vehicles in 1990 to 5.1 million in \n     2000.\n\n[[Page S12765]]\n\n     Over the next thirty years, the cross-border traffic along \n     the Detroit-Windsor corridor is projected to increase 40 \n     percent in car traffic and 120 percent in truck traffic. This \n     corresponds to an increase in daily cross-border car trips \n     from 52,000 to 70,000 and an increase in daily cross-border \n     truck trips from 13,000 to 28,000; and\n       Whereas, The Canada-US-Ontario-Michigan Border \n     Transportation Partnership is conducting a Planning/Need and \n     Feasibility Study to examine existing and future cross-border \n     transportation problems and opportunities within the \n     Southeast Michigan and Southwest Ontario region. In June \n     2005, the partnership proposed several international crossing \n     alternatives that address these identified transportation \n     problems and opportunities. Each alternative would involve \n     massive reconfiguration to either the I-275 or I-75 \n     interchange area and significant expansion of either King \n     Road, Pennsylvania Road, or Eureka Road to connect the \n     proposed interchange areas to the river crossing plazas; and\n       Whereas, The Detroit River International Crossing Study \n     proposes 12 river crossing plazas along the riverfront from \n     Belle Isle to Grosse Ile. Four of the proposed plazas are \n     located in the Downriver area. The first plaza consists of \n     173 acres located on the northeast corner of Fort Street and \n     King Road in Trenton near the McLouth Steel property. The \n     second proposed plaza is located in Trenton on the east side \n     of Jefferson Avenue, north of King Road, on 217 acres owned \n     by McLouth Steel. The third proposed plaza consists of 85 \n     acres located at the Atofina Chemical Company, located south \n     of Pennsylvania Road, west of Longsdorf Street in Riverview. \n     The fourth proposed Downriver plaza is located at the Atofina \n     Chemical Company on 85 acres located off Pennsylvania Road, \n     east of Biddle Avenue, and south of Wyandotte Shores Golf \n     Club in Wyandotte; and\n       Whereas, The reconfiguration of an interchange, the \n     expansion of major roadways, and the construction of a plaza \n     will have adverse effects on the quality of life in \n     Downriver's 19 cities and townships. In particular, these \n     wholesale transportation-related transformations will lead to \n     plummeting property values that will have a devastating \n     financial impact on the whole of Wayne County, particularly \n     public schools. These changes will bring about excessive \n     traffic-related noise that may have to be mitigated by the \n     erection of intrusive noise barriers, thereby eroding \n     community aesthetics and fueling negative public perception; \n     and\n       Whereas, These transportation-related changes will also \n     result in increased passenger vehicle and truck traffic. \n     Residents near the recommended bridge plaza will face \n     unacceptable health risks from the degraded local air quality \n     caused by heavy-duty truck exhaust emissions. Heavy-duty \n     trucks burn diesel fuel and are major emitters of nitrogen \n     oxides and particulate matter. Nitrogen oxides emitted by on-\n     road vehicles are a major contributor to high ozone levels in \n     Southeast Michigan. The Downriver area will incur significant \n     costs just to control emissions from current vehicle traffic \n     in order to attain the federal ozone standard. Fine \n     particulate matter emitted by diesel and gasoline engines is \n     implicated as the cause of premature death in persons with \n     cardiac and/or respiratory ailments after short-term exposure \n     as well as being linked to an increased risk of lung cancer \n     following long-term exposure; and\n       Whereas, The partnership also proposes the construction of \n     one of three alternative bridges connecting the river \n     crossing plazas to Ontario via Grosse Ile. Anyone of the \n     alternative bridges would produce intolerable traffic noise \n     that could not be mitigated by noise barriers, vegetation, \n     buffer zones, or any other noise abatement method. The \n     proposed King Road plazas bridge would span Grosse Ile along \n     Horse Mill road, with an attendant plaza facility near Church \n     and East River Roads. This proposed facility would either \n     destroy or have a decidedly negative impact on hundreds of \n     privately-owned residences, a Presbyterian Church and \n     cemetery, a Roman Catholic Church and cemetery, sensitive \n     wetlands, marshes, woods and transitional prairies, and a \n     number of locations on the Michigan Register of Historic \n     Sites. The proposed facility would also obliterate the \n     historical landing site of Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, who \n     camped on Grosse Ile more than 300 years ago before \n     proceeding upriver to settle modern-day Detroit. The two \n     proposed Pennsylvania Road plaza bridges would extend over \n     Hennepin Point, located on the northern end of Grosse Ile. \n     Any one of the proposed bridges will pose significant \n     problems for pilots flying out of Grosse Ile Municipal \n     Airport; endanger the 27 species of waterfowl, 17 species of \n     raptors (eagles, hawks, and falcons), 48 species of \n     nonraptors (loons, warblers, neotropical songbirds, cranes, \n     and shore birds); and bring peril to numerous species of \n     dragonflies and butterflies that migrate to the Grosse Ile \n     coastal wetlands; and\n       Whereas, The construction of an international bridge \n     crossing in the Downriver area will have a detrimental impact \n     on the Detroit River, the first river to be designated a bi-\n     national Heritage River and an International Wildlife Refuge. \n     As such, the river's marshes, coastal wetlands, islands, \n     shoals, and other natural features are to be preserved and \n     restored to protect wildlife habitat. The Detroit River is \n     also a primary source of drinking water for Wayne County. \n     This is important because an international bridge crossing \n     may involve the dredging of the Black Lagoon, which is \n     directly downstream from the McLouth Steel property. \n     Sediments in this area have been well documented to contain \n     high levels of mercury, PCBs, cadmium, chromium, copper, \n     lead, zinc, oils, and grease, substances that are known to be \n     hazardous to humans, wildlife, and aquatic species. Lead \n     contamination levels in this vicinity also exceed human \n     contact standards. Moreover, the construction of an \n     international bridge will have injurious consequences on the \n     small streams, ponds, and other sensitive ecosystems of the \n     Downriver watershed caused by road salt runoff. Road deicing \n     salts are contributing to the gradual salinization of the \n     Detroit River and area groundwater supplies; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we express opposition to the \n     study and construction of an international border crossing in \n     the Downriver area; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Office of the Governor, the Michigan Department of \n     Transportation, the Federal Highway Administration, the \n     President of the United States, the President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-214. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to stem cell research; to \n     the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 17\n\n       Whereas, An estimated 128 million Americans suffer from the \n     crippling economic and psychological burden of chronic, \n     degenerative, and acute diseases, including diabetes, \n     Parkinson's disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease; and,\n       Whereas, Chronic, degenerative, and acute disease result in \n     extreme human loss and suffering for those who suffer from \n     them and their families and caregivers, and result in \n     hundreds of billions of dollars annually in medical treatment \n     and lost productivity costs; and\n       Whereas, Stem cell research offers immense promise for \n     developing new medical therapies for these debilitating \n     diseases and a critical means to explore fundamental \n     questions of biology and could lead to improved treatments \n     and potential cures for diabetes, Parkinson's disease, \n     Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord injuries, burns, cancer, \n     heart disease, and other diseases; and\n       Whereas, The United States has historically taken a leading \n     role in funding biomedical research and has been a haven for \n     open scientific inquiry and technological innovation, and, as \n     a result, is the preeminent world leader in biomedicine and \n     biotechnology; and\n       Whereas; On August 9, 2001, the President adopted a policy \n     that restricts federal funding for embryonic stem cell \n     research to a limited number of embryonic stem cell lines \n     that were in existence as of that time, and subsequent \n     research has found those existing stem cell lines to be \n     significantly limited in their ability to support stem cell \n     research; and\n       Whereas, The United States House of Representatives has \n     twice passed legislation to prohibit some forms of stem cell \n     research, but voted on May 24, 2005, to allow federal funding \n     for stem cell research using excess embryos from fertility \n     clinics; and\n       Whereas, California voters approved Proposition 71 in \n     November 2004, which will provide $3 billion over 10 years \n     for stem cell research in California; and\n       Whereas. The Legislature has enacted legislation declaring \n     that research involving the derivation and use of human stem \n     cells, human embryonic germ cells, and human adult stem cells \n     from any source, including somatic cell nuclear \n     transplantation, shall be permitted in California, calling \n     for the development of ethical guidelines for stem cell \n     research, and prohibiting human cloning; and\n       Whereas, In 2005, the National Academy of Sciences issued \n     guidelines for conducting human embryonic stem cell research \n     in an ethical and responsible manner; and\n       Whereas, Similar guidelines are being developed by the \n     California Institute for Regenerative Medicine and the State \n     Department of Health Services; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California hereby memorializes Congress and the President of \n     the United States to: (1) lift restrictions on federal \n     funding for stem cell research; (2) not impair the ability of \n     researchers to conduct stem cell research applications that \n     hold promise for developing therapies for treating and curing \n     chronic diseases; (3) develop ethical guidelines for \n     federally funded stem cell research; and (4) prohibit human \n     cloning; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-215. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania relative to the \n     Low-\n\n[[Page S12766]]\n\n     Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP); to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n       Whereas, The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program \n     (LIHEAP) was established by Congress as a federally funded \n     program providing energy assistance to low-income persons for \n     heating their homes; and\n       Whereas, Many Pennsylvanians received these energy \n     assistance grants for several years; and\n       Whereas, Natural gas, electric and home heating oil prices \n     have risen steadily over the past several years and are \n     predicted to be even higher for this winter; and\n       Whereas, Home heating oil prices are predicted to increase \n     by 52%; and\n       Whereas, Natural gas prices are predicted to increase by \n     36% or higher; and\n       Whereas, The Federal allocation for LIHEAP has remained at \n     $2 billion for years; and\n       Whereas, The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will receive $120 \n     million, the same amount it received last year; and\n       Whereas, More than 70% of eligible residential customers in \n     the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are not able to receive \n     assistance due to lack of funding; and\n       Whereas, Some increases in home heating prices is due to \n     devastation from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita; and\n       Whereas, While the Gulf Coast states were directly struck \n     by Hurricane Katrina and Rita, northeastern states have felt \n     the impact of the storms through a sharp increase in natural \n     gas, electric and home heating oil costs; and\n       Whereas, Gas companies in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \n     receive 80% of their natural gas supply from the Gulf Coast \n     suppliers; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania memorialize Congress to appropriate supplemental \n     LIHEAP funds as part of any disaster relief legislation to \n     assist those states which will be impacted by higher prices \n     and shortages in the midst of a predicted harsh winter; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Clerk of the United States Senate and the Clerk of the \n     United States House of Representatives.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-216.

A bill to provide protection against bovine spongiform \nencephalopathy and other prion diseases; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill to strengthen our \nNation's firewalls against prion diseases. This bill would prevent the \nspread of mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE. It \nalso addresses other forms of prion disease that affect humans and \nanimals.\n  For many years, we thought that we didn't have BSE in the United \nStates. But now we have to assume that the disease does exist in our \ncattle, though it has been detected only twice.\n  In June 2005, U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, officials \nannounced that a Texas cow had tested positive for BSE.\n  It is troubling that the USDA and Food and Drug Administration, FDA, \ninvestigation could not pin down how the cow became infected. Reports \ncompiled for the Texas Animal Health Commission and obtained by The \nDallas Morning News showed that 85 percent of the cattle traced in the \ninvestigation had already been sent for slaughter.\n  We should not settle for half-measures in BSE control. Yet nearly two \nyears after USDA and FDA announced efforts to strengthen our nation's \nfirewalls against BSE, critical gaps remain in our defenses.\n  Just last week, the Government Accountability Office released a study \nthat found that testing of cattle feed is at times too slow to prevent \ncattle from eating feed that might be contaminated.\n  Poultry litter, plate waste, and pet food can still be fed to cattle, \ncreating loopholes in the ruminant feed ban.\n  In addition, the USDA Office of the Inspector General has raised \nconcerns about the design of USDA's surveillance program, including \nwhether the Agency is appropriately selecting animals for testing and \ntesting an adequate number of older cattle.\n  To fully protect animal and public health, I am reintroducing my bill \nto strengthen our Nation's firewalls against prion diseases like BSE. \nMy bill would close loopholes in the ruminant feed ban. It would ensure \nthat all older cattle are tested for BSE. In addition, my bill would \nimprove enforcement of the feed ban and take steps to ensure that meat \nintended for human\n\n[[Page S12768]]\n\nconsumption is free of tissues that could harbor infectious prions.\n  The bill also would require the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to assess the risk of transmission of human prion diseases \nthrough blood and surgical equipment and strengthen surveillance of \nprion diseases in humans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2002\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to make permanent the authorization for watershed \nrestoration and enhancement agreements; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today \nreauthorizes a very successful cooperative watershed restoration \nprogram that I originally sponsored, and that was originally enacted \nfor the Forest Service, in the fiscal year 1999 Interior Appropriations \nbill. The original legislation lasted through fiscal year 2001 after \nwhich it was reauthorized by the Appropriations Committees, at my \nrequest, through fiscal year 2005 and then again through fiscal year \n2011. It is time this legislation had a full hearing in the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee and was made a permanent authority.\n  The bill making what is commonly referred to as the Wyden amendment \npermanent authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to use appropriated \nForest Service funds for watershed restoration and enhancement \nagreements that benefit the ecological health of National Forest System \nlands and watersheds. The Wyden Amendment does not require additional \nfunding, but allows the Forest Service to leverage scarce restoration \ndollars thereby allowing the Federal dollars to stretch farther. During \nthe 7 years the program has existed the Forest Service has leveraged \nthree dollars for every Forest Service dollar spent on these \nagreements.\n  The Wyden amendment has resulted in countless Forest Service \ncooperative agreements with neighboring State and local land owners to \naccomplish high priority restoration, protection and enhancement work \non public and private watersheds. The projects authorized by these \nagreements have improved watershed health and fish habitat through the \ncontrol of invasive species, culvert replacement, and other riparian \nzone improvement projects. In addition to ecological restoration, use \nof the Wyden amendment has improved cooperative relationships between \nthe Forest Service, private land owners, State agencies and other \nfederal agencies.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee will have a hearing on this program soon to highlight its \nsuccesses and that thereafter this legislation can pass the Senate \nexpeditiously.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2003\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
