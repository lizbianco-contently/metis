Mr. President, a small number of provisions of the USA \nPATRIOT Act are due to expire. Senate Democrats stand ready to provide \nlaw enforcement with all necessary tools to keep Americans safe from \nterrorism. Democrats supported the original PATRIOT Act that was passed \nin 2001. We supported the reauthorization bill that passed the Senate \nunanimously this past summer. And we support reauthorization of the \nPATRIOT Act now with modest improvements.\n\n[[Page S334]]\n\n  A reauthorization bill should continue to provide the Government with \nthe tools it needs to fight terrorism but must also include sufficient \nchecks to protect against potential governmental abuse of these \nexpansive powers. There is widespread bipartisan support for a \nreauthorization bill that will protect both national security and the \nrights of innocent Americans.\n  I applaud Senators Sununu, Craig, Murkowski, and Hagel for their \nprincipled stand on this issue. I urge the White House to work with \nthese Senators and with Senators Leahy and Specter to craft a bill that \nall Senators can support. If a compromise cannot be reached before the \nend of this week, we are willing to enact another short-term extension \nof the current law. There has already been discussion of a 6-week \nextension of the act to give negotiators time to finalize a long-term \nreauthorization bill. That approach will be satisfactory to this side \nof the aisle. We do not want the PATRIOT Act to expire. There is no \nreason it should.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/31/senate-section/article/S334-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session and resume consideration of \nCalendar No. 490, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Samuel A. Alito, Jr., of \nNew Jersey, to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10:20 a.m. shall be equally divided.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Chair clarify before the time \nbegins how much time we have now to debate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Right now the minority side has 12 \nminutes, 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. If he will be kind enough to notify me \nwhen I have reached 6 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Certainly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Schumer be \nrecognized to follow me for the remaining period of time allotted to \nthe Democratic side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, after voting on war, a vote on a Supreme \nCourt nominee is the most important vote a U.S. Senator can cast. The \nselection of a Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States is one \nof those moments when 100 Senators speak for the rights, the hopes, and \nthe dreams of 300 million Americans. Soon this Senate will vote on a \nlifetime appointment to the Supreme Court for Judge Samuel Alito. Judge \nAlito is likely to receive more ``no'' votes than any confirmed Supreme \nCourt Justice in the history of the United States, other than Clarence \nThomas. Why?\n  Two reasons: The first is Sam Alito's legal career which separates \nhim from the legal mainstream in America. The second is the judge whom \nJudge Alito would replace. This is no ordinary vacancy. This is the \nSandra Day O'Connor vacancy on the Supreme Court. In case after case \nduring her career, Sandra Day O'Connor has cast the fifth and decisive \nvote. Her votes helped preserve the constitutional rights that many of \nus cherish: workers' rights, disability rights, the right to privacy, \nthe separation of church and state, and the principle that in a \ndemocracy no man or woman is above the law.\n  As we prepare to vote for Justice O'Connor's successor, I am reminded \nof the words of Justice Harry Blackmun. Like Justice O'Connor, Justice \nBlackmun was a lifelong Republican. He was chosen to write the majority \nopinion in Roe v. Wade. In his dissent in a 1989 case that narrowed the \nprotections of Roe v. Wade, Justice Blackmun wrote:\n\n       For today, the women of this Nation still retain the \n     liberty to control their destinies. But the signs are evident \n     and very ominous, and a chill wind blows.\n\n  I may be wrong about Judge Alito. If I am, no one will be more \npleased. But I fear on this January morning in the Senate Chamber, a \nchill wind blows, a chill wind which will snuff out the dying light of \nSandra Day O'Connor's Supreme Court legacy.\n  When you read his record as a Justice Department lawyer and a Federal \njudge, it seems unlikely that Justice Alito will preserve Justice \nO'Connor's respected record of measure and moderation. In case after \ncase during his 15 years on the bench, Judge Alito has consistently \nsided with powerful special interests, big business, and the heavy hand \nof government against the individual. In many of these cases, Judge \nAlito was the lone voice. More than any of the 29 judges with whom he \nserved, Sam Alito stood alone. Rarely did he stand on the side of the \npoor, the powerless, and the dispossessed.\n\n  Over the past several weeks during our hearings, we looked closely at \nthe decisions he rendered. We heard about a case in which Sam Alito \nwrote a dissent denying a fair trial to an African-American defendant \nwho was forced to stand trial for murder before an all-White jury. We \nheard about the case in which Judge Alito was the only judge on his \ncourt to rule that the Constitution authorized a strip-search of a 10-\nyear-old girl not listed in the search warrant. We heard about a case \nin which Judge Alito was the only judge on his court to vote to dismiss \nthe case of a mentally retarded man who was the victim of a brutal \nsexual assault in his workplace. He voted to dismiss this man's case \nbecause his lawyer wrote a poor legal brief.\n  Judge Alito has consistently ruled against those whose lives have \nbeen touched by the crushing hand of fate. As an ambitious young lawyer \nseeking a job with the Reagan administration, Judge Alito wrote flatly:\n\n       The Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion.\n\n  As a judge, he voted to uphold a controversial restriction on \nreproductive freedom, a position later rejected by the Supreme Court \nand Justice O'Connor.\n  When I asked Judge Alito at his hearing, is Roe v. Wade settled law \nin America, he did the Federalist Society shuffle, dancing away from \nadmitting what he really believes. In all his words, never once would \nhe say what John Roberts said, that Roe v. Wade is settled precedent.\n  With Sam Alito's nomination, when it comes to privacy rights and \npersonal freedom, a chill wind blows for America.\n  In the area of Executive power, I fear that Judge Alito will do the \nmost damage to our constitutional rights and civil liberties. His \nhistory tells us he will be more likely to defer to the President's \npower than to defend fundamental rights. Judge Alito is a disciple of a \ncontroversial theory that gives Presidents extremely broad powers. The \nso-called unitary executive theory has been cited by the administration \nin more than 100 bill signings.\n  What it basically says, according to some of its proponents, is that \na President can ignore the laws he doesn't care to follow. I fear that \nJudge Alito will be an easy ally for this President or any President \nwho seizes more power than the Constitution ever envisioned.\n  Last Friday I was walking through O'Hare Airport. A woman in an \nairline employee uniform came by and said hello as she passed. Then she \ncame back to me.\n  She stopped me and she said: Senator, isn't this Alito thing really \nabout holding a President back from doing things he should not be \nallowed to do? Isn't this really about checks and balances? It was a \nwonderful moment, a moment when a person who is busy with their life \nand family paused to think about the values that make America so \nunique.\n  There are some who will cheer the elevation of Judge Alito to the \nSupreme Court.\n  Yesterday, the New York Times ran a story with the headline, ``In \nAlito, G.O.P. Reaps Harvest Planted in '82.'' The article lifted the \nveil behind the Alito nomination. It revealed that\n\n[[Page S335]]\n\nJudge Alito is among a small group of lawyers who have been precleared \nby the ultraconservative Federalist Society.\n  We all remember the fury on the far right when President Bush first \nnominated Harriet Miers for this opening. Ms. Miers was not one of \ntheir chosen few, so they hounded her until the President withdrew her \nname from consideration.\n  But the far right is rejoicing with the name of Sam Alito. For the \nvast majority of Americans, there is no rejoicing. When we look to the \nSupreme Court as the last refuge for our rights and liberties, Sam \nAlito is no cause for celebration; he is a cause for great concern.\n  On this January morning, a chill wind blows.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, how much time remains before I begin?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 5 minutes 15 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would it be possible to ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 2 minutes? I also ask unanimous consent that an additional 2 \nminutes be given to the other side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thought the leaders agreed not to ask \nfor additional time. Otherwise, I would not have an objection. I don't \nknow what Senators Reid and Frist said. They have the time set for an \n11 o'clock vote. So I am inclined to object unless----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is objection. The Senator \nfrom Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I renew the request. At the risk of being smitten, I \nthink we can afford 4 more minutes on a Supreme Court nominee.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will not object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in a few minutes, we will vote on the \nnomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court. In a few hours, \nwe will hear the President tell us about his view of the state of the \nUnion. Without doubt, Judge Alito today has the votes to win \nconfirmation. Without doubt, the President tonight will boast of his \nnominee's victory in this vote. But I must say that I wish the \nPresident were in a position to do more than claim partisan victory \ntonight. The Union would be better and stronger and more unified if we \nwere confirming a different nominee--a nominee who would have united us \nmore than divided us. Had he chosen such a person, the President could \nhave taken the lectern this evening and rightfully claimed the mantle \nof leadership in the United States of America. Instead, this is not a \nday of triumph for anybody except the conservative minority who caused \nthe President to capitulate to their demands when Harriet Miers was not \nto their liking. There will be more votes against this nominee than on \nany since Clarence Thomas, who was hardly a unifying figure.\n  Tonight, when the President announces, to applause, the fact of Judge \nAlito's confirmation, what he should really hear, because of the \npartisan nature of his choice, is the sound of one hand clapping. While \nsome may rejoice at Judge Alito's success, millions of Americans will \ncome to know that the lasting legacy of this day will be ever more \npower for the President and less autonomy for the individual.\n  While some may exalt at the packing of the Court with yet another \nreliable, extreme voice in the mold of Scalia and Thomas, millions of \nAmericans will be at risk of losing their day in court when they suffer \nthe yoke of discrimination. Some may celebrate the elevation of a Judge \nAlito to the Supreme Court, but millions of Americans will suffer the \nconsequences of a jurisprudence that would strip Congress of the power \nto make their lives better in countless ways.\n  Why, then, with so many Americans at risk, so many rights at \njeopardy, will Judge Alito win confirmation? What does his confirmation \nmean for the future of the Supreme Court? I have been thinking about \nthis long and hard. It is an important question, and I don't have an \neasy answer, but I believe several things are clear.\n\n  For one thing, even though Judge Alito has demonstrated a record of \nbeing well out of the mainstream on a host of issues, my friends from \nacross the aisle dutifully march in rigid lockstep when the President \nnominates one of their choosing but oppose those who do not share their \nvalues and visions. Republican Senators should be aghast at Judge \nAlito's endorsement of vast Executive power, and they should be alarmed \nat his rejection of a woman's right to choose.\n  The hill will be steeper when a nominee evades, as Judge Alito did, \nanswering questions about his core judicial beliefs. All evidence \npoints to the fact that he will still hold his constitutional view that \nthe right to choose is not protected in the Constitution, that he will \nstill believe the Federal Government doesn't have the power to regulate \nmachine guns, and the evidence supported the conclusion that he will \nturn back the clock on civil rights. But he was clever enough not to \nsay so directly. So that, too, has been a factor.\n  In the end, there is one more thing at work here. The American people \nhave grown accustomed to the umbrella of protection they have under the \nConstitution. They are loathe to believe that those rights could, with \none nominee, evaporate into thin air. Who can believe it? Who wants to \nbelieve it? Even though no nominee since Robert Bork has such a clear \nrecord of being opposed to so many things the American people hold \ndear, the public doesn't want to believe that Judge Alito will remove \nthose protections, even when the record is clear. Who wants to believe \nthat after 40 years, a single nominee to the Supreme Court could \neviscerate title VII? Yet that is just what his colleagues on the Third \nCircuit accused him of attempting to do. Who wants to believe that a \nsingle nominee, one so seemingly soft-spoken and erudite, would, with \nthe stroke of a pen, take average Americans' rights away and not give \nthem their day in court?\n  People naturally don't want to believe the worst. Perhaps people \nthink of Earl Warren and David Souter, who defied their President and \ndid not stroke as hard a line as their benefactors might have hoped. \nBut I say to the American people, the days of Warren and Souter are \nover. The days of stealth nominees whose views may not match the \nPresident are over. That is clear when a small minority pushed the \nPresident to withdraw Harriet Miers.\n  In the coming months and years, we will be watching the Court. We \nwill be watching the votes. We will be watching our two newest \nJustices. And make no mistake, we will make sure the American people \nunderstand the implication of these votes today. Elections do have \nconsequences. But votes such as these also have consequences on future \nelections, and I believe that when the American people see the actual \nCourt decisions which are rendered by the new Court, they will have a \nstrong and countervailing reaction.\n  Again, I wish President Bush could tonight claim to lead a united \ncountry, but with this nominee and with this vote, sadly, he cannot.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Indeed, it has been most distressing to me to see this nominee, the \nepitome of a restrained, principled and highly respected judge, be \nportrayed as some sort of extremist. It is beyond my comprehension, \nfrankly. Questions have been raised about different cases. Alito \nanswered each and every one of those questions in front of the \nJudiciary committee. Senator Schumer and I serve on the committee. He \nwas asked about them repeatedly. He was asked 677 questions, and he \nanswered a higher percentage of them than perhaps any judge in \nhistory--97.3 percent. A Clinton appointee, Justice Ginsburg, for \nexample, was only asked 384 questions, and she only answered 80 percent \nof them. Justice Breyer, another Clinton appointee, was asked 355 \nquestions, and he answered 82 percent.\n  So Judge Alito was most forthcoming. He was asked more questions and \ngrilled and grilled, and he answered them with skill, fairness, and \nreasonableness. He was unflappable in his testimony and so judicious in \nhis approach to every question. It was a tour de force, a real model of \nhow a judge should perform. I could not be\n\n[[Page S336]]\n\nmore proud of him and more proud of President Bush for nominating him.\n  They say this nomination divides the country. Whom does it divide? It \ndivides the hard left, who wants the Court to eliminate all expression \nof religion from public life. We see the words ``In God We Trust'' \nabove the door in this Chamber. We had a chaplain open this Senate with \nprayer. Are we going to have the Supreme Court come in and strike those \nthings down? People are very confused about those issues today. We have \npeople who want to get rid of religion from the public square. They \nknow they cannot achieve this by votes, so they want a judge to do \nthese things. They are not happy with the U.S. Constitution. They want \na judge to quote foreign law to reinterpret the words in our statutes \nand in our Constitution. That is not what the rule of law in America is \nabout.\n\n  We have had a lot of extreme cases redefining the meaning of \nmarriage. States have defined marriage since the founding of the \nRepublic. Now all of a sudden we have lifetime-appointed, unelected \njudges discussing, and some court finding, that the legislature's \ndefinition of marriage--people who are responsible to the people, the \nlegislative branch--is not correct. So the judges are now going to \nreinterpret that definition and make it say what they want it to say. \nThey are going to take people's private property, not for public use, \nas the Constitution says. Now the court says we can take even poor \npeople's homes so that someone can build a private shopping center. \nThat is not what the Constitution says.\n  I know of judges who thought it would be better policy if the \nConstitution said what they want it to, so they just made it say that. \nBut that is not a principled approach to the law; it is not the \nAmerican approach to law. President Bush said we don't need that kind \nof judge. We want judges who are faithful and principled to the rule of \nlaw. They say Judge Alito is extreme. That is not so. It is an \nincredibly false charge.\n  What about the American Bar Association? Those of us on the \nRepublican side have been somewhat critical of them over the years. The \nABA is pretty liberal in all of the resolutions it passes. Sometimes it \nis very liberal. We felt that liberal persuasion infected their \nevaluation of judicial nominees. But they still evaluate nominees in a \nvery careful way.\n  The American Bar Association reported to our committee, after \nsurveying 2,000 people, personally interviewing 300, having teams of \nscholars read all of the writings Judge Alito ever wrote or \nparticipated in, and then they voted among themselves. They talked to \nlawyers who litigated against Judge Alito when he was in practice and \njudges who served with him and litigants who appeared before him, \npeople who have known him, judges who served with him, and 300 were \ninterviewed in depth. This committee of the American Bar Association--\n15 of them from all over the country--reviewed all of that. Many of \nthem participated directly in the interviews. Sometimes, people will \ntell the ABA things they may not tell the newspaper, things that are \nbad about somebody. They came back with a unanimous conclusion that \nJudge Alito was entitled to the highest possible rating. The American \nBar Association, after a most intensive review, has given him the \nhighest possible rating. Would they have done that if they thought he \nwas an extremist? Would they have done that if they thought some of \nthese cases we have heard about were wrongly decided or extreme in any \nway? No, they would not. So did his colleagues on the bench. One of the \nmost extraordinary panels of witnesses I have ever seen involved judges \nwho served with him on the Third Circuit, not a rightwing circuit. The \nThird Circuit, if anything, is considered a moderate to liberal \ncircuit. It is in the Northwest, and Philadelphia is the seat of the \nThird Circuit. New Jersey is also in that circuit. Judge Alito served \non that bench for 15 years.\n\n  People have suggested that somehow he is a tool of President Bush. He \nhad a lifetime appointment on the Federal bench in the Third Circuit \nand has served for 15 years. He has not been a part of any of this \nterrorism stuff we have heard about or any of these rulings involving \nthe Administration. He hasn't been a part of it at all. He comes to it \nwith all his skills and intelligence as an honored graduate at \nPrinceton and Yale, where he served on the Yale Law Review. He will \nbring his insight into these cases, which is exactly what we want--an \nunbiased umpire to deal with the issues.\n  Mr. Stephen Tober and others explained how one gets a unanimous ABA \nrating. The American Bar Association panel repeatedly gave him high \nmarks. They said Judge Alito ``has . . . established a record of both \nproper judicial conduct and evenhanded application in seeking to do \nwhat is fundamentally fair.''\n  One of the three members of the ABA who testified was a civil rights \nattorney, an African American who represented the University of \nMichigan in that famous affirmative action quota case. He said this \nabout Alito. He said that all the people they contacted concluded that \nJudge Alito was held in ``incredibly high regard.''\n  The ABA witnesses said they were unaware of anyone who has claimed \nthat Alito intentionally did anything wrong with regards to the \nVanguard matter that has been raised repeatedly and I guess dropped now \nsince we haven't heard that much about it.\n  We now hear this interesting argument that we needed Harriet Miers. \nThey are now harkening back to Harriet Miers nomination, claiming the \nRepublicans are at fault for her withdrawal. Not one Republican Senator \nI am aware of ever said Harriet Miers should not be voted on or said \nthey would vote against Harriet Miers. Some raised questions about her \nexperience, as did Senator Schumer, who raised the issue a few moments \nago. When Harriet Miers was being considered, Senator Schumer said:\n\n       I think there are three places where Harriet Miers yet \n     hasn't sort of met the burden of proof. The first is \n     qualifications, the second is independence, and the third, \n     most importantly, we have to know her judicial philosophy.\n\n  So Senator Schumer, who is now asking that we have Harriet Miers, was \nraising serious questions about her a few weeks ago.\n  She withdrew. She withdrew because she was sitting at the right hand \nof the President during so many of these matters involving the war on \nterrorism. The other side had already made clear they were going to \ndemand her personal conversations, her personal documents, her \ncommunications with the President, which are legal documents protected \nby client-attorney privilege. She realized it was going to be a matter \nthat would probably not be acceptable to the Members of the Senate. It \nwould be an uncomfortable process for her, and she withdrew.\n  Mr. President, what is the remainder of the time on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the case we have heard the most about is \nDoe v. Groody. The allegation has been made time and again that Judge \nAlito ordered the strip search of a 10-year-old girl.\n  I was a prosecutor for nearly 15 years. I read the case. I was at the \nJudiciary Committee and heard Alito testify. I would like to share some \nthoughts about that case. The reason I would like to talk about it is \nbecause I would like for everyone who is hearing me talk to understand \nthat this is a typical example of distortion and misrepresentations of \nthe actions of Judge Alito. It is so wrong and so biased and so unfair \nthat it ought to embarrass those who made the charges against him. He \nclearly did the right thing, in my opinion and it has been \nmisrepresented. It is symbolic of what has been said about other cases \nthat I don't have time to talk about at this late date.\n  In Doe v. Groody, police officers were investigating a drug-dealing \ngroup at a certain house. They went to the judge and presented an \naffidavit to search that house and all persons on the premises. They \npresented adequate probable cause to believe that a drug-dealing \noperation was going on in the house, and the judge agreed.\n  There was a form for a search warrant and that said John Doe was to \nbe searched. In this case, the judge directly incorporated an affidavit \nattached to the warrant for purposes of probable cause. The affidavit \nis where officers asserted probable cause to search all persons on the \npremises. This was a magistrate in a State court\n\n[[Page S337]]\n\nyears before Judge Alito ever knew the case existed. He was sitting on \nthe Federal appellate bench at the time.\n  So officers go out and do a search, and a female police officer takes \nthe mother, along with the 10-year-old child, into the bathroom. She \nasks them to pull down their trousers and lift up their shirts so that \nshe could detect whether there were any hidden drugs or weapons. They \ndid not take off their undergarments, nor was there any intrusive \ntouching. The female officer saw no drugs hidden on the mother or the \ngirl, and that was the end of that until sometime later when the police \nofficers were sued personally for money damages.\n  When it came before Judge Alito, he concluded that the affidavit had \nbeen made a part of the warrant that asked for the privilege of \nsearching people on the premises, which gave the police officers at \nleast a reasonable basis to believe they had the authority to do so. \nThey got a warrant. They asked for this privilege. They thought, by \nattaching the affidavit to the warrant that they had the power to \nsearch everyone on the premises. I don't know what the right answer is \nlegally, but I do agree with Judge Alito that the police officer could \nreasonably have felt that they were operating under the law, and should \nnot be personally liable for money damages to some dope dealer.\n\n  American police officers need to pay attention to this matter if this \nis what my colleagues think is bad law. They get sued enough trying to \ndo their duty.\n  One of the more fabulous panels we ever had, I thought, were \ncolleagues on the bench who served with Judge Alito. Judge Edward \nBecker has been on the bench for 25 years, the full time that Judge \nAlito has been on that bench. One of the more respected appellate \njudges in America said these things about Judge Alito. This is a man \nthey are accusing of being some radical, some extremist. This is what \nJudge Becker, who has been on the Federal bench for 25 years, said: Sam \nAlito ``is gentle, considerate, unfailingly polite, decent, kind, \npatient, and generous. I have never once heard Sam raise his voice, \nexpress anger or sarcasm or even try to proselytise. He expresses his \nviews in measured and tempered ways.''\n  On integrity, Judge Becker says:\n\n       Judge Alito is the soul of honor. I have never seen a chink \n     in the honor of his integrity which I view as total.\n\n  On intellect:\n\n       He is brilliant, he is analytical and meticulous and \n     careful in his comments and his written word.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I conclude with these words:\n\n       He is not doctrinaire, but rather open to differing views \n     and will often change his mind in light of the views of a \n     colleague.\n\n  This is the man who has been nominated and who is entitled to \nconfirmation by the Senate. I thank the President and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nfrom 10:24 a.m. to 10:34 a.m. shall be under the control of the Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will vote no on the nomination of Judge \nAlito to the Supreme Court for three reasons: first, his expansive view \nof Executive power; second, his narrow view of the role of the \nCongress; and third, his grudging reading of antidiscrimination law \nreflecting a lack of understanding of congressional intent and the \nnature of discrimination in the 21st century.\n  First, Judge Alito's expansive view of Presidential power.\n  In November 2000, Judge Alito said that ``the unitary executive \ntheory . . . best captures the meaning of the Constitution's text and \nstructure.''\n  Justice Thomas in his Hamdi dissent lays out his views on the power \nof an unchecked unitary executive to wage war and exercise foreign \npolicy.\n  Although Judge Alito said his interpretation of the unitary executive \nwas much narrower and that he couldn't recall Justice Thomas using that \nterm, I find Judge Alito's explanation not at all convincing.\n  I understand the term ``unitary executive'' in the manner in which \nJohn Yoo--the administration's legal architect--conceives of executive \npower.\n  I asked Judge Alito whether he agreed with Professor Yoo's reasoning \nthat would allow the President under his absolute power--even in the \nabsence of an emergency or imminent threat--to invade another country, \nto invade Iran tomorrow, no matter what Congress says.\n  Judge Alito declined to answer this basic, fundamental question.\n  Traditionally ``conservative'' Justices, such as Robert Jackson, \nstrongly believed in the wisdom of checks and balances.\n  Judge Alito was asked repeatedly at the hearing about Justice \nJackson's famous concurring opinion in the 1952 steel seizure case. \nDuring the Korean War, President Truman attempted to nationalize the \nsteel mills in order to avoid a labor work stoppage that would have had \nnegative effects on the war effort. A 6 to 3 Supreme Court ruled \nagainst President Truman.\n\n  Justice Jackson put it this way about what was at stake:\n\n       [N]o doctrine that the Court could promulgate would seem to \n     me more sinister and alarming than that a President whose \n     conduct of foreign affairs is so largely uncontrolled, and \n     often even is unknown, can vastly enlarge his mastery over \n     the internal affairs of the country by his own commitment of \n     the Nation's armed forces to some foreign venture. . . . That \n     military powers of the Commander in Chief were not to \n     supersede representative government of internal affairs seems \n     obvious from the Constitution and from elementary American \n     history.\n\n  Justice Jackson also laid out a three-part framework for how to view \nsubsequent cases in which the President is arguing he's doing something \nunder his Commander in Chief authority--a framework the Rehnquist Court \nembraced as ``analytically useful'' in the 1981 case of Dames & Moore \nv. Regan. First, is the instance in which ``the President acts pursuant \nto an express or implied'' authorization of Congress. Second, ``when \nthe President acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial \nof authority.'' And third, when the President takes ``measures \nincompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress.''\n  Judge Alito showed remarkably little appreciation and understanding \nof this framework, at one point confusing prong two and prong three of \nJustice Jackson's framework. Judge Alito's record and his answers at \nthe hearing raise great concern that both individual freedoms and the \nseparation of powers are in jeopardy.\n  In 1984, Judge Alito wrote that he did not ``question the authority \nthat the Attorney General should have absolute immunity'' in cases \ninvolving wiretaps. This again signifies a willingness by Judge Alito \nto give the President and his officers dangerously expansive powers.\n  At his hearings, Judge Alito tried to distance himself from his \nprevious statement, claiming he was only doing the bidding of his \nclients. But at the same time, he refused to definitively say that he \ndid not personally believe his previous assertion.\n  It is also useful to note that we are currently in midst of a \npotentially endless war. The war on terror is almost 5 years old; and, \nunfortunately, shows no signs of abating. Will these expansive \nPresidential powers become a permanent fixture? What kind of powers do \nwe want our President to have in dealing with a war that may go on for \ndecades? Should our courts have no role?\n  In 1986, Alito drafted a proposal to make full use of presidential \nsigning statements in order to ``increase the power of the Executive to \nshape the law.'' It was yet another way to increase the power of the \nexecutive at the expense of the other branches.\n  Senator Leahy asked Judge Alito at the hearing, ``wouldn't it be \nconstitutional for the Congress to outlaw Americans from using \ntorture?'' This is exactly what the Senate attempted to do in voting \noverwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis to support the so-called McCain \nanti-torture amendment.\n  But when this legislation was signed into law by President Bush on \nDecember 30, 2005, he issued a ``Presidential signing statement'' \nstating basically that no matter what me legislation says on its face, \nhe could still order torture in certain circumstances. Specifically, \nthe statement read that the ``executive branch shall construe this \n[prohibition] in a manner consistent\n\n[[Page S338]]\n\nwith the constitutional authority of the President to supervise the \nunitary executive branch. . . .''\n  That is what is at stake with ``Presidential signing statements.'' As \nmy colleague Senator Leahy has pointed out, President Bush has cited \nthe unitary executive 103 times in these ``Presidential signing \nstatements.''\n  Judge Alito, at this hearing, responded to Senator Leahy's question \nabout whether Congress could outlaw torture this way:\n\n       Well, Senator, I think the important points are that the \n     President has to follow the Constitution and the laws. . . . \n     But, as to specific issues that might come up, I really need \n     to know the specifics.\n\n  To me this is a dangerous nonanswer and one that is entirely \nconsistent with President Bush's use of a signing statement to override \nCongress's outlawing of torture. The implications are very troubling.\n  Judge Alito's view of the Executive is what worries me most. He \nreferred to Justice Jackson in the Steel Seizure case many times. But I \nwant to read one, short quote by Justice Jackson.\n  Justice Jackson said in 1952:\n\n       With all its defects, delays and inconveniences, men have \n     discovered no technique for long preserving free government \n     except that the Executive be under the law, and that the law \n     be made by parliamentary deliberations. Such limitations may \n     be destined to pass away. But it is the duty of the Court to \n     the last, not first, to give them up.\n\n  I believe they'll be destined to pass away with this Justice.\n  To allow the President--whether this one or any future one--to be \nunconstrained in his or her powers; to be able to pick and choose which \nlaws he or she wants to follow, is unacceptable. The Supreme Court was \nintended by our Founders to serve as a bulwark against executive \noverreaching. Any nominee to the Court who doesn't agree is a nominee \nwho should not be confirmed.\n  Second, Judge Alito has a very narrow view of congressional power.\n  Judge Alito will very likely join with the present members of the \nCourt who have struck down three dozen federal laws in less than 20 \nyears--laws which said, for example, you can't have guns within 1,000 \nfeet of an elementary school; laws requiring a 5-day background check \nfor a handgun purchase; laws battling violence against women; laws \nrequiring the clean-up of low level nuclear waste; laws designed to \nensure freedom of religion; laws saying states can't steal somebody's \nideas and inventions.\n  This recent level of ``conservative'' judicial activism is more than \nsix times the rate over the history of our Republic. Over the first \nseven decades of the Court's existence, in comparison, only two federal \nlaws were held unconstitutional.\n  On his 1985 job application, Judge Alito wrote, ``I believe very \nstrongly in . . . federalism''--the principle that has been used by \nthis activist court to knock down Federal law after Federal law.\n  In an October 27, 1986, draft letter on behalf of Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for Legislative Affairs, John Bolton, Alito urged President \nReagan to veto the ``Truth in Mileage Act.'' Alito drafted these words \nfor President Reagan:\n\n       My Administration believes that the Constitution intended \n     to establish a limited Federal government, one that would not \n     interfere with the vast array of activities that have been in \n     the states' traditional concern. Over time, Congress has \n     taken steps to eviscerate that constitutional scheme by \n     legislating in numerous areas that should be governed by \n     State law.\n\n  Judge Alito continued his federalist activism on the bench. As a \njudge, he has fully embraced--and even aggressively sought to broaden--\nthe Supreme Court's federalism opinions, most centrally in his sole \ndissenting opinion in the Rybar case.\n  In that case, Judge Alito called federalism ``vital'' and said that \n``even today, the normative case for federalism remains strong.'' The \nmajority of his colleagues in that case sharply criticized Judge \nAlito's opinion:\n\n       While the dissent writes in the name of `constitutional \n     federalism' it recognizes that even Lopez abjures such a \n     requirement . . . but overlooks that making such a demand of \n     Congress or the Executive runs counter to the deference that \n     the judiciary owes to its two coordinate branches of \n     government, a basic tenet of the constitutional separation of \n     powers. Nothing in Lopez requires either Congress or the \n     Executive to play Show and Tell with the Federal courts at \n     the peril of invalidation of a Congressional statute.\n\n  At his hearings, Judge Alito did nothing to allay concerns that he \nwould continue to push this activist federalism agenda if confirmed to \nthe Supreme Court. For example, he refused to recognize the well-\nsettled nature of some of the Court's bedrock Commerce Clause \nprecedents. And as a Supreme Court Justice, he would no longer be bound \nto follow these precedents.\n  When asked about these issues by Chairman Specter and others, Judge \nAlito provided answers that reinforced my view that he has a very low \nregard for Congress's power to legislate. When Chairman Specter asked \nJudge Alito whether he would ``overturn [] congressional acts because \nof [Congress's] method of reasoning,'' Judge Alito gave the following \nanswer:\n\n       I think that Congress's ability to reason is fully equal to \n     that of the judiciary.\n\n  On its face, that may sound like a good answer; but it's not. Under \nthe rational basis test--a cornerstone of constitutional law--the \nSupreme Court has greatly deferred to Congress's judgment and reasoning \nability.\n  Under the rational basis test, the Supreme Court has historically and \nrightfully deferred to Congress's reasoning as to why it did what it \ndid--after all, this is the branch that can hold hearings; the branch \nthat can call witnesses; and the branch that can build a record . . . \nall things the Court can't do. Judge Alito's answer seems to question \nthis bedrock principle.\n\n  What does this mean? What is at stake here? Does Judge Alito agree \nwith those on the intellectual right who are attempting to reverse a \nhealthy consensus going back to the days of the Great Depression that \nour government can act as a shield to protect Americans from the abuse \nof powerful interests?\n  Michael Greve of the American Enterprise Institute puts it straight \nforwardly:\n\n       I think what is really needed here is a fundamental \n     intellectual assault on the entire New Deal edifice. We want \n     to withdraw judicial support for the entire modern welfare \n     state.\n\n  What is at stake if this view gains ascendancy in our Supreme Court?\n  If the Court is allowed to second-guess congressional judgment, a \nbroad range of vital Federal legislation could potentially hang in the \nbalance.\n  Can we protect the air we breathe? Can we keep arsenic out of our \ndrinking water? Can we keep tobacco companies from targeting our kids? \nCan we establish minimum national standards to provide equal \nopportunity and human dignity for society's most vulnerable members--\nour elderly, our disabled, women victimized by violence? That is all at \nstake.\n  Listen to the debates going on behind these constitutional issues. \nIt's about devolution of government. It is about stripping--as a matter \nof law--the right of the Federal Government to do much of anything \nother than provide the national defense.\n  Justice Thomas has voted to strike down over 65 percent of the \nFederal laws that have been challenged before the Supreme Court. \nJustice Thomas wrote in one of his opinions recently, ``If anything, \nthe wrong turn was the Court's dramatic departure in the 1930s.'' What \nmost view as a ``healthy consensus,'' Judge Thomas and others call ``a \nwrong turn.''\n  What is at risk if this view of the Constitution ever gained full \nascendancy? The Clean Air Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean \nWater Act, and the Endangered Species Act, all rely on the Congress's \ncommerce clause power.\n  The intellectual right is also determined to elevate private property \nat the expense of protecting our safety, well-being, and communities. \nUnder their reading of the appropriate language in the Constitution--\nthe takings clause of the fifth amendment--the only way to keep a \nchemical plant out of your neighborhood would be to compensate the \nchemical plant to not build because you are taking their property.\n  Our bedrock civil rights laws are also based on post-1937 \nconstitutional interpretations.\n  There also could be no Federal minimum wage and no maximum hour laws. \nWe wouldn't be having a debate about increasing the minimum wage \nbecause there wouldn't be one.\n  The consequence of this judicial philosophy is to shift power to the \nalready\n\n[[Page S339]]\n\npowerful and eliminate the ability of the less powerful to use the \ndemocratic branches of government to rebalance the playing field.\n  And the intellectual right understands that in order to shift power, \nyou need to focus on the courts. In 1988, a Reagan Justice Department \ndocument stated:\n\n       There are few factors that are more critical to determining \n     the course of the nation and yet are more often overlooked \n     than the values and philosophies of the men and women who \n     populate the third co-equal branch of the government, the \n     federal judiciary.\n\n  Obviously, every judge could impact the course of the Nation; but \nmost important are the nine Justices on the United States Supreme \nCourt.\n  And that is why Judge Alito was selected to our highest Court, a \nconsequence of which will be to threaten Congress's power to protect \nthe American people.\n  Third, Judge Alito lacks an understanding as to how prejudice plays \nout in the real world and has a very restrictive view of the \nantidiscrimination legislation Congress has passed.\n  Earlier this month, I was thinking about my vote as I was preparing \nto speak before a Martin Luther King, Jr., event. And I reread his \nletter from the Birmingham jail.\n  Everybody was telling him, ``We won. Give it up. Give it up.'' And \nhere is what he wrote, laying out a standard by which to measure \nourselves.\n  Dr. King wrote:\n\n       When you are harried by day and haunted by night by the \n     fact you are Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never \n     quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner \n     fears and outer resentments; when you [are] forever fighting \n     a degenerating sense of `nobodiness,' then you will \n     understand why we find it difficult to wait.\n\n  We shouldn't wait. We should own up to the fact that prejudice is \nstill around and has evolved. It's not the prejudice of the '60s when \nthey would say, ``we don't want any blacks here,'' or more descriptive \nterms.\n  Now it's more subtle. They say, ``we're not sure you'd fit in.'' New \nwords, for old sins.\n  All public officials, including judges, must understand prejudice \nstill lurks in the shadows. Judge Alito's record demonstrates that he \ndoes not look into the shadows.\n  There is no question Judge Alito has ruled a number of times for the \nlittle guy, women, and minorities, but it's mostly in cases where the \noutcome was clear. When it was a close call, time and again Judge Alito \nended up almost inevitably on the other side, many times dissenting \nfrom every one of his colleagues looking at the case.\n\n  Judge Alito disagreed with all 10 of his colleagues and would have \noverturned the jury in Barbara Sheridan's case, stating that an \nemployer ``may not wish to disclose his real reasons'' for making \npersonnel decisions.\n  In another solo dissent, he would have deferred to a corporation's \n``subjective business judgment.'' His other colleagues said his \napproach would ``eviscerate'' antidiscrimination law.\n  Our courts are where the less powerful are supposed to get a fair \nshake. Our courts are supposed to safeguard individuals against \npowerful institutions; they are where a single individual--even one \nwho's not wealthy or well-connected--is on the same footing as a \npowerful corporation.\n  I focused on discrimination cases to try to find out how Judge Alito \nreasoned. What I found troubled me, as did how he reasoned in other \ncases I asked him about, including the Family and Medical Leave Act \ncase.\n  Judge Alito told me that he ``can't know everything about the real \nworld.'' So, in this case, he discounted any gender-related connection \nto the sick leave provisions, despite the fact that one in four people \ntaking sick leave under the Act were women with difficult pregnancies, \nand one of the reasons we wrote the law was because we know about the \nstereotyping of women.\n  Now, I don't think Judge Alito is a bad guy, but it is clear he has a \nblind spot; a dangerous blind spot for millions of Americans who still \nsuffer from discrimination and stereotypes--however subtle or \nsophisticated.\n  To my colleagues who would say it is inappropriate to look at the \njudicial philosophy or substantive rulings of our nominees to the \nSupreme Court, I would ask the following rhetorical question. Can you \nimagine on that hot, steamy Philadelphia summer in 1787, with the \nFounders sitting on the second floor so no one could hear what they \nwere doing; can you imagine them saying, by the way, we are going to \nhave three coequal branches of government. Two of them will be \nscrutinized by the American people, and the presumption will be that \nthey are not entitled to the office unless a majority of the people \nconclude they should hold the office. But as for the third branch, all \nwe want to know is are they honorable, decent, and straightforward?\n  It is also useful to point out that it is right to subject nominees \nto the Supreme Court to more exacting standards than nominees to the \nlower courts, for as the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court \ndictates the judicial precedents that all lower courts are bound to \nrespect.\n  As a result, there are hundreds of lower court nominees I would \nneither have personally nominated nor would have voted for confirmation \nto the Supreme Court, but whom I did support for lower courts.\n  But the Supreme Court is different. Because the Supreme Court is not \nbound by precedent in the way lower courts are--a point Judge Alito \nagreed to at his hearing--the judicial philosophy of Supreme Court \nnominees is not only fair game; it is crucial. This is the reason I \nhave voted against a much higher percentage of Supreme Court nominees \nthan lower court nominees during my time in the Senate, from Bork to \nThomas, from Rehnquist to Roberts.\n  It is also important to remember that we currently have a Justice \nserving on the Supreme Court nominated by President Ford. We even have \njudges still serving in the lower courts appointed by Presidents \nKennedy and Eisenhower. From the early 1800s, in fact, the average time \nfederal judges spend on the bench has increased from 15 years to 24 \nyears. By that count, a Justice Alito may still be handing down \ndecisions in the year 2030.\n  Judge Alito, like Justice Thomas before him, has supported the \ntheories of strict construction and originalism. He stated:\n\n       I think we should look to the text of the Constitution and \n     we should look to the meaning that someone would have taken \n     from the text of the Constitution at the time of its \n     adoption.\n\n  According to originalist logic, many Supreme Court decisions that are \nfundamental to the fabric of our country are simply wrong. Perhaps even \nmore importantly, how would a Justice Alito deal with the big issues of \nthe future: for instance, can microscopic tags be implanted in a \nperson's body to track his every movement? Can patents be issued for \nthe creation of human life? Can brain scans be used to determine \nwhether a person is inclined toward criminal behavior? What about the \nquestions we can't even conceive of from this vantage point?\n  Twenty or 30 years into the future, what would a Justice Alito be \nsaying about important issues of the day? That is what makes today's \nvote so momentous.\n  And when I look at all the evidence before us--Judge Alito's \nwritings, his statements, his judicial records, his opinions, and the \nlittle we learned about him in these hearings--I am forced to conclude \nthat he should not serve on the Supreme Court. That is why I am voting \nno.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleague.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today after a thorough examination of \nthe nomination of Judge Samuel Alito, Jr., to the Supreme Court. After \nthat thorough examination, I cannot support the nomination of Judge \nAlito to the Supreme Court. I fear that a Justice Alito will narrow our \nrights, limit our freedoms, and overturn decades of progress. To \nconfirm Judge Alito to the Supreme Court would be to gamble with our \nliberties, a bet I fear the Constitution--and the American people--\nwould lose.\n  Generations of Americans have looked to the Supreme Court as more \nthan a simple legal tribunal asked to decide cases and controversies. \nRather, we expect the Supreme Court to guard our liberties, protect our \nrights, and--where appropriate--expand our freedoms.\n  This process of bringing life to the promises of the Constitution has \nnever\n\n[[Page S340]]\n\nmoved predictably--or smoothly. As Martin Luther King, Jr., once noted, \n``Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable. Every step toward \nthe goal of justice requires . . . the tireless exertions and \npassionate concern of dedicated individuals.'' Throughout American \nhistory, those ``dedicated individuals'' have fought on many \nbattlegrounds--from the steps of the White House and Congress, to the \ndangerous back roads traveled by the Freedom Riders. And somehow the \nfight always leads to the Supreme Court--it is there that these brave \nindividuals have found refuge and, through their victories, changed \nAmerica for the better.\n  Many of these victories are now identified with individuals through \nfamiliar case names: Brown v. Board of Education, Gideon v. Wainwright, \nBaker v. Carr and Miranda v. Arizona. Judge Alito has stated his \nallegiance to the principles of these cases--and we are grateful for \nthat. But we would expect any nominee to any court in this land to \nagree that schools should not be segregated and votes should count \nequally. That is a starting point. But we must dig much deeper to \ndiscover whether Judge Alito should serve as an Associate Justice on \nthe Supreme Court of the United States.\n  We must ask ourselves: how will Judge Alito view the next ``dedicated \nindividuals'' who come before him seeking justice? What of the next \nBrown? The next Gideon? We do not consider Judge Alito for a seat on \nthe bench in 1954 or 1965 but, rather, in 2006, and possibly 2036. \nGiven his narrow judicial philosophy--on display throughout his legal \ncareer--Judge Alito is unlikely to side with the next ``dedicated \nindividual.''\n  This narrow judicial philosophy is clear, for example, in his views \non civil rights. In his now famous 1985 job application, he took issue \nwith the Warren Court decisions that established one-person/one-vote, \nMiranda rights, and protections for religious minorities. These \nstatements leave the clear impression that his antagonism toward these \ndecisions--decisions that helped religious and racial minorities \nreceive protection from majority abuses--motivated Judge Alito's \npursuit of the law.\n  While Judge Alito claimed that he was merely describing his opinions \nas a young man, his judicial opinions suggest a more well-formed \nphilosophy of limited rights and restricted civil liberties.\n  He was in the extreme minority of judges around the country when he \nfound that Congress has no ability to regulate machine guns. His \nefforts to strike down portions of the Family and Medical Leave Act \nwere rejected by then-Chief Justice Rehnquist. He raised the bar to \nunreachable heights repeatedly in employment discrimination cases, to \nthe point where the majority of his court concluded that he was \nattempting to ``eviscerate'' the laws entirely.\n  His restrictive view of constitutional liberties was echoed in his \nthoughts about a woman's right to choose. In a 1985 job application, he \nexpressed a legal view that there was no such right and worked hard to \ncraft a legal strategy that would chip away at--and ultimately--\neliminate that right from the Constitution.\n  When asked about this, Judge Alito has said--in essence--that was \nthen and this is now. Yet even years after his work for the Reagan \nadministration, his narrow views on privacy echoed throughout his \nopinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. He would have placed more \nrestrictions on a woman's freedom than other conservative judges--\nincluding the woman he seeks to replace on the Supreme Court.\n  Even today, Judge Alito is unwilling to declare that Roe v. Wade is \n``settled law''--a pronouncement that Chief Justice Roberts made with \nease. Judge Alito affirmed that one person/one-vote, integrated \nschools, and some privacy rights were settled, but not a woman's right \nto choose.\n  In addition, Judge Alito's decisions call into question our right to \nbe free of police intrusion and government power. For example, Judge \nAlito, in disagreement with his colleagues in the Reagan Justice \nDepartment, argued that the police acted reasonably in shooting--and \nkilling--a fleeing, unarmed, teenage suspect. In many opinions as a \njudge, he deferred reflexively to the police in cases involving the \ninterpretation of search warrants--including one permitting the strip \nsearch of a 10-year-old-girl.\n  At a time in our history when the balance between our security and \nour civil liberties requires the active involvement of the courts, \nJudge Alito's deference to Presidential power concerns us. He promoted \nthe radical idea of a ``unitary executive''--the concept that the \nPresident is greater than, not equal to, the other branches of \nGovernment. Judges are meant to protect us from unlawful surveillance \nand detention--not simply abide the President's wishes.\n  Although it is the most important standard, judicial philosophy is \nnot the only measure of a nominee. We had hoped that Judge Alito would \nhave been able to satisfy the concerns we had with his record at his \nhearing. Instead, he chose to avoid answering many of our questions. \nHis inability or unwillingness to answer those questions in even the \nmost general manner did a disservice to the country and to his \nnomination.\n  For example, when questioned on his support for Judge Bork--calling \nhim ``one of the most outstanding nominees of the century''--Judge \nAlito answered that he was just supporting the administration's \nnominee.\n  When questioned about his membership in the Concerned Alumni of \nPrinceton, he said he could not remember this group--despite citing it \nwith pride in a job application.\n  When questioned about whether Bush v. Gore should have been heard by \nthe Supreme Court, Judge Alito said that he had not thought about it as \na judge and did not have an opinion.\n  In each of the six Supreme Court nominations that I have voted on, I \nhave used the same test of judicial excellence. Justices Souter, \nBreyer, Ginsburg, and Roberts passed that test. Judge Alito does not.\n  Judge Alito's record as a professional--both as a Justice Department \nofficial and as a judge--reflects something more than a neutral \njudicial philosophy. Instead, it suggests a judge who has strong views \non a variety of issues, and uses the law to impose those views.\n  Judge Alito has the right to see, read, and interpret the \nConstitution narrowly. And we have the obligation to decide whether his \nviews have a place on the Supreme Court. I have decided they do not, \nand so I will oppose Judge Alito's nomination today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/31/senate-section/article/S340-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S340-S348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NOMINATION OF JUDGE SAMUEL ALITO TO THE U.S. SUPREME COURT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nconfirmation of Judge Samuel Alito as an Associate Justice of the \nUnited States. In the months since President George W. Bush nominated \nJudge Samuel Alito as an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, I \nhave carefully considered his record. I evaluated his long history of \ngovernment service and his work on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nThird Circuit, and I have closely followed his confirmation hearings.\n  When I review all the evidence before me, I do not believe Judge \nAlito will be able to fairly apply the principles embodied in the U.S. \nConstitution. Our Constitution sets forth important civil rights and \nprivacy protections that are fundamental to our way of life today. In \nrecent years, these freedoms have been precariously protected by a \ndelicate balance on the Supreme Court, with Justice O'Connor frequently \ntipping the scales in favor of the civil rights and privacy protections \nthat so many Americans depend upon. I am disheartened by the reality \nthat so many of these freedoms will likely be eroded when Judge Alito \njoins the Court.\n  Judge Alito's approach to the law is not merely conservative, it is \nextreme. Judge Alito's opinions in race and gender employment \ndiscrimination cases have crafted a restrictive interpretation of civil \nrights laws that would make it much more difficult for women and \nminorities to prevail or even receive a jury trial. I am also troubled \nby Judge Alito's statement in his infamous 1985 job application that he \nwas ``particularly proud'' of his work in the Reagan administration, \nwhere he counseled the administration to restrict affirmative action \nand limit remedies for racial discrimination.\n\n[[Page S341]]\n\n  I cherish our system of checks and balances in Government, where each \nbranch of the Government is coequal with the other. I believe that it \nis critical that this balance, which our forefathers so wisely and \ncarefully created, is protected and maintained. However, Judge Alito \nsupports the ``unitary executive'' theory, an expansive view of \nPresidential powers that he and his colleagues set forth while working \nin the Office of Legal Counsel of the Reagan Justice Department. Since \njoining the Third Circuit, Judge Alito made it clear that he still \nholds the premise of the ``unitary executive'' theory to be true, and \nthis approach concerns me, especially in this political climate. This \napproach also undermines Congress's authority to protect the public. \nJudge Alito has ruled that Congress did not have the authority to pass \nthe Family Medical Leave Act or to enact a Federal ban on the \npossession or transfer of machine guns. In both cases, the Supreme \nCourt disagreed with Judge Alito's conclusions and upheld these \nprotections, demonstrating that Judge Alito's opinions are not in the \nmainstream.\n  I take my responsibility to provide advice and consent seriously. I \ncannot support Judge Alito's nomination. Unfortunately, Judge Alito is \nexpected to be confirmed as Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's replacement. \nThis means he will be in the position to affect a number of critical \nissues in the coming years. Important questions on privacy, the \nenvironment, Presidential power, and women's reproductive rights will \nall come before the Court to be resolved. With Judge Alito sitting on \nthe Supreme Court, I am very concerned about the direction the Court \nwill take our great Nation. Although during his hearings Judge Alito \npromised that he would not legislate from the bench, his record \nindicates otherwise. For the sake of our country, I am hopeful that \nJudge Alito will take seriously his commitments to uphold the \nprinciples of our Constitution.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President I rise to discuss the nomination of Judge \nSamuel A. Alito, Jr., to the Supreme Court to the United States.\n  After closely and carefully studying his record and recent testimony \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, I have decided to vote against Judge \nAlito's confirmation to the Supreme Court of United States.\n  Of course, it is vital that any lifetime appointee to the highest \ncourt in the Nation possess the breadth of experience and character \nnecessary to review the most significant, complex, and far-reaching \nlegal questions of our time.\n  But that is not enough. I see disappointing and clear evidence in \nJudge Alito's long record, rulings, and statements of dangerously \nskewing the balance and relationship between our branches of \nGovernment. I do not expect any nominee to the Supreme Court to predict \nand promise with certainty how he or she will rule in any and all \nfuture cases.\n  But I do expect nominees to make clear that they would protect the \nmost basic rights of individuals and the fundamental structure and \nfoundations of our democracy. Yet I cannot be sure that Judge Alito \nwould do either. Indeed, I question whether he would show due respect \nfor the authority of Congress or apply a necessary check to the reach \nof the executive.\n  Serving as that check has long been one of the Court's most solemn \nobligations. Today, that role is more important than ever. We have seen \nevidence of a National Security Agency's eavesdropping program \noperating in question of a legal framework and without due oversight. \nWe are seeing literally, in wartime, a President reach without probable \ncause or warrant at the expense of individual rights and the most basic \nprotections of the Constitution. Yet it is a question whether Judge \nAlito would adequately control that reach.\n  Judge Alito has a record of concern when it comes to placing and \nconsolidating the rights of the government over the rights of the \nindividual. Consider, for example, how Judge Alito would give virtually \nunfettered authority to the police to trample on the clear privacy \nprotections given to every American as demonstrated in his 2004 dissent \nin Doe v. Groody. In this case he would have upheld the strip search of \na 10-year-old girl and her mother, despite the fact that they were not \nsuspected of any crime nor named in any search warrant.\n  When asked at his hearing about this case, and his minority opinion, \nJudge Alito repeatedly sought to portray it as ``a rather technical \nissue,'' a question of whether the police affidavit should be \nincorporated into the warrant itself, and suggested that the police \nwere operating under time pressure.\n  These claims are inconsistent with the facts, as made clear by Judge \nAlito's colleague, then-Judge Michael Chertoff, now Secretary of \nHomeland Security. According to Judge Chertoff, the approach advocated \nby Alito in Groody ``might indeed transform the judicial officer into \nlittle more than the cliche `rubber stamp.''' The American people \ndeserve a Supreme Court Justice who understands how important privacy \nrights are to all Americans, even the most vulnerable. They deserve \nmore than just a rubber stamp.\n  History shows that our courts have often stood up to Presidential \noverreaching during wartime: protecting the right of habeas corpus \nduring the Civil War; forbidding the president from authorizing \ndomestic warrantless wiretaps during the Cold War; and in the War on \nTerror by an 8-to-1 margin, the Supreme Court held that the President \ncannot indefinitely detain American citizens without allowing them to \nchallenge their detentions before a neutral decisionmaker, another \npower this administration had claimed.\n  Worse still, in areas where precedent is sparse or dated--such as the \nwar on terror and the executive's power to carry it out--Judge Alito's \nrecord and testimony suggests that he is far more likely to defer to \nthe ideological ambitions of our President than the protection and \nrights of our citizens.\n  To be sure, there is nothing wrong with an aggressive executive, \nespecially at times of great peril. An aggressive executive, however, \nalso requires a strong and functional Congress, the responsive voice of \nthe people. I have questions, however, if Judge Alito's rulings will \nnarrowly define the law and therefore threaten the authority and \nability of Congress to govern effectively and affirmatively.\n  Writing in Chittister v. Department of Community & Economic \nDevelopment, Judge Alito wrote that parts of the Family and Medical \nLeave Act, FMLA, which allow employees to leave when they or family \nmembers are seriously ill, were not applicable against the States. When \npassing the legislation Congress had identified the importance of both \nmen and women in caring for young children and family members with \nserious health conditions.\n  Congress also pointed to the burden that family caretaking imposes on \nwomen. But Judge Alito denied those findings. He saw no ``existence, \nmuch less the prevalence, in public employment of personal sick leave \npractices that amounted to intentional gender discrimination in \nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause.''\n  This view essentially deflated Congress's ability to defend civil \nrights. He wrote: ``Even if there were relevant findings or evidence, \nthe FMLA provisions at issue here would not be congruent or \nproportional. Unlike the Equal Protection Clause, which the FMLA is \nsaid to enforce, the FMLA does much more than require nondiscriminatory \nsick leave practices; it creates a substantive entitlement to leave. \nThis is `disproportionate to any unconstitutional conduct that \nconceivably could be targeted by the Act.'''\n  The Supreme Court later rejected Alito's position on the FMLA.\n  Ultimately, the Commerce clause is about understanding Congress's \npower to protect our families and its ability to respond to threats \nthat immediately affect those families. In February, for example, the \nCourt is scheduled to hear arguments on the scope of the commerce \nclause in two critical cases that could restrict the geographic \njurisdiction of the Clean Water Act to one percent of its current \ncoverage.\n  In my State, we know how fragile our precious natural resources can \nbe. The Pacific Northwest is blessed with incredible beauty. But \nhabitat loss and other pressures threaten some of my State's most \niconic species, salmon that spawn our great rivers and birds that \ndepend on old growth forests.\n  We also know that how we treat those resources and that wildlife \nspeaks to our priorities as a people and a nation. How do we value our \ncommunities and ensure their safety? How do\n\n[[Page S342]]\n\nwe honor an individual's freedom and his or her rights?\n  While I do not expect any judicial nominee to prejudge future cases, \nI do expect all nominees to make their positions clear on protecting \nthe most basic rights of individuals and the fundamental structure and \nfoundations of our democracy. In the end, I cannot be sure that Judge \nAlito would do either.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I believe that Judge Alito has a record of \nconcern when it comes to placing and consolidating the rights of the \ngovernment over the rights of the individual, and he has not provided \nthe answers to adequately reassure the people of our Nation. I must \nconclude that he would neither show due respect for the authority of \nCongress nor apply a necessary check to the reach of the executive. \nWith great respect for the institution, I cannot vote to confirm Judge \nAlito to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, President Bush has nominated Judge Samuel \nAlito to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court. \nJustice O'Connor has had a remarkable career of public service. Her \nstrong and moderate voice on the Supreme Court will be missed. I was \nlucky to get to socialize with her and her husband through mutual \nacquaintances and recommend her book about growing up on a ranch in \narid Arizona--The Lazy B. She is an exceptional person.\n  As is the custom, Judge Alito sought a meeting with any Senator so \ninterested. For our meeting, I suggested the Capitol steps and he \nagreed since it was a warm sunny day. I thought it was appropriate to \nbe visually connected to two of the three branches of government as we \ntalked about constitutional issues. If confirmed, the decisions he will \nmake on the Supreme Court will affect the lives of Americans \nprofoundly.\n  Judge Alito has outstanding legal credentials and an inspiring life \nstory. However, I am greatly concerned about his philosophy on some \nimportant constitutional issues. In particular, I carefully examined \nhis record on executive power, women's reproductive freedoms and the \ncommerce clause of article 1, section VIII of the Constitution.\n  On executive power, it is likely that cases dealing with the fourth \namendment will be heard by the Supreme Court. The fourth amendment \nreads:\n\n       The right of the people to be secure in their persons, \n     houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches \n     and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall \n     issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or \n     affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be \n     searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n\n  To me this language is very clear that a warrant is required for a \nsearch. That premise is now being questioned regarding warrantless \nwiretaps.\n  At the Judiciary Committee hearings, Judge Alito was asked a question \non executive powers and warrantless wiretapping. He said he would have \nto determine ``whether the President's power, inherent powers, the \npowers given to the President under article 2 are sufficient, even \ntaking away congressional authorization, the area where the President \nis asserting a power to do something in the face of explicit \ncongressional determination to the contrary''.\n  The only power in article 2 that Judge Alito could be referring to \nwould be:\n\n       The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and \n     Navy of the United States. . . .\n\n  Judge Alito was also asked ``. . . is it possible under your \nconstruct that an inherent Constitutional power of the President could, \nunder some analysis or some case, override what people believe to be a \nConstitutional criminal statue?'' Judge Alito responded that this was \npossible, noting a ``possibility that that might be justified''.\n  How far do we want Commander in Chief stretched? As Justice O'Connor \nwrote in a recent case, ``a state of war is not a blank check for the \nPresident when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens''.\n  On the issue of Roe v. Wade as with other issues, I am less \ninterested in what Judge Alito wrote or said as a lawyer for his client \nthe Reagan Administration, than how he has ruled as a judge and how he \ntestified at his nomination hearing. As an appellate court judge, Judge \nAlito was the lone dissenter on Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a court \ncase reviewing the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act.\n  The Supreme Court wrote on this landmark affirmation of Roe v. Wade:\n\n       These matters, involving the most intimate and personal \n     choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to \n     personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty \n     protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of \n     liberty is the right to define one's own concept of \n     existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of \n     human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the \n     attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of \n     the state.\n\n  The five majority Justices, who wrote that, were all Republican \nappointees: two Reagan appointees, one each of Bush ``41'', Ford and \nNixon.\n  An important standard of law is the concept of stare decisis--it \nstands decided. At the hearing Chairman Specter asked Judge Alito to \ndiscuss his view of stare decisis. He responded:\n\n       It's not an inexorable command, but it is a general \n     presumption that courts are going to follow prior \n     precedents''. In the Supreme Court dissent on Casey, the \n     justices who arguably wanted to overturn Roe v. Wade wrote \n     ``stare decisis is not . . . a universal inexorable command.\n\n  Not only did Judge Alito rule in favor of the Pennsylvania Abortion \nControl Act as a lower court judge, he used the same language as the \nhigh court dissenters at his Supreme Court nomination hearing. Stare \ndecisis is not an inexorable command.\n  Additionally, at his nomination hearing Judge Roberts was willing to \ncall Roe v. Wade ``settled law'' but Judge Alito refused to make a \nsimilar statement.\n  The last point I would like to make concerning constitutional law is \non the commerce clause. As you know the Constitution creates a \nGovernment of limited power--Congress can only enact legislation in \nareas that are specifically set out under the Constitution. Congress is \nexpressly prohibited from enacting legislation in other areas, leaving \nthis authority to the States per the tenth amendment:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution . . . are reserved to the States respectively, \n     or to the people.\n\n  Every law enacted by Congress must be based on one of the powers \nenumerated in the Constitution. The Framers of the Constitution gave \nCongress broad power to regulate immigration, national security and \neconomic activity between the states, and left most other power with \nthe States.\n  However, section VIII of article 1 states that ``the Congress shall \nhave the power to regulate Commerce . . . among the several states''. \nThis is the commerce clause and it is the most powerful provision in \nthe Constitution providing Congress the authority to enact legislation \nin a host of areas--including environmental protection. A key Supreme \nCourt case regarding the commerce clause was in 1942 when the Supreme \nCourt upheld legislation that allowed USDA to set quotas on local wheat \ngrowing. The Court noted that while crops regulated may never actually \nenter into interstate commerce, such local activity, coupled with \nsimilar activity in other States as an aggregate has a direct impact on \ninterstate commerce. Since then using the ``aggregate effects test'' or \n``substantial effects test'' Congress has passed broad ranging \nenvironmental legislation such as the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act \nand the Endangered Species Act, all of which were signed into law by \nRepublican President Nixon.\n  While I agree there should be constitutional limits on legislative \npower, Judge Alito seems to have agreed with Justice Thomas who wrote:\n\n        I believe we must further reconsider our substantial \n     effects test with an eye toward constructing a stand that \n     reflects the text and history of the Commerce Clause.\n\n  Indeed in a dissent to a gun case heard before his court Judge Alito \nwrote:\n\n       In sum, we are left with no appreciable empirical support \n     for the proposition that the purely intrastate possessions of \n     machine guns, by facilitating the commission of certain \n     crimes, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce, and \n     without such support I do not see how the statutory provision \n     at issue here can be sustained.\n\n  What is noteworthy in this dissent is that Judge Alito was alone with \nall members of his appeals court ruling the other way.\n  If ``the aggregate or substantial effects tests'' are overruled as \nJustice\n\n[[Page S343]]\n\nThomas has advocated, federal environmental laws could be ruled \nunconstitutional. Indeed on February 21, the Court is scheduled to hear \narguments on two cases, Carabell v. United States and United States v. \nRapanos.\n  In both cases the lower court upheld protection of wetlands, which \nare currently protected under the Clean Water Act. Environmentalists \nargue that these wetlands are critical to the health of our nation's \nwater supply and wildlife habitat.\n  Industry groups argue that the Army Corps of Engineers has no \nauthority under the Clean Water Act to regulate ``isolated wetlands'' \nthat have no connection with ``navigable waters.'' This would be a \nmajor setback to the Clean Water Act.\n  The critical issue is whether under the commerce clause, Congress has \nthe authority to regulate non-navigable bodies of water within a single \nState. Based on the writing of Judge Alito, he would appear to side \nwith the faction what would greatly limit the ability of Congress to \nprotect such ``intrastate'' issues.\n  These constitutional issues, the scope of executive power, women's \nreproductive freedoms and the commerce clause are likely to be heard by \nthe Supreme Court in the coming months. I care deeply about these \nissues.\n  Believe me, having been an executive in government, I want to support \nPresident Bush's choice to the Supreme Court. The President did win the \nelection. He has made his promises and I have made mine.\n  I am a pro-choice, pro-environment, pro-Bill of Rights Republican and \nI will be voting against this nomination.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice \nis one of the most important duties the Senate performs under the \nConstitution. We should consider the nomination of Judge Alito \ncarefully and conduct our debate on this nominee with dignity and \nrespect.\n  The Supreme Court is the final arbiter of whether the laws of our \nland conform to the Constitution. Once confirmed to the Court, Justices \nserve for life, beholden only to the Constitution and the rule of law. \nIt is an awesome responsibility; and for such an important event, we \nmust have a confirmation process fitting of that responsibility. Too \noften in recent years, we have not.\n  Though the judicial branch of our government is supposed to be \nindependent of politics, the nomination and confirmation process has \nbecome far too political to the point that it no longer serves the \nNation's interests, regardless of partisan or philosophical \ndifferences.\n  Judge Alito, whom I have met and found to be an honorable, \nintelligent man, was placed in the unfortunate position of having been \nselected as a result of this process. As my colleagues know, he was not \nthe President's first choice to fill Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's \nseat. John Roberts was. After his nomination was switched to become \nChief Justice, Harriet Miers became the President's second choice. \nAfter she was attacked by members of the President's own party, her \nnomination was withdrawn. Again, politics prevailed.\n  Judge Alito's nomination was the President's third choice for this \nseat and, in many ways, a gesture to the organized interest groups of \nthe President's party who had derailed Ms. Miers' nomination. \nUnfortunately, it was a nomination of, by, and for politics.\n  This highly charged political process spilled over into the \nconfirmation hearings before the Judiciary Committee. To secure \nconfirmation, Judge Alito said as little as possible. The strategy was \nclear: hide, don't explain or embrace, your judicial philosophy.\n  The Supreme Court nomination and confirmation process has become a \ngame of hide-the-ball. It is a process that does not help to inform \nSenate deliberations, and it sadly leaves the American people \nuninformed about who will be sitting on this highest of American courts \nuntil it may be too late.\n  The chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee are not to \nblame for what has happened to the confirmation process. I also thank \nJudge Alito for his willingness to appear before the committee for as \nlong as he did. But the entire process is clearly not what the Framers \nof our Constitution intended. No one in America should be afraid to \nspeak his or her mind openly and honestly. The American people are \npoorly served by a process that places tactical politics above guiding \nprinciple.\n  If confirmed, Judge Alito will replace one of the most important \njustices on the Court today, Sandra Day O'Connor. Justice O'Connor is a \nconservative, appointed by a conservative President. Over time, she \nbecame a consensus builder on the Court who took great pains to strike \na careful balance in her opinions, never forgetting that the Court's \ndecisions have real consequences for real people. She was open-minded \nand independent. Her influence on the Court was tremendous and her \nreasoning always carried great weight. She did not prejudge cases and \napplied the law to the facts in a fair manner.\n  Justice O'Connor, who was appointed by President Reagan, was a swing \nvote on a number of important decisions. Whether you or I agree with \nher individual opinions or not, I think she acted responsibly: someone \ncommitted to equal justice under the law, who applied the law to the \nfacts as presented to her and did not ``overreach'' from the bench. She \nshowed proper respect for the legislative branch and was careful not to \ncater to Executive authority.\n  While Samuel Alito has solid qualifications to become a Supreme Court \nJustice, it is our duty to look deeper. Though we can never know how a \nJustice will decide a case before it is presented and argued, it is \nimportant to know, during the confirmation process, which principles of \njudicial philosophy will underlie a potential Justice's future \nconstitutional interpretations. We can give advice and consent to a \nSupreme Court nomination without this information or these insights, as \nthis Senate is about to do. But without this information and these \ninsights, we cannot give informed advice or informed consent.\n  It was never intended that the Senate be a rubberstamp, approving \neveryone the President nominated simply because he sent them to us. The \nFramers expected Senators to bring wisdom and understanding to the \ntask, not to simply check off boxes on an application form.\n  Judge Alito's record gives me cause for concern. And his testimony \nduring the confirmation hearings unfortunately did very little to \nlessen that concern. His opinions and dissents on the bench leave open \nvery serious questions as to how he views fundamental civil rights for \nall Americans and how he views protecting the individual rights of \naverage citizens, especially when they are threatened by powerful \nforces, including the government itself. Judge Alito's nonanswers to so \nmany questions presented to him at the confirmation hearing added to \nthose troubling concerns.\n  I have voted for conservative judges nominated by Republican \nPresidents many times. John Roberts was the most recent. But I must \noppose this nomination. I want my vote against confirmation to send a \nsignal to all who care that the Supreme Court nomination process has \nbecome far too political and far too removed from the original purposes \nset forth by the Framers of the Constitution.\n  It is time for all of us, Republicans and Democrats of every possible \nphilosophical persuasion, to stand up against a process that so poorly \nserves the people of the States we represent in this great body.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on this rainy morning in our Nation's \nCapital, we just learned the sad news of the passing of Coretta Scott \nKing. We are reminded again of the crucial role our courts played in \nmaking real the promises of our national charter, the Constitution. It \nwas the courts to whom Dr. Martin Luther King spoke, and they \nresponded.\n  The Nation mourns the loss of another civil rights leader and is \nreminded again of the vital role our courts play as the place where \nordinary Americans can turn for justice when justice is denied them. \nCoretta Scott King and her late husband, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., \nput their lives on the line to bring those promises to untold millions \nof Americans. Let us never\n\n[[Page S344]]\n\nsquander or take for granted all that has been achieved. Let us keep \ntheir dream alive.\n  That is why, since this debate began last Wednesday, I posed the \nfundamental question this nomination raises: whether the Senate is \ngoing to serve its constitutional role as a check on the President by \npreserving the Supreme Court as a constitutional check on the expansion \nof Presidential power.\n  This nomination now before us is an unacceptable threat to the \nfundamental rights and liberties for all Americans now and for \ngenerations to come. This President is in the midst of a radical \nrealignment of the powers of the Government and its intrusiveness into \nthe private lives of Americans.\n  I am concerned that if confirmed, this nominee is going to further \nerode the checks and balances that have protected our constitutional \nrights for more than 200 years. This is a crucial nomination, one that \ncan tip the balance of the Supreme Court radically away from \nconstitutional checks and balances and from the protection of \nAmericans' fundamental rights.\n  The vote that the Senate is about to take has real consequences, not \njust for the 100 of us in this body but for 295 million Americans. We \nstand in their shoes. We stand in the shoes of generations to come. The \nvote will determine whether Samuel Alito, Jr., replaces Justice Sandra \nDay O'Connor on the Supreme Court of the United States. A vote for this \nnomination is a vote against constitutional checks and balances. A vote \nfor this nomination is a vote against maintaining the fundamental \nrights and liberties of ordinary Americans.\n  Republican Senators have pretended that judicial philosophy and \npersonal views do not matter because judges simply apply the rule of \nlaw, as if it were some mechanical calculation. Personal views and \njudicial philosophy often come into play on close and controversial \ncases. We all know this to be true. Why else did Republican supporters \nforce President Bush to withdraw his previous nominee for this vacancy, \nHarriet Miers, before she even had a hearing? It mattered to them when \nthe nominee was Harriet Miers. And it matters now. The only difference \nis that those who hounded Harriet Miers to withdraw are confident that \nJudge Alito will pass their litmus tests. Harriet Miers failed their \nlitmus tests because, despite all the backroom whispers and public \nwinks and nods, her conservative opponents were not confident that she \nwould rule the way they wanted. Those from among the President's \nsupporters who castigated Ms. Miers wanted certain results. The \nPresident allowed his choice to be vetoed by an extreme faction within \nhis party, before hearings or a vote. As Chairman Specter has said, \nthey ran her out of town on a rail. Like the more than 60 moderate and \nqualified judicial nominees of President Clinton on whom Republicans \nwould neither hold hearings or votes--by what was in essence a pocket \nfilibuster. They do not want an independent federal judiciary. They \nwant certain results.\n  The President says he is fulfilling a campaign promise. I remind him \nof his biggest campaign promise to be a uniter and not a divider. He \ncould have nominated so many people who would have united this country, \nwould have gotten 90 to 100 votes in the Senate. Republicans and \nDemocrats would have felt united, and the country would have felt \nunited. But instead of uniting the country through his third choice--\nand this was his third choice--to succeed Justice O'Connor, the \nPresident has chosen to reward a faction of his party at the risk of \ndividing the country.\n  Those so critical of his choice of Harriet Miers were the very people \nwho rushed to endorse the nomination of Judge Alito. Unlike what has \nbeen said on this floor, the criticism of his choice of Harriet Miers \ncame from the Republican Party. But instead of rewarding his most \nvirulent supporters, the President should have rewarded the American \npeople for the unifying choice that would have broad support.\n  Think how much better America could have done. America can do better \nif we have consultation--here we didn't have it--to select one of the \nmany consensus conservative Republican candidates who could have \noverwhelmingly been approved by the Senate.\n  Judge Alito was asked at the hearing how he got to this nomination. I \nthink we understand the real answer to that question. It has little to \ndo with Judge Alito's family story and a great deal to do with the \npressures that forced the President to withdraw the nomination of \nHarriet Miers and this President's efforts to avoid any check on his \nexpansive claims of additional powers.\n\n  This is a President who has been conducting secret and warrantless \neavesdropping on Americans for more than 4 years. This President has \nmade the most expansive claims of powers since America's patriots \nfought the War for Independence to rid themselves of the overbearing \npower of King George III. He has done so to justify illegal spying on \nAmericans without the essential check of judicial oversight to justify \nactions that violate our values and laws against torture and protecting \nhuman rights, and in order to detain U.S. citizens and others on his \nsay-so--just on his say-so--without any judicial review or due process. \nThis is a time in our history when the protections of Americans' \nliberties are at risk, as are the checks and balances that have served \nto constrain abuses of power for more than 200 years.\n  The President wanted a reliable Justice who would uphold his \nassertions of power, his most extreme supporters want someone who will \nrevisit the constitutional protection of privacy rights, and his \nbusiness supporters wanted somebody favorable to powerful special \ninterests.\n  A Supreme Court nomination should not be conducted through a series \nof winks and nods designed to reassure the most extreme factions while \nleaving the American people in the dark. No President should be allowed \nto pack the courts, but especially the Supreme Court, with nominees \nselected to enshrine Presidential claims of Government power. The \nchecks and balances that should be provided by the courts, Congress, \nand the Constitution are too important to be sacrificed to a narrow, \npartisan agenda. A Democratic-controlled Senate stood up to Democratic \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt when he proposed a Court-packing scheme. \nThe Senate acted as the Senate should and so rarely does today, to say \n``no'' to a President. I will not lend my support to an effort by this \nPresident to undermine our constitutional checks and balances or to \nmove the Supreme Court radically to the right.\n  The Supreme Court belongs to all Americans, not just the person \noccupying the White House, not just to a narrow faction of a political \nparty. The President continues to choose confrontation over consensus \nand to be a divider rather than the uniter he promised Americans he \nwould be. Rather than sending us a nominee for all Americans, the \nPresident chose a divisive nominee who raises grave concerns about \nwhether he would be a check on Presidential power and whether he \nunderstands the role of the courts in protecting fundamental rights.\n  The Supreme Court is the ultimate check and balance in our system. \nIndependence of the courts and its members is crucial to our democracy \nand way of life. The Senate should never be allowed to become a rubber \nstamp, and neither should the Supreme Court.\n  As the Senate prepares to vote on this nomination, we should be \nmindful of Justice O'Connor's critical role on the Supreme Court. Her \nlegacy is one of fairness I want to see preserved. Justice O'Connor has \nbeen a guardian of the protections of the Constitution provides the \nAmerican people. Of fundamental importance, she has come to provide \nbalance and a check on Government intrusion into our personal privacy \nand freedoms. In the Hamdi decision she rejected the President's claim \nhe could indefinitely detain a U.S. citizen. She said not even the \nPresident is above the law. She upheld the fundamental principle of \njudicial review. She wrote that even war ``is not a blank check for the \nPresident when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens.''\n  The American people deserve a Supreme Court Justice who inspires \nconfidence that he or she will not be beholden to the President, but \nwill be immune to pressures from the Government or from partisan \ninterests. The stakes for the American people could not be higher. The \nappointment of the next Supreme Court Justice must be made in the \npeople's interest and in the Nation's interest, not partisan interest \nor the President's interest.\n  It is as the elected representatives of the American people, all the \npeople,\n\n[[Page S345]]\n\nthat we are charged with the responsibility to examine whether to \nentrust their precious rights and liberties to this nominee. The \nConstitution is their document. It guarantees their rights from the \nheavy hand of Government intrusion and their individual liberties to \nfreedom of speech and religion, to equal treatment, to due process and \nto privacy. I want all Americans to know that the Supreme Court will \nprotect their rights. I want a Supreme Court that acts in its finest \ntradition as a source of justice. The Supreme Court must be an \ninstitution where the Bill or Rights and human dignity are honored.\n  This is Judge Alito's single moment in his lifetime, the only moment \nin his lifetime, of accountability before the prospect of a lifetime on \nour Nation's highest Court. But it is also an accountability moment for \neach of the 100 Senators in the decision we reach on this crucial \nnomination because we have to speak for 295 million Americans.\n  I urge all Senators to consult their consciences and their best \njudgment before casting their votes on this critically important \nnomination. But, in good conscience, based on the record, I cannot, I \nwill not, vote for this nomination.\n  Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 25 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, obviously I am distressed for many reasons \nabout this nomination, not the least of which is everything Judge Alito \nsaid indicated he would not be a check and balance. I so wish--and I \nhave said this to President Bush personally--I so wish he had been a \nuniter and not a divider. We could be here with a Senate unanimously \napproving a nominee, instead of this divisive battle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nfrom 10:34 until 10:44 shall be under the control of the Senator from \nPennsylvania. He is now recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as the Senate moves toward the vote on the nomination \nof Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr., to be Associate Justice of the Supreme \nCourt, we are mindful of the very heavy responsibility under the \nConstitution which the Senate has for confirmation of a Supreme Court \nJustice for a lifetime appointment. There is no vote as important, \nexcept for a declaration of war or the resolution authorizing the use \nof force, which is the practical equivalent of a declaration of war.\n  In our society, the Supreme Court of the United States is the final \ndecisionmaker in, as the process has worked out, many cutting-edge \nquestions that come before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court decides \nthe issue of who shall live, who shall die--the decision which they had \nrecently on the Oregon law or the application of the death penalty. It \nis the final protector of civil rights, the adjudicator of the Commerce \nclause, as to what Congress can do by way of legislation, and its \nauthority and power is magnified because so many of the decisions of \nthe Court are on a 5-to-4 count. When we have Justice O'Connor retiring \nas the swing vote on so many cases, there is an even heavier air of \nresponsibility as we move through the confirmation process of Judge \nAlito.\n  It is our responsibility to examine the nominee in terms of his \nqualifications. Those qualifications have been established by virtue of \nhis educational background and his professional background. We have to \nmake a determination of his temperament, and I believe we saw poise and \npatience under a very difficult confirmation process. The confirmation \nprocess has evolved and, candidly, I think Judge Alito's was a little \ntougher, a little more confrontational than most. That is the right of \nthe Senators. But he certainly had ample poise and ample calm and \ndemonstrated steadfastness and temperament.\n  The tougher inquiry is when we bear in and focus on what he is going \nto do if confirmed? What are his jurisprudential approaches? I think we \nhave come too much to the point in our confirmation process of looking \nfor definite answers. Some have objected to the confirmation of \nnominees because there is no guarantee on how they will vote in certain \ncases. A nominee to the Supreme Court is not supposed to give \nguarantees. A nominee to the Supreme Court is supposed to respond as to \nfactors to be considered and give us an idea of his or her reasoning \npower. He or she is not supposed to give us guarantees on how they \nwould rule. This goes back to President Lincoln, who said we should \nloathe somebody who told us in advance how he or she would rule when \nnominated to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  There is a lot of anxiety about a woman's right to choose. I share \nthat anxiety and I share that concern. We have seen in the history of \nthe Court that early indications as to how an individual may feel about \na woman's right to choose will not necessarily be the determinant as to \nhow that nominee will vote when the nominee is a Justice on the Supreme \nCourt. We have the operative case on a woman's right to choose. It is \nCasey v. Planned Parenthood, decided in 1992. It retained the woman's \nright to choose but modified the rationale from Roe v. Wade in 1973. \nThe opinion was written jointly by Justice O'Connor, Justice Anthony \nKennedy, and Justice David Souter. Prior to their becoming Supreme \nCourt Justices, all had expressed opposition to abortion rights, \nopposition to a woman's right to choose. But when they came to the \nCourt and they took a look at the precedents, when they took a look, as \ntheir joint opinion said, on reliance, they sustained the principle of \na woman's right to choose.\n  While you had Judge Alito's statement in 1985, 21 years ago, about \nhis own view on the subject, he made it emphatic that as a jurist he \nwould look to precedent and his own personal views would not dominate \nhis thinking as he applied the law in a constitutional setting.\n  He was also questioned at length about his work in the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office on the Thornburgh case. Too much is made of what an \nindividual does in an advocacy capacity representing a client. But \nJudge Alito was questioned at great length about the philosophical \nunderpinnings of a woman's right to choose. He agreed with Justice \nHarlan's dissent in Poe v. Ullman about the Constitution being a living \ndocument. And he agreed with Cardozo in Palko v. Connecticut, that \nconstitutional interpretation represents the values of an evolving \nsociety. He went about as far as he could go without making a \ncommitment in advance.\n  When it came to the question of Executive power, here again he \ndescribed the philosophical underpinnings of the President's authority \nand he agreed with Justice O'Connor that a state of war does not give a \nPresident a blank check. He outlined the considerations going to \nJustice Jackson's concurrence in the steel seizure case, about how he \nwould face an issue on Executive power.\n  The Congress of the United States can do considerably more by way of \noversight on what the Executive does, and we are going to have a \nhearing next Monday on the President's power for surveillance. What is \nthe President's authority in the face of a statute, the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, which requires court approval for \ncertain surveillance operations? What are the President's article II \npowers as Commander in Chief? There could be a great deal more activism \nby the Congress. You don't have to wait for these cases to come to the \nSupreme Court of the United States. But if, as, and when the question \ndoes arise, I think Judge Alito outlined the jurisprudential \nconsiderations, and he is on target.\n  When it comes to congressional power, we could also do a lot more. \nThe Supreme Court has been insulting in its characterization of our \nreasoning power, striking down legislation to protect women against \nviolence, disagreeing with our method of reasoning, or striking down \nportions of the Americans With Disabilities Act, as Justice Scalia \nsaid, being a taskmaster. We are preparing legislation in the Judiciary \nCommittee to grant Congress standing to go to court to uphold the \nconstitutionality of our statutes.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 40 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. When you take a look at the values of an individual, who \nknows him better than the judges with whom he worked?\n\n[[Page S346]]\n\n  Seven judges came before the Committee to testify and they all \nauthenticated the conclusion that he does not have a predetermined set \nof values that he is going to try to force upon the country.\n  All factors considered, I think he is worthy of confirmation by this \nbody.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for \nJudge Samuel Alito, Jr., for Associate Justice to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. I am honored to have the opportunity to again participate in a \nnomination for the Supreme Court. The casting of our votes from our \nSenate desks, as set forth by Senate tradition, is indicative of the \nmeaningfulness and the importance of the confirmation vote for a \njudicial nomination to the Supreme Court. As before, I am humbled and \nhonored to represent my fellow Kansans in this manner.\n  Over the course of the hearings, the Nation has had an opportunity to \nlearn more about Judge Alito's character, professional experience, and \napproach to the law. It is clear that Judge Alito's educational \nbackground is quite impressive. The son of public school teachers, \nJudge Alito grew up in a family in which the importance of education \nand hard work were firmly rooted. His father, who arrived in the United \nStates as an infant, knew firsthand the struggles of growing up in \npoverty. His ability to pull himself up by his bootstraps and \nemphasizing education as the window to a better life laid a firm \nfoundation for his family.\n  It is no surprise that Judge Alito's exceptional educational \nbackground boasts of two formidable Ivy League universities--a notable \naccomplishment resulting from hard work and a keen mind. However, \nduring his testimony, his statements demonstrated that he fully \nrecognized what an opportunity it was to attend these renowned \nuniversities and took full advantage. He said:\n\n       It was a time of turmoil at colleges and universities. And \n     I saw some very smart people and very privileged people \n     behaving irresponsibly. And I couldn't help making a contrast \n     between some of the worst of what I saw on the campus and the \n     good sense and the decency of the people back in my own \n     community.\n\n  It is this type of commonsense that resonates with my Kansas \nconstituents.\n  One only needs to look at Judge Alito's resume to see his extensive \nexperience in both prosecuting and applying the law. His distinguished \ncareer includes almost 15 years as a Federal prosecutor within the \nDepartment of Justice, 3 years as the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, and \nmost recently, 15 years as a Federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Third Circuit. Judge Alito is well versed in the law. While \nsome have alleged that his decisions are biased and that he is an \nideologue with a political agenda, his record, his testimony, and the \ntestimony of his colleagues and others who have worked with him dispel \nthose allegations. During his confirmation hearing before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, Judge Alito stated:\n\n       The role of a practicing attorney is to achieve a desirable \n     result for the client in the particular case at hand, but a \n     judge can't think that way. A judge can't have any agenda. A \n     judge can't have any preferred outcome in any particular \n     case. And a judge certainly doesn't have a client. The \n     judge's only obligation--and it's a solemn obligation is to \n     the rule of law, and what that means is that in every single \n     case, the judge has to do what the law requires.\n\n  His fellow colleagues on the U.S. Court of Appeals affirm his \nopenmindedness, impartiality, and decisions based on the facts and the \nlaw. Notably, the American Bar Association--long viewed as the gold \nstandard among my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--reviewed \nJudge Alito's judicial background and gave him their highest rating of \n``Well Qualified.''\n  In a time of judicial encroachment in which courts are increasingly \nimposing their political will on the Nation, Judge Alito's judicial \nrecord demonstrates his efforts to stem that tide. In his testimony he \nrefers to the role of the judiciary as very important, but limited by \nthe authorities set forth in the Constitution. The judicial branch's \nresponsibility lies in interpretation and application of the law and \nnot enacting policy judgements. In other words, he is guided by the \nrule of law set forth by the Constitution. Others describe Judge \nAlito's judicial philosophy as a philosophy of restraint and in \naccordance with the rule of law. Other witnesses from a broad range of \nideologies who know Judge Alito confirm that he is measured and \njudicial in his decisions.\n  In closing, I would like to comment on the increasing political \nnature in which judicial nominees are subjected to during the \nnominations process. During my remarks on the nomination of now Chief \nJustice John Roberts, I highlighted the elevated level of partisanship \nin the Senate. This trend of partisan bickering further threatens the \ncomity and respect that has long been the standard for conducting \nSenate business. The tenor and manner of questioning, or grilling as \nreferred to in the news headlines, of Judge Alito frays the spirit of \nour constitutional fabric under which we operate. I call on my \ncolleagues to work together to raise the level of discourse in these \nhallowed Halls of Congress.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination of \nJudge Samuel Alito to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  Judge Alito's education, legal training, and judicial record have \npositioned him well to serve our Nation with honor and dignity on the \nSupreme Court. A graduate of Princeton and Yale, Judge Alito has more \nthan 30 years of legal experience. Over the years, he has served as a \njudicial clerk, a prosecutor, an appellate lawyer before both the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court. He has served as legal \ncounsel to the U.S. Government and most recently as a judge on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Third District. Judge Alito has a full breadth \nof experience in both criminal and civil cases as well as the trial and \nappeals phases of the judicial system.\n  I believe Judge Alito's record on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nThird District shows that he is a fair and impartial jurist. During his \ntenure on that court, it has been clear that he takes all legal \ntheories and arguments into account when making decisions and issuing \nrulings. Judge Alito is well respected by his colleagues and has even \nreceived their praise for the manner and tone he takes in working \nthrough the facts to arrive at a decision. I do not recall anyone \nquestioning his ability to do the job and in fact, he received a \nunanimous ``well-qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association, \nits highest rating.\n  While many have criticized Judge Alito's supposed judicial \nphilosophy, I believe that his written decisions and statements as well \nas his appearance before the Judiciary Committee confirmed his ability \nto set personal views and ideology aside so as to not cloud his \ninterpretation of the law. I commend Judge Alito for his poise and \ncomposure throughout one of the most arduous hearings in recent memory.\n  The time has come for Congress and the President to serve as a check \non the judicial activism that has become so prevalent in the judiciary \ntoday.\n  I believe that we must have judges that interpret the Constitution \nand the law rather than manipulate it to meet their personal \nideologies. Judge Alito fits that mold.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to support Judge Alito and look forward to \nhim becoming the next Associate Justice on the United States Supreme \nCourt.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Democratic \nleader is recognized time until 10:54.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in his opening statement to the Judiciary \nCommittee, Judge Samuel Alito asked, ``How in the world did I get \nhere?'' That rhetorical question raises a serious concern about him, \nand it has shadowed his nomination from the very beginning. The fact \nis, Judge Alito became President Bush's candidate to replace Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor only after the radical rightwing torpedoed the \nnomination of White House counsel Harriet Miers and insisted that \nsomeone with Sam Alito's ideology be put in her place. That is how \nJudge Alito ``got here.''\n  I continue to believe that Harriet Miers received a raw deal. She is \nan accomplished lawyer, a trailblazer for women, and a strong advocate \nof legal services for the poor. Not only was she denied the up-or-down \nvote that my Republican colleagues say every nominee deserves, but she \nwas never even\n\n[[Page S347]]\n\nafforded the chance to make her case to the Judiciary Committee.\n  I believe radical elements in the President's own party demanded that \nMiers withdraw not because of her lack of judicial experience as some \nexclaimed but because they were insufficiently confident she would \nsupport their extreme agenda. Remember, approximately 40 percent of all \npeople who have ever served on the Supreme Court had no judicial \nexperience.\n  The rightwing distrust of Harriet Miers and their immediate elation \nwhen Judge Alito was named raised my suspicions on the day that he was \nnominated. Those suspicions were heightened when Alito's 1985 \napplication for a job in the Reagan administration came to light. In \nit, Alito stated, ``I am and always have been a conservative.'' He \nspoke proudly of his work on behalf of the extreme agenda of the Reagan \nJustice Department, his disagreement with landmark rulings of the \nWarren Court in favor of equal rights, and his membership in rightwing \norganizations. In effect, the 1985 document amounted to Judge Alito's \npledge of allegiance to conservative, radical Republican ideology.\n  I don't propose the Alito nomination is on the basis of a 20-year-old \njob application. Instead, I view that document as a roadmap to Judge \nAlito's subsequent judicial opinions and speeches.\n  Judge Alito's judicial opinions have been largely consistent with his \nideological signals; that is, the signals he sent in the 1985 job \napplication. One of the most prominent and eminent legal scholars in \nall of America, Professor Cass Sunstein of the University of Chicago \nLaw School, who generally supported the nomination of Chief Justice \nJohn Roberts, analyzed Alito's opinions and found ``a remarkable \npattern'' of ``almost uniformly conservative'' dissents. Professor \nSunstein concluded that ``the real question about Alito involves the \ndisturbingly close link between his political convictions and his legal \nconclusions.''\n  My concern about Judge Alito falls into three broad categories. \nFirst, I fear he will not vindicate the role of the judiciary as a \ncheck on executive branch power. Second, he is a leader in the so-\ncalled federalism movement which would limit congressional power to \npass environmental laws and remedy other national problems. Third, in \ndisputes between ordinary American citizens and the powerful \ncorporations and government, Judge Alito is often--and too often--on \nthe side of the powerful and against the interests of the individual.\n  First, I am disturbed by Judge Alito's overall bowing to Executive \npressure, bowing to Executive power. At a time when President Bush \nasserted unprecedented authority over the lives of American citizens \nand the Republican-controlled Congress seems too willing to cede those \npowers to him, I cannot support the nomination of a judge predisposed \nto giving the President the benefit of every doubt.\n  In matters ranging from domestic spying to the use of torture, the \ncurrent President has effectively declared himself above the law. \nMeanwhile, a Congress controlled by the President's party has stripped \nthe courts of jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus cases brought by \nGuantanamo detainees, some of whom have absolutely nothing to do with \nterrorism. In the face of such profound threats to the separation of \npowers in our Constitution, we need a Supreme Court comprised of \nindependent and impartial judges willing to stand up to imperial \nPresidencies.\n  Rather than serving as a check on President Bush's abuses of power, I \nworry that Judge Alito will instead serve as a rubberstamp. Both on and \noff the bench, Alito's writings and opinions show a record of extreme \ndeference to Executive power, whether exercised by the President or by \nFederal and local law enforcement officials.\n  Even before he was a judge, Alito made a name for himself arguing for \nexpansive Executive power. As a Justice Department attorney, he wrote \nthat the Attorney General should have absolute immunity from lawsuits \narising from illegal wiretaps. He also argued on the side of a \nTennessee police officer who shot and killed an unarmed 15-year-old boy \nnot because the officer believed the boy was armed, but to prevent \nescape from a petty crime.\n  Alito's judicial rulings on executive power heighten my concerns in \nthis area. In the recent decision of United States v. Lee, he found \nthat an FBI undercover probe that included audio and video surveillance \nof the defendant's hotel suite without a warrant did not violate the \nFourth Amendment.\n  The government wins, you lose.\n  In an earlier case in which Judge Alito voted to uphold the strip-\nsearch of a 10-year-old girl, then-Judge Michael Chertoff, now \nPresident Bush's Secretary of Homeland Security, criticized Alito's \nviews as threatening to ``transform the judicial officer into little \nmore than the cliche `rubber stamp.' ''\n  Again, government wins, you lose.\n  Judge Alito's unshakable deference to police officers conducting \nintrusive searches seems to extend to his view at the power of the \nPresident to act unilaterally when setting national policies.\n  In a speech to the Federalist Society in November 2000, he professed \nhis strong belief in the so-called ``unitary executive'' theory of \nconstitutional law, a theory embraced by those who advocate for \nexpanding executive powers at the expense of the judicial and \nlegislative branches of government.\n  Judge Alito's disturbing views on the constitutional separation of \npowers is also reflected in his refusal to condemn laws in which \nCongress strips courts of jurisdiction to hear certain disputes. For \nexample, Senator Leahy asked the nominee if Congress could strip the \nSupreme Court of jurisdiction over all cases arising under the First \nAmendment. Alito declined to respond directly, saying the matter was \nthe subject of academic dispute.\n  These comments lead me to doubt that Judge Alito fully appreciates \nthat the role of the courts is to protect constitutional rights and \nliberties in the face of an overreaching majority.\n  Second, I am concerned that Judge Alito would limit the authority of \nCongress to address environmental protection and other national needs. \nI fear that Alito would join Justices Scalia and Thomas in their \nactivist campaign to narrow congressional power under the Commerce \nClause, a movement that threatens important public health and welfare \nlaws in the name of ``federalism.''\n  Once again, the roots of Judge Alito's ideology can be found in his \nwork during the Reagan Administration. As Deputy Attorney General in \n1986, Judge Alito recommended that President Reagan veto the Truth in \nMileage Act, a law designed to prevent odometer tampering, because ``it \nviolates the principles of federalism.''\n  And again, Judge Alito seems to have carried his Reagan-era ideology \nwith him when he joined the Third Circuit. In the Chittester case, for \nexample, he held that Congress lacks authority to allow State employees \nto enforce aspects of the Family and Medical Leave Act. His logic would \ncripple the ability of Congress to help people with real problems, such \nas those who are disabled. Again, government wins, you lose.\n  There is every reason to fear that Judge Alito will work to continue \nthe Court's unwarranted restriction of Congressional power in these \nareas.\n  Third and finally, Judge Alito's nomination troubles me because in \nhis 15 years on the bench he has repeatedly and consistently favored \nthe power of government and corporations over the rights of individual \nAmerican citizens. As many commentators have observed, Judge Alito \nhardly ever sides with the proverbial ``little guy.''\n  The government wins, you lose.\n  A Knight-Ridder review of Alito's 311 published opinions on the 3rd \nCircuit Court of Appeals found that Judge Alito very rarely supports \nindividual rights claims. In a separate study, Professor Sunstein found \nthat Judge Alito ruled against the individual in 84 percent of his \ndissent--84 percent of the time.\n  Again, government wins, you lose.\n  In civil rights cases, Judge Alito has often voted to impose higher \nbarriers for people with claims of discrimination.\n  In Bray v. Marriott Hotels--a case dealing with race discrimination--\nhis colleagues said Title VII of the Civil Rights Act ``would be \neviscerated'' if Alito's approach were followed. Again, big business \nwould win, and you would lose. And in Nathanson v. Medical College of \nPennsylvania, he dissented in a\n\n[[Page S348]]\n\ndisability rights case where the majority said: ``few if any \nRehabilitation Act cases would survive'' if Judge Alito's view were the \nlaw.\n  Again, big business and government wins, you lose.\n  Perhaps the most important instance when the rights of an individual \nconflict with the interests of the government are when the state seeks \nto carry out the death penalty.\n  How anyone could come up with the conclusion of Judge Alito's is \nreally hard to understand.\n  Senators Leahy and Feingold asked Judge Alito whether it would be \nunconstitutional to execute an ``unquestionably innocent man.''\n  The obvious answer from anyone would be quite clear. It would be \nplainly unconstitutional. But Judge Alito refused to say so. Instead, \nhe spoke in bland bureaucratic terms about the need for the innocent \nperson to file the proper petitions under proper Federal rule.\n  Remember, the question was, ``Would it be unconstitutional to execute \nan unquestionably innocent man?'' Of course, it would.\n  That was a chilling moment. If the Constitution means anything it \nmeans that the state cannot put to death an ``unquestionably innocent'' \nperson. If Judge Alito cannot say that without equivocation, he is not \nthe kind of judge I want on the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  These three broad concerns about Judge Alito's record on the bench \nare all the more troubling in light of the fact that Judge Alito has \nbeen nominated to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a national icon \nwho has been a voice of moderation and reason on the Court for the last \nquarter of a century.\n  President Bush was not obligated to nominate a clone of Justice \nO'Connor. But this President has no mandate to move the Supreme Court \nand American law in a radical rightward direction. That is precisely \nwhat replacing Justice O'Connor with Judge Alito will accomplish.\n  That Judge Alito has been nominated to replace Justice O'Connor is \nrelevant in another sense. Justice O'Connor was the first of only two \nwomen ever to sit on the Supreme Court. It remains disturbing to me \nthat she would be replaced by a man, leaving only one woman on the \nnine-member Court.\n  Today, more than half of the nation's law students are women. There \nare countless qualified women on the bench, in elective office, in law \nfirms, and serving as law school deans. I can't believe the President \nsearched the country and was unable to find a qualified female nominee. \nBut maybe he was unable to find a qualified female nominee who \nsatisfied the radical far right wing of the Republican Party.\n  Meanwhile, for the third time, this President has turned down the \nopportunity to make history by nominating the first Hispanic to the \nCourt. How much longer must Hispanics across America wait before they \nsee someone on the nation's highest court who shares their ethnic \nheritage and their shared experiences?\n  I have no doubt that Sam Alito is a decent man.\n  But a confirmation debate is not a popularity contest. The rights and \nliberties of the American people are at stake. This particular \nnomination raises profound questions about our system of checks and \nbalances.\n  We need to ask whether a Justice Alito will serve as an effective \ncheck on a swaggering President and his reckless policies.\n  At this critical moment in our Nation's history, I cannot support the \nconfirmation of this nominee to fill this vacancy on the Supreme Court \nof the United States.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the majority \nleader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, at the end of a debate in the Senate there \nis rarely a question of whether everything has been said--only whether \nevery Senator has said it.\n  After 92 days since this nomination was announced, after 30 hours of \nJudiciary Committee hearings, after Judge Alito answered more than 650 \nquestions, and after 5 days of debate on the floor of the Senate, there \nis little left to be said. So I will be brief.\n  To President Bush I say thank you. To President Bush I say thank you \nfor nominating such an exceptionally qualified individual as Sam Alito \nto serve on the Supreme Court.\n  To my Senate colleagues I say well done to the supermajority of \nSenators who joined yesterday to elevate principle above partisan \npolitics and defeat an unjustified filibuster of this nomination.\n  And to Judge Alito I say: You deserve the seat on the Supreme Court. \nToday, you will become the 110th Justice to serve on the Court \nthroughout America's history. It is a seat that is reserved for a few \nbut that impacts millions. May the Constitution and rule of law be the \nlight that illuminates each case that comes before you.\n  So, momentarily, we will vote from our desks, a time-honored \ntradition that demonstrates, once again, how important and \nconsequential every Member takes his duty under the Constitution to \nprovide advise and consent on a Supreme Court nomination and to give \nthe nominee the fair up-or-down vote he deserves. It is time to call \nthe roll.\n  There is only one thing left to say. I ask for the yeas and nays on \nthe nomination of Samuel Alito to serve as Associate Justice of the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Samuel A. Alito Jr., of New Jersey, to be an Associate Justice of \nthe Supreme Court of the United States? On this question, the yeas and \nnays have been ordered. Senators are requested to vote from their \nseats.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair admonishes all present that no \nreaction to a Senate vote is permitted under Senate rules.\n  The result was announced--yeas 58, nays 42, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 2 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--58\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--42\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Bernanke, of New \nJersey, to be a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Ben S. Bernanke, of New \nJersey, to be Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise this morning in support of the \nnominations of Benjamin S. Bernanke to be a member and the Chairman of \nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n  In November of 2005, I chaired our Banking Committee hearing \nregarding this nomination, and we heard from Dr. Bernanke on a wide \nrange of economic issues. In reporting this nomination to the floor for \nconsideration, I would reiterate that President Bush has made a superb \nappointment in selecting Dr. Ben Bernanke for this position.\n  This nomination is of great importance to our Nation and our economy. \nAs the central bank, the Federal Reserve has the responsibility for \nconducting monetary policy to maintain maximum employment, stable \nprices, and moderate long-term interest rates. As the U.S. continues to \nlead the world economy, sound stewardship of the Federal Reserve also \naffects the global marketplace.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve would certainly have a big enough \njob to do if he were tasked only with serving as head of the central \nbank of the United States. But his job also entails the supervision and \nregulation of financial institutions, including some of the largest \nfinancial entities in the world. The Federal Reserve must ensure the \nsafety and soundness of these institutions and monitor any potential \nfor systemic risk. The American consumer also counts upon the Federal \nReserve to foster the fair and efficient delivery of services to \ncustomers of financial institutions.\n  The Federal Reserve also plays a major role in operating the Nation's \npayment system. Evolving technology continues to change the way we pay \nfor goods and services. The Federal Reserve must oversee these \ninnovations and adaptations and make certain the U.S. payment system is \neffective, reliable, and safe.\n  For nearly two decades, it has been impossible to raise the topic of \nthe Federal Reserve without also mentioning Alan Greenspan, and I will \ndo so briefly here today. Alan Greenspan has been the face and the \nvoice of the Federal Reserve for over 18 years. Today he is chairing \nhis last session of the Federal Open Market Committee.\n  Chairman Greenspan has made a big impression on all of us--here in \nCongress, our Nation, and across the world. During his tenure, the U.S. \neconomy and our financial system have withstood a number of significant \nshocks, including the stock market crash of 1987, the Asian debt crisis \nwhich affected capital globally, and, of course, the catastrophic \neffects of 9/11, which hit the heart of the U.S. financial industry and \nwhich affected all of us and our economy in many ways.\n  Chairman Greenspan also oversaw the longest economic expansion in \nAmerican history. Because of our economic success, even in the face of \ngreat challenges, some consider Chairman Greenspan to be the greatest \ncentral banker of all time. I commend Chairman Greenspan for his \nexemplary service and dedication to our country.\n  Now it is time for a transition at the Federal Reserve System. As I \nnoted, this will be the first time in nearly two decades that the \nCongress has had a new nominee before us for consideration. Certainly \nstepping into Mr. Greenspan's shoes will be a tremendous challenge.\n  While it may seem a daunting task to follow as distinguished a \nchairman as Alan Greenspan, we should be mindful of two things.\n  First, in 1987, many observers wondered whether an economist named \nAlan Greenspan could successfully follow in the wake of the vaunted \nPaul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Each person who sits \nin the Chairman's seat has the opportunity to make that position his \nown and to become a leader in his own right. That is what has been \ndone, in large part, due to the caliber of the men who Presidents of \nthe United States have chosen for the task.\n  Second, I would also note that many individuals who hold diverse \nviewpoints on other topics are in agreement that President Bush has \nselected the best possible candidate to serve as the next Federal \nReserve Chairman. Indeed, Dr. Ben Bernanke may well be the finest \nmonetary economist of his generation. He has both a distinguished \ncareer in academia as well as in the policymaking arena.\n  The list of his experience and achievements is long. I do not have \nenough time this morning to mention all of them, but I want to mention \nsome of his most important qualifications because his nomination \nrequires someone with the rare expertise that Dr. Bernanke has \nacquired.\n  As he moves on to become the Federal Reserve Chairman, Dr. Bernanke \nwill be completing his duties as Chairman of the President's Council of \nEconomic Advisers. During his service at the CEA, Dr. Bernanke provided \nthe President and our Nation with sound economic advice on a variety of \nsignificant policy issues. But before his service at the Council of \nEconomic Advisers, Dr. Bernanke served with great distinction as a \nmember of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from \n2002 to 2005. This experience gives him an inside knowledge of the \nFederal Reserve and the financial markets.\n  Dr. Bernanke has earned the tremendous respect and confidence of \npolicymakers in this country as well as around the world. He previously \nserved as chair of the economics department at Princeton University, \nand prior to that tenure he was an associate professor of economics at \nthe Graduate School of Business at Stanford University. He also served \nas a visiting professor of economics at New York University and at the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. He was the director of the \nMonetary Economics Program of the National Bureau of Economic Research. \nIn 1975, he received his B.A. in economics from Harvard University, \nwhere he graduated with honors. In 1979, he received his Ph.D. in \neconomics from MIT.\n  It will be difficult to follow the long and successful tenure of Alan \nGreenspan. Dr. Bernanke is an excellent choice for the job. Few \nindividuals have this mix of practical and academic experience, \nespecially his prior experience at the Federal Reserve. The Banking \nCommittee reviewed this nomination thoroughly, and we believe Dr. \nBernanke will serve this country well at the helm of the Federal \nReserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words on behalf \nof Dr. Bernanke. But before I do, I would like to state for the record \nwhat a great pleasure it has been to work with Dr. Greenspan. It was an \nhonor to have had the opportunity to hear his testimony in committee \nand to work with him on public policy issues. I wish him well as he \nmoves on to other endeavors. The country is forever grateful for his \nservice as Chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n  I had an opportunity to sit down and visit with Dr. Bernanke. I was \nimpressed not only with him personally but also with the conversation \nwe had and his record. He is going to bring a lot to the Fed. I join \nthe chairman of the Banking Committee in support of Dr. Bernanke.\n  Dr. Bernanke is known for his tough stance on fighting inflation. \nMany expect that Dr. Bernanke's views on interest rates will be similar \nto Dr.\n\n[[Page S350]]\n\nGreenspan's because of his stance on controlling accelerating inflation \nwith interest rate hikes. When I had a chance to visit with him, he \nstressed the importance of communication and transparency. As Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve, that is going to be a big part of his \nresponsibilities.\n  He argued that the final say on debts and deficits lies with the \nPresident and the Congress. I couldn't agree more that we need to do \nmore to control deficit spending and the debts we have accumulated over \nthe years. Dr. Bernanke shared with me that his first priority will be \nto maintain continuity with the policies and strategies established \nduring the Greenspan years.\n  We have to recognize Dr. Bernanke for what he has already \ncontributed. He is one of the world's leading experts on the subject of \nhow central banks, such as the Fed, should set interest rates and cause \nthe money supply to expand or contract. The combination of Dr. \nBernanke's academia, intellect, and his work for and with the Fed will \ngreatly facilitate his transition as the new chairman of the Federal \nReserve.\n  Wall Street and the investment world seemed to like the nomination of \nDr. Bernanke as the new Chairman of the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones \nIndustrial was up some 169.78 points. It was the biggest 1-day point \npercentage gain since last April. So the response from Wall Street has \nbeen good.\n  Dr. Bernanke spent 20 years at Princeton as a professor of economics \nand public affairs. He also served as the chairman of Princeton \nUniversity's economic department. Before being appointed to the \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisors, he served as a Governor of \nthe Federal Reserve. His current and past positions have groomed Dr. \nBernanke and serve as an apprenticeship to succeed Chairman Greenspan.\n  Dr. Bernanke was widely considered one of the leading candidates to \nreplace Dr. Greenspan as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. I was glad to \nsee the President make his appointment, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting Dr. Bernanke as Chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland controls 30 minutes. \nThe Senator from Alabama has 18 minutes 43 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts who wishes to speak on a different subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Sarbanes are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I join my able colleague from Alabama in \nsupporting the nomination of Ben Bernanke to be a member and Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. We will be voting on a 14-\nyear term on the Board of Governors, one of the longest terms we give \nto anyone other than Federal judges in the workings of our political \nsystem, and a 4-year term to be the Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBoard.\n  Before I address Dr. Bernanke, I wish to take a moment, as my \ncolleagues have, to say a word about Chairman Alan Greenspan. Chairman \nGreenspan chairs the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee that is \nright now taking place. Then he steps down. He has served for over 18 \nyears as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the second-longest tenure in \nour history, exceeded only by William McChesney Martin. There have been \noccasions when I have differed with Chairman Greenspan on some of his \ndecisions, most notably the green light he gave to large and excessive \ntax cuts in 2001 which helped to precipitate us into a serious deficit \nsituation. But this ought not obscure the many accomplishments and \nsuccesses during his long tenure.\n  Others have referenced the stock market crash which happened only a \nfew months after he took office; the Asian Russian long-term capital \nmanagement crisis, some 10 years later in the late 1990s; and, of \ncourse, the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Throughout all of that, he brought a \nsteadying presence to the workings of the financial system and a shrewd \nunderstanding of the situation and what needed to be done to address \nit.\n  I commend Chairman Greenspan for bringing greater transparency into \nthe workings of the Federal Reserve system, something which Dr. \nBernanke has indicated he intends to continue and support, and Chairman \nGreenspan's rejection of rigid policymaking, rejecting the idea that \nthere was a rigid formula or ideology by which you could establish a \nmonetary policy. In particular, he was able to push the limits on \nlowering unemployment and providing jobs while still being able to \ncontrol inflation. As a result we were able to get the unemployment \nrate down to levels that everyone previously had argued would lead to a \nspurt of inflation. Chairman Greenspan thought that wouldn't happen. It \ndidn't happen. Now we have established different benchmarks in terms of \nmonetary policy.\n  Dr. Bernanke, whose nomination is before us, is no stranger to the \nSenate. This is the fourth time in 3 years that we have been called \nupon to consider his nomination to a very significant position. In \n2002, he was nominated to serve as a member of the Federal Reserve \nBoard of Governors. He was renominated to that position in the \nfollowing year. In 2005, he was nominated to serve as Chairman of the \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisers. Today, we have his nomination \nto serve as Chairman for a term of 4 years and as a Governor for a term \nof 14 years.\n  There is no question about Dr. Bernanke's qualifications for the \nposition to which he has been nominated. He has served with distinction \non the Federal Reserve Board from all accounts. He has had direct \nexperience of economic policymaking at the Council of Economic Advisers \nand he has a very distinguished academic and scholarly background with \na B.A. in economics from Harvard and a Ph.D. in economics from MIT. He \nhas been on the faculty at MIT and at Stanford. Most recently, of \ncourse, he was at Princeton, where he served as chair of the economics \ndepartment from 1996 to 2002, a department recognized as one of the \nvery best, if not the best, in the country.\n  He commands great respect from his peers in the profession and I \nthink great respect from all who have come in contact with him.\n  I do, though, want to take a moment to speak a bit about the \nseriousness of the economic challenges we face and which Dr. Bernanke \nwill face as he assumes this important responsibility. We have seen the \nweakest recovery in our labor market of any post recessionary period \nsince World War II--that is, in 60 years. While we have had some recent \nimprovement, compared with recoveries from previous recessions, we have \nfallen well short. Furthermore, real wages have fallen over the past \nfew years for middle class and working Americans.\n  Meanwhile, U.S. economic policy has been marked by a recklessness in \nits reliance on borrowing on the apparent assumption that substantial \nborrowing at home and abroad can go on and on and will always remain a \ncontinuing option for us. The consequence of this is that we are \nrunning dangerous current account deficits and substantial budget \ndeficits in amounts that dwarf anything we have previously experienced. \nMany observers think that these deficits--the fiscal deficit and the \ncurrent account deficit threaten our economy and our ability to deal \nwith the challenges of the future.\n  Mr. President, the most recent figures indicate that economic growth \nhas slowed to almost a crawl over the past 3 months. It was just over 1 \npercent in the last quarter of last year. That is the lowest rate of \ngrowth since 2002, and but for the buildup of inventories that took \nplace in the fourth quarter, economic activity fell by three-tenths of \n1 percent. So it was only the inventory accumulation that kept us from \nexperiencing negative economic growth.\n  Mr. Bernanke, along with his colleagues at the Fed and those on the \nOpen Market Committee, will face questions concerning the conduct of \nmonetary policy. Of course, monetary policy doesn't exist in a vacuum. \nIt plays a significant role in determining the shape and direction of \nthe economy. Therefore, we need to consider it in the broader context. \nIn fact, the Federal Reserve Act clearly mandates two goals: maximum \nemployment and\n\n[[Page S351]]\n\nstable prices. Those goals are set out in the Federal Reserve Act and \nconstitute the guidance and direction from the Congress to the Federal \nReserve for the objectives in the conduct of monetary policy.\n  The act says:\n\n       The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system and \n     the Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long-run \n     growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate \n     with the economy's long-run potential to increase production \n     so as to promote effectively goals of maximum employment, \n     stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\n\n  Accomplishing the Fed's dual mandate is the most important \nresponsibility of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. The experience \nof the 1990s, with unemployment down at 4 percent and inflation below 3 \npercent, demonstrated that these goals can be harmonized, unlike the \nassertion by some that they are inherently in conflict. Dr. Bernanke \nwas pressed on this point in his confirmation hearing because he has \nbeen a proponent of what is called ``inflation targeting,'' which \nrequires the Fed to set a specific numeric target for inflation, \nannounce that target to the markets and then manage the economy with \nthe objective of reaching that target.\n  I want to underscore the importance of the Fed honoring its statutory \ndual mandate and not replacing it with a policy of inflation targeting. \nWe must be concerned that if a numerical figure were to be set for \ninflation to the detriment of other considerations, employment foremost \namong them, policymaking would shift and so, too, would the debate \nabout the health and strength of the economy. I fear that the focus of \nthe debate would become not whether the Fed was successful in meeting \nthe dual mandate, but rather the Fed's one-sided success or failure in \nreaching a numerical inflation goal.\n  Chairman Greenspan himself has made this point. Bloomberg News \nrecently reported:\n\n       Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has rejected adopting a target, \n     saying it would rob U.S. policymakers of the flexibility they \n     need to respond to developments in a rapidly changing \n     economy.\n\n  I was, therefore, somewhat reassured when at his confirmation hearing \nDr. Bernanke told the Banking Committee that he ``subscribes entirely \nto the Humphrey-Hawkins mandate,'' which puts employment growth and \noutput growth on a fully equal footing with inflation in terms of the \nFederal Reserve's objectives. Furthermore he went on to say, ``I would \nnot be interested in pursuing that matter''--referring to inflation \ntargeting--``if I thought it involved changing the mandate of the \nFederal Reserve.''\n  Mr. President, I put this issue out here only as a matter to be \nfocused on as we move ahead into the future. Dr. Bernanke indicated \nthat it was not his intention to seek changes in the Federal Reserve \nAct. I think that is a wise and prudent course to follow. How much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes 20 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield myself an additional 3 minutes. We learned last \nweek that our economy slowed dramatically over the past 3 months to a \ngrowth rate of 1.1 percent, the slowest growth level in the past 3 \nyears and, obviously, insufficient to meet our needs. Moreover, as I \nnoted, even that modest growth was based entirely on inventory growth, \nwhich is a one-time shot for the economy and not a sustainable basis \nfor growth.\n  The current unemployment rate of about 5 percent obscures the fact \nthat the job creation during the course of this administration is the \nworst since the Hoover administration. In other words, every previous \nadministration since that of Herbert Hoover has produced more jobs than \nthis administration has produced. In fact, real wages are down for a \ngreat number of Americans, and it is little wonder that working \nAmericans are concerned about their economic future.\n\n  Given these factors and the potential problems with our record level \nof deficits and debt at home and abroad, I urge the Fed to consider \ntaking a pause from what has been a steady upward push in interest \nrates. We have had 13 successive increases in interest rates. Short-\nterm rates have gone from 1 percent to 4.25 percent. We had 1-percent \ngrowth in the economy last quarter.\n  Furthermore, let me note two or three other serious issues. One is \nour current account deficit. Our international accounts are steeply \nimbalanced. We expect the current account deficit to approach $800 \nbillion for 2005, in excess of 6 percent of GDP. We are borrowing from \nabroad over $2 billion on a daily basis to finance this deficit, and \nthere is a broad consensus among economic experts that current account \ndeficits of this magnitude are not sustainable. We will be obligated to \npay this debt out into the future, which means it will come right out \nof the standard of living at home. Warren Buffet, talking about this \nsituation, warned that we risk becoming what he called a \n``sharecropper's society.''\n  Furthermore, as we continue to fall deeper into debt with the rest of \nthe world, we are experiencing growing imbalances here at home. Real \nwages for the majority of working Americans have declined, while the \nreal incomes of the wealthiest have increased astronomically. A recent \nBloomberg News story observed that U.S. wages are lagging inflation \nand, even with unemployment near a 4-year low, workers have little \nleverage to demand higher pay. Other articles have reported the record \nbonuses that are now being given out on Wall Street. In fact, Chairman \nGreenspan in testimony before the committee stated:\n\n       I think the income distribution issue is very critical \n     because you can't have a significant inequality of income and \n     expect to have support for the type of institutions which \n     have made this country great.\n\n  Mr. President, I also note the Fed's responsibility for carrying out \nimportant supervisory and regulatory authority over the safety and \nsoundness of the Nation's banking and financial system. In the area of \nconsumer protection, the Fed has broad jurisdiction over a host of \nconsumer laws--the Community Reinvestment Act, Truth in Lending Act, \nTruth in Savings Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Electronic Funds \nTransfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Homeowners \nEquity Protection Act. These are major responsibilities of the Fed over \nand above its monetary policy responsibilities.\n  Finally, as I indicated, I intend to vote for this nominee. I think \nthis nominee is extremely well qualified. He will assume the \nchairmanship at a time when the economy faces problems that have \nserious implications for our future economic health and the prospect of \na rising standard of living for working Americans. In the current \nclimate, our Nation will be well served by a policy of prudence and \nindependent thought on the part of the Federal Reserve. I am hopeful \nthat Dr. Bernanke will draw upon his distinguished work as an academic \neconomist and his experience as a policymaker at the highest level of \nthe Federal Government to make a prudent and independent policy the \nhallmark of the Fed in coming years.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe nomination of Dr. Ben Bernanke to be Chairman of the Federal \nReserve. The Federal Reserve, or the Fed as it is commonly known, was \ncreated by Congress over 90 years ago to create a safe and stable \nfinancial system for the American people. The Chairman of the Federal \nReserve must be a person of sound and prudent judgment and strong \ncharacter. Throughout his academic and professional career, Dr. \nBernanke has exhibited all these traits and I laud President Bush for \nnominating him to this important public position.\n  For the past 18 years, Americans have become accustomed to the sound \nanalysis and policy judgments of outgoing Chairman Alan Greenspan. \nDuring this period, we as a nation have experienced several \ntransformational events. The stock market crashed in 1987, a mere 2 \nmonths into Chairman Greenspan's tenure, and we have also dealt with \nfinancial crises in Asia, Latin American, and even closer, Mexico. The \ncountry has also suffered major natural disasters and terrorist attacks \non our homeland. Throughout these occasions, Chairman Greenspan guided \nour Nation's financial markets with astute analyses and sound policy \ndecisions. As a result, our economy has endured a number of shocks and \ncontinues to remerge from each stronger than it was before.\n  In his hearings before the Senate, Dr. Bernanke displayed the candor \nand intellectual gravitas that has endeared\n\n[[Page S352]]\n\nhim to colleagues and policymakers throughout his long and \ndistinguished career. Dr. Bernanke was graduated from Harvard College \nwith a bachelor's degree and he later went on to earn a doctorate from \nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Since then he has taught \neconomics to students at some of America's most prestigious \nuniversities and has become a highly regarded scholar of banking and \nmonetary policy. Dr. Bernanke has a history of public service, having \nserved on his local school board in Montgomery Township, NJ, the U.S. \nCensus Advisory Board, and most recently the Council of Economic \nAdvisers.\n  Our economy faces a number of challenges in the near future. Some of \nwhich include the pressures on the Social Security system, rising \nhealth care costs, and stresses on the Federal budget. Dr. Bernanke \npromises to bring a sound, fair, and nonpartisan economic adviser to \nthe President and Congress on a number of macroeconomic matters. I laud \nhis desire to continue pursuing policies aimed at maximum employment \nand control over inflation.\n  Dr. Bernanke's qualifications for this job are impeccable, and I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting his nomination to be the \nfourteenth Chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of a fellow Georgian, Dr. Ben Bernanke, to serve as not only \na member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but \nto succeed Dr. Alan Greenspan as the next Chairman of the Board.\n  Dr. Greenspan has served America well for more than 18 years. During \nhis service as Chairman, he guided the U.S. economy through a number of \nchallenging hurdles including the stock market crash of 1987, the \nfinancial crises in Mexico and Asia, recessions in the United States \nand other spikes in the economy from corporate scandals, terrorist \nattacks, and natural disasters. Dr. Greenspan's tenure also includes \nthe longest economic expansion in U.S. history which lasted from 1991-\n2001. For these reasons, it is clear why many refer to Chairman \nGreenspan as one of the greatest central bankers of all time.\n  While his footsteps will be difficult to follow, I am fully confident \nthat Dr. Bernanke will continue Chairman Greenspan's legacy by guiding \nour economy in the right direction, and making the best decisions not \nonly for the American people, but for the role of the United States in \nthe global marketplace.\n  The Federal Reserve Board guides the Nation and its economy with a \nsafe, flexible, and stable monetary and financial system. As the U.S \neconomy continues to grow, so does the role of the Federal Reserve \nBoard in the global marketplace. Therefore, the qualifications for the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve System must be held to the highest \nstandard. I feel Dr. Bernanke's impeccable qualifications and financial \nexpertise make him an excellent candidate to succeed Dr. Greenspan.\n  Dr. Bernanke graduated from Harvard University with the highest \nhonors and later received his Ph.D. in Economics from the Massachusetts \nInstitute of Technology. Most recently he served as Chairman of the \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisers, CEA, where he ``provided the \nPresident with obiective economic analysis and advice on the \ndevelopment and implementation of a wide range of domestic and \ninternational economic policy issues.'' Prior to serving as Chairman of \nthe CEA, Dr. Bernanke served 4 years on the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System.\n  Dr. Bernanke's expertise is well respected in the academic community. \nHe was a professor of Economics at Stanford University and later served \nas a professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University, \nwhere he also served as Chairman of their Economics department for 6 \nyears. Dr. Bernanke also served as the Director of the Monetary \nEconomics Program of the National Bureau of Economics Research, as a \nmember of the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle \nDating Committee, and he has also worked for two terms as a member of \nNew Jersey's Montgomery Township Board of Education, and as the Editor \nof the American Economic Review.\n  Dr. Bernanke is also one of the most cited authors in the financial \ncommunity. He has also given several important lectures at the London \nSchool of Economics on monetary theory and monetary policy. Dr. \nBernanke has also been the recipient of many prestigious fellowships \nand awards including the renowned Guggenheim Fellowship, the Sloan \nFellowship and the Econometric Society Fellowship.\n  I have no doubt that with such an impressive background, Dr. Bernanke \nwill serve with impartiality and will continue to guide our economy, as \nDr. Greenspan has done for the last 18 years, down a stable and \nprosperous path. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \ndistinguished nominee, and confirm Dr. Bernanke to the Board of \nGovernors, and as Chairman of the Board for the next 4 years.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take this chance to say a \nfew words of thanks to Alan Greenspan for his service to our Government \nand to wish him well as he leaves the Federal Reserve. Alan Greenspan \nhas done a commendable job as Chair of the Fed, and we are, indeed, \nfortunate to have had him in that position for the past 18 and a half \nyears.\n  The previous two decades have seen an amazingly large number of \ncrises that have impacted financial markets. The stock market crash of \n1987, the Savings and Loan collapse and subsequent bailout in 1990, the \nMexican bond crisis of 1994, the Asian financial panic in 1997, \nRussia's bond default and the subsequent collapse of Long Term Capital \nManagement in 1998, the collapse of the tech bubble in 2000, and the \nimplosion of Enron in 2001.\n  In recent years, we have witnessed a sharp rise in housing prices, \nalong with a concomitant chorus of financial experts exhorting him to \n``do something.'' Besides these various financial crises, the United \nStates has also been the victim of a massive terrorist attack in 2001, \nwhich shut down financial markets for over a week, and we were forced \nto intervene militarily in Kuwait, Afghanistan, and Iraq.\n  Despite the staggering number of potentially catastrophic events, the \nUnited States has had only two short recessions in the past 20 years, a \nrecord that is to me simply amazing. Of course, it would be wrong to \ngive the Federal Reserve and Alan Greenspan full credit for the \nprosperous conditions of the previous quarter century, but it is \nimpossible to conceive of us achieving this level of prosperity without \na vigilant and responsible Federal Reserve.\n  The main contribution of Chairman Greenspan and the Federal Reserve \nin the past 18\\1/2\\ years has been the taming of inflation. The effort \nto control this scourge began with Paul Volker, of course, but the \nspecter of inflation does not die easily. It took Alan Greenspan \nanother 10 or 15 years to finally rid the financial markets of the fear \nthat as the economy expands, so must the rate of inflation. The \nevidence of high inflation's demise can be seen merely by looking at \nmortgage rates. The record low interest rates of the past few years has \nallowed tens of thousands of families in my home State of Utah to \nafford to buy their own home, something that was beyond the reach of \nmany before.\n  Chairman Greenspan's success in taming inflation and creating a \nstable economic climate has paved the way for our next Fed Chairman, \nBen Bernanke, to explicitly state that low inflation is his primary \ngoal. Indeed, countries all over the world are following our lead of \nhaving an independent central bank dedicated to a stable price system, \nmodeled after the one in the United States. This is no small credit to \nthe ability of Mr. Greenspan and the capable economists employed by the \nFederal Reserve.\n  The pressure on the Chair of the Federal Reserve to ``do something'' \nin response to crises, both real or perceived, can be great. It is to \nhis credit that Chairman Greenspan has been able to resist many of \nthose calls and avoided meddling in situations where the potential \neconomic benefits from such action were slight, but the potential costs \nheavy. In central banking, inaction is most often the better part of \nvalor.\n  At this time, I would also like to express my enthusiastic support \nfor the nomination of Ben Bernanke to be the next Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve's Board of Governors. Mr. Bernanke has\n\n[[Page S353]]\n\nserved quite admirably for the past 4 years both as a member of the \nBoard of Governors and for the past 9 months as the head of the \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisers. He is a world-renowned \nscholar on monetary economics and the banking industry, and is one of \nthe preeminent experts on the causes and consequences of the Great \nDepression.\n  Before Dr. Bernanke came to Washington, he was a professor of \neconomics at Princeton University, perhaps the top school for economics \nin the world. He also served as its department chair for a number of \nyears. While living in Princeton, he served on the local school board \nfor a number of years, putting the lie to any notion that he has ever \nbeen an ivory tower academic unfamiliar with how the real world \noperates.\n  Benjamin Bernanke brings a gifted intellect, a wide variety of \nrelevant experience, and an understanding of the importance of what the \nFederal Reserve does and the harm that it can bring to an economy. I \nwholeheartedly encourage my colleagues to join with me in voting for \nhis nomination.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I rise in support of the nomination of Ben Bernanke, of \nmy home State of New Jersey, to be the next Chairman of the Federal \nReserve. Once again, New Jersey is honored that the President has \nnominated one of our own to serve our Nation in such a vital position.\n  Dr. Bernanke has a remarkable record of scholarship. He graduated \nfrom Harvard with top honors and later earned a doctorate in economics \nfrom the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT. Dr. Bernanke then \nentered academia and has taught at some of the preeminent universities \nof our Nation, starting at Stanford before continuing at MIT and New \nYork University and eventually ending as the Chairman of the Economics \nDepartment at Princeton University. He has also served our Nation with \ndistinction in his roles at both the Council of Economic Advisers and \nthe Federal Reserve.\n  As the newest member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs, I look forward to working with Dr. Bernanke in ensuring \nthat inflation remains in check, that our Nation's deficits are \naddressed and dealt with in a forthright manner, and that all Americans \nare able to successfully participate in our country's economy. He has a \nreputation of basing his decisions on sound economics, rather than \nideology and partisanship, and I expect this to continue in his new \nrole as Chairman.\n  Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not also take this time to \nthank Alan Greenspan for his almost two decades of service and economic \nstewardship as the outgoing Chairman.\n  I am quite pleased that the President has nominated my fellow New \nJerseyan, Dr. Bernanke, to be Chairman of the Federal Reserve and am \nconfident that he will do a good job in his new position, while making \nour shared State of New Jersey proud.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 minutes 43 seconds \nremaining. The Senator from Maryland has 8 minutes 5 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Does the Senator wish to continue?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I will yield half of the remaining time to Senator \nDorgan and the other half to Senator Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 4 \nminutes 17 seconds.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise in strong support of \nthe nomination of Mr. Bernanke to become Chairman of the Federal \nReserve. First, I would be remiss if I didn't say a few words of \ncongratulations to Alan Greenspan, who has truly been a giant in the \nfield. He will be missed. He hovered over our economy similar to a \ncaring guardian and has done an incredibly fine job. Every American of \nevery political stripe should be grateful that Alan Greenspan served so \nwell and so long. I called him yesterday to wish him well. He will do \njust fine. He is 79 and he is entitled to retire. I, for one, with no \naspersions on Mr. Bernanke, wish he would have even stayed a little \nlonger.\n  I think Mr. Bernanke is extremely well qualified for the job for a \nnumber of reasons. That is why I strongly support his nomination. He is \nerudite, he is smart, and he is one of those rare people who has made \nmonetary policy his life's work. Many of us would not choose to do \nthat, but he did and he has done it very well.\n  Second, Mr. Bernanke has assured us that he will follow the policies \nof Chairman Greenspan. That bespeaks well of his wisdom because \nChairman Greenspan did such a superb job managing monetary policy. \nAnybody who says that starts with a leg up.\n  Third, he is not an ideologue. He is a solid, thoughtful person. He \ndoes not go to the extreme. He does not have a narrow theory that \ngoverns the way economic policy should be made. He assured us, despite \nsome rumors to the contrary, for instance, that he would not follow a \nmechanistic, formulaic monetary policy. That is very important because \nour economy is so complicated and there are so many international \nconsiderations that you cannot be mechanistic in this changing new \nworld, and he is not.\n\n  He is also not an ideologue in terms of general economic policy. He \nis not one of these people who advocate tax cuts above all, even if it \nplunges us into greater deficits. He is a thoughtful, moderate man. He \nis the right choice for the job.\n  Senator Graham and I have been very concerned about the balance of \ntrade with China and them pegging their currency at a low rate. He \nshowed sympathy--in fact, greater sympathy than many--when we talked \nabout that with him.\n  There are great challenges for Chairman Bernanke. There is the \ninternationalization of the economy. That affects monetary policy \nbecause, as I said, there are loopbacks. What happens with the yen and \nthe yuan and the Euro affects the dollar in ways that did not occur \nbefore when so little of our economy was based on international trade.\n  He has to deal with another problem in our society--the agglomeration \nof wealth to the top. Our society cannot continue with the top 10 \npercent that glomerates most of the wealth. I hope he will speak out on \nissues beyond monetary policy because we don't have any respected \nvoices who do that without a partisan edge, other than the Chairman of \nthe Fed.\n  I make one final point. Contrast the nomination of Dr. Bernanke and \nJudge Alito. Dr. Bernanke is a moderate. There was consultation, and he \nis getting every Democratic vote. Judge Alito was a partisan \nnomination. There was no consultation. He is regarded by many of us on \nkey issues at the extreme, and we had a divided vote. I hope and pray \nthat in the future, the President will follow the nomination process \nmore like he did with Dr. Bernanke, a unifying choice, rather than like \nJudge Alito, a partisan choice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will be brief. I had thought I agreed to \nthe unanimous consent request in exchange for 10 minutes to speak on \nthis nomination, but if that time does not exist, I will truncate my \nremarks.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will be glad to yield to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota some of my time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in that case, let me compliment the \nchairman and ranking member, which I would have done in any event. Let \nme spend more time complimenting them for their work.\n  The Banking Committee is very important in the Senate. It takes a \nvery serious view of these issues and I know did a very thorough job in \nthe hearings held late last year on this nomination for Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board. I thank the chairman for his courtesy, and I \nthank the chairman and the ranking member for their work, not just on \nthis nomination but on so many important issues.\n  I don't come to the Chamber to oppose Mr. Bernanke's nomination. That \nis not my purpose. I wish him well. I want him to succeed. He is going \nto be confirmed almost unanimously today by the Senate.\n  Chairman Greenspan and I have had very significant differences over a \nlong period of time. But I wish him well. I want to thank him for his \nservice to our country, even if we have different views about monetary \npolicy.\n\n[[Page S354]]\n\n  I know people will talk about big shoes to fill. Whenever someone \nleaves, there are big shoes to fill. I don't know if the shoes are big, \nlittle, Ferragamos or Payless--but they are shoes. We have someone else \nanswering to the call of public service, in this case someone well \nqualified.\n  Mr. Bernanke has served at the Federal Reserve Board dealing with \nmonetary policy and at the White House dealing with fiscal policy for \nPresident Bush. The Senate will confirm him today, and he will go back \nto the Federal Reserve Board as Chairman.\n  What I wanted to say today is that we have the twin issues of fiscal \npolicy and monetary policy, and there needs to be some responsibility \nto understand how they work together to improve this country's future. \nI am very concerned about this country's economic future for reasons \nthat Senator Sarbanes touched on a moment ago. I wish to describe it to \nmy colleagues.\n  I think the Federal Reserve Board for some long while--and, yes, it \nwas under Chairman Greenspan's stewardship--has been providing green \nlights saying, It is OK, go right ahead, to a series of fiscal policy \nmoves which has put us deep in debt. It is not just in budget policy \nwhere we have these deep and abiding long-term deficits and, therefore, \nincreases in the Federal debt. We also have large trade deficits. In \nabout a week and a half, we will have an announcement about last year's \ntrade deficit. My expectation is it is going to be about $750 billion, \nthe highest in history. That debt is devastating to this country. It is \nunsustainable. At the same time, in fiscal policy, the Federal debt \nwill increase in this fiscal year somewhere around $650 billion.\n  I wish to put up a chart that shows what is happening. This is the \nwall of debt in fiscal policy. You will see year after year after year, \ngoing from 2006 to 2011, up to $12 trillion in fiscal policy debt. \nExtend this another 5 years, and you get to $16 trillion. This is a \nrelentless wave of bad news in fiscal policy that we cannot continue. \nThis is just fiscal policy. The trade policy debt looks even worse. Its \ngrowth is even more dramatic. Of course, that relates to the issues of \njobs.\n  Last week, we heard Ford Motor say: Oh, by the way, we are going to \ncut 30,000 workers. Several months ago, it was General Motors saying: \nBy the way, we are going to cut 20,000 to 30,000 workers. Four months \nbefore that, it was General Motors calling in the heads of the \ncompanies that provide the General Motors' parts, 300 people in a room, \nand the person in charge of parts for General Motors said this to them: \nYou need, when making parts for General Motors cars, to outsource those \njobs to China to get the costs down.\n\n  Where is all this heading? Ford, General Motors, parts to China, $750 \nbillion trade deficit in a year? It is headed in the wrong direction, \nand we are today selecting one person who is going to be in a position \nof very significant influence in our Government about the direction of \nthis country. Mr. Bernanke will play a significant role in determining \nthe amount of economic growth and opportunity that will exist in the \nfuture, what kind of good jobs we will have, and how many.\n  Our fiscal policy, judged by anyone soberly looking at the facts, is \nseriously off track. I don't blame Mr. Bernanke for that, although he \nmost recently worked at the White House in the fiscal policy arena. It \nis not a question of blame, it is a proposition that all of us, \nRepublicans and Democrats, liberals, conservatives, moderates, must \nfinally come together to say this is unsustainable.\n  Our country is off track in fiscal policy and trade policy. This debt \nwill have consequences. And in the construct of monetary policy, it is \ncritically important that Mr. Bernanke understand these messages and \nnot do as has been done in most recent years and put up a big old green \nlight and say to friends in Congress: Oh, by the way, go ahead, it will \nall work out; be happy. Fine. That is exactly what has happened in \nrecent years, with a couple of exceptions.\n  The Federal Reserve Board is a strong central bank that is largely \naccountable to no one. I know, go back to the nineteen-teens when the \nFederal Reserve Board was created, and it was said on the floor of the \nSenate, we are not creating a central bank, we are not creating a \nstrong central bank, and we are not for certain creating a strong \ncentral bank accountable to no one, but that's exactly what happened. \nYou can make the case over a long period of time that things have gone \npretty well with monetary policy here, fiscal policy there.\n  My colleague from Maryland talks about economic stabilizers. You can \ntalk about some successes. Our recessions have been less deep in recent \nyears because of economic stabilizers and some thoughtful approaches to \ndealing with monetary policy and fiscal policy. But I believe it is \nvery important for us to understand where we are. If you don't \nunderstand where you are at the moment, it is pretty hard to figure out \nwhere you are going.\n  As we consider the nomination of one of the most important people in \nthis country with respect to economic policy, a new Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board, I call attention once again to the fact that we \nhave very serious, abiding, long-term economic problems which, unless \nresolved, will injure this country's long-term opportunity to remain a \nworld economic power. It is that serious.\n  One final point. There is a little fund down at the Federal Reserve \nBoard to which I also wish to call attention. I assume Mr. Bernanke \nknows of it. It is a fund in which $12.9 billion exists. It is a fund \nat the Federal Reserve Board which is called a surplus account. The \nFederal Reserve Board, I remind everyone, effectively creates money. It \ndoes not need a rainy-day fund because it will never lose money. It has \nnot suffered an annual loss in some 90 years. And yet the Federal \nReserve Board has a rainy-day fund, a surplus fund, which has grown now \nto $12.9 billion.\n  I believe the Fed and the Congress ought to take a hard look at that \nand ask themselves, given the fact we are choking on debt these days, \nis there any reason that the Federal Reserve should continue to have a \nsurplus fund of $12.9 billion? The Fed wants a fund apparently because \nit might lose money someday. The Fed makes money. The Fed creates \nmoney. The Fed does not need $12.9 billion in a surplus account.\n  So as Mr. Bernanke receives his approval of the Senate today, my hope \nis he might, with Members of Congress, take a look at that issue. \nSenator Reid and I and others asked for a GAO report on that 10 years \nago now--and the Fed blithely ignores the consequences of any of that \nand does what it wants to do. In fact, at that point, the reserve or \nsurplus rainy-day fund was $4.5 billion. Not only did the criticism of \nthat fund not deter them, it has grown now to nearly triple that \namount, in a rainy-day fund in a climate where it never rains. I am \nsorry, but Mr. Bernanke should take a good, hard look at that, and so \nshould the Congress.\n  Having said all that, pointing out especially that we have very \nabiding and serious fiscal policy problems and trade policy problems, \nmy hope is that Mr. Bernanke, in seizing the reins of our monetary \npolicy in this country as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has a \nsuccessful tenure. I wish him well. I want him to do well. I want our \ncountry to do well. I come to the Chamber only to ask that all of us \nfinally join together, including the Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBoard, to see where we are and where we must be if we want a strong \nAmerica in the future, one that grows and finds opportunities for our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  I again thank my two colleagues for the time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time at this \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BERNANKE TO BE A MEMBER AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD \n         OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM--Continued\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of \nDr. Ben Bernanke to be Chairman of the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve. I am not one who relishes opposing President Bush's \nnominees or his policies. I have been supportive of an overwhelming \nmajority of them, but I have opposed a nominee or two on a few \noccasions. This is one of those rare occurrences.\n  Dr. Bernanke has an impressive resume and career. He received his \nbachelor of arts in economics in 1975 from Harvard University. From \nthere he headed off to Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he \nreceived his Ph.D. in economics in 1979. He was assistant professor of \neconomics in the graduate School of Business at Stanford University \nfrom 1979 to 1983 and then became associate professor of economics at \nStanford's graduate School of Business from 1983 to 1985.\n  Ben Bernanke then popped over to Princeton University. There he \nbecame a professor of economics and public affairs from 1985 to 1994. \nHe stayed at Princeton and ultimately became chair of its economic \ndepartment until 2002. He was then appointed to serve as a member of \nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System by President Bush.\n  Dr. Bernanke was then tapped as chairman of the President's Council \nof Economic Advisers and he has held that post since June of 2005.\n  Of course, along with this academic and employment resume, Dr. \nBernanke has received many honors and fellowships along the way. He has \nalso published many articles on a wide variety of economic issues, \narticles relating to monetary policy, inflation targeting, \nmicroeconomics, central banking, and many other issues relating to \neconomic and monetary theories.\n  This all sounds very impressive, and it is. It is an economic elitist \ndream. For some, it can be a nightmare. I hope he does not hold too \nmany of the ivory-towered theories of academia for real-world wisdom as \nhe heads off to be the next Fed Chairman.\n  I voted for Ben Bernanke in the Banking Committee and in the Senate \nto be the Fed Governor in 2002. I supported him to the Board of \nGovernors at the Fed because of a private meeting we had.\n  Over the years I have had some great concern about the Federal \nReserve and the way it operates. One of my biggest concerns is that the \nFederal Open Market Committee, the FOMC, suffers from ``group think.'' \nIt seems to me no one ever challenges the Fed Chairman. I rarely, if \never, witnessed or heard any of the Fed Governors publicly challenging \nor disagreeing with Chairman Alan Greenspan.\n  Chairman Greenspan has done an admirable job during his tenure at the \nFederal Reserve. He had a difficult task. Part of his job was to \npredict the future. However, I believe Chairman Greenspan has always \nerred on the side of raising interest rates. I am not alone with this \nopinion. History has shown he has made many mistakes in raising rates \nfor too long. My problem is when he did that, not one Governor raised \ntheir voice. Instead, they either bit their tongue out of fear they \nwould be viewed as not a team player or perhaps what might be worse is \nthat they all agreed with each other and simply reinforced bad ideas.\n  Diversity of thought and dissension is, indeed, necessary within the \nFederal Reserve. After all, the Chairman of the Fed and its Board of \nGovernors essentially have the greatest power over shaping our economy. \nAnd the economy affects every American.\n  I understand the argument that to have an FOMC rife with dissension \nmight not be the best for the markets. I have heard the argument that \nit would rattle the markets and send Wall Street into a tizzy. Yes, \noverall, it is important the FOMC speak with one voice. However, the \npendulum can swing too far from dissent. My fear is that the FOMC under \nChairman Greenspan has arguably suffered from group think and that the \nFOMC has unintentionally become a rubberstamp for Chairman Greenspan's \nrecommendations.\n  We need an FOMC that is truly independent. It must be independent \nfrom the Congress and the executive branch. We cannot have a Fed that \nis influenced by the President. We certainly know the Fed does not pay \nany attention to Congress. For the FOMC to function properly, its \nmembers must challenge the Chairman. No Chairman should be able to \ndominate. There must be intellectual sparring so all members are heard \nand the FOMC can come up with the best decision for the country.\n  The Federal Open Market Committee needs independent voices. Dr. \nBernanke promised me he would be an independent voice as a member of \nthe FOMC. He promised me he would stand up to the Chairman if he \nthought he was being rolled. Sadly, I have not seen very much evidence \nof him being independent. I never saw him vote, not once, against the \nChairman. I never, ever saw him challenge the Chairman. And as far as I \ncan tell, they never had a disagreement.\n  As important as it is for the FOMC member to be independent, it is \nmore important the Chairman be independent. The Fed Chairman must not \ngive in to outside pressures. Monetary policy decisions must be made \nfor the good of the country and not for political considerations. When \nDr. Bernanke was a Fed Governor, I did not witness him showing \nindependence from the Chairman at all. During his tenure as a Fed \nGovernor, there were 23 votes taken by the FOMC committee. Not once did \nDr. Bernanke vote against Chairman Greenspan. I don't think that is \nindependence; that is group think. He did not show independence as a \nFed Governor. How can we be sure he will be an independent person as \nChairman of the Fed?\n  The pressures to go along for a quick political fix will be even \ngreater. Will he stand up to the President? Will he stand up to the New \nYork Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal? Will he stand \nup to the business and economic pundits in the broadcast media or \nanyone else when they call for rate increases or decreases? I am not \nconvinced he will. The past is prologue. I hope I am wrong.\n  It is mainly for this reason that in 2005 I opposed his confirmation \nas Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. I hope Ben \nBernanke proves to be a fine Chairman of the Federal Reserve. I hope he \nuses his vast knowledge of our economy to make correct monetary policy \ndecisions. I hope he gains the trust of Wall Street, much like the last \ntwo chairmen.\n  Dr. Bernanke has talked about bringing more transparency to the Fed. \nI hope he does this. I hope he continues to be plain spoken.\n  One other reason I oppose Dr. Bernanke is because he says he will \ncontinue the policies of Chairman Greenspan. That does not sit well \nwith me. I hope this is not completely true. I hope Ben Bernanke \nrefrains from talking about things outside the purview of the Federal \nReserve. One of my biggest problems with Chairman Greenspan was that he \ntalked about everything under the sun: tax policy, trade deficits, \nbudgets, fiscal policy, the Nation's oil patch. The Fed's jurisdiction \nis narrowly scoped to monetary policy, but if you asked Chairman \nGreenspan about monetary policy, he would talk about everything under \nthe Sun without ever answering your questions. If you asked him \nsomething that had nothing to do with monetary policy, he was more than \nhappy to give you a clear and concise answer. Hopefully, Dr. Bernanke \nwill be a different\n\n[[Page S356]]\n\nkind of chairman in that respect. Hopefully, he will talk only about \nmonetary policy and not interfere with tax and fiscal policy. Those \nmatters should be left to the legislative branch and other areas of the \nexecutive branch.\n  Also, Chairman Greenspan's problems were not just the fact that he \ntalked outside the monetary policy arena. Yes, Chairman Greenspan's \ntenure held relatively low inflation with growing economic conditions. \nHowever, his record came about from the creation of a fat market bubble \nthat ultimately popped. Then there was a housing bubble. It led to an \nunbalanced economic recovery fueled by cash raised from soaring home \nprices. This resulted in record household debt and negative consumer \nsavings rates.\n  We also witnessed the endless bailouts of Chairman Greenspan. There \nwas the 1997 Fed bailout of the Asian crisis. There was the long-term \ncapital management bailout in 1998. We had a financial crisis and the \nFed got involved with Mexico and all this led to a huge trade and \nFederal budget deficits. This was all further affected by record energy \nprices which raised the cost of goods and services.\n  After almost 20 years, Chairman Greenspan is now acknowledging some \nof the bad consequences of his decisions. He said inflation may be \ncreeping in. But Chairman Greenspan leaves knowing that his mess will \nfall to his apprentice, Ben Bernanke.\n  Yes, Dr. Bernanke has an impressive resume. But the question is \nwhether he knows what is waiting for him around each economic corner. \nIt is indeed ironic that Dr. Bernanke finds it necessary to continue \nthe Greenspan policies. I hope this is not true. This would be \ndisastrous. These policies have not been the best for our economy.\n  I hope Dr. Bernanke does not follow too closely in the footsteps of \nChairman Greenspan in his approaches. But regardless, he just might \ninherit a mess from Chairman Greenspan. If so, I hope he can clean it \nup.\n  I hope there is no damaging recession or financial crisis looming. If \nso, I hope Ben Bernanke does not live up to his nickname of \n``Helicopter Ben,'' and throw the U.S. mint's printing presses into \noverdrive.\n  I have no personal qualms with Dr. Bernanke. We simply differ on \nopinions. I do not relish opposing President Bush's nominees. But, \nregretfully, I must oppose Dr. Ben Bernanke to be Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be recorded as being \nopposed to Ben Bernanke's nomination upon its approval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while Senators talk about prebuttal and \nrebuttal speeches before the State of the Union speech, I hear middle-\nclass folks saying ``drop the buts and make our lives easier.'' I know \nbecause in January, when I was home, I held 21 community meetings. The \nbig issues then were those where the second word was ``bill''--medical \nbills, gas bills, heating bills, mortgage bills, college bills, and \nespecially tax bills.\n  It is not hard to see why those are the issues. Middle-class folks in \nthis country are not keeping up. Even their wages do not keep up with \ninflation. And while they want a better life for their kids--the way \ntheir parents wanted for them--they stay up nights worrying that they \ncannot make it happen.\n  So today I want to spend a few minutes discussing just two issues: \ntaxes and health care. I believe in each of these two issues Congress \ncould work on a bipartisan basis for genuine relief for the middle \nclass. We may not hear about it tonight, but as middle-class folks \nbegin pulling together their 1099s, their W-2s, their schedule this and \nschedule that, and all of what they have to do to comply with filling \nout their tax forms, I simply wanted to come to the floor and say it \ndoes not have to be this way.\n  I brought, today, just part of what constitutes the regulations and \nrules for complying with taxes in America. One of the experts in the \nfield told me there have been more than 14,000 amendments to the Tax \nCode since the last major overhaul in 1986. It comes to almost three \nfor every working day in America.\n  This year, Americans are going to spend $140 billion on tax \ncompliance. Americans are going to spend more money complying with the \ntax rules than the Federal government is spending on higher education \nin our country.\n\n  I have come to the floor today because I want to make it clear I do \nnot think it has to be that way. I have developed an alternative. My \none-page 1040 form is just 30 lines long. Take your income from all \nsources, subtract your deductions, take your credits, send it off to \nthe IRS, and you can even add a note: I'm done. Have a nice day.\n  I filled this out myself, and that in and of itself is a little bit \nof a revolution because it has been a long time since a member of the \nSenate Finance Committee or someone in the other body on the Ways and \nMeans Committee could fill out their own tax form.\n  What happens today? More than three million people, for example, have \nto essentially fill out their taxes twice. They have that alternative \nminimum tax staring at them. Scores of families are pulling together \nshoe boxes full of receipts, shouting across the living room, ``Honey, \ncan you find that receipt for the copier that we bought months ago?'' \nbecause part of it is for business and part of it was used for the \nfamily. I say it does not have to be this way.\n  I have shown that you can have a one-page 1040 form. The President's \nadvisory committee report that came out in the fall had a similar \nform--I do not happen to agree with all they did, but their one-page \nform isn't that much longer than mine. For purposes of Government work, \nwe could put the two of\n\n[[Page S357]]\n\nthem together and really do something meaningful on a bipartisan basis \nto simplify the Tax Code, to use that $140 billion now spent on \ncompliance on something I know the Presiding Officer has a great \ninterest in--education and infrastructure and other areas that are of \ngreat importance to our country.\n  But on top of simplifying the Tax Code, there is more that has to be \ndone to help the middle class. I suspect we are not going to hear about \nit tonight, but Warren Buffett, the second wealthiest man in America, \npays a lot lower tax rate than his receptionist. That is because there \nis a double standard.\n  We hit people a lot harder when they work for wages than when they \nmake their money off investments. I am not interested in soaking \nanybody. I believe in markets. I believe in creating wealth. But \nsomething is out of whack when middle-class folks have to spend the \ntime to figure out how to wade through all of this and spend literally \nmuch of the money they want to spend on their families on just filling \nout their taxes--it is not right to hammer people who work for a \nliving.\n  Here is the way it works. If a cop working outside the Capitol gets a \nlittle bit of a pay raise--maybe $500--that cop pays 25 percent of the \npay raise to the Federal Government in income taxes and pays Social \nSecurity payroll taxes on top of it. If, however, you make your money \non investments--we want everybody to do well in that area also--you pay \n15 percent of what you make on your investments in income taxes and you \ndo not pay any Social Security payroll taxes.\n  There is a double standard. We discriminate against people who work \nfor a living. In Ohio, in Oregon, across the country, if you work hard, \nplay by the rules, and work for a wage, you get hit a lot harder than \nthe people who make their money on investments.\n  I have already said I am not interested in soaking anybody. I happen \nto believe marginal rates are a big deal. And because I do, I have not \nraised the top rate in my proposal. I have three tax brackets: 15, 25, \nand 35 percent. So it is progressive. I have said to colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, folks in the administration, there is plenty \nof flexibility in my proposal. If we want to make it 13, 23 and 33, I \nam up for that, too. We can do that in a bipartisan way.\n\n  But tonight, I suspect, instead of hearing that we ought to take on \nthe tax bureaucracy embodied in a few of these volumes, in effect we \nare going to be told to re-up for business as usual. I don't think it \nhas to be that way. I refer colleagues to what happened in 1986, 20 \nyears ago. Then we had a Republican President, revered by millions of \nAmericans, Ronald Reagan, who worked with Democrats, Dan Rostenkowski, \nBill Bradley, Dick Gephardt. They found common ground in a proposal \nthat has many of the same features I bring to the Senate today.\n  They were concerned about marginal rates. There were Democrats, such \nas myself, who think marginal rates are a big deal. They worked \ntogether with a Republican President to achieve a significant success. \nThey removed a lot of clutter from the Tax Code. I wish we hadn't gone \nback over the last 20 years since that historic legislation and added \nit all back, those more than 14,000 provisions. But it happened. We all \nknow it has a little bit to do with the lobbyists, because the \nlobbyists all come and ask for this particular break or another. I had \none of our colleagues say to me: Ron, I don't agree with every part of \nyour proposal, but you are right, probably every 20 years you ought to \nautomatically cleanse the Tax Code. You automatically ought to give it \na bath.\n  So I come tonight to say I am interested in working on a bipartisan \nbasis to do something about all this dead wood. I would rather preserve \nthe trees that go into all these volumes and simplify the life of \nmiddle-class folks. We have our folks talking on cell phones all day \nand pagers and practically tethered to the Internet. I know of young \npeople trying to get ahead. They work 12, 14 hours a day. They come \nhome and they are still checking their e-mail. Do we want to put them \nthrough another 30 hours of preparing their taxes?\n  I filled out my one-page 1040 form. I already said the President's \nAdvisory Panel on tax reform had some good ideas. We could come up with \nan alternative. But we have to want to lead. We have to want to lead as \nPresident Reagan did, as Bill Bradley did. We have to say we want to do \nit on a bipartisan basis.\n  I am hopeful that if we hear tonight about business as usual on \ntaxes, I can join with colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I \nhave already talked to some on the Finance Committee where I am honored \nto serve. I have discussed it both with Chairman Grassley and Senator \nBaucus, two who frankly are role models for bipartisanship.\n  I came today to particularly talk about how this could help middle-\nclass folks. I am going to put in the Record examples of how various \nmiddle-class people would be affected. I will ask unanimous consent to \nprint in the Record some examples of how my proposal would help the \nmiddle class.\n  Under my proposal we will have a lot of middle-class people, people \nmaking $70, $80, $90,000 a year--there are a lot of them in Ohio and \nOregon--will get a significant amount of relief. Essentially, all those \nfamilies who make up to $150,000 a year, primarily on wage income, \nmaybe a little bit of investment thrown in, they are going to get real \ntax relief or they are going to stay about the same. I want to see us \ndo it in a fiscally responsible way. I know this is of great concern to \nthe Senator from Ohio. The Congressional Research Service said that it \nis possible to get the tax relief to millions of middle-class people \nthat is outlined in my legislation, the Fair Flat Tax Act, and pay down \nthe Federal deficit by $100 billion. That is clearly not all you have \nto do to stop the hemorrhaging of the Federal budget, but at least it \nis a downpayment.\n  The Senator from Ohio has done an awful lot of good work in terms of \npay-as-you-go budgeting and taking on health care costs and some of the \nskyrocketing cost of entitlements. My proposal doesn't pretend to deal \nwith all of the red ink we see in the Federal budget, but it does get \nreal tax relief to middle-class people and does it in a fiscally \nresponsible way, with the Congressional Research Service saying that it \nwould pay down the Federal deficit by $100 billion over the next few \nyears.\n  I will be back on the floor over the next few days and weeks trying \nto make the case for bipartisanship to overhaul the tax system. I don't \nthink it is possible to continue to add a piece here and a piece there \nand make any sense out of all this. We will only be adding more and \nmore volumes. For example, virtually every Senator I have talked to \nwants to deal with the alternative minimum tax. We know there are a lot \nof people being swept up in the alternative minimum tax who certainly \ndon't consider themselves fat cats. They weren't the kind of people \nanybody was talking about when the AMT came into being. But we are \ngetting to the point now where it is almost impossible to put a patch \non the AMT without having that change ripple all the way through the \nsystem.\n  What we ought to say, on a bipartisan basis, is we can make the code \nsimpler, flatter, and fairer. I have described today how it can be made \nsimpler. I have a one-page 1040 form. The President's advisory \ncommission has one that is a bit longer, but they are close enough for \npurposes of Government work. I have three brackets in my tax proposal: \n15, 25, and 35. It is fine with me to adjust the numbers a little bit, \nparticularly the idea of going down a couple of points for each of the \nbrackets. The biggest challenge in terms of working out a bipartisan \nproposal is on the issue of fairness, because that is obviously in the \neye of the beholder. What is fair to one person may not be fair to \nsomebody else.\n  I want to close on one point with respect to taxes. Ronald Reagan \nsigned a bill in 1986 that treated investment income the way wage \nincome was treated. Ronald Reagan in 1986, working with Bill Bradley, \nDick Gephardt, a host of Democrats, signed a bill that treated \ninvestment income as it treated wage income. He did it because he \nthought the overall set of tax brackets made sense. I happen to think \nmine do as well. Colleagues may have other approaches. What we know for \na fact is what was done in 1986 worked. The stock market was not \nhampered. For colleagues on the other side of the aisle, a Republican \ngot elected President in 1988 so no Republican was hurt\n\n[[Page S358]]\n\nby tax reform, where there was bipartisan leadership.\n\n  I come to the floor with my first comments, that while, \nunfortunately, we are not going to hear about comprehensive tax reform \ntonight, this Senator wants to make it clear that this is a cause I am \nnot giving up on. I am going to push this at every possible \nopportunity. I am going to work with colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle. We know that you can't get anything important done unless it \nis bipartisan. I am going to do it because I don't think you can defend \nbusiness as usual with this tax system. The simplification that I have \ncome to argue for makes sense. Frankly, that ought to be a no-brainer \nfor everyone. We can make the code flatter.\n  Let's role up our sleeves and try to come up with a system that is \nfairer for everybody, the way it was done back in 1986. If we can get \nit done--and I have the good fortune of being able to stay on the \nSenate Finance Committee, if the people of Oregon honor me with a \nchance to continue to serve there--this time I am going to fight those \nlobbyists who will try to go back and clutter it up. Frankly, that is \nwhat happened in 1986. Nobody really said ``no'' after that historic \nreform.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I want to conclude on another pocketbook issue for the \nmiddle class by talking about health care. I am a Senator who believes \nthere ought to be private choices in American health care. There are \nsome who think that all the health care ought to be privatized, some \nwho think that Government ought to do everything. I am one who believes \nthere is a role for both the private sector and for Government in \nhealth care.\n  Unfortunately, I voted for the Medicare prescription drug program. As \na former director of the Oregon Gray Panthers, I still have the welts \non my back to show for it. I never conceived that the administration of \nthis program could be so bungled. We have bedlam out there right now \nwith seniors with advanced degrees trying to sort all this out. Again, \nit did not have to be this way. If, for example, the administration had \nat least standardized the policies a little bit so that people could \ncompare the various prescription drug coverages available, we could \nhave avoided this chaos. There is a model for this as well, a model \nused for the private health insurance supplements that seniors bought \nto add to their Medicare.\n  Before I came to Congress, I was director of the Gray Panthers. It \nwas not uncommon for a senior to have 10, 15 private health insurance \npolicies. We drained that swamp. Now seniors for the most part have \nonly one Medigap policy. It meets their needs. The insurance industry \nhas indicated it works for them. We ought to be trying to standardize \nor at least make more understandable the private health policies that \nseniors are looking at now to meet their prescription drug needs.\n  I have suggested this to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. \nTo his credit, he has indicated that he is interested in pursuing it. \nThe administration of this program didn't have to roll out this way. It \ncould have been simpler and more understandable, if the choices that \nwere made available to seniors had simply been structured in a clearer, \nmore understandable way.\n  There is a second thing that needs to be done on health care. Senator \nSnowe and I got 51 votes late last year for our legislation to lift the \nrestriction on Medicare's right to bargain to hold down the cost of \nprescription medicine. The way Medicare is buying this medicine defies \nanything that goes on in the private sector. It is similar to somebody \ngoing to Costco and buying toilet paper one roll at a time. Nobody \nwould shop the way Medicare is purchasing these prescription drugs.\n  By my count, Senator Snowe and I now have 53 votes for our \nlegislation to lift the restriction on Medicare bargaining. I commend a \nnumber of colleagues who have been involved. On our side of the aisle, \nSenators Stabenow and Feinstein have done a lot of heavy lifting. \nSenator McCain has been a wonderful supporter. We ought to pass that \nlegislation. We ought to make it possible for Medicare to bargain to \nhold down the cost of medicine. I look forward to talking to our \ncolleagues further, including the distinguished Senator in the chair.\n  There are other steps that ought to be taken to hold down the costs \nin health care. I hope we will hear about them tonight. One of the best \nis to make more accurate information available about how doctors and \nhospitals price their services.\n  It is possible to shop for just about anything in the United States, \nbut you cannot shop very much for health care. It makes no sense at \nall. Senator Cornyn, the distinguished Senator from Texas, has a great \ninterest in this issue. Other colleagues do as well. But if we are \nserious about holding down costs--I think the President will talk about \ncost containment tonight--let's get better, more understandable, more \nusable information about doctors and hospitals out to the American \npeople. That is step No. 2.\n  Step No. 3 involves end-of-life care--one of the most controversial \nissues in American health care. As my colleagues know, I was the one \nwho blocked the original Schiavo legislation from coming up on the \nfloor. Let me talk about something all of us can agree on, and that is \nwe ought to expand hospice and comfort care to deal with end-of-life \nservices because this is something which will help us save money, will \navoid some of the family tragedies that result in these horrible, \npolarizing kinds of problems such as we saw in the tragic Schiavo case.\n  There is no reason, given the fact that a growing fraction of the \nhealth care dollar gets spent in the last few months of an individual's \nlife, that to be both compassionate and hold down health care costs, \nRepublicans and Democrats cannot join hands on expanding hospice care \nas an alternative to what our citizens face now with end-of-life \nchoices.\n  The fourth step is an area the Chair has a great interest in, and \nthat is health care technology. We know many communities have multiple \ntechnologies, such as MRI machines. There are some very exciting and \ntremendous new products that are available. Many communities have lots \nof these technologies, and some have none at all. There is a \nmaldistribution of health care resources. So an area I have a great \ninterest in is, making it possible in communities in Minnesota and \nOregon for health care providers to share these technologies, perhaps \neven giving them a waiver of antitrust restrictions, so that rather \nthan everybody having to keep up with the Joneses and adding to health \ncare expenses in an area that has fueled our costs, let's figure out a \nway that will not freeze innovation. Nobody wants to do that.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has been a leader in that field. We don't \nwant to freeze innovation, but we want to hold down costs and make sure \nthere is access. I think there are ways in which we can create \nincentives to share these exciting health care technologies. I have \nsuggested just one this afternoon. That is a way to hold down health \ncare costs.\n  Mr. President, to recap, let's clean up the Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit. Let's figure out how to get better and more accurate \ninformation about doctors and hospital costs and services out. Let's \nexpand hospice and compassionate end-of-life care. And let's make sure \nthere are incentives to better use health care technology.\n  Those are four practical steps which can hold down health care costs \nand improve health care services in our country.\n  I close by way of saying that I came to the Senate floor today \nbecause I had those 21 town meetings at home. I heard middle-class \npeople talk about all the issues where the second word was ``bill''--\nmedical bill, tax bill, mortgage bill, gas bill, home heating bill. \nThey are concerned about economics and their pocketbooks. We don't need \nall this dead wood in our tax system. We can come up with a 1-page \nalternative. I proposed one, as have others. We can work in a \nbipartisan way to hold down health care costs.\n  Tonight, we may not hear about some of what I have discussed this \nafternoon, but I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle and with the Bush administration because on both the tax \nissue and the health care issue, we can do better.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today has been an extraordinarily historic \nand eventful day, one in which we have paid tribute to, and reflected \nupon, the great deeds and towering leadership of some of the most \nconsequential individuals of the 20th century. It has also been a fast-\npaced day of action, of looking to the future, guiding America toward \nour most cherished goals and most cherished ideals.\n  One person we honor today, who has helped lead that journey, is \nretiring Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. For over two \ndecades, Justice O'Connor has presided over some of the most complex, \ndifficult, and vexing debates of our times.\n  Justice O'Connor, who turns 76 this year, retires with a sterling \nreputation as a brilliant legal scholar, a fair and impartial jurist, \nand an individual of impeccable personal integrity.\n  Born in the humble town of El Paso, TX, to Harry and Ada Mae, the \nyoung Sandra Day grew up on her family's cattle ranch in southeastern \nArizona. It was not far and wasn't long to Stanford University where \nshe graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in economics. \nShe was accepted into the university's prestigious school of law and \nearned a coveted position on the law review's board of editors. She \ncompleted law school in only 2 years and finished near the top of her \nclass. Among her classmates was a young man who would later sit beside \nher on the highest Court in the land: the late Chief Justice William \nRehnquist.\n  Despite her extraordinary credentials, the private sector didn't \neasily welcome a woman into its male-dominated ranks. After a \nfrustrating job search in the private sector, the young lawyer began \nher career as Deputy County Attorney of San Mateo, CA. A 4-year stint \nin Europe, where her husband was posted, and 3 sons later, Sandra Day \nO'Connor became Arizona's Assistant Attorney General in 1965.\n  She served 4 years before being appointed to fill an unexpired seat \nin the Arizona State Senate. In the State senate she proved herself an \nadept and popular lawmaker. She rose to its highest office to become \nthe first woman State majority leader ever in the history of the United \nStates.\n  In 1975, Sandra Day O'Connor was elected judge of the Maricopa County \nSuperior Court, and 4 years later, in 1979, was appointed to the \nArizona Court of Appeals. There she served until President Ronald \nReagan appointed her Associate Justice to the Supreme Court.\n  Twenty-five years ago, on September 21, 1981, the Senate unanimously \nconfirmed her nomination. On that day, Sandra Day O'Connor again made \nhistory. She became the first female Justice in the Court's history. \nWhen asked for her reaction to her nomination, Sandra Day O'Connor \nsaid:\n\n       I can only say I will approach [my work on the bench] with \n     care and effort and do the best job I possibly can do.\n\n  So she has. Justice O'Connor has served with distinction and as an \nexample to all Americans that, through persistence and hard work, the \nhighest peaks can be achieved. Despite her early professional \nobstacles, she never surrendered her determination, her focus, nor did \nshe surrender her Southwestern roots. Fiercely proud of her heritage, \nJustice O'Connor and her brother H. Alan Day authored a best selling \nmemoir entitled ``Lazy B: Growing Up on a Cattle Ranch in the American \nSouthwest.'' Anyone who has entered the inner compounds of Justice \nO'Connor's Supreme Court office has seen that sign that reads: \n``Cowgirl Parking Only: All Others will be Towed.''\n  About 11 years ago, when Karen and I first came to Washington, DC, we \ndidn't really know anybody here. We were a little bit lost, a physician \nand his family moving to this city. We early on met John and Justice \nO'Connor. Since that time, we have had the opportunity to be with them \nsocially. We respect their wonderful and loving relationship, which has \nbeen always and continues to be manifested in so many wonderful ways. \nThey welcomed our family to this Washington community and expressed \nthat welcome in warm and heartfelt ways, again and again.\n  To echo the worlds of Ronald Reagan, Sandra Day O'Connor is ``truly a \n`person for all seasons,' possessing those unique qualities of \ntemperament, fairness, intellectual capacity and devotion to the public \ngood which have characterized the 101 `brethren' who have preceded \nher.''\n  Sandra Day O'Connor has served this country for over five decades as \nan Arizona State Senator and majority leader, State court judge, \nassistant State attorney general, and in the capacity of which she will \nlong be remembered, as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of \nAmerica. The ``cowgirl from Arizona'' may never have dreamed of riding \nto the highest Court in the land but, boy oh boy, is America fortunate \nthat she did.\n  On behalf of my fellow Senators and the American people, I offer my \ndeepest gratitude to Justice O'Connor for her service to this great \nNation, and I wish Mrs. O'Connor the best in all of her future \nendeavors.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

JAMES M. PHILPOTT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Mr. James M. \nPhilpott, Assistant Deputy Chief of\n\n[[Page S360]]\n\nStaff for Resource Management, U.S. Army Pacific, who, in early 2006, \nwill retire from a distinguished career spanning 35 years of exemplary \nservice to America.\n  Mr. Philpott began his Federal career as a Comptroller Management \nIntern with the U.S. Army Pacific in 1971. He has served with Army \norganizations in Hawaii, Okinawa, mainland Japan, Korea, and Fort \nHuachuca, AZ. Mr. Philpott also spent 2 years with the U.S. Department \nof Energy where he directed the Comptroller's independent financial \nmanagement review and analysis function.\n  During his more than 30 years involved in Army resource management, \nMr. Philpott was a highly respected leader and expert on the Army \nbudget and a wide range of related issues concerning the Asia-Pacific \nregion. He played a critical role in the formulation, approval, and \nexecution of U.S. Army Pacific budgets that produced a much-needed \nstrengthening of America's defense posture and enabled our military to \nfulfill its many demanding commitments within the Pacific area of \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. Philpott developed and led a diverse staff of analysts. Over the \nyears, he mentored and guided a generation of Army budget and \nmanagement analysts. Mr. Philpott was the primary leader in tracking \nand resolving budget and realignment matters involving U.S. Army \nPacific. He meticulously tracked numerous and complex actions affecting \nthe funding and manpower available to the command. Mr. Philpott has \nbeen a loyal and trustworthy adviser to nine commanding generals of \nU.S. Army Pacific, spanning 19 years. His expertise of Pacific resource \nmanagement matters is unparalleled.\n  Mr. Philpott produced substantial top-quality analysis on complex \neconomic, fiscal, and budget topics for commanders of U.S. Pacific \nCommand and U.S. Army Pacific and other senior leaders. He also \nimproved support for these leaders by initiating important resource \nmanagement reforms that saved staff time and improved the quality of \ndecisionmaking data.\n  For his extraordinary achievements, Mr. Philpott received the \nMeritorious Service Award three times. He was awarded the Nick Hoge \nAward for Professional Development, and Superior Civilian Service Award \nand Commander's Award two times. He earned the deep respect of leaders \nthroughout the U.S. Army Pacific, Department of the Army, and with \nCongress's defense oversight committees. These leaders benefited \nenormously from his exceptional knowledge and dedication. Mr. \nPhilpott's service has substantially helped our Nation's leaders make \nthe wisest possible allocation of its defense resources in order to \nensure America's future security.\n  Throughout his distinguished career, Mr. Philpott has had the \nresolute support of his wife Kathy and his three children. He has \nearned the deep gratitude of the American people. I join my staff, \nparticularly our Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Staff Director, \nSid Ashworth, in wishing Mr. Philpott and his family all the best in \nthe coming years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/31/senate-section/article/S360-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ALAN GREENSPAN\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today marks the end of one of the most \noutstanding public service careers in this country's history.\n  Today, Dr. Alan Greenspan steps down as Chairman of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System.\n  These last 18 years many accolades have been showered on Chairman \nGreenspan's leadership in steering monetary policy--a period that \nincluded some very difficult waters.\n  But I think the true strength of his leadership can be measured by \nthe numbers. The Chairman, I understand, devours statistics in helping \nto make sound decisions. And the measurable results have been \nimpressive.\n  Since being appointed to the chairmanship--first by President Reagan \nin August 1987, and then, later, by Presidents George Bush, Bill \nClinton, and George W. Bush--U.S. economic growth has averaged 3 \npercent per year.\n  The annual rate of increase in consumer prices has similarly averaged \na low 3 percent annually.\n  If price stability is the key responsibility of our independent \nFederal Reserve System, one can only conclude that Chairman Greenspan's \nleadership has been extraordinarily successful.\n  Meanwhile, the number of payroll jobs in America has grown from 102 \nmillion when he took on the chairmanship to nearly 135 million today. \nThe unemployment rate has averaged slightly more than a low 5\\1/2\\ \npercent.\n  But Chairman Greenspan has been more than an outstanding captain of \nthe economic seas. He has been a shrewd analyst and forecaster, shaping \nthe economic future.\n  One key statistic that the Chairman brought to the public's \nattention--and particularly to those of us involved in the policy \nprocess--is the issue of productivity.\n  He was the first to recognize that the rise of productivity allowed \nunemployment to fall lower than many economists thought possible \nwithout stoking the fires of inflation, therefore, allowing the Federal \nReserve to keep interest rates low.\n  Over his tenure, productivity growth averaged 2.2 percent per year, \nnearly double the rate of growth in the seventies and eighties.\n  There were major challenges along the way:\n  Only 2 weeks after taking his position at the Federal Reserve, the \nstock market dropped nearly 23 percent--marking the worse 1-day decline \nin the market's history.\n  There was an Asian and Russian financial crisis in 1998.\n  And, of course, the tragedy of September 11 that hit directly at the \nheart of our financial system.\n  In each instance, quick action by the Chairman to provide liquidity \ninto the market through interest rate decisions allowed for the \neconomy, indeed the global economy, to right itself, stabilize, and \ncontinue to grow.\n  One measure of the Chairman's counsel has been his highly anticipated \ntestimonies before the Committees of Congress. Those hearings have \nalways been sold out, headliner events. We have always listened very \nclosely.\n  On a more personal level, it has been my distinct pleasure to have \ngotten to know Alan Greenspan and discuss informally with him the \nchallenges that confront this country--in particular, our health care \nsystem and the increasing costs of health care, pensions and public \nentitlements.\n  I will miss those discussions with Mr. Greenspan. But I am confident \nthat he will continue to offer his wise counsel to those who request \nit. For he will always remain, at heart, a public servant seeking to \nbetter the lives of citizens throughout this country and the world.\n  A counselor to Presidents and Congresses, a thoughtful thinker, \nflexible and non doctrinaire, Chairman Greenspan possesses the rare \nability to communicate complicated ideas clearly and to make difficult \ndecisions under complex, dynamic and uncertain conditions. For 18 \nyears, he has done so consistently. For 18 years, he has done so \nmasterfully.\n  Alan Greenspan leaves the Federal stage a giant in his field.\n  And if my high praise suggests a dash of ``irrational exuberance,'' \nso be it. Chairman Greenspan is deserving of our highest regard.\n  On the passing of John Maynard Keynes, the British economist Alfred \nMarshall wrote that: ``a great economist must possess a rare \ncombination of gifts: mathematician, historian, statesman, \nphilosopher.'' Alan Greenspan possesses each in large measure.\n  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your outstanding service to your country \nand to your fellow Americans.\n  On behalf of the U.S. Senate, best wishes to you in all of your \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/31/senate-section/article/S360-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S360-S361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Specialist Prince Koa Teewia\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to set aside a few moments \ntoday to reflect on the life of SPC Prince Koa Teewia. Prince \nepitomized the best of our country's brave men and women who fought to \nfree Iraq and to secure a new democracy in the Middle East. He \nexhibited unwavering courage, dutiful service to his adopted country, \nand above all else, honor. In the way he lived his life--and how we \nremember him--Prince reminds each of us how good we can be.\n  Born in Liberia in 1979, Prince was separated from his mother when \nshe\n\n[[Page S361]]\n\nvisited the United States, and civil war broke out in her native \ncountry. Due to security concerns, she was not allowed to return to her \nhomeland to be with her children. After his father fled the war-torn \nregion in 1990, Prince stayed with an aunt and eventually found refuge \nin neighboring Sierra Leone.\n  One by one, his mother managed to find ways for her eldest sons to \njoin her in the United States. Prince was finally reunited with his \nparents when he moved to Durham, NC, in 1998 to live with friends and \nrelatives. Shortly after his return, his parents moved to Delaware in \nthe hopes of finding better paying employment. Prince stayed behind in \nNorth Carolina with the hopes of furthering his education and to enroll \nin classes at North Carolina Central University.\n  Prince Teewia had always wanted to join the military of his adopted \nhomeland and, in 2004, he signed up for the 101st Airborne Division, \nbased out of Fort Campbell, KY. He had been deployed in Iraq for less \nthan a month when he was killed on December 29, 2005, by a roadside \nbomb that detonated next to the humvee he was riding in.\n  Specialist Teewia was granted full status as a U.S. citizen shortly \nafter his death. This distinction was bestowed upon him because of his \nhonorable service in the Armed Forces and his willingness to pay the \nultimate cost while performing his duty in Iraq.\n  Prince was laid to rest with full military honors in Delaware \nVeterans Memorial Cemetery in Bear, DE, on January 13, 2006. He is \nsurvived by his parents John and Rebecca, his maternal grandparents, as \nwell as eight brothers and six sisters.\n  I rise today to commemorate Prince, to celebrate his life, and to \noffer his family our support and our deepest sympathy on their tragic \nloss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/31/senate-section/article/S361-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S361-S362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget \nscorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under \nsection 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate \nscorekeeping of section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the first concurrent \nresolution on the budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the 2006 \nbudget through January 25, 2006. The estimates of budget authority, \noutlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 2006 concurrent resolution on the budget, H. Con. \nRes. 95. Pursuant to section 402 of that resolution, provisions \ndesignated as emergency requirements are exempt from enforcement of the \nbudget resolution. As a result, the attached report excludes these \namounts.\n  The estimates show that current level spending is under the budget \nresolution by $14.015 billion in budget authority and by $379 million \nin outlays in 2006.

Res. 95. the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal\n  Year 2006, assumed the enactment of emergency supplemental\n  appropriations for fiscal year 2006, in the amount of $50 billion in\n  budget authority and approximately $62.4 billion in outlays, which\n  would be exempt from the enforcement of the budget resolution. Since\n  the current level totals exclude the emergency appropriations in\n  Public Laws 109-13, 109-61, 109-62, 109-68, 109-73, 109-77, 109-88,\n  109-106, 109-114, 109-135, and 109-148 (see footnote 1 on Table 2),\n  the budget authority and outlay totals specified in the budget\n  resolution have also been reduced (by the amounts assumed for\n  emergency supplemental appropriations) for purposes of comparison.\n\\2\\ Current level is the estimated effect on revenue and spending of all\n  legislation that the Congress has enacted or sent to the President for\n  his approval. In addition, full-year funding estimates under current\n  law are included for entitlement and mandatory programs requiring\n  annual appropriations even if the appropriations have not been made.\n\\3\\ Excludes administrative expenses of the Social Security\n  Administration, which are off-budget.\n\\4\\ The Employee Retirement Preservation Act (Public Law 109-151) has a\n  loss of revenue of $1 million.\n\n\n[[Page S362]]\n\n\n TABLE 2.--SUPPORTING DETAIL FOR THE SENATE CURRENT-LEVEL REPORT FOR ON-BUDGET SPENDING AND REVENUES FOR FISCAL\n

Mr. President, those of us working constructively and in a \nbipartisan way to extend the USA PATRIOT Act with improvements have \nrepeatedly offered to meet to work out the remaining differences. \nSadly, the Senate leadership has not made the effort to work through \nthe remaining concerns or brought us together.\n  I have continued meeting and talking with interested Republican and \nDemocratic Senators. Senate staff has finally gotten together this week \nin a bipartisan meeting. I urge the majority leader to bring together \nkey interested Senators to work out a bipartisan compromise that \nimproves the failed conference report.\n  A majority of Senators--Republicans and Democrats, those who voted \nagainst cloture on the conference report that failed to pass the Senate \nand those who voted for it urged the Republican leader to act on a \nshort-term, 3-month extension before the end of the last session. \nInstead, he chose to proceed with a 6-month extension that Republicans \nin the House found objectionable. That led to the short extension that \nis about to expire this week. The President had said that he would not \napprove a short-term extension. House Republicans had said that they \nwould not allow a short-term extension. But just before Christmas they \ndemanded and enacted a shorter extension than anyone else had proposed.\n  As soon as it became apparent that the conference report filed by the \nRepublican leadership would be unacceptable to the Senate, I joined on \nThursday, December 8, in urging a 3-month extension to work out a \nbetter bill. On the first day the Senate was next in session, Monday, \nDecember 12, Senator Sununu and I introduced such a bill, S.2082. We \nsent out a ``Dear Colleague'' letter to other Senators on December 13 \nand that bipartisan bill was cosponsored by 46 other Senators. That \nbill would have extended the PATRIOT Act until March 31, 2006, to allow \nus all to work out the remaining differences and\n\n[[Page S363]]\n\nimprove this reauthorization legislation in ways to better protect the \nrights of ordinary Americans. It proposed a commonsense solution to \nallow us to take a few more weeks to get this right for all Americans.\n  Contrary to the false claims and misrepresentations by some, there \nwas no effort on either side of the aisle to do away with the PATRIOT \nAct. That is just not true. Along with others here in the Senate, I am \nseeking to mend and extend the PATRIOT Act, not to end it. There is no \nreason why the American people cannot have a PATRIOT Act that is both \neffective and that adequately protects their rights and their privacy. \nThe only people who were threatening an expiration of the PATRIOT Act \nwere the President and House Republicans. As I noted on December 21, \nthe administration and the Republican congressional leadership were the \nones who were objecting to extending the act and threatening to have it \nexpire. That was wrong. That made no sense. They came to their senses \nin the days that followed. But now, as we approach the expiration of \nthe current extension this Friday, the Republican congressional \nleadership has taken no further action and we risk sections of the \nPATRIOT Act expiring, again.\n  Republican and Democratic Senators joined together last month to say \nwe can do better to protect Americans' liberties while ensuring our \nnational security is as strong as it can be. In the days after 9/11 we \nacted as Americans, not Democrats, not Republicans. The President's \npolitical adviser Karl Rove and the rest of those who are seeking to \nmake the PATRIOT Act a partisan political issue should instead join \nwith our bipartisan coalition and work with us to provide a better \nbalance to protect the rights of Americans.\n  Every single Senator--Republican and Democratic--voted last July to \nmend and extend the PATRIOT Act. That bipartisan solution was cast \naside by the Bush administration and Republican congressional leaders \nwhen they hijacked the conference report, rewrote the bill in ways that \nfell short in protecting basic civil liberties and then tried to ram it \nthrough Congress as an all-or-nothing proposition. I have joined with \nSenators of both parties in an effort to work to improve the bill. Some \nof us are working hard to protect the security and liberty of \nAmericans. What is wrong is for the White House to manipulate this into \na partisan fight for its partisan political advantage. Instead of \nplaying partisan politics, the Bush administration and Republican \ncongressional leadership should join in trying to improve the law.\n  This is a vital debate. The terrorist threat to America's security is \nvery real, and it is vital that we be armed with the tools needed to \nprotect Americans' security. At the same time, however, the threat to \ncivil liberties is also very real in America today. The question is not \nwhether the Government should have the tools it needs to protect the \nAmerican people. Of course it should. That is why I coauthored the \nPATRIOT Act 5 years ago, and that is why that Act passed with broad \nbipartisan support. When I voted for the PATRIOT Act, I did not think \nit was an ideal piece of legislation, and I knew that it would need \ncareful oversight and, in due course, reform. None of us wants the \nPATRIOT Act to expire, and those who threatened to let it expire rather \nthan fix it play a dangerous game.\n  This is about how to reconcile two shared and fundamental goals--\nensuring the safety of the American people and protecting their liberty \nby means of a system of checks and balances that keeps the Government--\ntheir Government--accountable. Those goals are not the goals of any \nparticular party or ideology; they are shared American goals. How to \nbalance security with liberty and Government accountability was the \nmost fundamental dilemma with which the Framers of our Constitution \nwrestled, and how to adjust that balance in the post-9/11 world is a \nfundamental dilemma before this Congress.\n  Our Nation is a democracy, founded on the principles of balanced \ngovernment. We need to restore checks and balances in this country to \nprotect us all and all that we hold dear. Our Congress and our courts \nprovide checks on the abuse of executive authority and should protect \nour liberties. Congress must write the law so it provides not just a \ncheck on Presidential power but also a clear role for the courts. All \nAmericans need to take notice and need to demand that their liberties \nbe maintained. We can do better and must do better for the American \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/31/senate-section/article/S363-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IRAN'S EFFORTS TO OBTAIN NUCLEAR WEAPONS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as a known sponsor of international \nterrorism, and in light of the president of Iran's recent apocalyptic \nstatements calling for the destruction of Israel, Iran must not be \nallowed to develop nuclear weapons. The international community must \nrespond quickly and decisively to Iran's gross disregard of \ninternational treaties and obligations and to its concerted and \nmalicious efforts to develop the capability to create nuclear weapons.\n  The international community must take concerted and decisive action \nto prevent Iran from furthering its nuclear research and technology \ndevelopment. In its forthcoming meeting on February 2, 2006, the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors should \nheed the calls by Russia, China, the European Union, and the United \nStates to reaffirm its findings that Iran has blatantly violated its \ninternational obligations, recognize the grave nature of Iran's recent \nactions, and refer Iran to the United Nations Security Council. The \nSecurity Council should then speak with one voice to condemn Iran's \nactions and send a clear signal that continued defiance of the \ninternational community will not be tolerated.\n  It is essential that the Security Council approve specific actions to \nprevent the furthering of Iran's nuclear capabilities. The Security \nCouncil specifically, and the international community generally, must \nrecognize the potentially devastating link between the violent and \ndefiant rhetoric of Iran's president and his regime's determined effort \nto undermine approved and transparent methods of developing civilian \nnuclear technology for energy use.\n  Congress can also take steps to help stop or slow Iran's acquisition \nof nuclear and other WMD-related technology, including adding teeth to \nexport control legislation such as the Iran and Syria Nonproliferation \nAct. The Iran Nonproliferation Enhancement Act, S.1976, that Senator \nKyl and I introduced late last year would do just that. It would \ntoughen the ISNA by requiring rather than merely authorizing sanctions \non proliferators, extending sanctions to the parent companies, and \nincreasing the types of sanctions that apply to proliferators. By \nadopting this legislation, we would be sending a crystal clear message \nto would-be proliferators: if you choose to assist Iran in developing \nnuclear or other WMD-related capabilities, you are also choosing to \nforgo doing business with the United States.\n  History teaches us that we cannot ignore the stated intent of those \nwho seek to destroy nations. A nuclear-armed Iran would pose a grave \nthreat to the region, to Israel, and to the entire international \ncommunity. A concerted international effort is needed to prevent Iran \nfrom procuring the technology and materiel needed to develop a nuclear \nweapon. This effort must begin now, and it must be comprehensive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/31/senate-section/article/S363-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S363-S364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                IN RECOGNITION OF DR. KATHERINE ESTERLY\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nachievements of Dr. Katherine Esterly. Kitty, as she is known to her \nfriends, has had an enormous impact on the lives of countless people, \nmany of whom were too young to even realize that she was helping them.\n  Dr. Esterly has dedicated her life to advancing the field of \nneonatology, which is the field of pediatric medicine that deals with \nthe care of newborn infants. She has helped countless mothers-to-be and \ntheir young children by helping bring healthier babies to term and \nassisting those newborns who need a little extra care after their \ndelivery. This work transcends the concepts of reduced health care \ncosts and decreased infant mortality rates. It\n\n[[Page S364]]\n\nmeans healthier babies and stronger families and that is an \naccomplishment worthy of our praise and admiration.\n  Katherine Esterly grew up in Norristown, PA, knowing that she wanted \nto work with children. After graduating from Temple University's \nmedical school in 1951, she moved to Delaware to work towards that \ngoal. Delaware was truly blessed when she made this decision.\n  Despite her diminutive size and warm personality, Dr. Esterly has \nalways approached her efforts to care for Delaware's babies with a \nsteel will and an unwillingness to accept ``no'' for an answer. She \ndemands high standards from her colleagues and has lived her life by \nthis same commitment to excellence.\n  One of the hallmarks of her care is how she continually goes above \nand beyond the traditional role of simply caring for the newborn child. \nShe uses a gentle hand and an open style of communication to develop a \nlevel of trust with parents that greatly improves their hospital \nexperience during such difficult times. Whether it is a reassuring word \nor a simple explanation of a complex procedure, Kitty is always willing \nto do whatever it takes to assure parents that their newborn is \nreceiving the best possible care.\n  Katherine Esterly became a practicing pediatrician in 1954 after \ncompleting her internship and residency at the Delaware Hospital. Dr. \nEsterly then served as an associate in pediatrics for the Children's \nBureau of Delaware from 1954 until 1968. During this time, Kitty worked \ntirelessly to help adoptive and foster children. In 1968, because of \nher outstanding record of leadership and her dedication to her \nprofession, she was named director of this organization.\n  After the merger of community hospitals in Wilmington in 1967, the \nMedical Center of Delaware was formed and a new department of \npediatrics was created. Unfortunately, there wasn't a neonatologist on \nstaff at this new institution. Dr. Esterly took the initiative to get \nthe necessary training so she could fill this void in the department's \nneonatal intensive care unit. She went on to become the director of the \nneonatology division in 1975. Throughout the 1980s, Dr. Esterly \nexpanded the division and added additional full-time neonatologists to \nher staff, resulting in a world-class practice where even the sickest \nof newborns could be cared for.\n  Dr. Esterly also advanced the cause of nurses by working with \ncolleagues and government officials to highlight and promote the \nqualifications of professional nurses. Her actions led to nurse \npractitioners being able to treat patients and write prescriptions, \nwhich greatly reduces the workload of practicing physicians and allows \nfor greater responsibility on behalf of nurses.\n  In addition, Katherine Esterly helped create a neonatal nurse \npractitioner program for schools in Delaware and New Jersey that \ncontinue to train the next generation of caregivers. Her ability and \nwillingness to share her knowledge has ensured that future generations \nwill continue the work that Kitty pioneered so many years ago.\n  In 1995, while serving as Governor of Delaware, I appointed Dr. \nEsterly to serve as the chair of Delaware's Perinatal Board. In this \ncapacity, she spearheads Delaware's efforts to promote the health and \nwelfare of countless numbers of children. The First State and her \nchildren are better off because of her efforts.\n  Most recently, the Katherine L. Esterly Nursing Education Scholarship \nfund was established for the College of Health Sciences at the \nUniversity of Delaware. When asked if she would allow her name to be \nused to distinguish this scholarship, Dr. Esterly, in her customary \nselfless fashion, not only agreed but also made a personal contribution \nto the very fund that now bears her name. Her generosity will help \nensure that her legacy of caring for Delaware's youngest residents will \nbe preserved and passed on to future generations of caregivers.\n  Kitty's dedication and innovation in the field of neonatology serves \nas an example to us all. I rise today to honor her achievements and to \nthank her on behalf of all Delawareans for her years of hard work, \ndedication, and constant championing of Delaware's youngest \nresidents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/31/senate-section/article/S364-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNITION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on Wednesday, the American \nAssociation of Colleges for Teacher Education will present its Best \nPractice for Collaboration with a Community College Award to the \nUniversity of Northern Iowa. This award recognizes outstanding \ncollaboration between a university teacher education program and a \ncommunity college--in this case, Des Moines Area Community College. \nThis partnership is a wonderful example of two fine educational \ninstitutions working together to meet the needs of schools in rural \nIowa, and I congratulate them for this accomplishment.\n  Eleven years ago, UNI joined forces with the DMACC campus in Carroll \nto develop a new approach to address the unique needs of rural school \ndistricts. The idea was simple--locate a teacher preparation program \nwhere you have the need. Instead of training teachers 160 miles away on \nits campus in Cedar Falls, UNI established a joint program with DMACC \nin the heart of rural western Iowa.\n  Rural communities face many unique challenges, including the need to \nrecruit highly qualified teachers. At the same time, many rural \nresidents have a need to upgrade their skills, but are unable to move \nto a larger community to attend college. The 2+2 program is a perfect \nsolution. This homegrown approach allows individuals to obtain the \ntraining they need to fill the jobs that are literally in their own \nbackyards.\n  Since 1995, UNI has awarded baccalaureate degrees to nearly 100 \nteachers at the Carroll campus. It is very important to point out that \nnearly all of these individuals continue to live in western Iowa, and \nare working for school districts in the surrounding area.\n  This program has been an enormous success and I am very proud to have \nsecured Federal funding from the U.S. Department of Education to \nsupport this innovative program. UNI is building on this experience and \nwill be expanding the 2+2 model to other fields of study, including \ntechnology management, general business and criminology. The University \nwill also expand the partnership to include Western Iowa Tech Community \nCollege in Sioux City, Northeast Iowa Community College in Peosta and \nCalmar, Eastern Iowa Community College in Davenport, and Iowa Western \nCommunity College in Council Bluffs.\n  The success of this project is due to the creative energy and hard \nwork of many individuals from UNI, DMACC and the community of Carroll \nincluding: Dr. Constantine Curris, former President of UNI; Dr. Joe \nBorgen, former President of DMACC; Dr. Robert Koob, President of UNI; \nDr. Robert Denson, President of DMACC; Dr. Richard Hawkes, Professor of \nTeaching at UNI; Dr. Roger Kueter, Director of Community College \nProjects at UNI; Dr. Jim Knott, Provost of the DMACC Carroll campus; \nSteve Schultz, coordinator of the 2+2 program for DMACC; Art Neu, \nformer mayor of Carroll and former Lieutenant Governor of the State of \nIowa; and Jim Wilson, publisher of the Carroll Daily Times Herald.\n  I extend my congratulations to all of them on this outstanding \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/31/senate-section/article/S364-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S364-S365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN MEMORY OF WILLIAM R. ROBERTSON\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am deeply saddened to inform you \nof the passing of Bill Robertson, former secretary treasurer for the \nLos Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO. I would like to take a \nfew moments to recognize Bill Robertson's many important \naccomplishments and the tremendous impact he made on the labor \nmovement.\n  Born in St. Paul, MN, Bill Robertson was a man with humble \nbeginnings. He lost both his parents when he was a child and lived in \nan orphanage for a brief period. Growing up in difficult circumstances \nin the middle of the Great Depression shaped Bill's social and personal \nbeliefs. He intimately understood the struggle that working men and \nwomen faced to achieve dignity in the United States.\n  Bill led the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor for nearly two \ndecades. During his tenure, he fought for the rights of working people \nwith passion and great success. In 1975, Bill\n\n[[Page S365]]\n\nRobertson became secretary-treasurer for the Los Angeles County \nFederation of Labor, AFL-CIO. Under his leadership, The Los Angeles \nCounty Federation of Labor saw phenomenal growth. He coordinated many \nsuccessful labor rights victories and spent a great deal of time \nbuilding the labor movement and fighting for fairness and equality. In \naddition to his efforts to further the labor movement, Bill Robertson \ntook steps to assist the city of Los Angeles' homeless population. In \nthe winter of 1985, the city of Los Angeles had authorized a temporary \ntent shelter to be erected for the city's homeless population. Bill \nRobertson found this solution to be inadequate and successfully \npersuaded then Mayor Tom Bradley to authorize construction of a \ntemporary structure to house the 138-bed shelter. Bill Robertson \nrallied volunteer laborers and secured union funds to buy the \nconstruction materials.\n  Bill also played a major role in bringing prominence and recognition \nto the city of Los Angeles. In addition to assisting city officials \nwith securing the rights to host the 1984 Olympic Games, Bill also \nplayed a pivotal role in establishing a home for a professional \nfootball team in Los Angeles. It was through his role as chief \nnegotiator in the $6.7-million deal in 1980 that brought the Raiders \nfootball team from Oakland to the Los Angeles Coliseum. Bill Robertson \nconsidered this achievement as one of the proudest of his career.\n  I invite all of my colleagues to join me and the many members of the \nlabor community in recognizing and honoring Bill Robertson for his \nguidance and lifelong effort in fighting to improve the lives of \nworking people. He is survived by his wife, Dresden Graham Robertson; \nhis two sons, William and Robert; three grandchildren; and four great-\ngrandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/31/senate-section/article/S365-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             IN MEMORY OF JUDGE WILLIAM MATTHEW BYRNE, JR.\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am deeply saddened to inform you \nof the passing of Judge William Matthew Byrne, Jr. I would like to take \na few moments to recognize Judge Byrne's many important accomplishments \nand the tremendous impact he made on the judicial system.\n  William Byrne was born in East Los Angeles in 1930 and attended \nLoyola High School and the University of Southern California. Before \nbecoming a Federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, he served as a judge \nadvocate from 1956 to 1958 in the U.S. Air Force. In 1967, he was \nappointed as U.S. attorney by President Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1970, \nwhen President Richard Nixon created the President's Commission on \nCampus Unrest, he chose William Byrne as its executive director.\n  Byrne became the youngest judge ever appointed to the Federal bench \nwhen he was confirmed in 1971 at age 40, and he served as the Central \nDistrict's chief judge from 1994 to 1998. In more than 30 years of \nservice on the Federal bench, Judge Byrne had the opportunity to handle \nmany cases. He is, however, best known for presiding over the Pentagon \nPapers case, which was assigned to him just 2 years after his \nconfirmation as a Federal judge.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Woodson \nKindergarten Center, in Austin, MN, which recently earned an Award for \nExcellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements \nin educating children.\n  The Woodson Kindergarten Center, which is funded by Austin Public \nSchools, is truly a model of educational success. The district \nrecognized the advantages of joining together all of its \nkindergarteners in a single building. This made economic sense and also \nimproved the students' experience, allowing all kindergarten teachers \nand specialists to work together and to benefit from the expertise each \nperson brought to the team. Currently, 390 children attend Woodson \nKindergarten Center, which provides special education services and \nEnglish language learner services for children of all ages.\n  At Woodson Kindergarten, students are grouped for reading and math \nbased on skill level. A student who has not mastered all of the skills \nneeded for first grade attends 6 weeks of summer school. Woodson \nemphasizes reading to children in school and at home and also focuses \nthroughout the day on building children's social skills, including \nconflict resolution.\n  Woodson Kindergarten Center better prepares students for first grade \nand provides a stronger foundation for at-risk children. Its full-day \ncurriculum offers more time for hands-on discovery, for experimenting \nand making mistakes, for reading the whole story, and for richer, more \ndevelopmentally appropriate learning.\n  Much of the credit for Woodson Kindergarten Center's success belongs \nto its principal, Jean McDermott, and her dedicated teachers. The staff \nat Woodson Kindergarten Center understand that, in order to be \nsuccessful, a school must go beyond achieving academic success; it must \nprovide a nurturing environment where students develop the knowledge, \nskills and attitudes for a lifetime of success. All of the faculty, \nstaff, and students at the Woodson Kindergarten Center should be very \nproud of their accomplishments.\n  I congratulate Woodson Kindergarten Center in Austin, MN, for winning \nthe Award for Excellence in Education and for its exceptional \ncontributions to education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/31/senate-section/article/S365-3", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dakota \nMeadows Middle School, in North Mankato, MN, which recently earned an \nAward for Excellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative \nachievements in educating children.\n  Dakota Meadows Middle School is truly a model of educational success. \nOne hundred of the school's eighth-grade art students have created a \nglass mosaic, measuring 3 feet by 24 feet, for the school's media \ncenter. The project was financed by the Prairie Ecology Bus Center. The \noverall design, based on nature, correlates with the Dakota Meadows \nMiddle School Ecology curriculum, and includes images of fish, birds, \nand sky. I had the honor to be present at the school for the official \nunveiling, and found it to be an awe inspiring piece.\n  The glass mosaic medium was chosen to introduce the students to an \nancient medium. The mosaic's dimensions allowed each student to make a \nunique contribution toward an artistic work of lasting beauty.\n  Much of the credit for Dakota Meadows Middle School's success belongs \nto its principal, Shane Baier, and his dedicated teachers. The school \nand its artist in residence, Dr. Arnoldus Gruter, made it possible for \nthe students to produce their own work of art, which is also their \nlegacy to the school. The students and staff at Dakota Meadows Middle \nSchool understand that, in order to be successful, a school must go \nbeyond achieving academic success; it must also provide a nurturing \nenvironment where students develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes \nfor a lifetime of success.

Mr. President, today I honor last fall's Youth \nService Learning class, at Mankato West High\n\n[[Page S366]]\n\nSchool, in Mankato, MN, which recently earned an Award for Excellence \nin Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements.\n  The Youth Service Learning class at Mankato West High School is truly \na model of educational success. As part of its fall curriculum, the \nclass embraced Project Homecoming, a statewide effort to raise money to \nhelp pay for the cost of bus transportation from Camp Shelby, MS, to \nMinnesota, for 400 Minnesota National Guard soldiers. The soldiers had \nbeen training at Camp Shelby for deployment to Iraq in early 2006. \nAlthough they were given 10 days leave for the holidays, no funding was \navailable through the military or National Guard to provide round-trip \ntransportation to Minnesota and back.\n  The Youth Service Learning class, which focuses on volunteerism and \nthe functioning of nonprofits in the community, gained some real life \nexperience by helping Project Homecoming raise $75,000 in just under 4 \nweeks. The students learned how to establish a tax-exempt fundraising \neffort, engage the media in an event, and raise significant money for a \ncause they considered extremely important to their communities. In less \nthan 3 days, the students raised over $1,500 from their schoolmates, \nmade telephone calls to potential donors, and asked their own employers \nto help in the effort. With the students' help, Project Homecoming \nreached its $75,000 goal.\n  Much of the credit for the Youth Service Learning class's success \nbelongs to Mr. Bruce Borchers, Mankato West principal; Mr. Tim Walz, \nYouth Service Learning teacher; and Mr. Pat Griffiths, Project \nHomecoming coordinator. The students and staff who participated in the \nclass understand that in order to be successful, a school must go \nbeyond achieving academic success; it must also provide a nurturing \nenvironment where students develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes \nfor a lifetime of success. All of the faculty, staff, and students \nshould be very proud of their accomplishments.\n  I congratulate the Youth Service Learning class at Mankato West High \nSchool in Mankato, MN, for winning the Award for Excellence in \nEducation and for its exceptional contributions to education in \nMinnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/31/senate-section/article/S366-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/31/senate-section/article/S366-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/31/senate-section/article/S366-3", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S366-S370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON THE STATE OF THE UNION DELIVERED TO A JOINT SESSION OF \n                  CONGRESS ON JANUARY 31, 2006--PM 35\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was ordered to lie on the table:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, Members of \nthe Supreme Court and diplomatic corps, distinguished guests, and \nfellow citizens:\n  Today our Nation lost a beloved, graceful, courageous woman who \ncalled America to its founding ideals and carried on a noble dream. \nTonight we are comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the husband \nwho was taken from her so long ago, and we are grateful for the good \nlife of Coretta Scott King.\n  Each time I am invited to this rostrum, I am humbled by the \nprivilege, and mindful of the history we have seen together. We have \ngathered under this Capitol dome in moments of national mourning and \nnational achievement. We have served America through one of the most \nconsequential periods of our history and it has been my honor to serve \nwith you.\n  In a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches, \nthere will always be differences and debate. But even tough debates can \nbe conducted in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to \nharden into anger. To confront the great issues before us, we must act \nin a spirit of goodwill and respect for one another--and I will do my \npart. Tonight the state of our Union is strong--and together we will \nmake it stronger.\n  In this decisive year, you and I will make choices that determine \nboth the future and the character of our country. We will choose to act \nconfidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom--or retreat from our \nduties in the hope of an easier life. We will choose to build our \nprosperity by leading the world economy--or shut ourselves off from \ntrade and opportunity. In a complex and challenging time, the road of \nisolationism and protectionism may seem broad and inviting--yet it ends \nin danger and decline. The only way to protect our people . . . the \nonly way to secure the peace . . . the only way to control our destiny \nis by our leadership--so the United States of America will continue to \nlead.\n  Abroad, our Nation is committed to an historic, long-term goal--we \nseek the end of tyranny in our world. Some dismiss that goal as \nmisguided idealism. In reality, the future security of America depends \non it. On September 11, 2001, we found that problems originating in a \nfailed and oppressive state seven thousand miles away could bring \nmurder and destruction to our country. Dictatorships shelter \nterrorists, feed resentment and radicalism, and seek weapons of mass \ndestruction. Democracies replace resentment with hope, respect the \nrights of their citizens and their neighbors, and join the fight \nagainst terror. Every step toward freedom in the world makes our \ncountry safer, and so we will act boldly in freedom's cause.\n  Far from being a hopeless dream, the advance of freedom is the great \nstory of our time. In 1945, there were about two dozen lonely \ndemocracies on Earth. Today, there are 122. And we are writing a new \nchapter in the story of self-government--with women lining up to vote \nin Afghanistan . . . and millions of Iraqis marking their liberty with \npurple ink . . . and men and women from Lebanon to Egypt debating the \nrights of individuals and the necessity of freedom. At the start of \n2006, more than half the people of our world live in democratic \nnations. And we do not forget the other half--in places like Syria, \nBurma, Zimbabwe, North Korea, and Iran--because the demands of justice, \nand the peace of this world, require their freedom as well.\n  No one can deny the success of freedom, but some men rage and fight \nagainst it. And one of the main sources of reaction and opposition is \nradical Islam--the perversion by a few of a noble faith into an \nideology of terror and death. Terrorists like bin Laden are serious \nabout mass murder--and all of us must take their declared intentions \nseriously. They seek to impose a heartless system of totalitarian \ncontrol throughout the Middle East, and arm themselves with weapons of \nmass murder. Their aim is to seize power in Iraq, and use it as a safe \nhaven to launch attacks against America and the world. Lacking the \nmilitary strength to challenge us directly, the terrorists have chosen \nthe weapon of fear. When they murder children at a school in Beslan . . \n. or blow up commuters in London . . . or behead a bound captive . . . \nthe terrorists hope these horrors will break our will, allowing the \nviolent to inherit the Earth. But they have miscalculated: We love our \nfreedom, and we will fight to keep it.\n\n  In a time of testing, we cannot find security by abandoning our \ncommitments and retreating within our borders. If we were to leave \nthese vicious attackers alone, they would not leave us alone. They \nwould simply move the battlefield to our own shores. There is no peace \nin retreat. And there is no honor in retreat. By allowing radical Islam \nto work its will--by leaving an assaulted world to fend for itself--we \nwould signal to all that we no longer believe in our own ideals, or \neven in our own courage. But our enemies and our friends can be \ncertain: The United States will not retreat from the world, and we will \nnever surrender to evil.\n  America rejects the false comfort of isolationism. We are the Nation \nthat saved liberty in Europe, and liberated\n\n[[Page S367]]\n\ndeath camps, and helped raise up democracies, and faced down an evil \nempire. Once again, we accept the call of history to deliver the \noppressed, and move this world toward peace.\n  We remain on the offensive against terror networks. We have killed or \ncaptured many of their leaders--and for the others, their day will \ncome.\n  We remain on the offensive in Afghanistan--where a fine president and \nnational assembly are fighting terror while building the institutions \nof a new democracy.\n  And we are on the offensive in Iraq, with a clear plan for victory. \nFirst, we are helping Iraqis build an inclusive government, so that old \nresentments will be eased, and the insurgency marginalized. Second, we \nare continuing reconstruction efforts, and helping the Iraqi government \nto fight corruption and build a modern economy, so all Iraqis can \nexperience the benefits of freedom. Third, we are striking terrorist \ntargets while we train Iraqi forces that are increasingly capable of \ndefeating the enemy. Iraqis are showing their courage every day, and we \nare proud to be their allies in the cause of freedom.\n  Our work in Iraq is difficult, because our enemy is brutal. But that \nbrutality has not stopped the dramatic progress of a new democracy. In \nless than 3 years, that nation has gone from dictatorship, to \nliberation, to sovereignty, to a constitution, to national elections. \nAt the same time, our coalition has been relentless in shutting off \nterrorist infiltration, clearing out insurgent strongholds, and turning \nover territory to Iraqi security forces. I am confident in our plan for \nvictory . . . I am confident in the will of the Iraqi people . . . I am \nconfident in the skill and spirit of our military. Fellow citizens, we \nare in this fight to win, and we are winning.\n  The road of victory is the road that will take our troops home. As we \nmake progress on the ground, and Iraqi forces increasingly take the \nlead, we should be able to further decrease our troop levels--but those \ndecisions will be made by our military commanders, not by politicians \nin Washington, DC.\n  Our coalition has learned from experience in Iraq. We have adjusted \nour military tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction. Along \nthe way, we have benefited from responsible criticism and counsel \noffered by Members of Congress of both parties. In the coming year, I \nwill continue to reach out and seek your good advice.\n\n  Yet there is a difference between responsible criticism that aims for \nsuccess, and defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but \nfailure. Hindsight alone is not wisdom. And second-guessing is not a \nstrategy.\n  With so much in the balance, those of us in public office have a duty \nto speak with candor. A sudden withdrawal of our forces from Iraq would \nabandon our Iraqi allies to death and prison . . . put men like bin \nLaden and Zarqawi in charge of a strategic country . . . and show that \na pledge from America means little. Members of Congress: however we \nfeel about the decisions and debates of the past, our Nation has only \none option: We must keep our word, defeat our enemies, and stand behind \nthe American military in its vital mission.\n  Our men and women in uniform are making sacrifices--and showing a \nsense of duty stronger than all fear. They know what it is like to \nfight house to house in a maze of streets . . . to wear heavy gear in \nthe desert heat . . . to see a comrade killed by a roadside bomb. And \nthose who know the costs also know the stakes. Marine Staff Sergeant \nDan Clay was killed last month fighting the enemy in Fallujah. He left \nbehind a letter to his family, but his words could just as well be \naddressed to every American. Here is what Dan wrote: ``I know what \nhonor is. It has been an honor to protect and serve all of you. I faced \ndeath with the secure knowledge that you would not have to . . . Never \nfalter! Don't hesitate to honor and support those of us who have the \nhonor of protecting that which is worth protecting.''\n  Staff Sergeant Dan Clay's wife, Lisa, and his mom and dad, Sara Jo \nand Bud, are with us this evening. Our Nation is grateful to the \nfallen, who live in the memory of our country. We are grateful to all \nwho volunteer to wear our Nation's uniform--and as we honor our brave \ntroops, let us never forget the sacrifices of America's military \nfamilies.\n  Our offensive against terror involves more than military action. \nUltimately, the only way to defeat the terrorists is to defeat their \ndark vision of hatred and fear by offering the hopeful alternative of \npolitical freedom and peaceful change. So the United States of America \nsupports democratic reform across the broader Middle East. Elections \nare vital--but they are only the beginning. Raising up a democracy \nrequires the rule of law, protection of minorities, and strong, \naccountable institutions that last longer than a single vote. The great \npeople of Egypt have voted in a multi-party presidential election--and \nnow their government should open paths of peaceful opposition that will \nreduce the appeal of radicalism. The Palestinian people have voted in \nelections--now the leaders of Hamas must recognize Israel, disarm, \nreject terrorism, and work for lasting peace. Saudi Arabia has taken \nthe first steps of reform--now it can offer its people a better future \nby pressing forward with those efforts. Democracies in the Middle East \nwill not look like our own, because they will reflect the traditions of \ntheir own citizens. Yet liberty is the future of every nation in the \nMiddle East, because liberty is the right and hope of all humanity.\n  The same is true of Iran, a nation now held hostage by a small \nclerical elite that is isolating and repressing its people. The regime \nin that country sponsors terrorists in the Palestinian territories and \nin Lebanon--and that must come to an end. The Iranian government is \ndefying the world with its nuclear ambitions--and the nations of the \nworld must not permit the Iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons. \nAmerica will continue to rally the world to confront these threats. And \ntonight, let me speak directly to the citizens of Iran: America \nrespects you, and we respect your country. We respect your right to \nchoose your own future and win your own freedom. And our Nation hopes \none day to be the closest of friends with a free and democratic Iran.\n\n  To overcome dangers in our world, we must also take the offensive by \nencouraging economic progress, fighting disease, and spreading hope in \nhopeless lands. Isolationism would not only tie our hands in fighting \nenemies, it would keep us from helping our friends in desperate need. \nWe show compassion abroad because Americans believe in the God-given \ndignity and worth of a villager with HIV/AIDS, or an infant with \nmalaria, or a refugee fleeing genocide, or a young girl sold into \nslavery. We also show compassion abroad because regions overwhelmed by \npoverty, corruption, and despair are sources of terrorism, organized \ncrime, human trafficking, and the drug trade.\n  In recent years, you and I have taken unprecedented action to fight \nAIDS and malaria, expand the education of girls, and reward developing \nnations that are moving forward with economic and political reform. For \npeople everywhere, the United States is a partner for a better life. \nShort-changing these efforts would increase the suffering and chaos of \nour world, undercut our long-term security, and dull the conscience of \nour country. I urge Members of Congress to serve the interests of \nAmerica by showing the compassion of America.\n  Our country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here \nat home. The enemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack us. \nFortunately, this Nation has superb professionals in law enforcement, \nintelligence, the military, and homeland security. These men and women \nare dedicating their lives to protecting us all, and they deserve our \nsupport and our thanks. They also deserve the same tools they already \nuse to fight drug trafficking and organized crime--so I ask you to \nreauthorize the Patriot Act.\n  It is said that prior to the attacks of September 11th, our \nGovernment failed to connect the dots of the conspiracy. We now know \nthat two of the hijackers in the United States placed telephone calls \nto al-Qaida operatives overseas. But we did not know about their plans \nuntil it was too late. So to prevent another attack--based on authority \ngiven to me by the Constitution and by statute--I have authorized a \nterrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue the international \ncommunications of suspected al-Qaida operatives and affiliates to and \nfrom America. Previous\n\n[[Page S368]]\n\npresidents have used the same constitutional authority I have--and \nFederal courts have approved the use of that authority. Appropriate \nMembers of Congress have been kept informed. This terrorist \nsurveillance program has helped prevent terrorist attacks. It remains \nessential to the security of America. If there are people inside our \ncountry who are talking with al-Qaida, we want to know about it--\nbecause we will not sit back and wait to be hit again.\n  In all these areas--from the disruption of terror networks, to \nvictory in Iraq, to the spread of freedom and hope in troubled \nregions--we need the support of friends and allies. To draw that \nsupport, we must always be clear in our principles and willing to act. \nThe only alternative to American leadership is a dramatically more \ndangerous and anxious world. Yet we also choose to lead because it is a \nprivilege to serve the values that gave us birth. American leaders--\nfrom Roosevelt to Truman to Kennedy to Reagan--rejected isolation and \nretreat, because they knew that America is always more secure when \nfreedom is on the march. Our own generation is in a long war against a \ndetermined enemy--a war that will be fought by Presidents of both \nparties, who will need steady bipartisan support from the Congress. And \ntonight I ask for yours. Together, let us protect our country, support \nthe men and women who defend us, and lead this world toward freedom.\n  Here at home, America also has a great opportunity: We will build the \nprosperity of our country by strengthening our economic leadership in \nthe world.\n  Our economy is healthy, and vigorous, and growing faster than other \nmajor industrialized nations. In the last two-and-a-half years, America \nhas created 4.6 million new jobs--more than Japan and the European \nUnion combined. Even in the face of higher energy prices and natural \ndisasters, the American people have turned in an economic performance \nthat is the envy of the world.\n  The American economy is pre-eminent--but we cannot afford to be \ncomplacent. In a dynamic world economy, we are seeing new competitors \nlike China and India. This creates uncertainty, which makes it easier \nto feed people's fears. And so we are seeing some old temptations \nreturn. Protectionists want to escape competition, pretending that we \ncan keep our high standard of living while walling off our economy. \nOthers say that the Government needs to take a larger role in directing \nthe economy, centralizing more power in Washington and increasing \ntaxes. We hear claims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy--\neven though this economy could not function without them. All these are \nforms of economic retreat, and they lead in the same direction--toward \na stagnant and second-rate economy.\n  Tonight I will set out a better path--an agenda for a Nation that \ncompetes with confidence--an agenda that will raise standards of living \nand generate new jobs. Americans should not fear our economic future, \nbecause we intend to shape it.\n  Keeping America competitive begins with keeping our economy growing. \nAnd our economy grows when Americans have more of their own money to \nspend, save, and invest. In the last 5 years, the tax relief you passed \nhas left $880 billion in the hands of American workers, investors, \nsmall businesses, and families--and they have used it to help produce \nmore than 4 years of uninterrupted economic growth. Yet the tax relief \nis set to expire in the next few years. If we do nothing, American \nfamilies will face a massive tax increase they do not expect and will \nnot welcome.\n  Because America needs more than a temporary expansion, we need more \nthan temporary tax relief. I urge the Congress to act responsibly, and \nmake the tax cuts permanent.\n  Keeping America competitive requires us to be good stewards of tax \ndollars. Every year of my presidency, we have reduced the growth of \nnon-security discretionary spending--and last year you passed bills \nthat cut this spending. This year my budget will cut it again, and \nreduce or eliminate more than 140 programs that are performing poorly \nor not fulfilling essential priorities. By passing these reforms, we \nwill save the American taxpayer another $14 billion next year--and stay \non track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. I am pleased that Members \nof Congress are working on earmark reform--because the Federal budget \nhas too many special interest projects. And we can tackle this problem \ntogether, if you pass the line-item veto.\n  We must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending, or \nentitlements. This year, the first of about 78 million Baby Boomers \nturn 60, including two of my Dad's favorite people--me, and President \nBill Clinton. This milestone is more than a personal crisis--it is a \nnational challenge. The retirement of the Baby Boom generation will put \nunprecedented strains on the Federal Government. By 2030, spending for \nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid alone will be almost 60 percent \nof the entire Federal budget. And that will present future Congresses \nwith impossible choices--staggering tax increases, immense deficits, or \ndeep cuts in every category of spending.\n  Congress did not act last year on my proposal to save Social \nSecurity, yet the rising cost of entitlements is a problem that is not \ngoing away--and with every year we fail to act, the situation gets \nworse. So tonight, I ask you to join me in creating a commission to \nexamine the full impact of Baby Boom retirements on Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid. This commission should include Members of \nCongress of both parties, and offer bipartisan answers. We need to put \naside partisan politics, work together, and get this problem solved.\n  Keeping America competitive requires us to open more markets for all \nthat Americans make and grow. One out of every five factory jobs in \nAmerica is related to global trade, and we want people everywhere to \nbuy American. With open markets and a level playing field, no one can \nout-produce or out-compete the American worker.\n  Keeping America competitive requires an immigration system that \nupholds our laws, reflects our values, and serves the interests of our \neconomy. Our Nation needs orderly and secure borders. To meet this \ngoal, we must have stronger immigration enforcement and border \nprotection. And we must have a rational, humane guest worker program \nthat rejects amnesty . . . allows temporary jobs for people who seek \nthem legally . . . and reduces smuggling and crime at the border.\n  Keeping America competitive requires affordable health care. Our \nGovernment has a responsibility to help provide health care for the \npoor and the elderly, and we are meeting that responsibility. For all \nAmericans, we must confront the rising cost of care . . . strengthen \nthe doctor-patient relationship . . . and help people afford the \ninsurance coverage they need. We will make wider use of electronic \nrecords and other health information technology to help control costs \nand reduce dangerous medical errors. We will strengthen Health Savings \nAccounts--by making sure individuals and small business employees can \nbuy insurance with the same advantages that people working for big \nbusinesses now get. We will do more to make this coverage portable, so \nworkers can switch jobs without having to worry about losing their \nhealth insurance. And because lawsuits are driving many good doctors \nout of practice--leaving women in nearly 1,500 American counties \nwithout a single OB-GYN--I ask the Congress to pass medical liability \nreform this year.\n\n  Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy. Here we have \na serious problem: America is addicted to oil, which is often imported \nfrom unstable parts of the world.\n  The best way to break this addiction is through technology. Since \n2001, we have spent nearly $10 billion to develop cleaner, cheaper, \nmore reliable alternative energy sources--and we are on the threshold \nof incredible advances. So tonight, I announce the Advanced Energy \nInitiative--a 22-percent increase in clean-energy research at the \nDepartment of Energy, to push for breakthroughs in two vital areas. To \nchange how we power our homes and offices, we will invest more in zero-\nemission coal-fired plants; revolutionary solar and wind technologies; \nand clean, safe nuclear energy.\n  We must also change how we power our automobiles. We will increase \nour research in better batteries for hybrid and electric cars, and in \npollution-free\n\n[[Page S369]]\n\ncars that run on hydrogen. We will also fund additional research in \ncutting-edge methods of producing ethanol, not just from corn but from \nwood chips, stalks, or even leaves. Our goal is to make this new kind \nof ethanol practical and competitive within 6 years. Breakthroughs on \nthis and other new technologies will help us reach another great goal: \nto replace more than 75 percent of our oil imports from the Middle East \nby 2025. By applying the talent and technology of America, this country \ncan dramatically improve our environment . . . move beyond a petroleum-\nbased economy . . . and make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a \nthing of the past.\n  And to keep America competitive, one commitment is necessary above \nall: We must continue to lead the world in human talent and creativity. \nOur greatest advantage in the world has always been our educated, hard-\nworking, ambitious people--and we are going to keep that edge. Tonight \nI announce the American Competitiveness Initiative, to encourage \ninnovation throughout our economy, and to give our Nation's children a \nfirm grounding in math and science.\n  First: I propose to double the Federal commitment to the most \ncritical basic research programs in the physical sciences over the next \n10 years. This funding will support the work of America's most creative \nminds as they explore promising areas such as nanotechnology, \nsupercomputing, and alternative energy sources.\n  Second: I propose to make permanent the research and development tax \ncredit, to encourage bolder private-sector investment in technology. \nWith more research in both the public and private sectors, we will \nimprove our quality of life--and ensure that America will lead the \nworld in opportunity and innovation for decades to come.\n  Third: We need to encourage children to take more math and science, \nand make sure those courses are rigorous enough to compete with other \nnations. We have made a good start in the early grades with the No \nChild Left Behind Act, which is raising standards and lifting test \nscores across our country. Tonight I propose to train 70,000 high \nschool teachers, to lead advanced-placement courses in math and science \n. . . bring 30,000 math and science professionals to teach in \nclassrooms . . . and give early help to students who struggle with \nmath, so they have a better chance at good, high-wage jobs. If we \nensure that America's children succeed in life, they will ensure that \nAmerica succeeds in the world.\n  Preparing our Nation to compete in the world is a goal that all of us \ncan share. I urge you to support the American Competitiveness \nInitiative . . . and together we will show the world what the American \npeople can achieve.\n  America is a great force for freedom and prosperity. Yet our \ngreatness is not measured in power or luxuries, but by who we are and \nhow we treat one another. So we strive to be a compassionate, decent, \nhopeful society.\n  In recent years, America has become a more hopeful Nation. Violent \ncrime rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s. Welfare \ncases have dropped by more than half over the past decade. Drug use \namong youth is down 19 percent since 2001. There are fewer abortions in \nAmerica than at any point in the last three decades, and the number of \nchildren born to teenage mothers has been falling for a dozen years in \na row.\n  These gains are evidence of a quiet transformation--a revolution of \nconscience, in which a rising generation is finding that a life of \npersonal responsibility is a life of fulfillment. Government has played \na role. Wise policies such as welfare reform, drug education, and \nsupport for abstinence and adoption have made a difference in the \ncharacter of our country. And everyone here tonight, Democrat and \nRepublican, has a right to be proud of this record.\n  Yet many Americans, especially parents, still have deep concerns \nabout the direction of our culture, and the health of our most basic \ninstitutions. They are concerned about unethical conduct by public \nofficials, and discouraged by activist courts that try to redefine \nmarriage. And they worry about children in our society who need \ndirection and love . . . and about fellow citizens still displaced by \nnatural disaster . . . and about suffering caused by treatable disease.\n  As we look at these challenges, we must never give in to the belief \nthat America is in decline, or that our culture is doomed to unravel. \nThe American people know better than that. We have proven the \npessimists wrong before--and we will do it again.\n  A hopeful society depends on courts that deliver equal justice under \nlaw. The Supreme Court now has two superb new members, Chief Justice \nJohn Roberts and Justice Sam Alito. I thank the Senate for confirming \nboth of them. And I will continue to nominate men and women who \nunderstand that judges must be servants of the law, and not legislate \nfrom the bench. Today marks the official retirement of a very special \nAmerican. For 24 years of faithful service to our Nation, the United \nStates honors Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.\n  A hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do \nnot cut ethical corners, and that recognize the matchless value of \nevery life. Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most \negregious abuses of medical research--human cloning in all its forms . \n. . creating or implanting embryos for experiments . . . creating \nhuman-animal hybrids . . . and buying, selling, or patenting human \nembryos. Human life is a gift from our Creator--and that gift should \nnever be discarded, devalued, or put up for sale.\n  A hopeful society expects elected officials to uphold the public \ntrust. Honorable people in both parties are working on reforms to \nstrengthen the ethical standards of Washington--and I support your \nefforts. Each of us has made a pledge to be worthy of public \nresponsibility--and that is a pledge we must never forget, never \ndismiss, and never betray.\n  As we renew the promise of our institutions, let us also show the \ncharacter of America in our compassion and care for one another.\n  A hopeful society gives special attention to children who lack \ndirection and love. Through the Helping America's Youth Initiative, we \nare encouraging caring adults to get involved in the life of a child--\nand this good work is led by our First Lady, Laura Bush. This year we \nwill add resources to encourage young people to stay in school--so more \nof America's youth can raise their sights and achieve their dreams.\n  A hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of \nsuffering and emergency--and stays at it until they are back on their \nfeet. So far the Federal Government has committed $85 billion to the \npeople of the Gulf Coast and New Orleans. We are removing debris, \nrepairing highways, and building stronger levees. We are providing \nbusiness loans and housing assistance. Yet as we meet these immediate \nneeds, we must also address deeper challenges that existed before the \nstorm arrived. In New Orleans and in other places, many of our fellow \ncitizens have felt excluded from the promise of our country. The answer \nis not only temporary relief, but schools that teach every child . . . \nand job skills that bring upward mobility . . . and more opportunities \nto own a home and start a business. As we recover from a disaster, let \nus also work for the day when all Americans are protected by justice, \nequal in hope, and rich in opportunity.\n  A hopeful society acts boldly to fight diseases like HIV/AIDS, which \ncan be prevented, and treated, and defeated. More than a million \nAmericans live with HIV, and half of all AIDS cases occur among \nAfrican-Americans. I ask Congress to reform and reauthorize the Ryan \nWhite Act . . . and provide new funding to States, so we end the \nwaiting lists for AIDS medicine in America. We will also lead a \nnationwide effort, working closely with African-American churches and \nfaith-based groups, to deliver rapid HIV tests to millions, end the \nstigma of AIDS, and come closer to the day when there are no new \ninfections in America.\n\n  Fellow citizens, we have been called to leadership in a period of \nconsequence. We have entered a great ideological conflict we did \nnothing to invite. We see great changes in science and commerce that \nwill influence all our lives. And sometimes it can seem that history is \nturning in a wide arc, toward an unknown shore.\n  Yet the destination of history is determined by human action, and \nevery great movement of history comes to a point of choosing. Lincoln \ncould have accepted peace at the cost of disunity\n\n[[Page S370]]\n\nand continued slavery. Martin Luther King could have stopped at \nBirmingham or at Selma, and achieved only half a victory over \nsegregation. The United States could have accepted the permanent \ndivision of Europe, and been complicit in the oppression of others. \nToday, having come far in our own historical journey, we must decide: \nWill we turn back, or finish well?\n  Before history is written down in books, it is written in courage. \nLike Americans before us, we will show that courage and we will finish \nwell. We will lead freedom's advance. We will compete and excel in the \nglobal economy. We will renew the defining moral commitments of this \nland. And. so we move forward--optimistic about our country, faithful \nto its cause, and confident of victories to come.\n  Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless America.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to provide quality, affordable health care for all \nAmericans; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in this century of the life sciences, \nmedical miracles have the potential to improve the health and extend \nthe lives of millions of Americans and millions more across the world.\n  But for too many of our citizens, quality affordable health care is a \ndistant dream, and the promise of the century of the life sciences \nrings hollow.\n  Forty-six million Americans have no health insurance. Under the \ncurrent Administration, the number has climbed every year of this \nAdministration, from 40 million in 2000 to 46 million today. That's \nequivalent to the population of 24 States and the District of \nColumbia--combined.\n  That's 46 million Americans who wonder whether a cough or fever will \nturn into a serious illness that brings financial ruin, and 46 million \nAmericans who have to make the impossible choice between paying for a \nvisit to the doctor or paying the rent to keep a roof over their heads.\n  Even these figures understate the problem. Over a two year period, 82 \nmillion Americans, one out of every three Americans under 65, will be \nuninsured for a period of at least two months.\n  The burden of lack of health insurance falls most heavily on minority \npopulations. Less than 13 percent of white Americans are uninsured, but \nover 20 percent of African Americans lack health insurance. For \nHispanic Americans, the figure is even more appalling--over a third of \nHispanic Americans lack coverage.\n  Over 80 percent of the uninsured are members of working families. \nThey work 40 hours a week, fifty-two weeks a year--but all their hard \nwork can't buy them the health insurance they need to protect \nthemselves and their families--because they can't afford it and their \nemployers don't provide it.\n  In any given year, one third of the uninsured go without needed \nmedical care. Eight million uninsured Americans fail to take the drugs \ntheir doctors prescribe--because they can't afford to fill the \nprescription. 270,000 children suffering from asthma never see a \ndoctor. 27,000 uninsured women are diagnosed with breast cancer each \nyear. They are twice as likely as insured women not to receive medical \ntreatment until their cancer has spread. As a result, they are 50 \npercent more likely to die of the disease.\n  The list of grim examples goes on and on.\n  Some argue that despite the lack of health care coverage, the \nuninsured get the care they need. But that's a myth. The facts prove \notherwise.\n  Thirty five percent of the uninsured--over 15 million Americans--skip \nrecommended treatment because of cost. Over a third of the uninsured \nneed care but do not get it, and nearly half postpone care because of \nits cost. Millions of Americans are at risk of ignoring serious \nillnesses, because they can't afford to see a doctor for a needed test.\n  Whether the disease is AIDS or mental illness or cancer or heart \ndisease or diabetes, the uninsured are left out and left behind. In \nhospital and out, young or old, black or white, they receive less care, \nsuffer more, and are 25 percent more likely to die than those who are \ninsured.\n  But the large and growing number of the uninsured is only part of the \nhealth care crisis. Costs are rising out of control, making health care \ncoverage less affordable for businesses and individuals, and \nundercutting American industry in the global marketplace.\n  There is no doubt that America has the finest health care \nprofessionals, the best hospitals and the most creative medical \nresearchers in the world. But having the best components is no \nguarantee of success for the health care system as a whole.\n  In the amount of money spent on health care per person, America is \nfirst in the world by a large margin. By that standard, we spend 49 \npercent more than the Swiss, 88 percent more than the Germans, 150 \npercent more than the British, and 160 more than the Japanese. Despite \nthis enormons expenditure, America's health care system fails all too \noften to deliver quality health care. Among the world's leading \nindustrialized countries, the United States ranks only 22nd in average \nlife expectancy and 25th in infant mortality.\n  The most significant difference between the American health care \nsystem and those of our economic competitors is that these other \nnations regard health as a right, not a privilege. They make certain \nthat their citizens have access to good health care. By establishing a \nnational system of care, they have been able to hold down costs and \nkeep quality high.\n  In the United States, we have refused to commit to quality health \ncare for all Americans.\n  As a result, those who can afford the best care receive it, but \nmillions of other Americans are left by the wayside.\n  Because of our fractured system of care, America's health care system \nis the most economically inefficient in the industrial world. The \nadministrative costs alone of our system are nearly double those of \nCanada. Reducing our administrative costs to the low level of the \nCanadian system would save about $250 billion every year.\n  The difference between the way health care is financed in Canada and \nthe U.S. saves the Canadian auto industry $4.00 an hour in worker \ncompensation compared to the U.S. The Canadian branches of the big \nthree automakers have released a joint letter with the Canadian Auto \nWorkers Union stating that the Canadian system is a ``strategic \nadvantage for Canada'' and ``has been an important ingredient'' in the \nsuccess of Canada's ``most important export industry.''\n  Wise investments have helped contain health care costs here at home \ntoo. Since 1996, costs per patient in the Veterans medical system have \nactually decreased 7 percent, while private sector costs per patient \nhave increased by 62 percent. The VA system did not achieve these \nsavings by stinting on patient care or denying needed services. The VA \nhas been widely praised for improving its quality of care through \ninvestments in information technology and a strong commitment to \nquality for all.\n\n[[Page S372]]\n\n  As a result of America's failure to focus on comprehensive care and \ncost reduction, costs are soaring out of control. Health care premiums \nhave gone up over 70 percent in the last five years--over 5 times the \noverall rate of inflation in the economy. More and more small \nbusinesses can't afford to offer health care to their employees.\n  Health care costs mean that working Americans who have health \ncoverage through their job are increasingly worried that their employer \nwill eliminate the coverage on which they rely. Those who obtain \ncoverage on the individual market must often pay huge premiums and \naccept large gaps in their coverage if they have any history of \nillness, no matter how slight. Many cannot obtain coverage at any \nprice.\n  Even those who have health insurance have little security. Millions \nof Americans have seen health care costs eat away their savings and cut \ninto their paychecks more and more every year.\n  Since the year 2000, the average cost of a family health insurance \npolicy has increased by over $4,500, so that it now costs the average \nfamily nearly $11,000 for a health care policy. Family earnings have \nnot kept pace. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, health \ninsurance premiums climbed by 73 percent over the last five years--but \nearnings increased only 15 percent.\n  The costs keep climbing higher and higher. Almost one in five working \nfamilies have seen their premiums go up over 15 percent--and one in ten \nhave faced increases over 20 percent.\n  These out-of-control costs are devastating for both individuals and \nbusinesses. Working families often face the agonizing choice between \npaying for health insurance and paying rent or buying groceries. Or \nthey compromise by buying a meager insurance policy that provides \nlittle refuge when big danger strikes.\n  It's no wonder that unpaid medical bills cause nearly half the \nbankruptcies in America.\n  It's no wonder that practically every business leader in America \ncites rising health care costs as a top concern. When General Motors \nhas to spend more on health care than it does on steel, it's time for a \nchange. When ten percent of the total cost of a ton of steel \nmanufactured in the United States is consumed by retiree health \nbenefits alone, it's time for a change. When Starbucks spends more on \nhealth care than it does on coffee, it's time for a change.\n  In world markets, American businesses have to compete with foreign \nfirms whose health costs are heavily subsidized by the government. \nAmerican workers are the best in the world, but we give other nations \nan unfair advantage, because we refuse to enact long overdue policies \nto reduce health costs and ease the heavy burden of health care for \nAmerican employees.\n  To say that this Administration and its Republican allies in Congress \nhave stood idly by as this crisis has worsened would be untrue. To say \nthey have taken no action as 3,000 more Americans have become uninsured \nduring every single day of the Bush Administration would be inaccurate. \nThey have taken action--by making the health care crisis worse.\n  Tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote on a budget bill \nthat will make the health care crisis worse for the 50 million \nAmericans for whom Medicaid is literally the difference between life or \ndeath. The Republican bill makes them pay more and more for the health \ncare on which their lives depend. I urge the House to reject these \ndistorted priorities.\n  Currently, communities across the nation are struggling to cope with \nthe disaster caused by the Republican Medicare drug ``plan''. Millions \nof seniors have faced a baffling array of choices, instead of the \ncertainty of Medicare in getting the medications they need. Millions of \npersons with disabilities, or those facing the challenge of HIV/AIDS or \nliving with mental illnesses have been denied the prescriptions they \nrequire, or have been told to pay exorbitant fees by the insurance \ncompanies that Republicans put in charge of the drug benefit. Try \ntelling those who have been denied their medicines that they are in \ncharge of their health care.\n  Tonight, the President will try to make the American people believe \nthat the solution to rising health costs is to shift more and more of \nthose costs to patients, or to deny care to those in need. That's the \nwrong prescription for health care.\n  The President's proposal will let the wealthiest Americans rack up \nbillions of dollars in tax giveaways, while shifting the costs of \nhealth care to working families and those least able to pay.\n\n  Our people deserve true health care reform--not gimmicks and \ngiveaways that worsen the crisis. They deserve a guarantee that when \nthey get sick, they'll be able to obtain decent health care at a price \nthey can afford.\n  Medicare has meant quality health care for millions of senior \ncitizens for forty years. The time has come to make Medicare available \nto every American who wants to enroll in it. It's the best way to bring \nthe enormous promise of this new century of the life sciences to every \nAmerican.\n  America's failure to guarantee the basic right to health care for all \nits citizens was one of the great public policy failures of the 20th \ncentury, and we must not allow that failure to continue in this new \ncentury.\n  There is a better way. Our goal should be an America where no citizen \nof any age fears the cost of health care, and no employer stops \ncreating jobs because of the high cost of providing health insurance.\n  We should build on the tried and true and trusted model of Medicare. \nAdministrative costs are low, patient satisfaction is high, and \npatients have the right to choose any doctor and hospital they think is \nbest--not the one an insurance company thinks is best for them.\n  Today I am introducing legislation to extend Medicare to all \nAmericans, from birth to the end of life. Those who prefer private \ninsurance can choose any of the plans offered to members of Congress \nand the President. I call this approach Medicare for All, because it \nwill free all Americans from the fear of medical expenses and enable \nthem to seek the best possible care when illness strikes. Nothing is \nmore cynical than a Member of Congress who gives a speech denouncing \nhealth care for all, then goes off to see his doctor for a visit paid \nfor by the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan.\n  To ease the transition, Medicare for All will be phased in by age \ngroup, starting with those 55-65 years old and children up to the age \nof 20.\n  The plan contains a number of provisions to reduce costs and improve \nquality, including more effective use of health information technology. \nIt also puts new emphasis on preventive care, because preventing \nillness before it occurs is always better and less expensive than \ntreating patients after they become ill.\n  My proposal will be entirely voluntary. Any American who wishes to \nstay in their current employer-sponsored plan can do so, and employers \ncan tailor their health plans to provide additional services to their \nemployees that wrap around Medicare coverage.\n  As we implement this reform, financing must be a shared \nresponsibility. All will benefit, and all should contribute. Payroll \ntaxes should be part of the financing, but so should general revenues, \nto make the financing as progressive as possible.\n  We can offset a large part of the expense by a single giant step--\nbringing health care into the modem age of information technology. By \nmoving to electronic medical records for all Americans when they go to \nthe hospital or their doctor, we can save hundreds of billions of \ndollars a year in administrative costs while improving the quality of \ncare. Equally important, we should pay for health care based on value \nand results, not just the number of procedures performed or days in a \nhospital bed.\n  We all know that Medicare is one of the most successful social \nprograms ever enacted. It makes no sense to make it available only to \nsenior citizens. I have no doubt that if we were enacting Medicare \ntoday, we would not limit its benefits to seniors. The need for good \nhealth coverage is as urgent today for all Americans as it was for \nsenior citizens 40 years ago, when Medicare was first enacted.\n  The battle to achieve Medicare for All will not be easy. Powerful \ninterests will strongly oppose it, because they profit immensely from \nthe status quo. But no battle worth fighting is easy--and the struggle \nto fulfill the promise\n\n[[Page S373]]\n\nof this century of the life sciences for all our citizens is as worthy \nas any in American history.\n  I urge my colleagues to make good on the promise of America, and see \nthat all our citizens receive the quality health care that should be \ntheir birthright. I urge the Senate to support Medicare for All.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/31/senate-section/article/S373-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 359--CONCERNING THE GOVERNMENT OF ROMANIA'S BAN ON \n    INTERCOUNTRY ADOPTIONS AND THE WELFARE OF ORPHANED OR ABANDONED \n                          CHILDREN IN ROMANIA\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                              S. Res. 359\n\n       Whereas following the execution of Romanian President \n     Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989, it was discovered that more than \n     100,000 underfed, neglected children throughout Romania were \n     living in hundreds of squalid and inhumane institutions;\n       Whereas citizens of the United States responded to the dire \n     situation of these children with an outpouring of compassion \n     and assistance to improve conditions in those institutions \n     and to provide for the needs of abandoned children in \n     Romania;\n       Whereas, between 1990 and 2004, citizens of the United \n     States adopted more than 8,200 Romanian children, with a \n     similar response from the citizens of Western Europe;\n       Whereas the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) \n     reported in March 2005 that more than 9,000 children a year \n     are abandoned in Romania's maternity wards or pediatric \n     hospitals and that child abandonment in Romania in ``2003 and \n     2004 was no different from that occurring 10, 20, or 30 years \n     ago'';\n       Whereas there are approximately 37,000 orphaned or \n     abandoned children in Romania today living in state \n     institutions, an additional 49,000 living in temporary \n     arrangements, such as foster care, and an unknown number of \n     children living on the streets and in maternity and pediatric \n     hospitals;\n       Whereas, on December 28, 1994, Romania ratified the Hague \n     Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in \n     Respect of Intercountry Adoption which recognizes that \n     ``intercountry adoption may offer the advantage of a \n     permanent family to a child for whom a suitable family cannot \n     be found in his or her State of origin'';\n       Whereas intercountry adoption offers the hope of a \n     permanent family for children who are orphaned or abandoned \n     by their biological parents;\n       Whereas UNICEF's official position on intercountry \n     adoption, in pertinent part, states: ``For children who \n     cannot be raised by their own families, an appropriate \n     alternative family environment should be sought in preference \n     to institutional care, which should be used only as a last \n     resort and as a temporary measure. Inter-country adoption is \n     one of a range of care options which may be open to children, \n     and for individual children who cannot be placed in a \n     permanent family setting in their countries of origin, it may \n     indeed be the best solution. In each case, the best interests \n     of the individual child must be the guiding principal in \n     making a decision regarding adoption.'';\n       Whereas unsubstantiated allegations have been made about \n     the fate of children adopted from Romania and the \n     qualifications and motives of those who adopt \n     internationally;\n       Whereas in June 2001, the Romanian Adoption Committee \n     imposed a moratorium on intercountry adoption, but continued \n     to accept new intercountry adoption applications and allowed \n     many such applications to be processed under an exception for \n     extraordinary circumstances;\n       Whereas on June 21, 2004, the Parliament of Romania enacted \n     Law 272/2004 on ``the protection and promotion of the rights \n     of the child'', which creates new requirements for declaring \n     a child legally available for adoption;\n       Whereas on June 21, 2004, the Parliament of Romania enacted \n     Law 273/2004 on adoption, which prohibits intercountry \n     adoption except by a child's biological grandparent or \n     grandparents;\n       Whereas there is no European Union law or regulation \n     restricting intercountry adoptions to biological grandparents \n     or requiring that restrictive laws be passed as a \n     prerequisite for accession to the European Union;\n       Whereas the number of Romanian children adopted \n     domestically is far less than the number abandoned and has \n     declined further since enactment of Law 272/2004 and 273/2004 \n     due to new, overly burdensome requirements for adoption;\n       Whereas prior to enactment of Law 273/2004, 211 \n     intercountry adoption cases were pending with the Government \n     of Romania in which children had been matched with adoptive \n     parents in the United States, and approximately 1,500 cases \n     were pending in which children had been matched with \n     prospective parents in Western Europe; and\n       Whereas the children of Romania, and all children, deserve \n     to be raised in permanent families: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the desire of the Government of Romania to \n     improve the standard of care and well-being of children in \n     Romania;\n       (2) urges the Government of Romania to complete the \n     processing of the intercountry adoption cases which were \n     pending when Law 273/2004 was enacted;\n       (3) urges the Government of Romania to amend its child \n     welfare and adoption laws to decrease barriers to adoption, \n     both domestic and intercountry, including by allowing \n     intercountry adoption by persons other than biological \n     grandparents;\n       (4) urges the Secretary of State and the Administrator of \n     the United States Agency for International Development to \n     work collaboratively with the Government of Romania to \n     achieve these ends; and\n       (5) requests that the European Union and its member states \n     not impede the Government of Romania's efforts to place \n     orphaned or abandoned children in permanent homes in a manner \n     that is consistent with Romania's obligations under the Hague \n     Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in \n     Respect of Intercountry Adoption.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/31/senate-section/article/S373-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 360--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF FEBRUARY 6 THROUGH \n       FEBRUARY 10, 2006, AS ``NATIONAL SCHOOL COUNSELING WEEK''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 360, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 360) designating the week of February \n     6 through February 10, 2006, as ``National School Counseling \n     Week.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to submit this \nresolution designating the week of February 2, 2006 as ``National \nSchool Counseling Week,'' on behalf of my colleagues, Senator Biden, \nSenator Dorgan, Senator Johnson, and Senator Dodd. This resolution \nhonors and celebrates the important work of school counselors, which \nthe Senate has recognized since 1965 through the inclusion of school \ncounseling in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  Across the country, there are approximately 95,000 school counselors, \nincluding 2,100 in Washington State. School counselors are critical \ncomponents of a successful school and contribute significantly to the \ngrowth and success of students. In fact, school counselors were \ninstrumental in helping students, teachers, and parents deal with the \ntrauma of terrorism on September 11, 2001, and its aftermath. However, \ndespite their important service, counselors are expected to serve, on \naverage, 485 students each, and are overwhelmed. The American School \nCounseling Association, the American Medical Association, and the \nAmerican Psychological Association recommend the ratio of students to \nschool counselors be 250 students to 1 school counselor.\n  I want to share just a few examples of how school counselors \nthroughout America are helping students.\n  In a middle school in southern California, school counselors realized \nthat 257 students were in danger of not passing on to the next grade. \nThey discovered that only 15 percent of the students understood the \npromotion and retention requirements. The school counselors presented a \nseries of individual and small-group lessons on promotion and retention \ncriteria. After the lessons, 100 percent of the students understood the \nrequirements. As a result, 72 of the 257 students, about 28 percent, \navoided retention that year.\n  In a high school in Racine, WI, a math teacher realized that 100 of \nhis students failed algebra in the first quarter of the year. He asked \na school counselor for help. Together, they discovered some of the \nreasons why students were failing. They initiated several programs, \nsuch as peer tutoring and homework assistance. As a result, 93 of the \n100 students passed algebra by the end of the year and were able to \nmove on to the next level of math.\n  A school district in Kentucky realized that the retention rate among \nninth grade students was unacceptably high. School counselors, teachers \nand administrators worked together to develop and implement strategies \ntargeted at helping ninth graders move to tenth grade. As a result, \nretention rates improved in 16 of the 17 high schools in the county in \njust 1 year. One school saw the retention rate improve more than 25 \npercent.\n  This resolution, though, is merely the beginning of what we need to \nbe doing to support school counselors. We need to reduce the ratio of \nstudents to counselors to, at the most, 250 to 1. We need to help \nschools maintain their funding so that school counselors are not cut \nfrom school budgets. And we need to support our school counselors so \nthat they can continue to be integral in the fabric of our schools and \nhelp our students achieve success in high school and beyond.\n  School counselors design and implement comprehensive developmental \nschool counseling programs that are integral to the success of every \nstudent. They help students improve academic achievement, develop \npersonally and socially and prepare for successful careers that will \nenable them to be contributing members of society. National School \nCounseling Week focuses public attention on the unique contribution of \nprofessional school counselors and highlights the tremendous impact \nthat school counselors have in helping students achieve success in \nschool and beyond.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be \nprinted in the Record, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 360) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 360\n\n       Whereas the American School Counselor Association has \n     declared the week of February 6 through February 10, 2006, as \n     ``National School Counseling Week'';\n       Whereas the Senate has recognized the importance of school \n     counseling through the inclusion of elementary and secondary \n     school counseling programs in the reauthorization of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965;\n       Whereas school counselors have long advocated that the \n     education system of the United States must leave no child \n     behind and must provide opportunities for every student;\n       Whereas personal and social growth results in increased \n     academic achievement;\n       Whereas school counselors help develop well-rounded \n     students by guiding them through their academic, personal, \n     social, and career development;\n       Whereas school counselors have been instrumental in helping \n     students, teachers, and parents deal with the trauma that was \n     inflicted upon them by hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma;\n       Whereas students face myriad challenges every day, \n     including peer pressure, depression, and school violence;\n       Whereas school counselors are usually the only \n     professionals in a school building who are trained in both \n     education and mental health matters;\n       Whereas the roles and responsibilities of school counselors \n     are often misunderstood, and the school counselor position is \n     often among the first to be eliminated in order to meet \n     budgetary constraints;\n       Whereas the national average ratio of students to school \n     counselors of 478-to-1 is more than double the 250-to-1 ratio \n     recommended by the American School Counselor Association, the \n     American Counseling Association, the American Medical \n     Association, the American Psychological Association, and \n     other organizations; and\n       Whereas the celebration of National School Counseling Week \n     would increase awareness of the important and necessary role \n     school counselors play in the lives of students in the United \n     States:\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of February 6 through February 10, \n     2006, as ``National School Counseling Week''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the week with appropriate ceremonies and activities that \n     promote awareness of the role school counselors perform in \n     the school and the community at large in preparing students \n     for fulfilling lives as contributing members of society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/31/senate-section/article/S375-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S375-S376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING PROFESSIONAL SURVEYORS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 362, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 362) honoring the life of Coretta \n     Scott King and expressing the condolences of the Senate on \n     her passing.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the passing of a great \nAmerican.\n  Coretta Scott King, a leader of the civil rights movement, died in \nher sleep yesterday evening.\n  In 15 years of marriage to Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and nearly \nfour decades of tireless advocacy after his assassination, Mrs. King \nproved herself a strong and tireless voice for the principle of human \nequality.\n  At her husband's side through good times and bad, she played a major \nrole in speaking out against the injustice and evils of State-mandated \ndiscrimination and private bigotry.\n  Her work with her husband played a key role in the passage of our \nmost vital civil rights laws: the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 \nVoting Rights Act.\n  Following her husband's death, she helped found the Martin Luther \nKing Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change and led the successful \ncampaign to establish her husband's birthday as a national holiday.\n  As a Southerner who hails from a state that once imposed the terrible \nevils of Jim Crow, I am deeply grateful for the work of the Civil \nRights Movement.\n  As majority leader of the Senate, I had the privilege and the \npleasure of being with Coretta Scott King on a number of occasions. As \nI was reflecting back over the course of the day, the one I remember \nmost was now 2 or maybe 3 years ago when I joined her for a church \nservice at Ebenezer Baptist Church Heritage in Atlanta where the family \nhas been historically attending services.\n  Without the achievements of the civil rights movement, Tennessee, and \nindeed the entire American South, would have remained mired in cultural \nand political and economic patterns of the distant past. It took \nleadership. It took boldness. It took vision.\n  As we move forward with our work today and in the whole of this \nCongress, let us remember that heroic, that bold, yet humble, work of \nCoretta Scott King. Let us prove ourselves worthy of the legacy of the \ncivil rights movement the King family have bequeathed to our Nation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we were all awakened this morning to the \nnews of the passing of one of our Nation's true heroes in the struggle \nfor civil rights, Coretta Scott King. Together, Americans all mourn her \npassing. We offer our deepest thanks for her dedication to keeping the \ndream of racial equality and national harmony alive even after losing \nher husband, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. I join all \nAmericans in extending our thoughts and prayers to her extended family.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today we mourn the passing of Coretta Scott \nKing.\n  When I think about Coretta Scott King, I think about a little girl \nwho walked 5 miles to school on those rural Alabama roads and felt the \nheat of racism each day she passed the door of the Whites-only school, \nso much closer to home.\n  It didn't matter, because she studied and succeeded and excelled \nbeyond most of her classmates, Black and White. She earned a college \ndegree, and an acceptance to a prestigious graduate school up North.\n  One day she met a young preacher from Atlanta, and she fell in love \nwith him. And he told her his dreams. And she believed in them. And she \ndecided that she would help to make them real--not just as a wife or as \na friend, but as a partner in freedom's cause.\n  Over the next years, Coretta Scott King did that in so many ways we \ncan't even imagine. She raised a family, she marched through the \nstreets, she inspired through song, she led through speech, and she \neven dodged countless attempts on her family's life.\n  And when one of those attempts finally took her love from this world, \nshe made the selfless decision to carry on. With no time to even cry or \nmourn, to wallow in anger or vengeance, Coretta Scott King took to the \nstreets just four days after Dr. King's assassination and led 50,000 \npeople through the streets of Memphis in a march for the kind of \njustice for which her husband had given his life.\n  She spent the rest of her time on this earth marching for that same \njustice--leading the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change in \nAtlanta, and spreading her family's message of hope to every corner of \nthis world.\n  I had the great honor of knowing Mrs. King, and the occasion to visit \nwith her in Atlanta last year. She was an extraordinarily gracious \nwoman. We sat and chatted in her living room. She showed me an album of \nphotographs of her, Dr. King and the children. Then she told me what \nher husband had said to her once, at a time when she was feeling \nburdened, understandably, by all the stress and strain that had been \nplaced on the family as a consequence of his role in the civil rights \nmovement. She said her husband advised:\n\n       When you are willing to make sacrifices for a great cause, \n     you will never be alone. Because you will have divine \n     companionship and the support of good people.\n\n  Coretta Scott King died in her sleep last night, but she certainly \nwas not alone. She was joined by the companionship and support of a \nloving family\n\n[[Page S377]]\n\nand a grateful Nation--inspired by her cause, dedicated to her work, \nand mournful of her passing.\n  My thoughts and condolences today are with her children. I ask that \nshe and her husband now rest together in eternal peace.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself, all \nGeorgians, and I am sure all Americans, to express my deepest sympathy \nand condolences to the family of Coretta Scott King, the wife of Dr. \nMartin Luther King. We learned this morning that she passed away \nyesterday at the age of 78. Coretta Scott King is known in history for \nbeing the wife of Dr. Martin Luther King, but she was far more than \nthat. As he wrote in his ``Letter from the Birmingham Jail'' to the \nconcerned clergy of Birmingham about his justification for coming to \nBirmingham on behalf of the citizens who had been discriminated \nagainst, Dr. King said:\n\n       I come because injustice anywhere is a threat to justice \n     everywhere.\n\n  As we all know from history, he took his mission wherever it took him \nto fight on behalf of justice for all Americans. He was able to do that \nin large measure with the support and the partnership of his great \npartner in life, Coretta Scott King. I had the privilege, as a \nGeorgian, of knowing her since my days in the legislature. I saw her as \nan equal with Dr. King in the movement. I saw her as a loving mother in \nthe raising of their four children. And I have seen her, since the loss \nof Dr. King, as an untiring advocate on behalf of ensuring that the \nlegacy of Dr. King and his movement is perpetuated in American history.\n  A few months ago, the United States of America and this Senate \nhonored the life of Rosa Parks as a significant leader, the matriarch \nof the civil rights movement. There is no question today, as we pause \nin sympathy for the loss of Dr. King's wife, Coretta Scott King, that \nshe joins Rosa Parks as a great woman in American history and as a \ntireless advocate for equality for all Americans.\n  On behalf of my State, myself, and all those who love peace and \njustice, I express our sympathy on the loss of Coretta Scott King.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to remember an \nextraordinary and courageous woman, Coretta Scott King.\n  Coretta Scott King was one of the most influential women leaders in \nour world. She entered the public stage in 1955 as wife of the Rev. Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr. and as a leading participant in the American \ncivil rights movement.\n  Born and raised in Marion, AL, Coretta Scott graduated valedictorian \nfrom Lincoln High School. She received a B.A. in music and education \nfrom Antioch College in Yellow Springs, OH, and then went on to study \nconcert singing at Boston's New England Conservatory of Music, where \nshe earned a degree in voice and violin. While in Boston she met Martin \nLuther King, Jr. who was then studying for his doctorate in systematic \ntheology at Boston University. They were married on June 18, 1953, and \nin September 1954 took up residence in Montgomery, AL, with Coretta \nScott King assuming the many functions of pastor's wife at Dexter \nAvenue Baptist Church.\n  During Dr. King's career, Mrs. King devoted most of her time to \nraising their four children. However, she balanced mothering and work, \nspeaking before church, civic, college, fraternal and peace groups. She \nconceived and performed a series of favorably-reviewed Freedom Concerts \nwhich combined prose and poetry narration with musical selections and \nfunctioned as fundraisers for the Southern Christian Leadership \nConference, the direct action organization of which Dr. King served as \nfirst president.\n  After Dr. King's assassination in 1968, Mrs. King devoted much of her \nenergy and attention to developing programs and building the Atlanta-\nbased Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change as a \nliving memorial to her husband's life and dream. For 27 years, Mrs. \nKing devoted her life to developing the King Center. As founding \nPresident, Chair, and Chief Executive Officer, she dedicated herself to \nproviding local, national and international programs that have trained \ntens of thousands of people in Dr. King's philosophy and methods; she \nguided the creation and housing of the largest archives of documents \nfrom the civil rights movement; and, perhaps her greatest legacy after \nestablishing the King Center itself, Mrs. King spearheaded the massive \neducational and lobbying campaign to establish Dr. King's birthday as a \nnational holiday. In 1983, an act of Congress instituted the Martin \nLuther King, Jr. Federal Holiday Commission, which she chaired for its \nduration. And in January 1986, Mrs. King oversaw the first legal \nholiday in honor of her husband--a holiday which has come to be \ncelebrated by millions of people world-wide and, in some form, in over \n100 countries.\n  Coretta Scott King carried the message of nonviolence around the \nworld. She led goodwill missions to many countries in Africa, Latin \nAmerica, Europe and Asia. She spoke at many of history's most massive \npeace and justice rallies. She was the first woman to deliver the class \nday address at Harvard, and the first woman to preach at a statutory \nservice at St. Paul's Cathedral in London.\n  In 1974 Mrs. King formed a broad association of over 100 religious, \nlabor, business, civil and women's rights organizations dedicated to a \nnational policy of full employment and equal economic opportunity, as \nco-chair of the Full Employment Action Council. In 1983, she brought \ntogether more than 800 human rights organizations to form the Coalition \nof Conscience, sponsors of the 20th anniversary march on Washington, \nuntil then the largest demonstration in our Nation's capital. In 1988, \nshe reconvened the Coalition of Conscience for the 25th anniversary of \nthe March on Washington. In preparation for the Reagan-Gorbachev talks, \nin 1988 she served as head of the U.S. delegation of Women for a \nMeaningful Summit in Athens, Greece; and in 1990, as the USSR was \nredefining itself, Mrs. King was coconvener of the Soviet-American \nWomen's Summit in Washington, DC.\n  Mrs. King received honorary doctorates from over 60 colleges and \nuniversities; authored three books and a nationally-syndicated column; \nand served on, and helped found, dozens of organizations, including the \nBlack Leadership Forum, the National Black Coalition for Voter \nParticipation, and the Black Leadership Roundtable.\n  On a very personal note, I had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. King on a \nnumber of occasions, both within my great State of Georgia as well as \noutside of our State. Most notably, I have been to a number of the \nMartin Luther King, Jr., Day celebrations at Ebenezer Baptist Church \nand was there last year, which happened to be the last time that Ms. \nKing was there. She was unable to be there this year.\n  She was a remarkable lady in that, in spite of her high profile \nrelative to the civil rights movement, as well as since Dr. King's \ndeath, she remained a very humble, a very personable, a very congenial \nlady who had a great sense of humor. Certainly during the time of the \ncivil rights movement, this lady was undoubtedly one of the most \nadmired women in the world because of what she saw her husband going \nthrough.\n  She was loyal and steadfast in the support of her husband. She \nobviously loved her husband. She loved her family until her death last \nnight. Her legacy will live on for generations, generations and \ngenerations to come.\n  Coretta Scott King worked tirelessly to make a better world. History \nwill judge that she did. We mourn her passing.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in 1968, I was a law student at Georgetown \nUniversity here in Washington, DC. It was a tumultuous year, and I \nrecall sitting in the library working for my class assignments when a \nlaw professor walked in and said: I would like all of you students who \nare second- and third-year law students to come outside. We walked \noutside, and he said: We need to ask for your help. The District of \nColumbia is in an uproar. With the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, there are riots all over our Nation's Capital and many cities \nacross the country, and our legal system has broken down. They have \narrested people for a variety of charges and have filled up the DC \njails. They have no room for them and no attorneys to represent them. \nWe would like to ask you as a law student to walk across the street to \nthe DC courts and provide some legal advice to the people who are being \narrested.\n\n[[Page S378]]\n\n  I couldn't believe that as a law student they would ask me to serve \nas a lawyer, but it was an emergency situation.\n  As I went over there and saw the DC courts in turmoil over the uproar \nand the riots, if you will, in the streets of the District of Columbia, \nI reflected on that terrible year and all that we had been through. Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Robert Kennedy--it was a year no one will ever \nforget.\n  I did my part and recall shortly afterwards watching as the \ntelevision was filled with the funeral of Dr. Martin Luther King. I can \nrecall his casket being drawn by a team of mules to his final resting \nplace. I can recall his brave wife walking in the front of the line \nbehind him.\n  Many of us still recall when Jackie Kennedy faced that same awful \nburden with the assassination of her husband, John Kennedy, the \nexceptional courage she showed under what must have been the most \nstressful and terrible moment of her life.\n  Coretta Scott King showed that same courage that day, leading the \nfollowers of Dr. Martin Luther King to his final resting place. She \ncould have easily retired from public life at that moment and become \nhonored in her own right for having given so much to this country, but \nshe did not. She decided to carry on his legacy, and she led a public \nlife from that point forward in his memory.\n  The strength we saw on the day of his burial was the strength that \ncontinued until her last moment of life a few hours ago. We were all \nsaddened this morning to wake up to the news of the death of Coretta \nScott King, a champion of justice and human rights. We honor her memory \nand send our deep condolences to her family.\n  A few days ago, Martin Luther King, her son, spoke at Mayor Daley's \nMartin Luther King breakfast in Chicago, IL. He did an exceptional job. \nHe spoke to us about the challenges his mother faced even in her \nillness and told us about the continued commitment of his family to \ncivil rights.\n  Because of her deep humility, there is a tendency to think of Coretta \nScott King as her husband's supporter. In fact, as Dr. King himself \nmade clear, she was his indispensable partner. Listen to what Dr. King \ntold an interviewer in 1967. Speaking of Mrs. King, he said:\n\n       I never will forget [that] the first discussion we had when \n     we met was the whole question of racial injustice and \n     economic injustice and the question of peace. In her college \n     days, she had been actively engaged in movements dealing with \n     these problems.\n\n  And then he added:\n\n       I must admit, I wish I could say, to satisfy my masculine \n     ego, that I led her down this path; but I must say we went \n     down together, because she was as actively involved and \n     concerned when we met as she is now.\n\n  For more than 50 years, Mrs. King called America toward greater \njustice and equality. She spoke with dignity and a quiet authority that \nchallenged us to fulfill our American obligation to create a more \nperfect union by embracing equal rights and genuine economic and social \njustice for all Americans, regardless of race, religion, gender, \nnational background, or sexual orientation.\n  Coretta Scott King was the driving force behind the establishment of \nthe Martin Luther King, Jr., national holiday, for which I was proud to \nvote, and of the construction of the King Center in Atlanta which I \nvisited with Congressman John Lewis. Yet she reminded us that the best \nway to honor her husband's legacy was to devote our lives to his work.\n  It is perhaps no accident that as Coretta Scott King laid her head \ndown for the last time, it was the very day that a decision was made to \nlocate the new Museum of African-American History and Culture near the \nLincoln Memorial where her husband delivered his immortal ``I Have a \nDream'' speech. It was a dream they shared and to which they both \ndedicated their lives.\n  Now Coretta Scott King and Martin Luther King, Jr., rest together in \neternal peace, and it is up to us to keep that dream alive.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Coretta Scott King was a driving force, \nnot just for the civil rights movement, but for the great march toward \nprogress.\n  Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King awakened the conscience of \na nation that began the journey toward equality, knocking down the \nwalls of discrimination based on race, on religion, and on ethnicity. \nWe have all benefited so much from their inspiration and their \nleadership.\n  Coretta was not only a powerful and charismatic figure and leader for \nour time, but she was a mother who helped her children grow up to be \nindividuals with a sense of dignity, a sense of pride in their heritage \nand a strong commitment to do something for someone else. I admire her \nfor that as well, and my thoughts and prayers are with her children \ntoday.\n  The signs of bigotry and discrimination are still evident today. \nThey're much more sophisticated and much more subtle than when Dr. King \nwas facing the police dogs and the beatings that took place in Selma, \nMontgomery, and in towns and cities across America. There's no question \nthat we're a fairer and a better nation because of Dr. King, and I \nbelieve what Coretta Scott King would want us to do is continue this \nmarch toward progress when it comes to disability rights, women's \nrights, civil rights--and not retreat from it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the able Senator from \nMassachusetts. I was privileged to have worked with Mrs. King on the \nMartin Luther King, Jr. holiday bill for which she pushed so hard and \nwhich eventually was passed by the Congress. I agree with the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, she was a champion of decency and human rights and \na more just and humane society in her own right, not only as a partner \nof her husband. We mourn her death and recognize the extraordinary \ncontributions she has made to our Nation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today, I rise to pay tribute to the \nlife of a great American, Coretta Scott King, who passed away last \nnight at the age of 78.\n  Mrs. King, Alabama born, was educated in Ohio and Boston. It was \nwhile attending the New England Conservatory of Music that she met a \nyoung man from Atlanta, Martin Luther King, Jr. She knew from their \nfirst date that Martin Luther King, Jr., was brilliant and exceptional, \na born leader.\n  When they were married at her home in Alabama in 1953, Reverend \nKing's father, who was a pastor, performed the ceremony. But at \nCoretta's request, he omitted the bride's vow to obey her husband. That \nwas pretty bold at that time. It was highly unusual, but it provided a \nglimpse of the strength and independence Coretta Scott King would \ndemonstrate throughout her life.\n  Coretta Scott King joined her husband in the fight for equality and \njustice. She believed that was our Nation's promise to every citizen, \nbut it had too long been denied to African Americans. She was Dr. \nKing's constant partner in the struggle for civil rights. She marched \nalongside him and used her talent as a singer to raise money for their \ncause while raising their children and keeping their family together in \nthe face of constant threats and a bombing by the Ku Klux Klan.\n  After Dr. King's assassination 38 years ago, Coretta Scott King might \nhave quietly slipped out of public life, but she chose to continue his \nwork. She created the Martin Luther King, Jr., Center for Nonviolent \nSocial Change in Atlanta in search of civil rights and equality for \neveryone in America. Coretta Scott King never lost faith in her \nhusband's dream of peace and mutual respect. I had the honor of being \nable to identify a courthouse in the city of Newark that was being \nbuilt as the Martin Luther King, Jr., Courthouse. I called Coretta \nScott King to be certain that this was an acceptable item in the memory \nof Dr. Martin Luther King. We were pleased to do it, and that \ncourthouse stands today as a reminder to everybody who passes in that \narea, everybody who lives in that region, that Martin Luther King was \nthe great leader that he was, and his wife followed closely in his \nfootsteps. She never wavered from Dr. King's commitment to achieve \nchange through nonviolent means.\n  Dr. King lived long enough to see the passage of landmark legislation \nthat removed legal barriers to equality. His wife lived to see more \nAfrican Americans and Latino Americans elected as public officials and \nserving as Secretary of State for the United States,\n\n[[Page S379]]\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of the military, and CEOs of companies \nsuch as American Express, Kmart, and Time-Warner.\n  Although some of the legal barriers to equality have fallen, economic \nbarriers remain. At the time of his assassination, Dr. King was \nbeginning to focus on economic justice. Today, 38 years later, we still \nhave not achieved his dream of economic justice. That promise rings \nhollow today for millions of hard-working Americans. It rings hollow \nfor the people who clean the rooms in the big hotels but cannot afford \na decent place to live. It rings hollow for garment workers, those who \nwork in the factories over sewing machines and needles and the pressing \nmachines, whose children wear hand-me-down clothes. They work making \nbeautiful clothing, but they cannot afford to clothe their own children \nin many cases. And farm workers who grow and harvest the crops, they \noften cannot afford healthy food for their families.\n  Last year, Hurricane Katrina revealed to the whole world the stark \npoverty that still afflicts our Nation. The greatest majority of the \npoor people we saw stranded in New Orleans were African Americans. In \nthe past 5 years, the poverty level among African Americans has \nincreased. More than one-third of all Black children in this country \nlive in poverty. That suggests something in the long-term that is not \ngood for them, nor for country.\n  I had the privilege yesterday of going to a school in Patterson, NJ, \nthat I attended many years ago. Patterson, NJ, is a minority city of \nAfrican Americans and new immigrants. I looked at the faces of those \nchildren. We had a demonstration by the band. My wife and I were there. \nIn the faces of those kids you could see hope, and you could see a \ndesire to have a chance at life. It is a terrible condition that \nprohibits, many times, their opportunity to get an education, to have \nthe kind of nutrition they need to grow healthy bodies and strong \nminds. The overall poverty rate among African Americans is almost three \ntimes as high as non-Hispanic Whites. That is not economic justice, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The great promise of America has always been that if you work hard, \nyou can build a better life for your family. Poverty is a national \ndisgrace in this wealthy country we inhabit. Dr. King and Coretta Scott \nKing knew that. They believed America could do better. They loved this \ncountry for its promise of liberty and justice for all, and in holding \nus to that promise, they appealed to the best nature of the American \nspirit.\n  Mr. President, I find it fitting that on the very day Coretta Scott \nKing passed away, the Smithsonian Institute announced its intention to \nbuild a museum of Black history on the National Mall. That is where it \nbelongs; it belongs in the founding elements of our country, to \ndemonstrate the contribution that has been made by African Americans in \nour society. That museum will be just a few blocks from the Lincoln \nMemorial, where her husband delivered his famous ``I have a dream'' \nspeech during the 1964 march on Washington. It is an appropriate \nplace--a place where President Abraham Lincoln is remembered for his \nfight against slavery and the abuse of the people who were kept in this \ncondition.\n  For almost four decades, Coretta Scott King has helped keep that \ndream alive. Now we must all do the same.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to share my thoughts on \nthe passing of Coretta Scott King. I once had the privilege of hosting \nMrs. King at my home. She was an extraordinary woman who was deeply \ninvolved in a movement that led our nation closer to a more equal and \njust society.\n  Although Mrs. King is often referred to as the wife of the late \nReverend Dr. Martin Luther King, she was a civil rights activist in her \nown right. Following Dr. King's death in 1968, she devoted her energies \nto the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change. Her \nleadership helped spread Dr. King's message of positive social change \nthrough nonviolent means. She often said, ``The center enables us to go \nout and struggle against the evils in our society.''\n  Mrs. King, like her husband, was a uniter. She brought together \ndiverse groups for common causes. In 1974, Mrs. King formed the Full \nEmployment Action Council, consisting of civil rights, religious, \nlabor, and business groups promoting equal economic opportunity and \nfull employment for all Americans. Nine years later, she helped form \nthe Coalition of Conscience, consisting of over 800 human rights \ngroups, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the March on Washington. \nGlobally, she was a goodwill ambassador to countries around the world \nand an adviser to world leaders such as Nelson Mandela. Later this \nyear, Mrs. King and her late husband were to receive the Congressional \nGold Medal for their contributions to the Nation.\n  Mrs. King has left us, but her legacy lives on as we remember and \nhonor her historical impact. We should strive to follow in her \nfootsteps. Today, my thoughts and prayer are with Mrs. King and her \nfamily and friends.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I was saddened today to learn of the \ndeath of Coretta Scott King. Her work and life gave one man great \nstrength and inspired a nation. In a lifetime, suffering and pain can \nenvelop communities and span generations; it can also touch us \nintimately and immediately. When her husband was assassinated in April \nof 1968, Mrs. King suffered a world of loss in one moment. She \npersevered with passion and devotion, honoring the movement her husband \nmade so strong. She taught the world that carrying on a great legacy \nrequires more than simply remembering the words of the dead, but \nrequires imbuing those words with action, life, leadership, and vision. \nMrs. King has left our Nation a vital legacy of her own.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to a fallen \npillar of the movement to extend civil and social rights to millions of \nAfrican Americans: Coretta Scott King.\n  Mrs. King was loved and respected the world over as one of the \npioneers of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. She was \nthe friend, partner and wife of the leader of the civil rights \nmovement, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n  Born in Marion, AL, on April 27, 1927, Coretta Scott graduated as \nvaledictorian of her high school class and attended Antioch College in \nYellow Springs, OH. She received a B.A. in music and education and then \nstudied concert singing at the New England Conservatory of Music in \nBoston, MA.\n  As the young Martin Luther King, Jr., began his civil rights work in \nMontgomery, AL, Mrs. King worked closely with him, organizing marches \nand sit-ins at segregated restaurants while at the same time raising \ntheir four children: Yolanda Denise, Martin Luther III, Dexter Scott, \nand Bernice Albertine.\n  During the height of the civil rights movement, Mrs. King and her \nhusband endured threats and attempts on their lives. In spite of the \nviolence that surrounded them and that would one day take Dr. King's \nlife, they never abandoned a fundamental belief in nonviolence. They \nwere committed to peace.\n  After her husband's death, Mrs. King took a more visible role in the \nmovement. She worked to keep his ideology of equality for all people at \nthe forefront of the Nation's agenda. She pushed for more than a decade \nto have her husband's birthday observed as a national holiday, then \nwatched with pride in 1983 as President Reagan signed the bill into \nlaw.\n  King became a symbol, in her own right, of her husband's struggle for \npeace and brotherhood, presiding with a quiet, steady, stoic presence \nover seminars and conferences on global issues. Throughout her years of \nservice, however, she never lost sight of the fact that her children \nwere her greatest responsibility.\n  Mrs. King was also a role model for many young women. She showed them \nthat their own voices had value and that their thoughts and actions \nmattered.\n  Our loss of Mrs. King leaves a void that won't soon be filled. We \nhave lost a great leader, a great role model, a great woman, and a \ngreat American, but it is also important for us to remember that her \nchildren have lost their mother. May the Lord grant them peace in this \ntime of mourning. Our thoughts and prayers go out to her family and \nfriends.\n  Mr. President, today is a sad day for the Nation. We have lost one of \nour\n\n[[Page S380]]\n\nleading voices for equality and justice. In closing, I am sure that the \nentire Senate will join with me in honoring the life of Mrs. Coretta \nScott King.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to the life of \nMrs. Coretta Scott King. She was a steady force in the civil rights \nmovement who ably supported the work of her late husband, the Reverend \nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. Her legacy, like that of Dr. King, is \nsteeped in the American principles we all hold dear: those of equality \nand justice, patriotism, faith, and family values.\n  As a young woman, Coretta Scott, a native of Marion, AL, experienced \nthe racism and prejudice that characterized the South at that time. She \nhad a desire to exceed expectations in the most challenging of \nenvironments. Coretta was valedictorian of Lincoln High School in 1945 \nand pursued the serious study of music at Antioch College in Ohio, and \nthen at the New England Conservatory of Music. It was in Boston that \nCoretta first met the young Martin King, a divinity student earning his \ndoctorate in theology.\n  Both of them knew the value of education and study, but both were \nalso determined to serve others. Coretta had been involved in the civil \nrights movement before she met Dr. King; but when they joined forces as \nhusband and wife in 1953, the movement was strengthened. Each place \nthey lived in was roiled by the controversies of the movement to end \nracial segregation. In every place, bigots threatened the King family's \nsafety. Amidst the violence, the arrests of peaceful protesters, the \nbombings, and assassination attempts against her husband, Mrs. King \nremained a bedrock for her husband and the protector of her children. \nYolanda, Martin III, Dexter, and Bernice found remarkable role models \nin both of their parents, but it was Mrs. King's steady hand that \ndirected their upbringing.\n  As the world took notice of Dr. King's philosophy of nonviolent \nsocial change, Mrs. King spread it effectively, especially among women. \nShe lent her time and talents to numerous educational causes and civil \nrights groups. She exhibited poise, dignity, and grace in everything \nshe did.\n  Mrs. King's commitment to civil rights did not diminish in 1968 when \nher husband's life was ended by an assassin's bullet. She instead made \na commitment to the nonviolent achievement of social justice as her \nlife's work. The Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social \nChange in Atlanta, GA, stands today as a testament to Dr. King's work \nand to that of his wife, for it was she who made the institution what \nit is. Mrs. King's strong will and courageous strength allowed her to \nstay the course and further the movement.\n  She was also a strong force behind the national holiday to \ncommemorate Dr. King's life.\n  Coretta Scott King and the late Rosa Parks were often regarded as \n``Mothers of the Civil Rights Movement.'' We are sad to have lost both \nof them in so short a time. But as we enter Black History Month in \nFebruary and then Women's History Month in March, the message and \nexample of these American heroines will be before us. They demonstrate \nthat ordinary people can achieve extraordinary things. Their \nselflessness will not be forgotten.\n  May Mrs. Coretta Scott King find the peace for which she and Martin \nstrived so hard to achieve. God speed...\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nfirst lady of the civil rights movement--Coretta Scott King. Mrs. King, \nthe widow of the late Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., dedicated her \nlife to sharing Dr. King's quest for social justice and peace.\n  Although one cannot say enough about her lifelong commitment to the \ncause of racial and economic equality, it is important to also note \nthat Coretta Scott King was a visionary for women's rights on her own \nmerit. She was the first woman to deliver the Class Day address at \nHarvard, and the first woman to preach at a statutory service at St. \nPaul's Cathedral in London. And Mrs. King served as a liaison to \ninternational peace and justice organizations even before Dr. King took \na public stand in 1967 against United States intervention in the \nVietnam war.\n  As we mourn the passing of Coretta Scott King, we are once again \nreminded of her quiet and resolute compassion for others. As she once \nremarked, and continued to demonstrate throughout her long life, Dr. \nKing's dream was equally hers as well. ``I didn't learn my commitment \nfrom Martin. We just converged at a certain time.''\n  Together, their fearless commitment to the civil rights movement \nshaped and inspired the revolutionary social changes in the United \nStates over the last half-century.\n  Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Coretta Scott King were first \nvaulted to the national stage during the Montgomery bus boycott. Led by \nDr. King, the 1955 boycott lasted nearly 13 months and truly ignited \nthe Nation's civil rights movement.\n  The boycott led to the Supreme Court questioning the legality of the \nJim Crow law that mandated the discrimination of African-Americans on \nthe public bus system. And on November 13, 1956, in the landmark case \nBrowder v. Gayle, the Supreme Court banned segregation on buses. It was \ntruly a remarkable victory for the cause of freedom and equality.\n  Throughout the turbulent decades of the 1950's and 60's, Dr. King's \nvision helped the Nation form a new and better understanding of itself, \none that celebrates its diverse nature and strengthens its commitment \nto the principles of equality and justice.\n  Yet one cannot simply overlook the passion and commitment of Mrs. \nKing as her own individual. Throughout her long life, Mrs. King served \nas an inspirational presence around the world for the values of \nequality and peace.\n  Coretta Scott was born April 27, 1927, the middle of three children \nborn to Obadiah and Bernice Scott. She grew up in the two-room house \nher father built on land that had been owned by the family for three \ngenerations. Her exposure to the injustices of segregation were formed \nearly on, as she walked to her one-room school house each day, watching \nbuses full of white children kick up dust as they passed.\n  During high school, Mrs. King excelled academically and demonstrated \na great talent for music. She attended Antioch College in Yellow \nSprings, OH, where 2 years earlier her older sister, Edythe, had become \nthe first black to enroll. At Antioch, she studied education and music.\n  In 1953, the young Coretta Scott was preparing for a career in music \nat the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, when she met a \nyoung graduate student in philosophy. A year later she and Dr. King, \nthen a young minister from a prominent Atlanta family, were married.\n  During Dr. King's career, Mrs. King mostly shied away from the \nprominent spotlight of her husband, balancing motherhood and movement \nwork. She devoted most of her time to raising their four children: \nYolanda Denise, born in 1955, Martin Luther III, born in 1957, Dexter \nScott, born in 1961, and Bernice Albertine, born in 1963. But she also \ngained recognition for the ``Freedom Concerts'' she organized, where \nshe lectured, read poetry and sang to raise awareness of and money for \nthe burgeoning civil rights movement.\n  Upon the tragic assassination of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., on \nApril 4, 1968, Mrs. King bravely took up the mantle of the civil \nrights cause. Even before her husband was buried, she marched at the \nhead of the garbage workers he had gone to Memphis to champion.\n\n  Over the next few decades, Coretta Scott King gained nationwide \ninterest and admiration for her efforts to establish a national holiday \nin honor of her husband. By an act of Congress, the first national \nobservance of the holiday took place in 1986. Dr. King's birthday is \nnow marked by annual celebrations in over 100 countries.\n  During the 1970s, Mrs. King continued to work on behalf of the cause \nof economic justice. In 1974 she formed the Full Employment Action \nCouncil, a broad coalition of over 100 religious, labor, business, \ncivil and women's rights organizations dedicated to a national policy \nof full employment and equal economic opportunity.\n  She also helped to found the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Non-\nViolent Social Change in Atlanta, dedicated both to scholarship and to \nactivism.\n  Over time, Mrs. King also developed her own causes and rhetoric, \nwhich were consistent with the vision of her\n\n[[Page S381]]\n\nhusband. For example, when she stood in for her husband at the Poor \nPeople's Campaign at the Lincoln Memorial on June 19, 1968, she spoke \nnot just of his vision for social justice, but also of gender and \nracial equality. She called upon American women ``to unite and form a \nsolid block of women power to fight the three great evils of racism, \npoverty and war.''\n  Mrs. King also dedicated herself to the cause of peace, traveling \nthroughout the world on goodwill missions to Africa, Latin America, \nEurope and Asia. In 1983, she marked the 20th anniversary of the \nhistoric March on Washington by leading a gathering of more than 800 \nhuman rights organizations, the Coalition of Conscience, in the largest \ndemonstration the Capital City had seen up to that time. And in 1993, \nMrs. King was invited by President Clinton to witness the historic \nhandshake between Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Chairman Yassir \nArafat at the signing of the Middle East peace accords.\n  Mrs. King also envisioned plans for a memorial dedicated to her \nhusband. Recently, I cosponsored a bill that approved funding for such \na memorial. This memorial will be the first on the National Mall in \nhonor of a person of color. It is my hope that this memorial will \ncontinue to remind the Nation, and the world, of the powerful words of \nhope Dr. King expressed here in Washington, DC, more than 40 years ago.\n  Throughout her life, Mrs. King was seen as an inspirational figure \naround the world, someone who truly personified the ideals to which she \nand Dr. King pledged their lives.\n  But although our country has come a long way since the days when our \ncountry first met the legendary Coretta Scott King and Rev. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., we still have much to accomplish. We must steadfastly \nprotect the advances already made in the fight for social equality, and \nalso further those advances in the years ahead.\n  We owe the legacy of Coretta Scott King, and that of her remarkable \nhusband, the late Martin Luther King, Jr., no less.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 362) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 362\n\n       Whereas Coretta Scott King was an inspirational figure and \n     a woman of great strength, grace, and dignity who came to \n     personify the ideals for which her husband fought;\n       Whereas Coretta Scott was born and raised in rural Alabama, \n     graduated as the valedictorian from Lincoln High School, and \n     received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Antioch College in \n     Yellow Springs, Ohio;\n       Whereas Coretta Scott fought to be allowed to teach in the \n     local public schools in Ohio but was denied because of her \n     race;\n       Whereas Coretta Scott studied music at the New England \n     Conservatory of Music in Boston and, while attending school \n     in the City, met a graduate student who was studying for his \n     doctorate degree at Boston University;\n       Whereas that graduate student, Martin Luther King, Jr., \n     told her on their first date, ``The four things that I look \n     for in a wife are character, personality, intelligence, and \n     beauty. And you have them all.'';\n       Whereas Coretta Scott and Martin Luther King, Jr. were \n     married on June 18, 1953, and moved to Montgomery, Alabama;\n       Whereas Mrs. King gave birth to her first child, Yolanda, 2 \n     weeks before the start of the Montgomery bus boycott, and \n     protected her when opponents of the boycott bombed the King \n     household;\n       Whereas Dr. and Mrs. King were to have 3 more children \n     named Martin Luther, III, Dexter, and Bernice;\n       Whereas during the lifetime of Dr. King, Mrs. King balanced \n     the demands of raising their 4 children, serving as the wife \n     of a pastor, and speaking before church, civic, college, \n     fraternal, and peace groups;\n       Whereas Mrs. King participated in more than 30 ``Freedom \n     Concerts'', where she lectured, read poetry, and sang to \n     raise awareness of and money for the civil rights movement;\n       Whereas Mrs. King stood by the side of her husband during \n     many civil rights marches and other notable occasions, \n     including a 1957 trip to Ghana to mark the independence of \n     that country, a 1959 trip to India to visit sites associated \n     with Mahatma Gandhi, and a 1964 trip to Oslo, Norway, to \n     accept a Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Dr. King;\n       Whereas just 4 days after the assassination of her husband \n     in 1968, Mrs. King led a march of 50,000 people through the \n     streets of Memphis and, later that year, took his place in \n     the Poor People's March to Washington;\n       Whereas Mrs. King devoted her energy to carrying on the \n     message of nonviolence and the work of her husband to create \n     a United States in which all people have equal rights;\n       Whereas Mrs. King dedicated herself to raising funds and \n     developing programs for the Atlanta-based Martin Luther King, \n     Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, where she served as \n     founding President, Chair, and Chief Executive Officer;\n       Whereas Mrs. King was instrumental in seeing that the \n     birthday of her husband was honored as a Federal holiday, an \n     occasion first marked in 1986;\n       Whereas Mrs. King received honorary doctorates from over 60 \n     colleges and universities, and authored 3 books;\n       Whereas Mrs. King received the congressional gold medal for \n     her invaluable contributions to the United States as a leader \n     of the civil rights movement;\n       Whereas Mrs. King traveled to every corner of the United \n     States and the globe to speak out on behalf of a number of \n     important issues, including racial and economic justice, the \n     rights of women and children, religious freedom, full \n     employment, health care, and education; and\n       Whereas Coretta Scott King was a civil rights icon and one \n     of the most influential African Americans in history: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) mourns the loss of Coretta Scott King;\n       (2) admire her lifelong commitment to social justice and \n     peace;\n       (3) recognizes her role as a leading participant in the \n     American Civil Rights Movement and her support to democracy \n     movements world-wide;\n       (4) expresses it sympathies to the family of Coretta Scott \n     King and;\n       (5) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to the family of Coretta \n     Scott King.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/31/senate-section/article/S381-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
