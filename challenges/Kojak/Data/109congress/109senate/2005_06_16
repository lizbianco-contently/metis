Mr. President, first, I rise to express my appreciation to \nSenator Cantwell for the issue she has brought before the Senate. I am \nso convinced that the 40 percent can be met in 20 years. When President \nKennedy said, We need to go to the Moon, he did not set a formula how \nwe would get to the Moon, but we got to the Moon. When we were in the \ndepths of our Depression in 1932, President Roosevelt said, We need to \nget out of this. We went a number of steps forward, some steps back, \nbut we were able to work our way out of the Great Depression.\n  Senator Cantwell's amendment is visionary. I really do believe that \nwe can do this. I know there are people concerned, well, does this mean \nCAFE standards? Does this mean we are going to go totally to biomass? \nAre we\n\n[[Page S6670]]\n\ngoing to do it all with alternative energy? I do not know, but the \ngreat genius of America can figure out a way to do this.\n  We need to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. There is no question \nabout that. Fifty-eight percent of the oil we use comes from foreign \ncountries. Listening to the news this morning, the stock market just \nmoved a little bit yesterday. Why did it not move more? Because the \nprice of oil went up almost a dollar a barrel. We have to do better \nthan that. The only way we can do it is to lessen our dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  Unless we have a directive of this President and Presidents that \nfollow him to meet this goal, we will continue to be dependent on \nforeign oil.\n  So I am totally impressed with the Senator from Washington and the \ngreat work she has done on this amendment. I hope it passes by a large \nmargin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6670-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FUNERAL OF FORMER SENATOR EXON\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the time I have is leader time, and I wanted \nto say a few things. I was not here yesterday afternoon because of the \nfuneral of Senator Exon. I say to my colleagues, those of us who went \nto that funeral were so impressed with what this man did for the State \nof Nebraska. For the first time in the history of Nebraska, a funeral \nwas held in the State capitol. Why? Because Jim Exon made a difference \nin the State of Nebraska. I am sure all 100 Senators, as I have, ask \nare we making a difference in what happens in our States, in our \ncountry. The lesson we can look to is Jim Exon, a man with not a great \neducation by modern-day standards but a person who by modern-day \nstandards, or any standard, had a great heart and a great mind and was \nable to do wonderful work for the State and for the country.\n  His family expressed so many warm feelings about their father and \ngrandfather. Bob Kerrey gave one of the most moving eulogies that has \never been given. I am sorry I was not here yesterday, but for those of \nus who went to that funeral--Senator Ben Nelson, Senator Hagel, Senator \nBingaman, Senator Levin, Senator Akaka--it was so worth our time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6670-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6670-S6671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JOHN BOLTON NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to respond to a statement that was \nmade yesterday. I want to provide an update on the status of the Bolton \nnomination. As I said yesterday, and I say now, we on this side of the \naisle have been clear and consistent on our position on this matter. If \nthe administration works in good faith to give the Senate the \ninformation it requires, Senate Democrats are ready immediately to give \nthis nomination a vote.\n  We are not going on a fishing expedition in this instance. Democrats \nare seeking clearly defined and specific information about two very \nimportant issues that bear directly on John Bolton's fitness to \nrepresent this great country in the United Nations. I know what a \nfishing expedition is. A fishing expedition is, for example, in the law \nwhen one does a deposition or sends interrogatories and they have no \nidea what the answers are going to be, they have no idea what \ninformation they are really seeking to obtain, they hope something will \nturn up. That is not the case here because we have given two important \nareas where we want information: Did Mr. Bolton attempt to exaggerate \nwhat Congress and the American people would be told about Syria's \nalleged weapons of mass destruction capabilities? Secondly, did Mr. \nBolton use or maybe perhaps misuse highly classified intelligence \nintercepts to spy on bureaucratic rivals who disagreed with his views \nor for other inappropriate purposes?\n  At the time I made those remarks, sadly, the administration and \nSenate Republicans had taken the position for the past month or more \nthat nothing needed to be provided to the Senate on either of these \nissues, nothing. Last evening, the chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, my friend, Senator Roberts, came to the floor to announce \nthat he had attempted, ``one last good-faith effort to alleviate Senate \nDemocrats' concerns.''\n\n  These questions were not directed to a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee or to a member of the Armed Services Committee. These \nquestions that we have asked were directed to the White House, to this \nadministration.\n  Let us take a look, though, at Senator Roberts' efforts. First, it \ncompletely ignored one of the two issues on which we are seeking \nfurther clarification; namely, whether Bolton attempted to exaggerate \nwhat Congress and the American people would be told about Syria's \nalleged weapons of mass destruction capabilities.\n  I remind my colleagues, this is no small matter. All over the news \nthe last 2 days has been concerns about weapons of mass destruction by \nvirtue of the memo that was discovered in England. Concerns about this \nadministration hyping intelligence and Great Britain hyping \nintelligence cannot be dismissed lightly.\n  U.S. troops are fighting in Iraq today largely because this \nadministration told the Congress and the American people that Iraq not \nonly possessed stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction but was also \ncapable of using them against us and our allies.\n  U.S. troops are fighting in Iraq today. In the last 48 hours, 11 \nAmerican soldiers have been killed. During that same period of time, I \ndo not know the exact count, but well over 100 Iraqis have been killed. \nDuring that same 48-hour period, I do not know how many American \nsoldiers have been grievously injured. I have no idea how many Iraqis \nhave been paralyzed, blinded, or lost limbs. It is serious.\n  But we have learned since the war that the administration's own \ninvestigator concluded Iraq did not possess either the stockpiles or \nthe means of delivery. Just as importantly, there are a series of \nunanswered questions about whether senior officials in this \nadministration dramatically and intentionally hyped this threat to \njustify their desire to invade Iraq. So one can see why we believe it \nis no small matter for us to learn whether Mr. Bolton was a party to \nother efforts to hype intelligence.\n  Let's be clear about what is happening in Washington and the Senate. \nWe have a White House that continues to drive an agenda--some say it is \na radical agenda--determined to consolidate power and abuse it when \nnecessary to push its unpopular policies. This disagreement over the \nBolton nomination is not about partisan politics, ideology, or even \nreform at the United Nations. It is about whether we permit this \nadministration yet again to walk roughshod over the Constitution.\n  Our duty as Senators is to ensure that our country is represented by \nqualified and, yes, ethical individuals. Instead of joining the Senate \nto protect and respect the Constitution, the administration has decided \nto pick a fight with large rhetoric and negative attacks as it \nconsecrates its power and continues its secretive approach to \ngoverning.\n  Instead of joining us in a bipartisan conversation to reform Social \nSecurity, the administration pursues a risky privatization scheme that \nwill slash benefits and threaten our economy with massive new debt. \nPublic support for this privatization scheme is around the 20-percent \nmark.\n  This administration has also acquiesced to its radical rightwing base \nand supported the intrusion of the Federal Government into the private \nlives of families.\n  Just as troubling as all of this might be, when the administration \nfails to get what they want, they rev up the negative attack machine \nand set up the slash and burn, and I can say that is certainly true.\n  This pattern could not be clearer, and the American people are \njoining us to say enough is enough. For months now we have been talking \nabout reforming Washington and focusing on the issues that affect the \nlives of the American people. We have been trying to do that as \nDemocrats. Our work on the Energy bill this week is an example of what \ncan be done with bipartisan work. We have a bipartisan bill that we \nhope to continue to improve.\n  Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman have been exemplary in the work \nthat they have done. We want to improve the bill. That is what \nlegislation is all about. Americans are tired of getting caught in the \ncrossfire of partisan sniping. So let us continue to join in a \ncommonsense center and do the work the American people sent us to do.\n\n[[Page S6671]]\n\n  I end as I began. If this administration, like previous \nadministrations, respects requests of the Senate, we will immediately \nmove to grant Bolton an up-or-down vote. I stand by that pledge today \nas I did more than a month ago.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask that I be permitted to speak 1 \nminute as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I listened with great attention to the \nminority leader. I want to state to the Senate, as I listened I had one \nquestion that went through my mind. I am in no way--I have not been \nstudying Guantanamo, in terms of hearings and the like. But some of our \nleading officials, in whom I have great confidence--the generals who \nspeak, the Vice President--are asking the question, What would we do \nwith those people, those prisoners?\n  I guess it would be interesting for those who are very concerned \nabout the issue to think with us a minute. What about the other side? \nWhat do they do with their prisoners? They don't have any problems, \nright? They kill them. We have been watching that. They hold them as \nhostages, tell the whole world about it, and then the next day they say \ncut off their heads. That is how they get rid of people who they think \nare an impediment to what they want to do, those who are fighting their \ncause.\n  We don't have that luxury. We pick up these combatants and what do we \ndo with them? What are we going to do with them, I ask rhetorically. We \nsurely are not going to do what they are doing. We have to do something \nwith them and it is not an easy solution. Who wants them? Will we put \nthem out and say go home and then they will be out there killing our \nmen again?\n  It is a very serious proposition, in terms of the United States of \nAmerica having a difficult problem here.\n  I understand my time has elapsed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6671-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The time has come to move back to this bill. I want to \nsay to Senators it happens frequently, when things are going well, that \nnobody is very interested in moving along. So we have to push you along \nby making sure Senators, or their staffs, understand this has to be a \nday where we get rid of three or four amendments, including a couple of \nvery important ones that are here for the Senate to consider.\n  There is a pending amendment Senator Cantwell has before us. We are \ntrying right now to work out a unanimous consent agreement whereby we \nwill move off that amendment and have a time for a vote. Then we will \nmove onto an amendment--we are thinking that will be an amendment by \nSenator Bingaman--with a time agreement, somewhere around 3 hours \nequally divided. We will share that with Senator Bingaman and others.\n  Then there is a third amendment from our side of the aisle which, for \nthe sake of naming it, we will call the DeWine amendment. It is not \nnecessarily the name, but he is one of the Senators. We know he has an \namendment. We hope we can lock that in to follow after the Bingaman \namendment. We will agree on the time. Then the DeWine amendment will \nhave a certain amount of time after which it will be ready for a vote.\n  I am thinking with some degree of certainty we will have three votes. \nThat will take us into the evening. We will have this pending \namendment, the Bingaman amendment, that he considers very important on \nthe mandate for renewables across the land, and then we will have a \nDeWine amendment that has to do with the oil cartel.\n  I am waiting for those who are putting these numbers together to come \nhere because Senators have to be consulted.\n  If people wonder why this takes a little bit of time, let me explain. \nWe are agreeing to something, but people in the Senate have to agree. \nSo we are checking with them now. The only other way we could do it, \nyou see, for those who wonder where they are, we could have all \nSenators down here and say, Do you agree with this or that? But we \ncan't do that, so we have this little time interval where we ask the \nSenate be put into a quorum call and that is what I was going to ask \nright now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to speak to the pending \namendment, the Cantwell amendment, if it is appropriate, unless the \nchairman has some other business he wants to raise at this point?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would ask the Senator, if he would, give me a little \nbit of time before he does that and let me see if we can have a \nunanimous consent agreement locked in so we have some idea how much \ntime you will use, or others.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Maybe I could make an alternative suggestion to the \nchairman. I will speak until I receive a signal from him that he wants \nto speak for any reason.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If you are so generous, I will listen and when I think \nI am tired of listening to you, I will put up my hand.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It will then be a very short speech, I am sure.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I hate to live under that standard, but I will proceed \nnevertheless, at my peril, to discuss this bill.\n  This 800-page bill is our energy bill. We have been working on it for \nyears. No one has worked harder than the Senator from New Mexico. This \nRepublican Senator has joined with the Democratic Senator from New \nMexico, Senator Bingaman, and they have produced a bill which in many \nrespects is a good bill. If this bill were presented to me today to \nvote on, I would vote for it because I think there are so many \npositives here. It not only is good in itself, it is certainly good in \ncomparison to what the House has produced. The House of Representatives \nhas produced a grab bag of incentives and benefits to energy producers \nthat doesn't get to the heart of the question: What is the best energy \npolicy for America, for our children and grandchildren? What is the \nlong-term view of America, when it comes to energy?\n  Senator Dorgan of North Dakota asked a question of the administration \nwhen they came to testify on this bill. He said, You look forward 30 or \n40 years on Social Security and say we have to be prepared. What are \nyou prepared to say will be our energy policy in 30 or 40 years? What \nshould we be aiming for?\n  The simple answer was they couldn't answer it. They had no long-term \nenergy policy. There is one thing we know will happen, unless we change \ncourse from where we are today. Each and every day of every month of \nevery year for at least the next 20 years, we will become more \ndependent on foreign oil. Today, 58 percent of the oil consumed in the \nUnited States comes from overseas. That number has grown dramatically. \nIn 1973, that number was 28 percent. So in 32 years we have more than \ndoubled our dependence on foreign oil. We all need it: to fuel our \ncars, trucks, businesses--the economy of America. So the obvious \nquestion is, Is this something that should concern us? I think it is \nclear on its face it should.\n  As we become increasingly dependent on Saudi Arabia, the OPEC cartel, \nIraq, Iran, Libya, and so many other countries for our oil sources, \nfrankly, we are surrendering some of our freedom and control of our own \nfuture. If we lessen our dependence on their foreign oil, it \nstrengthens our economy. Less money is going overseas to buy oil. More \nmoney goes into the United States. There is less dependence on what \nhappens.\n\n[[Page S6672]]\n\n  Saudi Arabia is a country we ought to take a close look at because we \ndepend on it so much. Saudi Arabia is a royalty. It is a kingdom. It is \na government which, on any given day, we are either embracing because \nthey provide us with oil or admonishing because they are doing things \nas a matter of policy that are inconsistent with American values. How \nmuch longer do we want to be joined at the hip with Saudi Arabia? How \nmuch longer do we want to wait for these sheiks and princes to decide \nhow much oil they will release from their country and directly impact \nthe cost of gasoline in America?\n  I think the answer is very clear. The sooner we move toward \nindependence, the more secure America is, the less dependent we are on \nSaudi Arabia and other countries. The pending amendment by Senator \nCantwell of Washington sets a goal for America. I think it is a goal \nthat can be reached by people of good faith on both sides of the aisle \nwho are prepared to accept the challenge.\n  Here is the challenge: Can we, over the next 20 years, reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil by 40 percent? It is a challenge. It is not \nas great a challenge as putting a man on the Moon, but America did \nthat. It may not be as great a challenge as the Manhattan Project, when \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt said develop an atomic bomb that will end \nWorld War II, but we did that. I am confident, with the creativity and \ningenuity of America, we can meet this challenge--40-percent reduction \nin dependence on foreign oil over the next 20 years. That is the \npending amendment.\n  You would think most Senators would say: Fine, let's accept the \nchallenge. Let America rise to this challenge and meet it. But sadly, \nif you listen to the debate, primarily from the other side of the \naisle, that is not what we hear. We hear, instead: Oh, this is too big \na challenge for America. We can't do that. The technology isn't there. \nWe would have to change the cars we are driving. We would have to \nchallenge Detroit and automobile manufacturers to build more fuel-\nefficient vehicles. They say that is impossible, America cannot meet \nthat challenge, and they oppose the pending amendment.\n  I would say from my point of view this should be a bipartisan \nchallenge we all accept. There are people who love their SUVs. I \nunderstand that. But I think we can say to Detroit, you can, and we \nknow you can, produce a fuel-efficient vehicle that is safe and meets \nthe needs of America, our families and our businesses. But to continue \nto build cars larger and heavier, that get fewer and fewer miles per \ngallon, is to increase our dependence on oil, particularly foreign oil, \nand our addiction to this source of energy. I think we can do better. I \nthink the amendment offered by Senator Cantwell of Washington does \nestablish that challenge for us.\n  I personally believe we should do something about the fuel efficiency \nof the vehicles we drive. Do you know it has been 20 years since we \nheld Detroit responsible for reducing the amount of fuel that you \nconsume to travel a mile in America? For 20 years we have stepped out \nof the picture, and what has happened in the meantime? The fuel \nefficiency of vehicles in America has gone down, down, down. People \ndrive these Hummers. Have you ever seen them? I personally think if you \nwant to drive a Hummer, you ought to join the Army. People want them \nand get 5 or 6 miles a gallon and Detroit keeps churning out these big, \nheavy cars.\n  From my point of view, we ought to step back as a nation and say, \nisn't it worth something for us to have more fuel-efficient vehicles so \nwe don't get drawn into foreign conflicts over oil? It is more \nimportant to me to drive a sensible car and to spare someone's son or \ndaughter from serving in the military in the Middle East in a war. That \nis not a great sacrifice on my part. And it is certainly a great \nreward, when we have fewer and fewer times when we are entangled in \nthis Middle East problem that continues today over our sources of oil.\n  I happen to believe this is a good bill. It can be improved and the \nCantwell amendment improves it. There is one provision, only one in 800 \npages, which talks about better fuel efficiency in America--or at least \nreduces our dependence. Let me be more specific: reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil. There was a provision that was passed by the \nSenate the last time we debated this bill, 99 to 1. It was \noverwhelmingly supported. It said, over the next 10 years we will \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil by 1 million barrels a day. That \nis a good step in the right direction. The Cantwell amendment takes us \na little further and I think is better overall, but I support what is \nin the bill. Do you know, 2 days ago President Bush and his White House \nsent us their evaluation of this bill and said if that provision is \nincluded in the bill, the President will veto it.\n  The President will veto it if we embark on a policy of reducing our \ndependence on oil by 1 million barrels a day over the next 10 years? \nWhat are they thinking? How can we be any safer as a nation more \ndependent on foreign oil? Should not we be accepting this challenge? \nWhy is the Bush White House walking away from it?\n  Senator Domenici, myself, virtually every other Senator, agreed to \nput this provision in the bill last time. I think it is a good \nprovision this time. Yet the Bush White House is opposed to it.\n  There is only a certain amount of oil we can drill for around America \nand around the areas we control to meet our needs. The total world oil \nsupply in the control of the United States is about 3 percent. Yet we \nuse 25 percent of the oil that is consumed each day. If we are going to \nbe realistic, we have to understand we need more efficient vehicles, \nmore use of alternative fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel, and we \nneed to be looking for ways to reduce the waste of fuel, such as the \none included in this bill, and I commend the Senator from New Mexico on \nthis. The provision in your bill which relates to the idling of diesel \ntrucks is a great provision. All of these are sensible moves in the \nright direction. If they are, why isn't this administration supporting \nit? Why don't we have a good, strong bipartisan vote not only for that \nprovision but for the Cantwell provision, as well?\n\n  Let us accept the challenge. Let us not view that as a negative \nalternative that America just cannot do it. We can. We have proven it \nin the past. We can come together and pass this bill on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I am greatly rewarded by his \npatience in allowing me to speak a full 10 or 15 minutes without \nboiling his bile or whatever might have occurred.\n  I yield the floor and hope we are moving toward a vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are grateful. We will have a unanimous consent to \ntake care of today.\n  Let me just say briefly, if I were President of the United States--\nwhich obviously is beyond the realm of possibility--I would be opposed \nto this amendment. It is not as if it does nothing to the President. It \nsays, Mr. President, whoever you are--and it obviously will not be this \none--tell us how, give us a plan, tell us how you will reduce America's \nconsumption of crude oil by 40 percent by a year certain.\n  What President would like to do that? What President would think that \nis a worthwhile effort if he would have to send up some kind of plan at \nwhich the whole world would laugh? Our cars would have to be the size \nof golf carts or we would have to make a breakthrough in the next 10 \nyears, which we have been working on for 40 or 50 years, and we have \nnot made it yet.\n  The very ones talking about it do not want to even get the oil from \nANWR. That is a million of what they are asking for, and it surely \nwould be here by the time their resolution talks about it. What if the \nPresident, whoever it is, says: Let's go to ANWR and get a million. \nGuess what they would say: Destroying the world, getting rid of the \nenvironment. But a nice little resolution, nice little bill saying we \nhave a solution to this. We will just be a John F. Kennedy and say our \ngoal is to some way, somehow, cut America's consumption of crude oil \nfrom overseas by 40 percent, when it has been going up every year with \neverything we are trying to do.\n  In this bill, we are trying what is real. We are challenging all of \nthe technocrats, the technologists, the scientists. We are telling \nthem: Here are resources, find solutions. What superentity would we \ncreate in this country and say: Here you are. You are on top\n\n[[Page S6673]]\n\nof all this. You prepare this plan. You give it to the President so he \ncan give it to the people. To what end? What would it do? A 40-percent \nreduction reduces our consumption by 7.2 million barrels. We cannot \neven get anyone to vote to let America produce 1 million barrels now. \nIf that 1 million would come off 7.2 million barrels, we would still be \na huge way away.\n  Do not misunderstand, this issue is an American issue of high \nconsequence. America is doing everything it can. We did not used to. \nThat is why it is so hard now. We let it get away from us. It will not \ncome back under control with a gaudy, impossible resolution that will \nsound like somebody has a plan.\n  I have attempted just to tell the Senate the truth. I have attempted \nto offer an amendment to this and just up the ante and say if we can do \n7.2 million, why don't we do 8.2 or 9.2, and put it in there and say we \nwill vote on a bigger one. Then I thought, maybe I ought to be what I \nhave tried to be on this bill all along, honest and forthright, and as \nbest I could explain to the Senate, we have to do everything we can, \nwith imagination, with vigor, with certainty, with resources, but the \nkind of things we know we can do, that we know we put our shoulders to \nit and we work hard.\n  We are finally coming to the point where Americans do believe it is a \nbig problem. I don't think they are blaming people anymore. It used to \nbe we called the big oil companies up, swear them in under oath--I \ndon't know if the Senator remembers the day we called them up here and \nhad them swear. We said: You are the problem; you are why we are \nimporting all this oil.\n\n  Remember those days? They told us everything they could. That hearing \nwent away. What happened? The next year we imported more oil and more \noil.\n  It isn't that the Senator doesn't think we should have an American \nplan. What we have in this bill is an American plan. Senator Bingaman \nand I and many others have worked hard to put it together. Some people \nsay it does not do enough as it is. I heard some reporters yesterday \ncommenting. I wondered what they were reading. They said: It doesn't do \nanything for nuclear. It is the most far-reaching pronuclear set of \nproposals we will have ever before us. The same commentators said it \ncost too much money. I don't know where they got the numbers. We have \nnot even spent in this bill. We were given a $2-billion reserve fund. \nWe have not spent all of that yet. I shouldn't have said that because \neverybody will be down here wanting to spend it, but they have to go \nthrough us before they can spend it.\n  The tax portion is about like the House portion. It is a pretty good \nbill. It is not a spending bill. When you authorize programs, \nincidentally, you are not saying we are going to buy them or pay for \nthem. The distinguished occupant of the Chair knows in agriculture you \nauthorize programs, but you do not expect the appropriations to do \nexactly what you say. You say: This is a program we would like you to \nthink about. That is what this bill does in terms of authorization. \nOverall, it is a very good bill.\n  Is the proposed unanimous consent agreement satisfactory?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent the Cantwell amendment be \ntemporarily set aside, Senator Bingaman be recognized in order to offer \nan amendment regarding RPS; provided further there be 3 hours of debate \nequally divided in the usual form and that following the use or \nyielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the \namendment and that no second-degree amendments be in order to the \namendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 791\n\n         (Purpose: To establish a renewable portfolio standard)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Coleman, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Collins, Mr. Dorgan, Ms. \n     Feinstein, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Salazar, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 791.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is a proposal that has been offered \nbefore in the Senate. This is a proposal that was included in the \ncomprehensive Energy bill we passed in the 107th Congress, again in the \nbill that was passed in the 108th Congress. It sets a standard referred \nto, generally, as a renewable portfolio standard. It is essentially a \nrequirement that those producing electricity in the country produce 10 \npercent of that electricity that they sell by 2020 from renewable \nsources.\n  The Senate has approved this proposition again and again. As I \nindicated, in the 107th Congress, we included such a portfolio standard \nas part of an Energy bill. We had various votes in the Senate that \naffirmed the Senate's determination that the standard should not be \nweakened. In the 108th Congress, there was a letter signed by 53 \nSenators that went to the chairs of the conference on the Energy bill, \nH.R. 6. Senate conferees went on to approve the portfolio standard and \npass it on to the House as part of the Senate action.\n  Now we have the opportunity to renew our support for this proposal to \nplace it in this bill where we can, hopefully, get broad bipartisan \nsupport and get it to the President's desk.\n  There are good reasons for the strong support that we have seen in \nthe Senate. A strong renewable portfolio standard is an essential \ncomponent of any comprehensive national energy policy--not just an \nimportant part of such a strategy but an essential component.\n  The benefits are clear and they are many. Let me cite the major \nbenefits: This provision would reduce our dependence on traditional, \npolluting sources of electricity. It would reduce our dependence on \nforeign energy sources. It would reduce the growing pressure on natural \ngas as a fuel for the generation of electricity. It would reduce the \nprice of natural gas. It would create new jobs. It would make a start \non reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It would increase our energy \nsecurity and enhance the reliability of the electricity grid.\n  The renewable portfolio standard that we are offering--and I have \nvarious cosponsors--and I hope we have additional cosponsors before \nthis amendment is dealt with--Senator Coleman, Senator Jeffords, \nSenator Collins, Senator Dorgan, Senator Cantwell, Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Reid, Senator Salazar. I believe many other Members in the \nSenate strongly support this effort.\n\n  The RPS we have offered is a flexible and market-driven approach to \nachieving the various goals I have mentioned at a negligible cost to \nconsumers in this country. According to the Energy Information \nAdministration, the amendment would result in over 350 billion kilowatt \nhours or 68,000 megawatts of renewable generation between 2008 and \n2025. That is enough power generation to supply 56 million U.S. homes. \nThe cost to consumers would be about .18 of a percent or less than one-\nfifth of 1 percent increase in overall energy prices.\n  This proposal would require retail sellers of electricity that sell \nmore than 4 million megawatt hours per year to provide 10 percent of \nthat electricity from renewable resources by the year 2020. The \nrequirement would be ramped up in 3-year increments to allow for \nplanning flexibility. The Secretary of Energy would be required to \ndevelop a system of credits for renewable generation that could be \ntraded or sold; again, making the program easier to comply with. \nUtilities could use existing renewable generation to comply with the \nprogram or they could comply with the program by buying credits from \nsomeone else who is producing renewable energy. New renewable producers \ncould receive the credits to trade or to sell.\n  The cost of the program to the utilities would be capped by allowing \nthe\n\n[[Page S6674]]\n\nSecretary to sell credit at 1.5 cents per kilowatt, adjusted for \ninflation. As long as the difference between the cost of the renewable \ngeneration is less than 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour, the utility could \nbuy or generate renewables. When it reaches or exceeds that price, \nobviously the cap would kick in, and it would become more cost \neffective for the utility to go ahead and buy the credits. We also \nwould create a program for the sale of the credits to fund State \nprograms for the development of renewables.\n  Congress has tried before to spur the development of renewables. In \n1978, we passed the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, PURPA. That \nbill required utilities to buy renewables if the generators could meet \nthe avoided cost of the utilities. Cogeneration--that is, the combined \nuse of heat for industrial processes and for generation of \nelectricity--was also eligible. That program resulted in a huge growth \nof cogeneration. Over half of the new generation that came online in \nthe country during the 1980s and 1990s was from that resource.\n  It did not, however, do much for renewable generation. These \ntechnologies have remained at about 2 percent of total electricity \nsupply for decades now. In other words, PURPA did not work to stimulate \ndevelopment of renewables as we had hoped it might.\n  Let me put up a chart to make the point of this 2 percent figure to \ngive people an idea of what we are dealing with today.\n  This shows electricity generation by fuel for the period of 1970 \nthrough 2025. Of course, some of that is anticipated. This is from the \nEnergy Information Agency which is part of the administration.\n  You can see that by far the largest percentage of the electricity we \nproduce in this country is produced from coal. That is the case today, \nin 2005, as shown by this white line on the chart. That has been the \ncase ever since 1970, and that will be the case in the future. That is \ntrue regardless of whether this amendment is adopted or is not adopted.\n  The next source of power, the next fuel for electricity generation is \nsoon to be--right now it is nuclear but it is very soon to be natural \ngas. You can see a green line there. It is probably a little hard to \nsee against that blue background on the chart, but there is a green \nline which goes up pretty dramatically in the future. That is a concern \nI know all of us who have looked at this issue share. We see the price \nof natural gas going up a significant degree, because we have more and \nmore of our electricity being produced from natural gas. That puts \npressure on the price of natural gas. People who are buying natural gas \nto heat their homes or their businesses see the cost of their utilities \ngoing up because of the increased pressure on that price of natural gas \ncoming from the increased demand for natural gas to produce \nelectricity.\n  You can see the renewables number down here. The renewables is next \nto the bottom line, and it is bumping along at less than 5 percent. It \nis down around 2 percent today. It will increase very modestly.\n  This chart is a chart of how the Energy Information Agency would \nexpect production to occur absent a renewable portfolio standard. What \nthis amendment will try to do is increase somewhat the amount of \nelectricity we are producing from renewables and, by doing so, decrease \nthe amount of electricity we have to produce from natural gas. This is \na way to keep down the increasing cost of natural gas, and it is a way \nto keep down the increasing price of natural gas as well.\n  Let me talk about some of the criticism that has been made of this \namendment and this approach. Critics of the proposal point to a number \nof concerns they have. The No. 1 criticism I have heard is it costs too \nmuch; also, that States are already requiring development of \nrenewables; and, third, some areas do not have readily available \nrenewable resources. Those are the three major criticisms we hear, so \nlet me respond to each of those.\n  In response to the argument that it costs too much, I will point to a \nnumber of studies of this proposal that have been done over the last \nseveral years.\n  In 2003, I asked the Energy Information Agency at the Department of \nEnergy to look at the effect the standard would have. They found our \nstandard would result in 350 billion kilowatt hours of new renewable \ngeneration between 2008 and 2025. That would not happen absent the \nadoption of this provision. They found the cost would be minimal. The \nreport indicated there would be an increase in the cost of electricity \nof only one-tenth of a cent in 2025 over projected costs. When combined \nwith the reduction in natural gas prices that would be caused by the \nRPS, total aggregate cost to the consumer on that consumer's energy \nbill was projected to be less than one-twentieth of 1 percent.\n  I have asked the EIA to update this analysis with current conditions, \nand we have their update. They have sent me a letter which I can put in \nthe Record. Let me cite the most important parts of it. It says:\n\n       Cumulative residential expenditures on electricity from \n     2005 through 2025 are $2.5 billion lower while cumulative \n     residential expenditures on natural gas are reduced by $2.9 \n     billion, or 0.5 percent. Cumulative expenditures for natural \n     gas and electricity by all end-use sectors taken together \n     would decrease by $22.6 billion.\n\n  Now, that is their current estimate of what the effect of this \nprovision would be.\n  The report also indicates the generation of electricity from natural \ngas would be 5 percent lower if we adopt this RPS than it would be \notherwise. It also projects that total electricity-sector carbon \ndioxide emissions are reduced by 7.5 percent relative to the status \nquo. They are reduced by 249 million metric tons.\n  A number of other studies have found positive results, even to the \npoint of reducing overall energy costs. Earlier this year we held a \nhearing in the Energy Committee on generation portfolios. Dr. Ryan \nWiser of Lawrence-Berkeley National Laboratory presented a report that \nsummarized the results of some 15 studies of renewable portfolio \nstandards much like the one we are offering today. All of these studies \nfound that a portfolio standard would reduce natural gas prices. Twelve \nof the 15 studies projected a net reduction in overall energy bills as \na result of the RPS.\n  The Energy Information Agency report projected that the RPS would \nlead to a 32-percent lower allowance cost for sulfur dioxide emissions. \nThe cost is not great. So the argument we have heard that this is too \nexpensive a proposition I think does not hold water.\n  Many have argued that States are implementing renewable portfolio \nstandards and there is no need for a Federal program. It is true that \nStates have taken the lead in pushing for more renewable generation. \nEighteen States currently have developed renewable requirements. Three \nmore are soon to begin implementing renewable requirements.\n\n  Almost all of these standards are more aggressive than the Federal \nstandard in the amendment I am proposing today. My home State of New \nMexico requires 10 percent of electricity produced by utilities in that \nState to be from renewable sources by the year 2011--not 2020. Mr. \nPresident, 2020 is what our amendment calls for. But New Mexico says \n2011. California says 20 percent by 2017. Maine requires 30 percent by \n2000; Minnesota, 19 percent by 2015.\n  This will spur the growth of renewables in these regions. There is \none thing, however, a State standard will not do. It will not drive a \nnational market for these technologies. If some States have renewable \nstandards and others do not, or if the technologies and requirements \nvary from State to State, it is impossible for a national market to \ndevelop for renewable credits.\n  This credit trading system is the piece of our proposal that gives \nthe greatest flexibility for compliance. A credit trading system also \nhelps to reduce the cost of compliance by allowing credits for lower \ncost renewables from one region to be bought by utilities in another \nregion.\n  Some argue this is a cost shift from the regions without renewable \nresources to those with renewable resources. I would argue it is a way \nto spread the cost to all who are seeing the benefits. If States do not \nhave or choose not to develop renewable resources, they still realize \nthe benefits of lower natural gas prices, of lower SO2 \nallowances, of lower cost carbon\n\n[[Page S6675]]\n\nreductions. It is only fair they share the slight increase in cost for \ngeneration of electricity that has created these savings.\n  The argument that many regions do not have renewable generation \nresources has also been made. While it is true that the best wind, \ngeothermal, and solar resources are concentrated in Western States, the \nentire country has extensive biomass potential. We have another chart I \nwant to put up here for people to look at.\n  As Maine and other States have shown, paper production and \nagricultural processes are available everywhere. If Rhode Island, \nPennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland can implement aggressive \nstandards, then other States can as well.\n  This chart makes the case very strongly about where these renewable \nenergy resources are available. You can see that solar, of course, is \navailable everywhere but more prominently in the Southwest. That is \nshown in the upper right-hand part of this chart. Wind resources are \nnot available everywhere but clearly are in many States, and \nparticularly in the West and the Midwest. That is shown on the lower \nright-hand part of the chart. Geothermal resources are primarily \nconcentrated in the West, but biomass and biofuel resources are \neverywhere in the country, and are particularly concentrated in the \neastern part of the country. So as these technologies develop, as the \nmarkets for these technologies develop, there is an ability to produce \nenergy from renewable sources everywhere.\n  The environmental benefits are clear. The renewable portfolio \nstandard would result, according to the Energy Information Agency, in a \n3.6-percent reduction in carbon emissions in the year 2025. This is a \nreduction of 31 million tons in that year alone. That reduction is the \nequivalent to planting 27.5 million acres of trees, an area about the \nsize of Pennsylvania. And this is in one single year.\n  The RPS also benefits the economy by driving job growth. According to \nthe Union of Concerned Scientists, wind turbine construction alone \nwould result in 43,000 new jobs per year on average. An additional \n11,200 cumulative long-term jobs would result from the subsequent \noperations and maintenance of these renewable facilities.\n  The Regional Economics Applications Laboratory for the Environmental \nLaw and Policy Center found that 68,400 jobs and $6.7 billion in \neconomic output are a result of renewable energy; wind power creates 22 \ndirect and indirect construction and manufacturing jobs for each \nmegawatt of installed capacity; wind power creates one operation and \nmaintenance job for every 10 megawatts of installed capacity.\n  A study by the State of Wisconsin found that increased use of \nrenewable energy sources would create three times as many jobs as \nincreased use of traditional fuels for electricity production. U.S. \nPIRG reports that building 5,900 megawatts of renewable energy capacity \nin California would lead to 28,000 yearlong construction jobs and 3,000 \noperations and maintenance jobs. Over 30 years, these new plants would \ncreate 120,000 person hours of employment, four times as many person \nhours as building 5,900 megawatts of natural gas capacity.\n  According to the AFL-CIO, an estimated 8,092 jobs would be created \nover a 10-year period for installation and operations and maintenance \nof wind power in Nevada, and another 19,000 manufacturing jobs.\n  Support for this concept and this proposal is strong throughout the \ncountry. Recent polls have shown that support. A poll by Mellman \nAssociates found that 70 percent of those surveyed nationwide supported \na 20-percent portfolio standard. We are not proposing that aggressive a \nstandard. We are proposing 10 percent by the year 2020, which I pointed \nout is substantially more modest than most of the States have embraced \nthat have gone this route. These results held about the same in States \nas diverse as North Dakota, Georgia, Missouri, and Arizona.\n  Environmental groups from throughout the Nation, from the Sierra Club \nto the Natural Resources Defense Council, from industrial associations \nto the renewable trade groups and utilities, have all supported the \nRPS.\n  We are trying in this bill to implement a policy to develop an energy \nfuture for the Nation that would rely on our own resources, creating \nenergy security for the country; that would provide for cleaner air and \nwater; that would begin to reduce our emissions of carbon dioxide into \nthe air; and that would drive our economy to greater heights. This \nportfolio standard is a low-cost, effective, market-driven way to \naccomplish these goals.\n  Let me put up one other chart before I yield the floor.\n  There is a chart we have that shows the production-added capacity of \nwind energy which I wanted to reference. It is entitled ``Annual \nInstalled Capacity.''\n  One of the arguments being made against this legislation is, through \nthe Tax Code, we are already providing incentives for utilities to do \nthis. Therefore, something like this is not required.\n  The truth is, we have had incentives in the Tax Code. Our history of \nsuccess at getting additional installed capacity through that device \nhas been extremely mixed. We have a tax provision for a year, and then \nwe let it expire. Installation drops off dramatically. We have a tax \nprovision put back in place. The installation of capacity goes up. We \nlet it expire. Unfortunately, that has been the history in this \nCongress.\n  I would like to say it is going to be different in the future, but I \nam not persuaded. What the renewable portfolio standard will do is to \nset a long-term path for how we want to proceed and would give \nutilities and those who are involved in the generation of electricity a \nclear idea of what is to be expected from them as they go forward. This \nwould have a beneficial effect on the development of these \ntechnologies, on bringing the cost of producing power from renewable \nsources down, and would bring us into line with many of the more \nindustrially advanced countries in the world.\n  This is a useful provision. It is one that has bipartisan support in \nthe Senate and one we have had the good sense to adopt in the previous \ntwo Congresses. I hope we will do that again this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I remind the Senate that we have an hour \nand a half on our side. I am in control of the time. I am going to \nyield control of the time to the junior Senator from Tennessee. He will \nstart and use as much time as he wants. Then I will return and use \nsome. I have put the word out, if anybody else would like to speak in \nopposition to the Bingaman amendment.\n  With that understanding, I yield the floor and thank the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico. \nWhile both Senators from New Mexico are in the Chamber, all of us \nappreciate the way they have brought this extremely important bill \ntogether. We know there are a handful of tough issues about which we \ndisagree. Through their leadership, we have a consensus on what is well \non its way to being an American Clean Energy Act for 2005, something \nthat will dramatically transform the way we conserve energy, produce \nenergy, and will help us keep our jobs and be more competitive in the \nworld marketplace. That is our goal.\n  I also believe it will lower natural gas prices. And I thank the \nchairman and ranking member for their contributions.\n  At the end of our committee markup, during which the vote was 21 to \n1, there were compliments thrown all around. Senator Bingaman said he \ncouldn't remember a party-line vote in all the votes that we had, that \nwe were voting based upon our own individual views and our regional \ndifferences. Senator Cantwell said it was not only a clean energy bill, \nbut it was a clean process. But that doesn't mean that when we \ndisagree, we shouldn't disagree. And we have differences of opinion. \nThat is what the Senate is for.\n  While I respect the other side for what is a high-sounding idea, the \nidea of a renewable portfolio standard, I believe there is a better way \nto spend these billions of dollars than the way\n\n[[Page S6676]]\n\nsuggested by Senator Bingaman, if our real goal is to create an \nadequate supply of low-cost, reliable American-produced energy.\n  It is always important to start from the proposition that this is a \nbig country and a massive economy. We use 25 percent of all the energy \nin the world, and we spend about $2,500 a year per person to produce \nthat. So when we put up a windmill that only blows 20 or 30 or 40 \npercent of the time, it doesn't matter much in terms of what we do. \nWhen we build a new nuclear power plant, which we haven't done since \nthe 1970s, it matters a lot. A windmill would be one of 6,700, but that \npower plant would be only 1 of 1,300 or 1,400 power plants we have in \nthe country. So it takes quite a bit to affect our energy policy.\n  There are three reasons I hope my colleagues will vote against the \nrenewable portfolio standard. The first reason is that it is an $18 \nbillion tax. It is a new $18 billion rate increase on the electric \nratepayers of America. The second reason is it is an increase in \nsubsidy for a number of people, especially wind developers who already \ninclude a huge subsidy of a couple billion dollars over the next 5 \nyears, which the Finance Committee has recommended we increase to $3.3 \nbillion over the next 5 years just for giant windmills. Three, if not \ntechnically, it is at least in the spirit of an unfunded Federal \nmandate, the kind of thing that a lot of us were elected to stop, the \nidea of coming up with a big idea here in Washington and imposing it on \nthe rest of the country and then sending them the bill.\n  I was thinking about this: We are all going to be going home in a \ncouple of weeks, having debated the Energy bill and hopefully having \npassed it, feeling good about it. Our constituents are going to ask: \nWhat did you do about high gasoline prices? What did you do about high \nnatural gas prices? What did you do about the possibility of blackouts \nso my computer wouldn't work and so I wouldn't be safe in my home? What \ndid you do about the fact that China and India and other parts of the \nworld are buying up oil reserves and growing their economies and \ncreating constant pressure on the price of oil? What did you do about \nthat, Senator, while you were in Washington over the last couple of \nweeks?\n  I wonder if what we really want to say to our friends who elected us \nwhen we go back to Tennessee or Nevada or New Mexico is:\n  I raised your taxes $18 billion. I put a new $18 billion charge on \nyour electric bill. That is the first thing I did. The second thing I \ndid was I gave an increased subsidy to people who were already getting \na lot of money. Windmill developers are making $2 billion over the next \n5 years just to put up these giant windmills. We gave them another \nsubsidy on top of that. And then the third thing I did was, since we \nall get smarter when we go to Washington on the airplanes, we decided \nthat despite the fact that 17 or 18 States are already defining \nrenewable energy sources in their own ways and already trying to meet \nthem and already giving them incentives, we decided we would decide \nthat better. We would decide that from Washington, DC.\n\n  While I am not sure about this, at least in earlier versions of the \nproposal, in a number of cases the credit you got for what you were \ndoing according to your State renewable portfolio standard doesn't \ncount towards your national renewable portfolio standard.\n  I don't think I want to go home and say to the people of Tennessee \nthat what I did about the growth of China and India and the threat to \ntheir jobs and what I did about high gasoline prices and natural gas \nprices, what I did about blackouts was to add $18 billion to their \nelectric rates, to give a big subsidy to windmill developers, and to \nput an unfunded mandate on top of what States ought to be doing for \nthemselves.\n  There are better ways, if our goal is to produce low-carbon or \ncarbon-free electricity, which is what this debate is really all about. \nThis debate is motivated by those who feel most strongly about global \nwarming and about low-carbon and carbon-free electricity. There is a \nbetter way to do that, particularly if we have $18 billion. I want to \ntalk about that a little more as we go along.\n  The Senator from New Mexico, as he always does, gave a very careful \nand well-reasoned explanation of his points of view. His proposal is a \nlittle different from his proposal made in 2003. I want to go through \nwhy I said what I said and make sure my point of view is understood.\n  Let me begin with the idea of the $18 billion. I didn't just pull \nthat out of the air. This is a letter from the Department of Energy in \nWashington dated June 15, 2005, to Senator Bingaman. He quoted some of \nit. It talks about a number of things. It does talk about some places \nwhere in the whole economy there might be some reductions in \nexpenditures as a result of the RPS based on their monitoring. But it \nalso says the following:\n\n       From 2005 to 2025, the RPS has a cumulative total cost to \n     the electric power sector of about $18 billion. . . . This \n     cost includes $700 million in payments to the Government for \n     compliance credits once the price cap is reached and $10.7 \n     billion in payments to owners of customer-sited photovoltaics \n     that are eligible for triple credits.\n\n  In other words, we are going to spend $11 billion in payments for \nsolar power.\n  Let me start by talking about what we mean when we say renewable \nenergy. Some people get confused about ethanol, renewable fuel, and \nrenewable energy. We are not talking about ethanol. We are only talking \nabout renewable energy, making electricity. There are only a handful of \nways to do that that make much difference. Senator Bingaman has defined \nthose very narrowly. Wind is one, giant windmills. Geothermal is \nanother. That is hot water coming out of the ground to heat your home. \nHydropower is one, but we exclude hydropower except for very limited \nnew hydropower in this bill. Solar is another, using the sun. And \nbiomass, putting grass and/or other things into coal plants and burning \nthem is yet another.\n  Today, all of those renewable fuels produce a little over 2 percent \nof the electricity. Since the 1970s and 1980s, we tried very hard to \nencourage more. I can remember President Carter 20 years ago setting a \ngoal of 20 percent of solar energy. In 1992, the wind developers said: \nWe can make wind electricity out of wind, just give us a little bit of \nmoney to help get started, and then we will be off on our own. That was \n1992.\n  Billions and billions of dollars later, wind is still not very much \nbecause that is not the best way to produce carbon-free electricity for \nan economy of this size, to compound the problem by putting new taxes \nand new subsidies on the American people at a time when we are supposed \nto be talking about lower prices. I haven't heard anybody say: I want \nhigher natural gas prices. I want to pay a higher electric bill.\n  We are talking about higher prices, 18 billion new dollars on your \nelectric rates. And for what? To build tens of thousands of windmills \nand to spend nearly $11 billion producing what will end up being one-\nfifth of 1 percent of all of the electricity that we will produce. That \nwould be the solar electricity.\n  I am all for solar power. I have an amendment for solar power with \nSenator Johnson that we introduced as part of the Natural Gas Price \nReduction Act. It would spend $380 million over the next 5 years for \nbusinesses and homeowners who want to use solar power. It would help \nthat industry get started and see if it could go on its own without \nhuge higher costs. But this is nearly $11 billion for solar power to \nproduce one-fifth of 1 percent of all the electricity in the United \nStates.\n  After solar, tens of thousands of these windmills is the other major \nexpenditure along with biomass. So what we are talking about to begin \nwith is wind and biomass and solar and landfill gas and geothermal, and \ntrying to take that from 2 percent up to 10 percent. To do that, we are \ngoing to put an $18 billion tax increase on.\n  Now, let's go to the second objection I have. That is the size of the \nsubsidy and the people to whom the subsidy is going. I have been doing \na little investigating. It is hard to get these numbers down, to try to \nsee how much money we are spending for this kind of fuel, so I could \nsee if we could better spend it some other way. I have noticed that we \nare spending about 1 percent of our--we have something called the \nrenewable electricity production tax credit. So far, it has been really \na tax credit for windmills because solar\n\n[[Page S6677]]\n\nhasn't had the chance to take advantage of it. It pays you 1.8 cents \nfor every kilowatt hour of wind power that you produce.\n  Now, wind has become--according to many of the utilities who buy and \nsell wind power--a fairly competitive product where the wind blows. Of \ncourse, where it doesn't blow, no amount of subsidy will help it. So we \nhave already committed $2 billion in our Tax Code over the next 5 years \nto subsidize wind producers. And the Finance Committee, yesterday, said \nthey want to add a billion to that. The Finance Committee also said \nthey not only want to subsidize the production of the kilowatt hours of \npower, they want to loan money so developers can build these giant \nwindmills.\n  Some people may think I am talking about your grandmother's windmill \nout by the well somewhere pumping the water.\n  I will have to make one correction in trying to describe these. I \nhave said only one will fit into the second largest football stadium in \nAmerica in Tennessee. The Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, \nreminded me that Penn State is larger than the University of Tennessee, \nand I stand corrected on that. But even at Penn State, and even at the \nUniversity of Michigan, which is the largest, or the University of \nTennessee, which is third largest, just one of these windmills will fit \nin the stadium. The rotor blades extend from the 10-yard line to the \n10-yard line, and it rises twice as high as the skyboxes, and you can \nsee the red lights from 20 miles away on a clear night. These usually \ncome in groups of 10, 20, or 30 windmills.\n  This proposal would have the effect of increasing the number of these \ngigantic windmills from about 6,700, which we have in America today, to \n45,000. That is the estimate of the Energy Information Administration. \nEach of these produces about 1 megawatt of power--or to be accurate, is \nrated to produce about 1 megawatt of power. The wind only blows 20 to \n40 percent of the time, so it only produces about a third of a megawatt \nof power. Also, you have to take into account the fact that since these \noften are built in remote places or on top of scenic ridges, then you \nwould build large transmission lines through backyards to carry the \nelectricity to places. And you have to take into account the fact that \nyou cannot close down your coal plant and nuclear plant and your \nnatural gas plant when you put up windmills because people don't want \nto shut off their computers, stop working, or turn off their lights. \nThey have to have their electricity all of the time, and you don't \nstore power from wind in these amounts to use later.\n  So the idea that the United States of America would look to the \nfuture to keep its jobs and competition with Japan, with China, and \nwith India--our country that uses 25 percent of all the energy in the \nworld--by taxing its ratepayers $18 billion to build tens of thousands \nof windmills and, as good as solar power is, to spend $11 billion on \nsolar power, which will produce one-fifth of 1 percent of all of the \nelectricity we need in this country--I don't believe, respectfully, it \nis the best way to spend our money.\n  The third point is this about the States, and the Senator from New \nMexico mentioned about what the States are doing. Someone said, \n``Senator Alexander hasn't gotten over being Governor.'' Maybe, in a \nway, I hope I never do because I don't think you automatically get \nsmarter when you fly to Washington, DC. I know the Presiding Officer \ngoes home almost every weekend. You gain a lot of wisdom while you are \nat home, and not here. To the extent that it is a good idea for \nelectric utilities to begin to use a variety of different renewable \nsources, I submit that they are already doing it. They are working hard \non it. The Governor of California made a major address the other day \nabout the use of solar power in California.\n  There are 19 States, plus the District of Columbia, that have some \nform of RPS today. They have all sorts of different approaches to this. \nIowa met its standard in 1999. Connecticut increased its standard in \n2003. Texas has a well-regarded standard.\n  They use different definitions of renewable sources of energy. Maine \ndefines renewable to include pulp and paper waste and black liquor. \nPennsylvania has a clean energy portfolio standard that includes waste \ncoal. Connecticut includes fuel cells. The Western Governors \nAssociation includes clean coal.\n  I have a number of examples of how, under Senator Bingaman's 2003 \nproposal, which I have studied since his new proposal came just today, \nwhich I have not studied as closely, but there were a number of cases \nwhere the credits at the local utilities would be received under their \nState plans, but they would not be allowed under the Federal plan. So \nwe would be saying in Washington, DC, we see that in 19 States you have \nthis idea of more renewable energy, but we are going to do that \nourselves. We are going to preempt the field, we are going to set the \nrules, we are going to define it, and we are going to spend $18 billion \nour way instead of your way. I think that is unwise, Mr. President.\n  So the three arguments that I make against the Senator's amendment \nare these:\n  One, it is an $18 billion new tax on ratepayers to build tens of \nthousands of windmills and to spend $11 billion on solar power, which \nwould produce one-fifth of 1 percent of all of the electricity we need \nby 2025. That is not the wisest use of money, and I don't think that is \nwhat we want to say to our constituents when we go home.\n  Second, it adds an unneeded subsidy, especially to wind developers, \nwho we are giving $2 billion already over the next 5 years to build \nthese gigantic windmills, which mars the landscape and only work 20 or \n40 percent of the time. The only reason they are being built is because \nof these huge subsidized incentives.\n  I predict that if legislation like this passes and we go from 6,700 \nto 45,000 of these big windmills, you are going to have an uprising in \nevery State of people who don't want to see them and wonder why we are \ntaking $18 billion away from their electric bills and subsidizing \nthings like this.\n  Third, I trust the States. Nineteen of the States have an RPS, plus \nthe District of Columbia. These are the green ones on the chart, where \nyou see more capacity for renewable fuel. If you put a 10-percent \nstandard on Louisiana or Arkansas or Florida or Tennessee or Virginia, \nand we cannot meet that standard, what do we do? Our utility just \nwrites a check to the Government under the RPS. It is a new tax, it is \na new rate increase, and that is not the kind of thing we ought to be \ndoing.\n  What should we be doing? Let me go back to my first chart, and then I \nwill conclude my remarks. I like the direction of our bill as it is. \nYou see, I think what our bill, as written, does--and it hasn't been \nwidely noted, and the Senator mentioned this a while ago--it would \ntransform the way we produce electricity in the United States. If we \nreally want carbon-free air, if we want to meet the Kyoto standards, \nstop the global warming that people are concerned about, you are not \ngoing to do it by building tens of thousands of windmills and spending \n$11 billion on solar panels.\n  Here is how you will do it: conservation and efficiency. The \nDomenici-Bingaman bill that is here already would save us from building \n45 500-megawatt gas plants just because of appliance standards. The \nhybrid car incentives coming from the Finance Committee will encourage \nthe buying of 300,000 hybrid cars, resulting in more efficiency, less \ncarbon in the air, and encouraging our auto industry to transform, as \nmany of us hope they will do. If we do that, we should spend another \n$750 million, not on windmills, but on giving tax incentives to auto \nplants in the United States that retool to be able to produce hybrid \ncars. If we give incentives to buy those cars, we want them to be built \nin Tennessee, Michigan, or elsewhere in this country, not in Yokohama. \nIf we spend a new $750 million for that purpose, which is a \nrecommendation of the National Commission on Energy Policy, it will \nhelp to create 39,000 new automobile jobs in the United States.\n  Senator Feinstein and Senator Snowe have a proposal for energy-\nefficient appliances and buildings. The cost, over 5 years, is $2 \nbillion. Some of that is in the legislation. But more could be spent on \nit to great effect. Coal gasification powerplants. We have talked about \nnuclear, so I will go to nuclear; $2 billion for deployment of\n\n[[Page S6678]]\n\nadvanced nuclear power plants. Mr. President, if we want carbon-free \nair, we know how to get it. We get it from nuclear power. Twenty \npercent of all of our electricity in this massive economy of ours that \nuses 25 percent of the energy in the world is from nuclear power today.\n  So why would we subsidize windmills and solar panels instead of \nspending $2 billion on advanced nuclear power plants? France does it. \nThey are 80 percent nuclear. Japan has one new nuclear plant a year. We \nhave not started one since the 1970s, although we have dozens of Navy \nships docking at our ports around the country with nuclear reactors \nthat have never had a problem. So $2 billion for advanced deployment of \nnuclear power.\n  Right behind that, waiting in line--and I know both Senators from New \nMexico agree with this--is coal gasification in powerplants, along with \ncarbon recapture and sequestration technologies. If this could work, \nthis would back up nuclear power and produce the large amounts of low-\ncarbon or carbon-free energy that not only we need in the United States \nbut that the world needs. If we do it here, they will do it there. If \nwe don't do it, they will not, and they will produce so much pollution \nand junk in the air that it won't matter what we do because the air \nwill blow around on top of us.\n  I mentioned solar energy development. I think there should be a \nsubstantial increase for solar energy development. The production tax \ncredit, since 1992, has done nothing for solar power. It virtually all \ngoes to wind. But an appropriate amount of money would be, over 5 \nyears, $380 million. That is even more than the Finance Committee \nrecommended. Under the RPS, we are talking about $11 billion collected \nfrom increased rates and spent to produce one-fifth of 1 percent of the \nelectricity we need in 2025.\n  Mr. President, I want low-carbon air. I want to transform the way we \nproduce electricity. But I also want lower electric rates. The \nTennessee Valley Authority just raised our rates 7 percent. That is a \nhigh rate increase. That means there are some manufacturing plants in \nTennessee that are going to think twice about whether the jobs stay \nhere or the jobs go somewhere else. If we start putting new taxes and \nnew rate increases on homeowners and manufacturing plants in Tennessee \nand around this country in order to build tens of thousands of \nwindmills and this extent of solar power, we will not be taking the \nwisest course.\n  I suggest we support the bill as it is written, and to the extent we \nhave dollars, let's spend it on hybrid vehicles, auto jobs, energy \nefficiency, coal gasification, modest, reasonable solar energy, carbon \nrecapture research, advanced nuclear, and cogeneration projects.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I received notice that our Republican \nleader wishes to speak, he said, at 11:15.\n  I want to make an observation and see if the Senator from Tennessee \nwill answer it.\n  The Senator from Tennessee went through all these other ways we could \ngo about cleaning up our air and reducing the carbon emissions. What \nstrikes me is, let's assume we are going to do all those things, \nbecause I think we are. I remind the Senator, however, that the $2 \nbillion in there on nuclear--we should all understand, we can produce \nnuclear powerplants before that ever happens. That is fourth \ngeneration. That is getting ready for hydrogen. That is not charged to \nthis, nor is it going to apply.\n  Nonetheless, take all the rest. Let's assume we are doing them. The \ninteresting thing about this amendment is, if we were doing them and \nsaving carbon emissions, we do not get any credit for that; am I right? \nWe still are going to have this 10-percent mandate for renewables. So \nlet's assume a State 4 or 5 years from now opens a nuclear powerplant. \nThat is as clean as wind, is it not? It is terrific from the standpoint \nof emissions, but we still have to do the 10 percent, right, the way \nthis approach is; is that correct?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And in every respect, a State will not get any credit \nfor the fact they are doing all these things that move in the direction \nwe want because here sits this mandate that says you do this anyway.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think that is not right, as I look at it. That \nconfounds me as to why that would be the case. We are urging they do \nthe others, but in some cases, they are going to be mandated to spend \nthis rather extraordinary amount. Once the credit is gone, \nincidentally, this kind of energy is going to be pretty expensive \nstuff.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That is true. In the case of wind power, it was \nsuggested to the Senators in the early nineties, give us a wind power \nproduction credit for a few years and then it goes away. If it goes \naway and it costs more, the ratepayers will end up paying for that \nhigher cost power.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The mandate does not go away. Somebody has to produce \nit and it has to be charged.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom New York and I be allowed to enter into a colloquy and that the \ntime not be charged against the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Frist and Mrs. Clinton pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1262 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will take a very few minutes to \nrespond to some of the points that the Senator from Tennessee was \nmaking. We are back on the amendment that I have offered for purposes \nof debate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Obama be added as a cosponsor to \nthe Bingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The first point I would make, in response to the \ncomments of the Senator and my colleague from Tennessee, who has \ncontributed greatly to the development of this overall Energy bill and \nwhose contribution has been very substantial and I very much respect \nhis views, obviously we are in disagreement on this issue, and I will \nexplain some of the reasons why.\n  First, much of what he said related to big windmills and the fact \nthat this, in his view, is essentially a program that would cause the \nestablishment of more big windmills. He pointed out the reasons why \nthat was unwise.\n  This amendment is technology neutral. We have been very specific \nabout this. We have said that qualifying renewables include wind, \nsolar, ocean, geothermal, biomass, landfill gas, and incremental hydro \npower. We have tried to talk about all of the different renewables and \nmake it clear we are not specifying which of these renewables are used \nby particular utilities to meet this requirement.\n  It would be up to them, and it would be up to them based on how the \nvarious technologies develop. In fact, many utilities have chosen to \npursue wind generation because they have found that that was the least \ncostly way to produce energy from renewable sources. Clearly, advances \nare being made in solar power, advances are being made in biomass, and \nin various others of these technologies. The purpose of this \nlegislation is to accelerate that.\n  There is a chart which my colleague from Tennessee put up indicating \nthe other ways in which we are trying to deal with our energy needs in \nthis overall legislation and the other ways in which we are trying to \nreduce emissions into our atmosphere in this legislation. I agree with \nall of that. We do have provisions in this legislation to encourage the \ndevelopment of this gas-combined cycle technology and the use of that \nin our coal-fired powerplants.\n  I will put up the chart that we had earlier that shows the different \nsources for our electricity generation as they exist today and as the \nEnergy Information Agency would expect them to exist in the year 2025.\n  You can see that by far the most significant source of our energy, \nour electricity generation in this country, is\n\n[[Page S6679]]\n\ncoal. It has been in the past; it is today; it is going to be in the \nfuture. The only question is to what extent does that number, that top \nline, go up. And, more importantly, to what extent do we see pressure \nput on natural gas as a source for electricity generation in the \nfuture.\n  But we have provisions in this bill that try to encourage the use of \nIGCC technology. That is very much in the public interest and I very \nstrongly support that.\n  We also have provisions in here to encourage more use of nuclear \npower, more production of electricity from nuclear power. You can see \nthe nuclear line is largely flat coming from today, 2005, out to 2025. \nIt is my hope, just as it is the hope of Senator Domenici and I am sure \nof many on our committee, you will see that line go up somewhat, as \ncompanies are able to see the benefits that are provided in this \nlegislation and look at the cost comparisons, that they will choose to \nput more resources into production of energy from nuclear sources as \nwell. That is very much to be desired.\n  But to accomplish our goals, our overall goals for this country and \nour overall goals for our energy legislation, we need to pursue all \navailable resources. That is why I believe it is important we adopt \nthis amendment, to give that extra push for renewables. The chart from \nthe Energy Information Agency projects very little increase in this \nline down here, this blue line for renewables, without this renewable \nportfolio standard in place.\n  I saw the map of the United States the Senator from Tennessee put up, \nshowing the different States that are doing this. All of that is taken \ninto account by the Energy Information Agency. All of those State \nrenewable portfolio standards are taken into account in their \ndetermination that there will still be only very modest, if any, \nincreases in the use of renewables over the next 20 years.\n  What we are trying to do through this renewable portfolio standard is \nto increase the contribution from renewables somewhat. I am the first \nto admit we are not going to solve our energy problems with the use of \nrenewables alone. We have to depend on nuclear power. We have to depend \non clean coal technologies. We have to depend on progress in all these \nareas. But the effect of this amendment I have offered is to give some \nadditional impetus to use of renewables.\n  Let me make a couple of other points which I think bear mentioning at \nthe same time. I think the Senator from Tennessee suggested that--maybe \nnot the amendment that is currently before the Senate but an earlier \nversion, I believe he indicated, would say you don't get credit for \nwhat you do to meet your State standard in order to meet this national \nstandard. Let me be clear. That is not the case. I don't think that has \never been the case in any version I have seen of this amendment, but it \nis certainly not the case in what we are talking about here. In States \nwhere there is a renewable portfolio standard in place--and in almost \nmore cases that is a much more aggressive and demanding requirement \nthan anything we are contemplating here--clearly this standard would be \nmet without any difficulty. This is not an incremental standard above \nwhat the State requires. This is an effort to require some effort to be \nmade nationwide and hopefully get us to a nationwide market and demand \nfor these technologies that we are promoting as part of this.\n  The other big point the Senator from Tennessee was making is this $18 \nbillion cost. He is referring to this letter from the EIA. It does say \nthe cumulative cost to the electric power sector is about $18 billion.\n  Three bullet points down in that same summary page, it says the \ncumulative expenditure for natural gas and electricity by end-use \nsectors, taken together, decreases by $22.6 billion.\n  What it is saying is the effect would be to decrease what they spend \non natural gas and electricity by $22.6 billion at the same time there \nis the $18 billion to be shifted over in this area. So clearly the \nwhole idea behind this legislation is that the people who are \nproducing, the companies that are generating electricity in this \ncountry, will do less of that through use of natural gas, will invest \nless in natural gas production facilities, or generating facilities, \nand will invest more in these other areas. That is the purpose of it. \nWe believe that is a good public purpose, a good purpose for us to be \npromoting in this legislation.\n  The final point the Senator was making is this is an unnecessary cost \nto consumers. That is not what I understand the EIA to be saying. The \nEnergy Information Agency says, in a quote out of their letter to me \ndated the 15th of June:\n\n       Cumulative residential expenditures on electricity from \n     2005 to 2025 are $2.7 billion lower, while cumulative \n     residential expenditures on natural gas are reduced by $2.9 \n     billion.\n\n  That is if this amendment is adopted. So the cumulative expenditures \nfor natural gas and electricity by all end users, taken together, will \ndecrease by $22.6 billion. It is saying, for this 20-year period we are \ntalking about, if we adopt this amendment we will be saving consumers. \nThey, the people who are producing the electricity the consumers are \nbuying, will, in fact, be shifting resources to produce some additional \nincrement of that electricity from these renewable sources rather than \nfrom natural gas plants as they otherwise would. But clearly there is a \nsavings here for the consumer, according to the Energy Information \nAgency, and I think that is clearly to be desired and something we all \nare hoping will result from this legislation.\n  Before I yield the floor, let me ask unanimous consent that Senator \nClinton be added as a cosponsor. She is available to speak.\n  Let me ask Senator Domenici, did you want to go back to your side to \nspeak now, or Senator Clinton would like to speak on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator will be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me ask, Senator Clinton, are you on some kind of \ntime-sensitive schedule? If you are, I will let you go. How long does \nthe Senator wish to speak?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. For 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. We will yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I want to speak strongly in favor of \nSenator Bingaman's renewable portfolio standard amendment. This is a \ngoal-setting amendment that gives us direction and impetus to do what \nwe should be doing. Requiring us to produce 10 percent of our \nelectricity from renewable energy sources in 15 years is something I \nthink is necessary so we begin to change how we do business, how we \nconserve, what we invest in. This is a major step in the right \ndirection. Although the critics have raised some alarms about this \namendment, numerous studies have demonstrated the efficiency and \nsavings that would flow from the adoption of this amendment.\n  Senator Bingaman has spoken at great length about some of these \nstudies. The recent analysis conducted by the Energy Information \nAgency, provided some very strong support for what Senator Bingaman has \nproposed. In fact, it is the administration's analysis that shows if we \npassed this national 10-percent renewable portfolio standard with a \n2020 deadline on it, we would save residential customers over $5 \nbillion, we would lower natural gas prices by 6.8 percent, and that \nwould have enormous benefits for our chemical, pharmaceutical, and \nother industries that rely on natural gas. It would also reduce \nelectric utility carbon dioxide emissions by 7.5 percent.\n  This does not even take into account all of the benefits that I \nbelieve would flow from this amendment. When it comes to renewables, we \nin the United States need to catch up. We are behind in this effort \ncompared to other countries and we need to spur innovation and \ncreativity.\n  I also support Senator Cantwell's amendment. This improves on a \nprovision in the bill that would require the President to develop a \nplan to save 1 million barrels of oil per day by 2015. That is a \nlaudable provision. Actually it was approved by the Senate 99 to 1, 2 \nyears ago. It is unfortunate the President opposes this provision and \nhas even threatened to veto the Energy bill over it. At a time when oil \nand gas prices are high, at a time when national security interests \nclearly dictate that we reduce our dependence on foreign oil, rather \nthan rejecting this provision, we need to go further than we\n\n[[Page S6680]]\n\nwent with the 99-to-1 vote, and that is exactly what the Cantwell \namendment does. It establishes an ambitious goal of reducing by 40 \npercent the amount of oil the United States is projected to import in \n2025.\n  Finally, we are a can-do nation. We can do this. This is something we \nshould be committed to do. These are goals. These are not enforceable \nstandards, but they spur us, they raise our aspirations, they help us \nto think more clearly about what we need to do to protect our Nation's \neconomy and security.\n  I hope the President will relinquish his veto threat and that we will \nhave strong bipartisan support on both the Cantwell and Bingaman \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 58 minutes on the majority side \nand 50 minutes on the minority side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want the Senate to know on our side we do not intend \nto use as much time as we have, unless other Senators want to speak. \nSenator Alexander certainly wants some additional time.\n\n  Senator Bingaman, I don't know if your side needs the whole amount. \nWe are trying to get a unanimous consent agreement shortly.\n  As the Senator from New York leaves the floor, let me say right at \nthe offset, the Bingaman amendment is not a goal. If it were a goal, \nthat would be something different. It is a mandate. There is a very big \ndifference between a goal and a mandate. This says exactly what each \nState is compelled to do with reference to the kinds of energies that \nare described. When you boil it all down, it means ``wind'' for the \ntime being. It means each State has to have it. And if they do not, \nthey have to pay money to the Secretary of Energy or they have to buy \nwind-generated electricity from some other State.\n  While I am on that subject, I would like to put up one little chart. \nI would like to show this to the Senate. If you look at this map, you \ncan see the white area, in particular the white area down here in the \nSoutheast. The interesting thing is that the white area does not have \nany source of wind to meet this standard.\n  It is nice if you are not one of those States. But if you are one of \nthem, it is not very nice because you are sort of wind poor. The other \nStates are wind rich. Under this bill, the States that do not have that \nhave to pay money, either to the States that do produce it for their \nwind energy or they have to pay money to the Secretary of Energy who \nuses that for research and technology development in the area of \nrenewables and the like.\n  We have been on the floor many times when we spoke about issues on \ncoal. I remember when I was a very young Senator, we had a big debate \nin the Senate about mandating a certain kind of coal be used. The \nSenate got very excited and hot about it because we were sort of \ndrawing a line between the States and creating a terrible kind of chasm \nbetween the States, saying these States are going to be the ``have'' \nStates, these States are going to be the ``have not'' States.\n  I admit that was a very serious problem, for the clean coal was not \ngoing to be used, in spite of it being clean, and the dirty coal was \ngoing to be used because we were mandating it. So it was in some ways \nsimilar, but it would have been billions upon billions of dollars in \nthe development of resources, so it truly would have divided the \ncountry.\n  This divides us in another way, in a way that I think is not \nnecessary. Let me say from the outset, for those who do not think the \nBingaman amendment is the right way to go, they are not coming to the \nfloor in harmony, en masse, saying we do not like wind energy.\n  Some may, but there are many who think wind energy ought to be \ndeveloped and we ought to push the frontiers of technology. But no one \nshould think that if we do not adopt the Bingaman amendment, we have a \nbill that is not going to push the development of renewables. The bill \nis laden with incentives to produce renewable energy.\n  As a matter of fact, the tax-writing committee that will bring their \nbill here shortly, I understand almost all of their allocation of tax \nreductions, the loss of tax revenues by way of credits or the like, \nalmost all of it will be renewable. As a matter of fact, the very major \ntax credit that, I might say, is the principal reason wind is being \ndeveloped at all is extended for 2 years at a very large cost to the \ntaxpayers--maybe $3 billion or thereabouts.\n  We are pursuing the development of renewable energy led by wind, \nwhich at this point is the principal one unless we consider hydro, and \nI don't think we are considering hydro in any of this debate. It \nexists, and it has nothing to do with what we are talking about.\n  What I am suggesting, if the amendment does not pass, we have not \nabandoned an American approach to pursuing the technology called \nrenewables led by wind in these United States. What we are trying to \nsay is that one shoe should not fit every State. States that can't do \nthis because of the unfortunate situation of nature--they do not have \nthe wherewithal to produce it, or if they had to produce it, they would \nproduce it in places they would not want to produce it because it would \nnot be consistent with another use of that land that is paramount and \nhas a priority to the development of windmills, such as right down the \nmiddle of a national park.\n  Having said that, another point was made by my distinguished friend \nfrom New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, who has been a tremendous partner in \nthis bill. He knows on this issue we do not agree, but he understands \nthat on 99 percent of this bill, we will fight for it and win and have \nan energy bill for the first time that has a lot of good, solid things \nfor the country. My good friend Senator Bingaman said that other States \nalready have these goals. They set their own requirements--not goals, \ntheir own requirements. He used the word that they have done so \n``aggressively.''\n  I remind the Senator, and I think I am correct, that those States do \nnot use the same formula for what will make up their portfolio of \nrenewables. I submit, if the Senator would like to amend his amendment \nand allow the myriad kinds of energy production used in other States to \nmeet their current goals or current mandates, that would be a good \nbill.\n  For instance, the State of Pennsylvania has a very aggressive plan. \nIf you think ``aggressive'' means they have a very aggressive wind \nprogram that would meet the mandates of this amendment, that is not \ntrue. They are using other technologies consistent with their \nresources, many of which are related to products related to coal. \nWhatever remains after they use coal is reused, and they produce a \nclean source of energy that counts toward their goal.\n  We think nuclear powerplants will be built in the future. It seems it \nwould be appropriate that a State might be given credit for that. We \nbelieve there will be very formidable advances in converting coal not \nonly into clean coal but into coal that has the carbon removed that \nwill, indeed, qualify for being as good for cleaning up with reference \nto the gases we are worried about in global warming as solar. It may \nend up, and from what I understand, even though it is new technology, \nit might be cheaper than what we think wind energy will be. It seems to \nme that is a more sensible approach. Provide a variety, a mix that \nwould make up this 10 percent.\n  But we should not be causing certain States to pay a very big tax \nbecause they cannot produce solar energy. No one calls it a tax, but \nwhen someone takes funds out of their consumers' pockets and gives them \nto some other State, to some other utility in another State, if it \nlooks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck. It seems to me \nthat the easiest way to talk about this is that it is a tax. I don't \nthink, when we look at all of that, this is the best way to do it.\n  I don't say this in any way to belittle those who have pursued this \nwith vigor, who think it is a very good approach. Senator Bingaman \nmakes valid arguments. The Senator from Tennessee, particularly in his \nway of getting to the bottom of things and articulating eloquently \nabout what he has learned, has contributed immensely to learning just \nwhat this is all about. As a consequence, I am not at all sure as many \npeople as thought this is a wonderful idea 6 months ago,\n\n[[Page S6681]]\n\nif they listen and understand, I am not so sure they would think this \nparticular way to get renewables, led by a renewable called wind, would \nbe the best way to go. I compliment him for that. I am not at all sure \nenough people are listening if we judge by the attendance in the \nSenate--and I don't think the people in America should do that. \nSenators are listening even though they are not here. If we judge on \nthat, of course we will not change any minds.\n\n  As I see it, there is good reason to say: Look, we are doing enough \nright now with this enormous credit. Frankly, I will add to the credit, \nI will say something that is beyond dispute. We have asked those who \ngauge and judge, How much wind energy can you produce? What is the \nmaximum that the fabricators of these products, these things you \ndescribe, Senator, that someone is building, that we will pay for--\nsomeone is making a lot of money on them right now because of the \nsubsidy. How much could we produce per year for the next 2 or 3 years? \nThe answer has come: You can't produce any more than the tax credit \nwill cause you to produce.\n  Let me put it another way: This mandate has nothing to do with \nmaximizing the production of wind so long as there is a credit. The \ncredit is going to produce it. In a sense, why do you need both? One \nwould say because of the long-term nature of a mandate versus we have 2 \nyears, maybe 3 years of credits. But in America, the way we ought to \nlook at this, you subsidize the technology so everyone involved can get \nwith it and apply this ingenuity called America and do it better. This \nvery large subsidy ought to surely get us in position where we can \nproduce this wind--if that is what we want to do--that we can produce \nit cheaper, so the incentive is relevant to the next 8 or 10 years in \nthat respect.\n  We ought to do better. To some extent, having the 10 percent out \nthere and having the credit out there is a disincentive to maximizing \ninnovation. What is the urgency? How are we sensitizing the marketplace \nto produce more efficient wind? When you give a tax credit and put a \nmandate on it, it seems to me whoever is doing it can sit around and \nsay: We have a nice thing going, we do not need to change, just keep \non.\n  I thought the idea was to move technology. It could be you are moving \nother technology besides wind. But there is a long way to go before you \nget some of that solar onboard. I don't think this will make that move \nin the next 10 years unless there is a big breakthrough that I don't \nbelieve will be caused by this mandate.\n  I have some other issues I was going to discuss. I will make a point \nabout States that are already doing something. I call to mind \nPennsylvania. One would not think of Pennsylvania as being a State with \na lot of wind, producing wind energy, yet they are in red on my chart. \nThat means they have to borrow from my friend, Senator Bingaman, an \naggressive policy on renewables. But it is not predicated upon the same \nrequirements of this bill. It is not a huge 10-percent wind component. \nIt is made up of other things.\n  If we look at each of these States in red and ask which States are \nmeeting this goal in an aggressive manner, and then come to the Senate \nfloor and say how each State is doing it, and then say, Why don't we \nlet any State that wants to do it in all of these ways and meet it--all \nwe have said is if the State is doing it, they get credit. That is what \nthe sponsor says. But we have not said if they do it differently than \nthis in the future, they get credit, as I understand it.\n  If we have another red State added up here--and I don't think the red \nand the blue of the last election has anything to do with this map; we \ndon't have blue up there; we have red and white--but if we added more \nreds before we had this bill, it would not be all wind or renewables as \nprescribed by this bill. It would be whatever they find meets their \ntest of renewable energy. It seems to me that kind of flexibility would \nbe much better.\n  What we have is an attempt to saddle the industry and consumers with \na hefty price tag to support a limited set of renewable resources.\n  According to the Department of Energy, only 2.2 percent of total U.S. \nelectricity generation in 2003 was comprised of non-hydro renewable \nenergy sources such as geothermal, photovoltaic, solar thermal, \nbiomass, municipal solid waste and wind plants. This is so despite \nyears of government subsidies and programs to encourage renewable \nenergy.\n  Of this 2.2 percent total, 44 percent came from biomass generation \n(mostly at industrial facilities), 26 percent came from municipal solid \nwaste, 16 percent from geothermal waste, 13 percent from wind, and 1 \npercent from solar technologies.\n  The RPS focuses on that 2.2 percent of our generation, mandates an \nincrease to 10 percent and essentially imposes a 1.5 cent per kilowatt \nhour tax on an increasing percentage of each year's retail sales of \nelectricity.\n  If electric utilities do not build new renewable facilities and have \nto purchase all their credits from the federal government to meet the \nRPS mandate, the total cost of the inflation-adjusted RPS proposal is \nan estimated $190.8 billion in nominal dollars.\n  That is a worst case scenario estimation, but we must consider that \nrisk when we are deciding whether this gamble on renewable resource \nmandate is the right thing to do. This proposal is a gamble not worth \ntaking.\n  Mandating a Federal Renewable Portfolio Standard is an ill advised \nmeans of achieving increased renewable resource use.\n  Any effort to legislate on renewable generation requires realistic \ntargets and due deference to States' rights to make decisions suited to \nbest serve their citizens' needs.\n  The proposed Federal Renewable Portfolio Standard fails to recognize \nthese principles.\n  States should definitely encourage their electric utilities to offer \nretail customers electricity from green energy to the extent it is \navailable and encourage investment in renewable development. Most \nimportantly, States should be afforded the right to develop their own \nRPS approaches without Federal interference.\n  States are best able to determine appropriate fuel types, societal \ncosts, consumer protections, and requirements to meet Federal and State \nenvironmental regulations.\n  Today, 19 States and the District of Columbia have their own RPS \nprograms. Others should be afforded the same right to develop an RPS \nwithout Federal interference.\n  The proposed RPS amendment penalizes those States that have already \nacted to establish a renewable program by requiring them to replace \ntheir State program with a new Federal program.\n  This amendment rewards certain regions at the expense of others. \nSolar has limited application east of the Mississippi, wind almost no \napplication in the southeast, and virtually all geothermal is located \nin the West.\n  We cannot ignore the reality that utilities in some regions cannot \nmeet a renewable mandate because they are not blessed with ample \nrenewable resources.\n  To ignore this would be to require these to buy credits, forcing many \nconsumers to pay for power they never receive, and would result in \nmassive interregional cash transfers.\n  Utilities that do not have access to new renewable assets will wind \nup paying 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour and receive no power--their \ncustomers will pay a tax with no benefit and this could have \nsignificant costs to establishing competitive markets and to low income \nconsumers where such markets do not exist.\n  Each State should decide for itself and its own residents the optimal \nmix of renewable and alternative energy sources.\n  I certainly advocate state policy makers coordinating choices to \nmaximize regional efficiencies, but I do not support instituting a one-\nsize-fits-all national plan.\n  States have historically had control over the fuel choices and \nresource development decisions. Past federal endeavors to meddle in \nfuel choice mandates have resulted in disasters.\n  Any effort to legislate on Renewable Portfolio Standards requires due \ndeference to States' rights to make decisions suited to best serve \ntheir citizens' needs. This amendment fails to provide that deference.\n\n[[Page S6682]]\n\n  Another problem with this RPS amendment is that it mandates an \narbitrary quota for some renewable energy resources without any \njustification as to why only a limited set of renewable resources are \nincluded as eligible.\n  At a hearing held by the Energy Committee in March 2005, Dr. Nogee \nwith the Union of Concerne Scientists was asked a Question about the \neffect an RPM on production from wind power. He explained that \\2/3\\ of \nthe RPS requirements would likely be met by new wind generation. \nMandating mostly wind power when wind power is not mostly available \naround the country is poor public policy.\n\n  Some claim that an RPS would help address emission problems. I don't \nthink that the goal of this RPS amendment is to help lower emissions at \nall.\n  If the RPS was truly a device to help lower emissions, why shouldn't \ncompanies receive credits for environmental improvement expenditures, \nlike pollution control equipment. The proposed amendment does not \ninclude such credit.\n  If cleaner energy was truly the goal of the RPS amendment, why isn't \ncoal gasification technology or nuclear power credited?\n  The Energy Information Administration has noted that an RPS will \n``have little impact on sulfur dioxide, SO2 or nitrogen \noxide, NO2, emission levels.''\n  If the goal of the RPS was to lower emissions, then a broader array \nof our renewable technologies--particularly clean coal and nuclear--\nshould have been included in the category of resources.\n  For similar reasons, I don't think that the RPS can be legitimately \njustified as a means to help diversify our fuel needs or reduce \ndependence on foreign resources. If that were the case, a greater \ndiversity of renewable resources should been included in the category \nof resources.\n  More effective and efficient solutions to this problem are available. \nIn response to concerns with over dependence on foreign resources, we \nshould focus our efforts on:\n  Nuclear power--which is one of our cleanest fuel resources;\n  Oil and natural gas from Alaska and other regions of the United \nStates;\n  Coal of which we have abundant reserves; and\n  New hydroelectric generation--which have zero emissions.\n  If renewable resources are to become a greater contributor to our \npower sector, then competitive market forces should be allowed to \noperate. In order to facilitate the necessary competition, transmission \nmust be available.\n  One of the barriers to entry for renewable development is the lack of \ntransmission capacity to transmit electricity generated from remote \nareas long distances.\n  Before mandating fuel choice, we need to address the real need for \nimproved transmission capacity. A number of the electricity title's \nprovisions are directed at accomplishing this goal.\n  Renewable energy should be encouraged in a reasonable, effective \nmanner. To that end, there are already extensive Federal and State \nsubsidies in place as well as tax credits that I support.\n  We all support renewables--what we should not support is Federal \ncommand and control of the market in the disguise of help for \nrenewables. Would Senator Craig desire to speak on this issue before we \nvote?\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to speak.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to Senator Craig to manage time, and then when \nhe leaves, he will give that to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Jeffords.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent to deliver my remarks from my \nseat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I speak on Senator Bingaman's \namendment to set a national goal to obtain 10 percent of our Nation's \nelectricity from renewable resources. I support this idea. In fact, I \nhave filed an amendment to go one step further--requiring 20 percent \nrenewables by the year 2020.\n  America needs a national commitment to encourage clean domestic \nsources of renewable energy. I have been in the Congress for 30 years. \nI have seen the Nation make tremendous advances in areas ranging from \nmedicine to the Internet. I have even witnessed the Red Sox win the \nWorld Series. Yet the Nation literally remains dependent on many of the \nsame powerplants that operated when I first was elected to Congress in \n1974.\n  When I think of the next 30 years, I envision an America where clean \ndomestic renewable energy sources are an integral part of our Nation's \nelectricity generation. As the ranking member of the Senate Committee \non Environment and Public Works, obtaining 10 percent of our country's \nelectricity from a renewable energy represents the modest end of what \nwe could achieve. Let me offer three reasons I believe the Nation's \ncommitment to encourage renewable power is needed.\n  First, renewable power would help consumers by reducing electricity \nprices. According to data provided by the Bush administration's Energy \nDepartment, a renewables requirement would lower consumer energy costs \nby the year 2020.\n  The second reason is the benefit to public health and the \nenvironment. A renewables requirement would dramatically reduce carbon \nemissions from powerplants. It would significantly also reduce \nemissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides. These pollutants contaminate \nour water, cause smog and acid rain, and contribute to respiratory \nillnesses.\n  Third, a renewable electricity standard would enhance our energy \nindependence and our national security by diversifying our energy \nsupply. As we increase our reliance on natural gas, much of the demand \nmay have to be met by liquefied natural gas shipped to the United \nStates from other countries. It is unthinkable that we should sink to a \ngreater reliance on foreign fuel imports when we have abundant, \ninexhaustible renewable energy here.\n  Currently, renewable energy accounts for a little over 2 percent of \nU.S. electricity generation. But the United States has the technical \ncapacity to generate 4.5 times its current electricity needs from \nrenewable energy resources. The potential is there, but we have to give \nit the assistance of market incentives, as we have traditionally done \nfor our more established fuel sources.\n  I urge my colleagues to again demonstrate our strong commitment to \nrenewables and support the Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, in speaking to the Bingaman amendment, I believe \nrenewable energy resources are an important part of our energy mix. I \ndo not think any of us could argue they are not. I also believe all \nconsumers should have the opportunity to purchase green power if they \nso choose.\n  But I must tell you, I strongly oppose including a nationwide \nmandatory renewable portfolio standard in this Energy bill. Adoption of \nthis amendment, in my opinion, would increase consumer electrical bills \nat a time when we are trying to do just the opposite by the very \nlegislation that is on the floor. This would have a particularly \nnegative consequence for those who can least afford it, such as the \nworking poor and the elderly living on fixed incomes.\n  For many regions of the country not blessed with renewable energy \nwealth, or resources, this RPS mandate would essentially result in a \nhuge wealth transfer payment from consumers to the Federal Government \nor to renewable energy generators located in other areas of the \ncountry. In essence, if you say to all States, you have to meet this \nstandard, and you by your physical presence on the globe cannot, you \nare not blessed with wind--and later on I will show this is dominantly \nfor that purpose--then you will pay the price.\n  Adoption of this amendment would conflict with the RPS programs that \nhave already been adopted in the way that we like good energy policy to \nevolve; that is, within the State and within the State structure. \nTwenty States already have developed renewable resource policies and \nimplemented\n\n[[Page S6683]]\n\ntimetables. This amendment ignores those States' programs; in other \nwords, it says: Oh, well, if it fits there, it fits everywhere.\n  We have simply known in our country for a long time that energy has a \nState, if not regional, character. While there is some national value \nin tying it all together, the regional character of our energy \nproduction is still very real today and my guess is will be tomorrow.\n  The national Energy Information Administration estimates that wind \nenergy would benefit most by the RPS mandate. In an analysis performed \nin 2003, EIA projected that wind energy would provide 141 billion \nkilowatt hours of generation by 2020. EIA's cost estimates for an RPS \nare heavily dependent on wind energy being built.\n  I would point out that a wind resource map prepared by the National \nRenewable Energy Laboratory graphically demonstrates that the entire \nsoutheastern region of the country has virtually no wind potential. \nLarge areas of the upper Midwest have marginal wind potential, unless \nthose States plan to build wind farms in the Great Lakes.\n  EIA's wind energy projection seems wildly, even naively, optimistic \nto me. Why? Because a wind turbine is just as vulnerable as any other \nenergy facility to a localized disease in our country called \n``NIMBYISM,'' or ``Not In My Back Yard'' syndrome.\n  And the fewer wind projects that are built, the more the RPS mandate \nends up being just a new Federal energy tax that consumers will pay on \ntraditional sources of energy, such as nuclear, coal, and natural gas.\n  Dollars will just be transferred from consumers' pockets to the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy to buy renewable energy credits so utilities can \nmeet these RPS standards.\n\n  Even self-proclaimed environmentalists fall victim to NIMBYISM when \nthe plans call for wind turbines to be built in their back yard. \nApparently, wind turbines are fine in theory as long as the alleged \nproponents cannot see them.\n  Let's look at what has really happened when wind developers announced \nplans to build wind energy facilities.\n  Nantucket Sound: A wind energy firm announced plans to install 130 \nwind turbines, spaced one-third to one-half mile apart, more than 6 \nmiles off the coast of Hyannis in Nantucket Sound. This project has \nbeen in the works for several years. The Massachusetts energy \nfacilities siting board, in May, finally approved construction of two \n18-mile transmission cables that would link the wind turbines to the \nshore.\n  The wind farms would provide Cape Codders with roughly 75 percent of \ntheir energy and New England with about 1.8 percent of its total energy \nneeds. The power would come without air emissions or using a single \nbarrel of Middle East oil.\n  You would think, with that kind of glowing announcement, the \nenvironmentalists would strongly support that approach. The answer is \nquite obvious--they do not. Many of them are up in arms organizing and \nmoving against this very proposed idea. A coalition has been formed \nwaging very expensive campaigns to stop the wind farm project. They are \ntalking about it as if it were an ``Exxon Valdez'' crisis or disaster \nbecause of what it would do to the character of Nantucket Sound. ``Not \nin my back yard.''\n  Well, then, let's go to Vermont. A possible Vermont wind farm located \non the mountaintops around East Haven is drawing local opposition. A \n``large, diverse, well-organized citizens group'' is fighting the \nproject and doesn't believe that wind energy has a place in Vermont. \nWell, wait a moment. Vermont is one of the most environmentally pure \nStates in the Nation, by their own admission. And yet wind is supposed \nto be the most environmentally benign form of energy production. The \n``Montpelier Times'' reported on the East Haven wind farm's future. \nVermonters are saying it loudly and saying it clearly: Wind turbines \nhave no place in Vermont.\n  Well, let's go to Maine. How about Maine? A 29-turbine wind energy \nproject proposed for western Maine is being strongly opposed, again, by \nthe environmental community of Maine. They are saying it will destroy \nthe vistas of the Appalachian Trail. The project would be built 10 \nmiles away from it. It is going to take a few roads and power lines. \nYou have to have a road to get the turbine in place, and you have to \nhave a power line to get the power away from the turbine. No, no. The \npark manager of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail wrote to a Maine \nnewspaper that the project ``would be an `in your face' facility for \nlong stretches of the Appalachian Trail. . . .''\n  The debate goes on. But in Maine they are saying, as they said in \nMassachusetts and as they said in Vermont: Not in my back yard.\n  Well, let's go to Virginia, then. How about Highland County in \nVirginia? They are strongly opposing a wind turbine project 3 years \nafter it was proposed. The project proposes construction of 18 to 20 \nwind turbines. More than 500 people attended a May hearing on the \nproject. About two-thirds of the Highland County residents signed a \npetition against the project.\n  Again, that dreaded disease of NIMBYISM has struck in the heart of \nVirginia. ``Not in my back yard. No. Somewhere else. Not in my back \nyard.''\n  But what does the amendment do? It says that it better be in \neverybody's back yard or you are going to get taxed for it so it can be \nbuilt somewhere else.\n  In Kansas, landowners and environmental groups bitterly fought \nconstruction of a wind farm. This is in the Flint Hills region of \nKansas. The area is the largest surviving vestige of the tall prairie \ngrass. I did not know that wind turbines would hurt prairie grass, but \nit does. Of course, the tall-grass prairies out there, without \nquestion, are a beautiful piece of nature. I do not deny that, as no \none should.\n  Work began on the $190-million project in May of 2005, despite \nongoing opposition. An environmental activist said:\n\n       It's not a time for celebration, but a time for folks to \n     redouble their efforts to protect the remaining Flint Hills.\n\n  And so on goes the article from the ``Kansas City Star.''\n  What is the conclusion one can draw from the opposition that is now \nmounting against those very large turbines? The Senator from Tennessee \nhas been so clear in explaining what these turbines are all about. For \nthose of you who do not understand the visualness of the large German \nturbine, step outside, walk out to First Street, and look back at the \nCapitol building. Look at the top of the Statue of Freedom, and then \nvisually come all the way down to ground level. That is about tip to \ntip on the large turbines. That is just about how big they are, about \n300 feet tip to tip. So they have high visibility because you have to \nget them up above the ground, on a large tower, and fit them into the \nairstream.\n  That is why people are reacting today. Yet we know that this RPS \nstandard is dominantly a wind standard. That is how you get there--\nbecause we are not going to build any more large power dams in Idaho. \nSome would even deny that hydro is a renewable resource. We know we are \nnot going to do much more geothermal because not all States are blessed \nwith the dynamics of geothermal energy. My State has a little of that. \nDominantly, what we are talking about is wind, and some photovoltaic, \nalthough wind is by far more advanced in its engineering and its \ndevelopment.\n  As these stories and experiences make clear, wind energy facilities \nare no more immune to NIMBYISM and the syndrome and that lethal virus \nthan any other item when it comes to disturbing the character or the \nuniqueness of one's personal surroundings. It is how we believe. It is \nthe character of our own local community. So when many over the years \nhave said, ``Oh, but this is the most benign of all energy production, \nthis fits our environmental portfolio,'' we are finding it is quite the \nopposite. Really, nothing fits some people's portfolio when it comes to \nenergy production.\n  If wind farms are OK as long as they are built somewhere else, then \nwhere are the right places? Where are all these wind turbines going to \ngo to be built that EIA assumes are going to be built under an RPS \nmandate? Will wind turbines be built in remote areas of the country \nwithout enough transmission capacity to move the power to where the \nconsumer is? More than likely. Texas has a State RPS program, and a lot \nof wind capacity has been built in\n\n[[Page S6684]]\n\nthat State. Unfortunately, about 1,000 megawatts of wind capacity was \nbuilt in west Texas on the wrong side of a transmission constraint. Got \nthe turbines, can produce the power, can't transmit it to where the \npeople are. As a result, a lot of that wind power has been stranded.\n  The regional coordinator responsible for maintaining reliability of \nthe Texas transmission grid has stated that ``the sparse transmission \nsystem in the area has required almost daily limits on the output of \nthis [wind] resource to keep within transmission operating limits.''\n  Maybe we can build all of the wind power we need in North Dakota. It \nhas been called the Saudi Arabia of wind potential. I know the Senators \nof that State are strong supporters of this RPS mandate. Unfortunately, \naccording to the North American Electric Reliability Council, the \nreliability region in which North Dakota is located is monitoring 31 \ntransmission constraints already within the grid of that region.\n  The NERC 2005 Summer Assessment Report states that ``these \nconstraints can limit [power] imports and exports,'' and the story goes \non.\n  Now you can see why I suggest--and I hope many support the idea--that \nStates do it on their own as it fits their needs. But when we create a \nnational mandate on a renewable portfolio, and it is restrictive to the \ncharacter of the region or the capacity of the region, we are taxing \none area against another. That simply is not good public policy. I \ndon't think it ever takes us where we want to go.\n  What we crafted in our Energy and Natural Resources Committee and is \nnow on the Senate floor as a very important piece of legislation took \ninto consideration all of what we thought was important and right. It \nis a bipartisan piece of legislation. I hope the amendment that I have \nspoken to--and that others are speaking to--will be rejected by the \nSenate. It simply does not fit. It will not bring us where all of us \nwant to go, and that is to greater sources, cleaner sources, reliable \nsources, a mix of sources, in our energy production for this country. I \nhope my colleagues will reject the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nColorado, Mr. Salazar.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Bingaman's \namendment, the renewable energy standard or, as we have come to know \nit, the renewable portfolio standard. When we consider the imperative \nwith which we deal today in the Senate, we are talking about whether we \ncan get the United States to energy independence, whether we can set \nAmerica free from being held hostage to the importation of foreign oil \nfrom Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, from those places in the world where \nfor 30 years their stranglehold on America has continued to increase \nday by day with no end in sight. Energy independence at the end of the \nday is what we should have a bipartisan consensus on with respect to \nthis legislation.\n  The legislation which has been prepared by the Energy Committee came \ntogether in that kind of a bipartisan fashion, led by Senator Domenici \nand Senator Bingaman. It is a good piece of legislation that we can \nimprove on. I believe the RPS proposed by Senator Bingaman, which would \nrequire that 10 percent of our electric generation come from renewable \nsources by 2020, is a very modest goal for us to have. Indeed, the \nexperts around this country who talk to us about energy say if we have \nthe will and the courage, we could get up to a much higher amount than \n10 percent by 2020. They will tell you that we could get to 40 percent \nwithin probably 15 years, 20 years, to 2025. So the proposal that is \ncurrently being considered under this amendment is a modest proposal \nthat moves us in the right direction.\n  In my own State of Colorado, in this last election in 2004, there was \na proposal considered by the voters of our State. That proposal on an \nRPS was adopted by an overwhelming majority of the people of Colorado. \nWhat it requires us to do is to get to a point where we have produced \n15 percent of our energy by the year 2020. Fifteen percent of the \nenergy of Colorado will come from renewable sources by the year 2020. \nThe Bingaman amendment has a more modest goal at only 10 percent by \n2020.\n  If we can do that amount of renewable energy and meet that standard \nin my State by 2015, there is no doubt that we can do that with the \namendment that Senator Bingaman has offered. My view is that setting \nAmerica free from its overdependence on Saudi and Venezuelan oil is an \nimperative for our Nation. We must first conserve and increase \nefficiency, we must invest in renewable energy resources, we must \ndevelop new technologies, and we must pursue a balanced approach to \ndeveloping domestic energy. This bill does much of that. The amendment \nthat is currently on the floor of the Senate will help us move even \nfurther forward on those goals.\n  The oil savings provision that is already in the Senate Energy bill \nrepresents an important, if modest, goal for achieving some measure of \nindependence from foreign oil. But it is, frankly, not enough. I am \nencouraged by the strong show of support for the Cantwell amendment to \nraise that bar even further. I am proud to be a cosponsor of her \namendment. I believe we need to do more to achieve oil energy savings. \nBut the grave problems we face with respect to long-term domestic \nsupplies of oil are only part of the story. Even if domestic reserves \nof oil and other fossil fuels were limitless, the way we use \nhydrocarbons is jeopardizing our way of life. Sooner or later--and I \nprefer sooner--the people of our great country must embrace the energy \nchallenges of the 21st century and figure out how to produce clean and \nabundant energy from domestic sources that do not produce carbon or \nother greenhouse gases and that do not involve recurring problems of \nintermittent supply from politically unstable and overly hostile \nregions of the world.\n  Although we have been encouraging progress in the development of new \ncarbon-free technologies, there is still a lot of work for us to do. \nEarlier this year I visited the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in \nGolden, CO, and saw some of the cutting-edge technologies that the \nscientists there have advanced with respect to wind energy. I saw solar \nenergy collection cells that could double as 20-year roofing shingles \nand some of the most advanced solar technologies America has developed. \nToday we produce only about 8 percent of our electric power needs from \nrenewable energy sources, and most of that--approximately three-fourths \nof the total or 6 percent--comes from hydropower. By contrast, the two \nmost common sources of renewable--solar energy and wind power--account \nfor less than 1 percent of the total electric power.\n  Why do these sources of renewable energy account for such a small \nfraction of our electric energy needs, even after three decades of \neffort? There are at least three reasons to that question. The first is \ntechnological, and the second is economic. Both of those are closely \nrelated. As new energy technologies have advanced and solar panels and \nwind turbines have become more efficient, the relative cost of \ngenerating electric power from these energy sources has declined. \nDespite these impressive growth rates, however, and despite decades of \nresearch and development, these new energy technologies still suffer \nfrom serious engineering and economic drawbacks. Hydrogen fuel cells, \ndespite their promise, are still many times more expensive than an \ninternal combustion engine, and they will require several more decades \nof research and development to be competitive.\n  Likewise solar power, even after three decades of research and \ndevelopment, still costs five times as much as coal-fired power. \nMoreover, there are inherent limits in the quality of the energy these \nnew energy technologies can produce. They are intermittent sources of \nenergy, and they are not always located near a load source. Therefore, \ninvestment in transmission infrastructure and advances in control \ntechnologies are necessary before renewable energy sources can provide \na dominant share of the future energy mix.\n  The third reason that alternative energy sources claim such a tiny \nfraction of the energy market is political. We can change that today. \nAlternative sources of energy must compete in an energy market \ndominated by hydrocarbons and the industries that profit from those \nhydrocarbons. I introduced\n\n[[Page S6685]]\n\nlegislation that would begin to level the playing field and provide tax \nand other incentives for renewable energy sources. Today the Finance \nCommittee is marking up its tax title which will extend the production \ntax credit for certain renewable energy sources. Those incentives are \nextremely important for these relatively immature power industries.\n  Americans across the country recognize that renewable energy is an \nimportant part of our future, and they recognize that Government should \nbe doing more to promote this type of energy. I stand with Americans \nwho have that point of view.\n  On Tuesday, the White House released a statement that they do not \nsupport any kind of renewable portfolio standard. Here is one case \nwhere the President and I differ in a fundamental way. I believe the \nEnergy bill should be a way to move us away from foreign oil, away from \npollution and towards independence. I do not understand the reason the \nPresident is on the other side of this issue. The United States needs \nto take substantial steps forward with renewable energy. Colorado and \nall of the West is positioned to be America's innovation hub of the \nfuture. That is why the Federal standard of renewable energy \ndevelopment, which Senator Bingaman has proposed, is so important. \nInvesting in these nascent technologies now will significantly improve \nour ability to produce energy from renewable resources.\n  But it is just as important for the U.S. Congress to establish a \nFederal standard, an achievable goal of producing a minimum amount of \nelectric power from renewable energy sources, to establish uniform \nnational goals and an active credit trading market based on those \ngoals.\n  Other benefits of Senator Bingaman's renewable energy standard are \nthe following: A standard similar to Colorado's 10 percent by 2015 is \naggressive enough to stimulate the market and produce widespread and \nrural economic benefits. Secondly, a 10-percent RPS by 2020 will help \nreduce natural gas prices by reducing demand for electricity generated \nfrom natural gas powerplants. Studies show that consumers will save \n$9.1 billion on their natural gas bills and $4.4 billion on their \nelectricity bills between now and 2020, for a total savings of $13.5 \nbillion. And third, renewable energy technologies create more jobs, \nnearly twice as many as in traditional fossil fuel industries. The \nBingaman amendment would create about 58,000 new jobs a year for \nAmerica.\n  This kind of commonsense approach is something that the American \npeople expect of all of us.\n  Let me say two final things with respect to the RPS. First, it is \ngoing to create a problem for industry and for this Nation to have a \nhaphazard patch of RPSs around the States as they are adopted State by \nState. Therefore, it would make more sense to have a national standard \nso that industry can recognize it has to live up to one standard.\n  Finally, I suggest that to make renewable energy a significant part \nof our energy portfolio is something that makes common sense because of \nthe national economic security issues that we face, because of the \neconomic opportunities that it will bring to rural America, and because \nof the fact that we need to deal with this issue that is creating so \nmany problems for us around the world, especially with overreliance on \noil from the Middle East.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will defer to Senator Domenici if he \nwants to do something at this point.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. This has been cleared with both sides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 today, the Senate proceed to a \nvote in relation to the Cantwell amendment, which will be modified with \nthe changes that are at the desk, which we have seen. I further ask \nthat following that vote, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to \nthe Bingaman amendment; provided further, that no second-degree \namendments be in order to either amendment prior to the votes; and \nfinally, prior to the vote on the Cantwell amendment, there be 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  Before the Chair rules, I note that there is no provision for wrap-up \ndebate on the Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we would like 2 minutes equally divided \nprior to the vote on the Bingaman amendment. I guess there is no need \nfor 2 minutes before Cantwell because they have a period of time before \ntheirs, but 2 minutes equally divided would be appreciated.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask that that be added to the unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to Senator Dorgan \nfrom North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first I thank Senator Bingaman for this \namendment. I support the amendment. It advances, improves and \nstrengthens the underlying energy bill. I know that the term \n``renewable portfolio standard''--we have talked about that--is not \nnecessarily something everybody understands. Much of what we do in the \nSenate sounds like a foreign language. Renewable portfolio standard. I \nthink what this is is an American-made amendment, a home-grown energy \namendment. It says what we ought to do is take charge and decide we are \ngoing to move in a different direction.\n  My colleague said, and other colleagues have said, yes, we are going \nto continue to use coal, oil and natural gas, and I support that. We \nmust continue to use fossil fuels. We also need to understand that we \nare increasingly dependent upon a supply of oil that comes from under \nthe sands of the Middle East. A very small part of this world has an \ninventory of a very substantial part of the oil resources that exist in \nthe world. To be hopelessly addicted to that oil--foreign sources of \noil--makes no sense. So as we developed a new energy bill, I think we \ndid an excellent job in the Energy Committee. I have complimented \nSenator Domenici and Senator Bingaman at some length about that. We \nhave produced a bipartisan piece of legislation and brought it to the \nfloor.\n  During the debate in committee, we recognized that we would reserve \nthis amendment for the floor of the Senate and debate it here on the \nfloor. Again, I call this the home-grown energy, or an American-made \nenergy amendment.\n  Let me use a picture to make a point. This happens to be a photograph \nof a wind turbine just south of Minot, ND. There are actually two wind \nturbines that sit on a hill south of Minot. North Dakota is a wonderful \nState. I am enormously proud to represent North Dakota. We happen to be \nfiftieth in the 50 States in native forest lands. Translated, we are \ndead last in trees. It is a great State. We happen to be dead last in \ntrees. We put up a wind turbine here and there, and we like it because \nwe are also a State that has more wind than almost any State in the \nNation. We are dead last in trees, but we are first in wind--some say \nespecially when I am at home on the weekends.\n  The Department of Energy says that North Dakota, among all of the \nStates, is the ``Saudi Arabia of wind.'' We have more potential to \ndevelop wind energy than anywhere in America. So this wind turbine is \nsouth of Minot, ND. I happen to have had a role in this wind turbine \nbecause we on the Appropriations Committee put money in for the air \nbase to buy green power. Eight air bases are buying green power. Two of \nthese wind turbines went up, and they are supplying wind energy to an \nair base. Incidentally, these turbines are named. The two south of \nMinot are Willy and Wally. I am not able to determine at first glance \nwhether this is Willy or Wally. They are essentially twins. We care a \nlot about them and this turbine is an example of the new technology--\nmuch more efficient technology--by which you can take energy from the \nwind and turn it into electricity.\n  In the long term, I think we will be able to take energy from that \nwind, through these turbines, and turn it into electricity, and through \nthe process of electrolysis, separate hydrogen from water and produce \nhydrogen for hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles. What a wonderful thing for \nthis country. Then we won't be quite so addicted to oil from Saudi \nArabia, Iraq, Venezuela, or Kuwait. Maybe we can shed that addiction.\n\n[[Page S6686]]\n\n  As we begin to talk about energy in the future, we have all talked \nabout natural gas and the increased use of natural gas as a result of \nboth our country and industry wanting to have cleaner burning fuels. \nNow we are realizing that we don't have enough natural gas to keep up \nwith demand. So now we are beginning to talk about how much natural gas \nwe will import into this country. The demand for natural gas continues \nto increase rather substantially. We are talking about new terminals \nfor LNG and how much LNG we will import into this country to keep pace \nwith our need.\n\n  Isn't that moving in exactly the same direction as we find ourselves \nnow with oil? Should we not, with just as much aggressiveness, decide \nwe want to change the whole construct of our energy mix, to the extent \nwe can? The answer should be yes. That is why a home-grown energy \namendment makes a lot of sense.\n  As I said yesterday, I understand there will be opposition to every \nproposition that changes the way we currently do things. I understand \nthat. ``It won't work, can't work, bad idea.'' The fact is, this \namendment asks the question, will we begin to take control ourselves? \nWill we take control?\n  This is a very simple proposition--in fact, milder than some. It \nsays, of the electricity we produce in this country, 10 percent of it \nshould come from renewable sources. This is not a giant lift.\n  I understand there are some in the electric utility industry, and \nothers, who feel this should not happen. They don't want this. They \nbelieve it is an intrusion. But I also understand we are trying to \nmarch toward a different energy future. We are trying to push a bit, \ntrying to stretch a bit to see if we cannot remove this hopeless \naddiction to foreign sources of energy. That is the basis of this \namendment.\n  My colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, is going to describe \ninformation about what this amendment, if we pass it, will mean in \nterms of the use of fossil fuels versus the use of renewable sources of \nenergy, what it means in costs, and what it means in the reduction of \nenergy dependency that now exists. I think this is not only a win-win, \nbut a win-win-win amendment for everybody. So what we are trying to do \nis harness energy we can produce.\n  Using 100 kilowatt hours of wind power each month is the equivalent \nof planting one-half acre of trees, or not driving 2,400 miles. Think \nof that. Put up a turbine--by the way, I understand the turbines didn't \nuse to be so efficient. We had to have much more of a boost and \nincentive. Now they are highly efficient. Put up one of these turbines \nand use the wind to produce electricity. Use the wind to turn that \nturbine, and from it produce the electricity. And 100 kilowatt hours--\nincidentally, this is probably 10 times that; this is about a megawatt. \nBut 100 kilowatt hours is the equivalent of planting a half acre of \ntrees or not driving 2,400 miles. That is the savings in energy.\n  This amendment will also reduce electric sector carbon dioxide \nemissions by 7.5 percent. That is a great result also, because we are \ngoing to have other debates on the floor of the Senate about global \nwarming, about CO2, about all of these related issues.\n  This amendment moves us in the right direction in several areas. It \nmakes a lot of sense. I hope at the end of this discussion we will have \nsent a message to the country and to the world that, while this is a \ngood bill that came out of committee, we have improved it. This \namendment moves us well down the road to a substantial improvement with \nrespect to our energy future.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we will have other debates of consequence \non these issues. Yesterday, we had a big idea, which said let's reduce \nour dependency on foreign oil by 40 percent in the next 20 years. We \nhad people stand up and say, oh, my gosh, we cannot do that; what are \nyou thinking about?\n  We went to the Moon in 10 years. If we can go to the Moon in 10 \nyears, we ought to be able to find a way to reduce our hopeless \naddiction to foreign oil in 20 years. Of course we can do that. I am \ntired of the can't-doers around here. Let's have some of the can-doers \ndecide to affect the destiny of this country's energy future. Our \ncountry's economic future, our children's ability to find jobs, our \neconomy's ability to expand, and our ability to remain a world economic \npower depends on energy. When the tank runs dry, this economy goes \nbelly up.\n  This amendment describes an opportunity for us to move in a slightly \ndifferent direction--toward home-grown energy, American made--believing \nin ourselves, taking control and taking charge. I support this \namendment. I hope the Senate will give it very broad support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am tempted to ask why we should have \nto raise electric rates in Tennessee to build windmills in North \nDakota, even as much as they like them. I would prefer to send every \nsingle one of these gigantic public nuisances to North Dakota if they \nwant them. What I object to is raising our electric rates to build \nthem. That is what we are doing. I want to go back over carefully what \nSenator Bingaman said earlier about the letter, describing his \nproposal.\n  The one thing we can be sure about, regarding the Bingaman proposal, \nis it is a multibillion dollar increase in electric rates on the bills \nof most Americans. Surely in Tennessee it will be, because here we are, \nreferring to this map. Senator Domenici pointed out the white area on \nthe map. The prior Presiding Officer is from South Carolina and the \npresent Presiding Officer is from Florida. They find themselves here in \nthe white area. There is no wind down there. Now, it is true that under \nthe Bingaman amendment, they might try to make enough electricity from \nsolar or from geothermal or from biomass. But what the letter says is \ntwo things. The letter from the Energy Department describing the \nproposal of the Senator from New Mexico says it will cost an $18 \nbillion increase in electric rates between now and 2025 in order to \nstart making our electricity out of this limited number of ways that we \ncall renewable energy, instead of the way we normally would do it. And \nif we are not able to do it--if in Tennessee, Florida, or South \nCarolina we cannot meet the 10 percent with big windmills or solar or \nbiomass or landfill gas or geothermal, then we write a check to the \nGovernment. So we pay a tax or we raise our rates or we do both.\n  Now, the Senator from New Mexico did correctly go back to the letter \nof June 15 and point out I had said that the letter from the Department \nof Energy says that, over 20 years, the cumulative total cost of the \nelectric power sector is about $18 billion for this amendment.\n  We have been having a big argument down here about the Clean Air Act, \nwhether to take the President's version or, say, the Carper version, \nwhich I cosponsored. According to the Environmental Protection Agency \nanalysis, the difference is a $5 billion effect on the economy, and \neverybody was shooting off rockets about that. This is $18 billion.\n  But the Senator from New Mexico said keep reading the letter. It \nsays:\n\n        . . . cumulative expenditures for natural gas and \n     electricity by all end-use sectors taken together decrease by \n     $22 billion.\n\n  That would look like the net increase was almost nothing.\n  The problem with that is that assumes the price of natural gas is $5. \nThat also looks at the year 2020. If you go out to 2025 with no RPS, \naccording to the Energy Information Administration, the cost of natural \ngas is $4.79 and the cost with RPS is $4.79.\n  What I am saying is, I do not believe we can count on a reduction in \nthe price of natural gas to $5 to offset this $18 billion increase in \nour electric rates that this amendment will produce.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is perfectly entitled to say: If you do \nnot believe their estimates about natural gas, why do you believe their \nestimates about the increase in the cost of electricity? And he would \nhave a point. But I think the one thing we can be sure of about the new \nmandate of the Senator from New Mexico is that it is a multibillion-\ndollar rate increase of some number.\n  We do know in the area where the Senator from Florida lives and where \nI\n\n[[Page S6687]]\n\nlive, if the utilities produce what they are more likely to produce, \nthey will produce electricity using nuclear power, which is carbon \nfree, and coal. I am told that today the cost of nuclear, after it is \nbuilt, is 1 cent per kilowatt hour, coal is 2 cents, natural gas is 4.8 \ncents, and wind is 4.8 cents, and these preferred methods in the \nBingaman legislation all cost more. In other words, this is an order to \nTennessee and Florida to not do what we would normally do but do this \nlimited number of renewable fuels and, in the process, pay for it with \na big increase in our electric rates.\n  The Tennessee Valley Authority has just announced it is considering a \n7-percent rate increase. I recruited a lot of automobile plants to \nTennessee. I know that aluminum is made from electricity, an \nelectrolysis process. If these electric rates go up too much, those \njobs go overseas. They will be gone by 2020 and 2025 if we put in an \n$18 billion increase on electric rates.\n  You may assume that natural gas will go down to $5 a unit. It is $7 \ntoday. Or it might not go down to $5 a unit. But it looks to me, under \nthis mandate, the only way electric rates can go is up.\n  Also, the EIA letter says there is no appreciable decrease in \nNOX to clean the air, no appreciable decrease in sulfur \ndioxide to clean the air, and the price of natural gas does not go \ndown. By the year 2025, according to the Energy Information \nAdministration, the price of natural gas is $4.79, with an RPS or \nwithout it.\n  What we have before us is a proposal to select out a very few nice \nsounding ideas and say let's charge the ratepayers of America $18 \nbillion to put them in and hope the price of natural gas goes down over \n20 years to offset it. That is what we are saying. We are assuming \nduring all that time there is no growth in nuclear power.\n  Why would we be over here even talking about spending $18 billion to \ncreate tens of thousands of new gigantic windmills to run the American \neconomy and spending $11 billion to produce by 2025 one-fifth of 1 \npercent of our total electricity in solar? That is what this would do. \nWhy don't we do something that we know would create large amounts of \ncarbon-free electricity?\n  I can go to that list. We know that nuclear power produces 70 percent \nof our carbon-free electricity. For those who care about global \nwarming--and I am one Senator who does--I do not want to rely on \nwindmills and solar energy that produces one-fifth of 1 percent of our \ntotal needs to get us where we need to go in terms of carbon-free \nenergy.\n  So why don't we take this money, if we have it, and accelerate \nadvanced nuclear powerplants, accelerate carbon recapture and \nsequestration, spend a reasonable amount on solar, accelerate coal \ngasification powerplants, accelerate conservation and energy \nefficiency. That is the way you have carbon-free air--conservation, \nnuclear power, coal gasification, and carbon sequestration, not tens of \nthousands of windmills.\n  I am not anxious to go home to Tennessee and say: We are worried \nabout the Japanese, the Chinese, and the Indians taking our jobs and \nbuying up the oil reserves, we are worried about our clean air, \ngasoline prices are high, natural gas prices are at a record high, and \nour solution: tens of thousands of windmills.\n  The Senator from New Mexico said there are many things that can be \ndone, but the EIA letter which he cites has an estimate of what the \neffect of this mandate would be. It could be more or less, but this is \nwhat it says. It says we will have 35,100 new gigantic wind mills. That \nis a lot. We have 6,700 today, and we will have 35,000 new wind mills.\n  Let me take an example of these wind turbines. There is one new \nnuclear powerplant being opened in America today and that is at Browns \nFerry. It is about 2,000 megawatts. If you had 2,000 1-megawatt wind \nturbines, that would spread over an area two times the size of the City \nof Knoxville, TN. But 2,000 would not produce the same energy you get \nfrom that one nuclear powerplant because wind turbines only work 20 to \n40 percent of the time, so you have to have 4,000. So it is an area two \nor three times the size of Knoxville, TN, and you do not even get to \nclose the nuclear powerplant because people want their electricity all \nthe time, not just when the wind blows.\n  The Senator from North Dakota mentioned he had gotten a nice subsidy \nfor his two big wind turbines in North Dakota. Well, that is terrific. \nSo now they have three subsidies to build these two giant windmills. We \ncommitted $2 billion of taxpayers' money--that is such a preposterous \nnumber for this purpose, I can barely speak it--$2 billion of taxpayer \nmoney over the next 5 years for windmills. The Finance Committee \nsuggested another billion. This mandate would, by causing those who \ncannot produce enough wind to write a check to the Government, be yet \nanother subsidy, and if you know the Senator from North Dakota, you can \nget a third subsidy to build windmills.\n  Why don't we get the same amount of interest in conservation, nuclear \npower, coal gasification, and carbon sequestration and really clean up \nthe air?\n  There is one last point I would like to make, and I will be through. \nThe Senator from Idaho talked about the landscape a little bit. I think \nsolar power is terrific. I have an amendment with the Senator from \nSouth Dakota to expand solar-produced power. Production tax credits \nhave gone all to wind and left out solar power. Biomass has a great \nfuture.\n  I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but I had always \nthought that the great American outdoors was one of the most essential \nparts of our character.\n  Egypt has its pyramids, Italy has its art, England has its history, \nand we have the great American outdoors. I do not think it is right for \nus to subsidize the building of these gigantic machines which are twice \nas tall as a football stadium and extend from 10-yard line to 10-yard \nline that can be seen for 20 miles away and destroy the American \nlandscape when there is no real purpose for it. At the same time, we \nhave unreasonable, massive subsidies to the developers to do it.\n  I hope we will defeat this amendment, and that is a part of the \nreason. I will not be through looking at these subsidies for wind power \nbefore we get through. I do not think any of us should be embarrassed \nthat it is not right to destroy and scar the American landscape by \nbuilding these what I believe are public nuisances when instead we \ncould be producing carbon-free energy by conservation, nuclear power, \ncoal gasification, and carbon sequestration.\n  This is an $18 billion increase to the ratepayers of America. Maybe \nyou believe that the lower price of natural gas in 20 years will make \nup for that. I would not count on it.\n\n\n                           regional capacity\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, energy diversification is \nimportant to the future of our country; and for that reason, the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Energy Committee has proposed an \namendment to require 10 percent of our electricity to be produced from \nrenewable resources by 2020. However, for those regions of the country \nthat do not have the capacity to greatly increase renewable resources \nin their State, a financial hardship may result through no fault of \ntheir own. My State of Florida is one of the States that will have \ndifficulty meeting the standards because the geological, climatic and \ntopographical conditions make it impossible to harness certain forms of \nrenewable energy like wind and hydropower. Furthermore, the Energy \nInformation Administration concludes that Florida's energy technical \npotential for renewable energy is 8 percent. Currently, Florida has 1.8 \npercent in existing renewables; and more than 50 percent of that 1.8 \npercent comes from municipal solid waste, a form of renewable energy \nnot included in the definition of ``new renewable energy'' in the \nranking member's amendment. For these reasons, I have expressed my \nconcerns to Senator Bingaman. While I remain supportive of expanding \nthe use of renewable energy supplies, I would prefer an approach that \nrecognizes the regional differences in the ability of States to meet a \nrenewable portfolio standard. An RPS standard cannot be rigid, it must \nbe flexible.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate the concerns of my colleague from Florida. \nAs you know, I continue to push for a renewable portfolio standard \nbecause the increased use of renewables can ease natural gas price \nvolatility and\n\n[[Page S6688]]\n\ndecrease our dependence on fossil fuels and foreign imports. Having \nsaid that, differences do exist from region to region and State to \nState with regard to renewable energy potential. I would like to extend \nan offer to Senator Nelson of Florida to work in conference to find a \nmethod that will enable a renewable standard to accomplish the goal of \nincreasing renewables while recognizing the legitimate differences \namong States. I acknowledge that municipal solid waste plays a large \nrole in Florida's renewable potential and I would be willing to \nrecognize that potential as part of our discussions in the conference. \nI believe we can find a way to help each State include a renewable \nstandard as part of their overall energy production, and I am committed \nto working with Senator Nelson to accomplish this.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I want to thank Senator Bingaman for his work \non this energy bill and his commitment to work in conference to address \nmy concerns with the renewable energy standard specifically. I look \nforward to working together on this important provision.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to amendment No. 791, \nSenator Bingaman's amendment which would require a mandatory renewable \nportfolio standard, or ``RPS.''\n  I am a big supporter of new, clean forms of energy. I am convinced \nthat we cannot become energy independent without making renewable \nenergy resources an important part of our energy mix.\n  I also believe that each region of the country has something to offer \nto meet this country's clean energy needs, but what each region has to \noffer is not the same. For that simple reason, I oppose including a \nnationwide, mandatory renewable portfolio standard in this energy bill.\n  In particular, for many regions of the country not blessed with \nrenewable energy resources, this RPS mandate would essentially result \nin a huge wealth transfer payment from consumers to the Federal \nGovernment or to renewable energy generators located in other areas of \nthe country. The amendment ignores the reality that some regions of the \ncountry simply do not have the amount of renewable resources demanded \nby this amendment.\n  The leading advocate for wind power, the American Wind Energy \nAssociation, lists my home State of Missouri as the 20th best state for \nwind energy potential. That would seem to imply that Missouri would \nhave no trouble meeting a 10 percent RPS with wind energy.\n  However, the detailed studies done by the National Renewable Energy \nLaboratory show that the wind Missouri does have is of insufficient \npower and consistency for utility grade wind turbine applications. In \nother words, the utilities in Missouri cannot build windmills in the \nState to meet an RPS. There's just no wind to make them turn.\n  Missouri is not the only State that finds itself unable to use wind, \nthe one renewable resource that RPS proponents do not dispute is \ncentral to meeting the proposed requirement. The wind resource map \nprepared by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory graphically \ndemonstrates that the entire southeastern region of the country has \nvirtually no wind potential. Those States are even worse off than \nMissouri. Moreover, large areas of the upper midwest have marginal wind \npotential, unless those States plan to build wind farms in the Great \nLakes, and I don't think any of us expect that to happen.\n  So if not wind, what else might be used? The proposed amendment lists \na limited number of forms of renewable energy that meet the \nrequirement--solar, wind, geothermal energy, ocean energy, biomass, \nlandfill gas, or incremental hydropower.\n  My State has just a little bit of hydropower. However, under Mr. \nBingaman's proposal, existing hydropower, though clearly a renewable \nresource and one of the very cleanest and cheapest sources of \nelectricity, inexplicably does not count. All of the hydropower in the \nPacific Northwest also does not count under this proposal.\n  My State also has a generator that burns tire chips. Every tire that \nis burned to make electricity is one less that will be tossed into our \noverburdened landfills. That is certainly something we should \nencourage, but are tires considered renewable? I do not see us driving \ncars without tires anytime soon. Nevertheless, tire chips do not count, \neither.\n  The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has also found that Missouri \ndoes not have utility-scale geothermal, solar, or fuelwood biomass \nresources, either. So what do I tell my homestate utilities that they \nshould use to meet this RPS requirement?\n  This morning, Sen. Bingaman acknowledged that many States do not have \naccess to the best renewable resources. He recognized that wind, solar, \nand geothermal resources are generally concentrated in western States. \nThese are the major sources of clean, renewable power. He suggested \nthat, no matter, another renewable--biomass--is available in every \nState. What he did not tell you, however, is that you can not just toss \nswitchgrass or other biomass into a boiler and churn out electricity.\n  Biomass is not generally used to make electricity today, and its use \nis not without substantial costs. It must be thoroughly dried before \nburning. That requires lots of space and energy for drying and, \nobviously, it can not be stored outside in a heap like coal. Building a \ndrying and storage facility to process and store the mountain of \nbiomass it would take to meet an RPS requirement would cost a lot of \nmoney. There would also be quite a cost to gather and transport these \nmaterials from the hundreds of acres it would take to grow sufficient \nbiomass just to equal a couple of tons of coal. Plus, there is a \nsubstantial cost to consumers for utilities to modify their boilers to \nco-fire or blend biomass fuel. And, on top of this, burning biomass may \nleave the utilities with additional cost to comply with the Clean Air \nAct.\n  Proponents of a mandatory RPS say, ``Just buy wind power from wind \ngenerators in other States.'' Sounds easy enough, but how do we get \nthat power to the State? Wind turbines obviously have to be built where \nthe wind is. These locations are usually remote and far from our cities \nwhere the electricity is most needed. In most every instance, there is \ninsufficient transmission capacity to move that power to where it is \nneeded. And at $1 to $3 million a mile, new transmission does not come \ncheaply, nor is it easy to get all of the necessary approvals to get it \nbuilt. So I am not ready to say I can count on economically \ntransmitting wind power to Missouri, if at all.\n  Moreover, wind turbines are just as susceptible to fierce local \nopposition as any other energy facility proposed near population \ncenters. Senator Alexander has highlighted how large and intrusive each \nof these modern wind turbines are. And while one on the horizon may be \ninteresting, it will take hundreds of them on that horizon to meet a 10 \npercent RPS requirement. I do not know that this is how any of us want \nto meet our Nation's energy needs, if we can even get that many wind \nturbines built.\n  What is the result if this wind energy does not get built or can not \nbe delivered? This RPS amendment will end up being nothing more than a \nnew energy tax on consumers who depend on traditional fuels for their \nelectricity. Higher energy costs, particularly those that result in a \nwealth transfer payment from our constituents to the Department of \nEnergy, is not good energy policy.\n\n  Utilities in my State already voluntarily offer the green power that \nthey have available to their customers if they prefer to buy green. \nThey are adding wind generators where they can--For example, Kansas \nCity Power and Light is adding up to 200 megawatts of wind power in \nKansas. This is about as much as they have found feasible to produce \nthere. But this does not even come close to meeting a 10-percent RPS \nrequirement.\n  According to EIA, total electricity sold in 2002 by the Missouri \nutilities that would have to meet the proposed RPS was 47,378,256 \nmegawatt-hours, meaning Missouri utilities would have to produce 4.7 \nmillion megawatt-hours of renewable electricity, and this amount will \nonly grow, as electricity demand has increased in recent years by \nnearly 5 percent.\n  KCP's 200 megawatts of wind energy capacity will translate into no \nmore than 584,000 megawatt-hours of wind energy, assuming the energy is \navailable \\1/3\\ of all hours of the year, far\n\n[[Page S6689]]\n\nshort of the 4.7 million megawatt-hours that a 10-percent RPS \nrequirement would demand. Even on a capacity rather then energy basis, \nthe 200 megawatts would only equate to 5 percent of KCP's current \ngenerating capacity of 4,000 megawatts.\n  KCP estimates that to meet the RPS requirement it would face with \nwind energy, it would need as much as 450 megawatts of wind. This \nequates to about 297 wind turbines, each of which needs at least 60 \nacres of land, meaning it would take upwards of 18,000 acres of land to \nmeet the RPS requirement. KCP estimates the total cost of complying \nwith the RPS proposal to be between $400 and $500 million. And that's \njust one utility that serves just a portion of Missouri.\n  Today, the cost of all types of energy is at unacceptably high \nlevels. Adoption of this amendment would increase consumers' electric \nbills, since if a utility cannot meet the standard, it would have to \nbuy credits at 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.\n  Missouri's average retail rate for electricity is around 6 cents per \nkilowatt-hour, making the RPS amount to a 25-percent increase in cost \nto Missouri customers for this portion of their electricity needs. This \nwould have particularly negative consequences for those who can least \nafford it, such as the working poor and the elderly living on fixed \nincomes.\n  This is just a wealth transfer from States with little renewable \nresources to those with a lot. We do not do this for any other source \nof electricity--States with low cost coal or hydropower do not \nsubsidize States that rely on higher cost fuels such as natural gas. \nWhy should we have some States subsidize others to promote a selective \nfuel for producing electricity? At 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, this \ncould cost Missouri consumers as much as $71 million a year.\n  Such a large sum of money would be better spent in shoring up our \nNation's transmission grid or pursuing other clean energy sources. \nMissouri utilities are voluntarily spending hundreds of millions of \ndollars pursuing clean coal technology to take advantage of the natural \nresource that is readily and economically available to Missouri, just \nas other States are doing what they can with the resources they have \navailable, whether that is coal, natural gas, wind, biomass or other \nforms of energy such as nuclear.\n  Utilities are also spending hundreds of millions of dollars to \nretrofit their plants to remove NOX, SO2, and \nmercury from emissions, and may be subject to CO2 reductions \nas well. KCP alone is spending $280 million to meet emission \nreduction goals.\n  Adding a tax to support renewables in other regions of the country is \nan excessive burden on this critical industry that needs to be focusing \ncapital resources on improving the transmission grid to increase \nreliability. This transmission investment is needed to improve the \nexisting grid, not to extend the grid to remote locations where wind \nturbines must be placed, far from where the electricity is used.\n  States that have renewable resources in sufficient quantity have \nalready moved ahead and adopted renewable portfolio standards tailored \nto the resources of the State. Not surprisingly, adoption of this \namendment would conflict with the RPS programs adopted by 20 States \nthat have different eligible renewable resources and implement \ntimetables.\n  Even some of these States with their own RPS will not be able to meet \nthis mandatory proposal. Of the 20 States with portfolio requirements, \nonly 13 of them have set a standard high enough to meet the proposed \n10-percent Federal standard by 2020. Some of 13 that meet the 10-\npercent threshold may still fail simply because their definition of \nrenewable energy doesn't meet what would be the national standard \ndefinition. They, like other States coming up short will be subject to \nwhat amounts to a Federally-mandated energy tax.\n  I believe that, if we want to encourage renewable energy, and we do, \na better way of doing it, particularly for wind, is through stable tax \ncredits. Stable tax credits are the better solution to encourage \nrenewables. A greater need for wind developers than the RPS is the \ncertainty of a production tax credit that doesn't annually disappear \nand reappear. Extending this credit from an annual credit to 5 or 10 \nyears would make wind competitive in areas of the country where it is \nviable and wanted. An RPS does not make wind competitive in the \nmarketplace; it just raises the cost of electricity to consumers, who \nare already paying too much for energy. This is not good energy policy.\n  I urge the Senate to reject this amendment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, many people think only of wind turbines \nwhen renewable sources of energy are discussed. However, I see great \npotential for Kansas and our nation in the production of renewable \nenergy from biomass sources. We have the technology to produce \nelectricity from grass, hay, wood, livestock manure and many other bio-\nbased sources that the State of Kansas has in abundance. This would not \nonly provide a new market for many of our farmers to access, but would \nlead to a better environment for all of us by finding beneficial uses \nfor many of these waste products.\n  I believe the Flint Hills to be the most environmentally significant \ntreasure the state of Kansas has to offer. It's paramount that we \nprotect this native land from unsightly development that will ruin this \ntreasure for future generations of Kansans. Therefore, with my vote for \na nation renewable portfolio standard, I urge the State to protect \nFlint Hills from wind turbine development and focus on producing \nrenewable electricity from biomass sources. It is good for our farmers, \nit is good for the environment and it is good for Kansans.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I agree that clean, renewable energy \ntechnologies are an important part of a program to achieve our national \nenergy and environmental goals. However, I do not believe that a \nFederal renewable portfolio standard achieves this objective.\n  Twenty-three States have already adopted renewable technology \nstandards and have committed resources to find cleaner and more \nefficient technologies to meet their energy needs. For example, Arizona \nis in the process of increasing its renewable target to 15 percent by \n2020, exceeding the proposed Federal standard in the amendment. I \nexpect that Arizona will implement its program in a manner that makes \nthe most of the State's solar potential in the long-term.\n  I do not believe that the proposed Federal standard would help \nArizona or any other State fully achieve their clean energy and \nefficiency goals. I also understand that the penalty for noncompliance \nwith the proposed Federal standard is significantly lower than the \nincremental cost of bringing renewables on line. While I do not believe \nthe intent of this amendment is to impose an energy tax on consumers, I \nthink that could be the economic reality in many circumstances.\n  My colleague from Tennessee has argued persuasively that this Federal \nRPS is primarily a wind-power bill. I was interested to read in a fact \nsheet from the Union of Concerned Scientists that, to achieve this 10-\npercent Federal RPS, we would need to build almost 55,000 new wind \nturbines. That is an enormous number. I suspect that the potential \nadverse environmental effect such a massive construction project have \nnot been studied. In fact, it has already been suggested that in the \nrush to take advantage of the current tax credit for wind generation \nanalyses of potential long-term consequences have been neglected.\n  I am not opposed to wind-power, but I have heard from utilities in my \nown State that a Federal mandate of this sort is largely a requirement \nto import wind, since Arizona has very limited wind resources. We are \nalready providing substantial subsidies for wind-power and the energy \ntax title will provide more. I question why we need to subsidize wind \nto the practical exclusion of other renewables.\n  The need for energy sustainability and cost-effectiveness does \ninfluence my opposition to this amendment. What we need to do, what we \nmust do, is enact a mandatory cap and trade program for greenhouse gas \nreduction and let the market drive the technology. A Federal RPS would \nstand in sharp contrast to the market-based solutions in the Climate \nStewardship and Innovation Act, which Senator Lieberman and I \nintroduced last month. That legislation would promote clean and \nefficient energy technologies\n\n[[Page S6690]]\n\nwithout relying solely on taxpayer subsidies or choosing particular \ntechnologies over others. That is the vision I have for our energy \nfuture--a clean, efficient and innovative mix of technologies that \nbenefit all Americans.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by the \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman. This amendment is a breath of \nfresh air in a bill that is filled with many stale concepts regarding \nour approach to this Nation's energy policy. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  Producing a significant amount of our electricity from renewable \nsources is not a concept for the future. It is a real possibility that \nexists today using solar, wind, tidal, gas from landfills, and biomass. \nIn fact, 19 States around the country are using these renewable source \nof energy to steer their States towards a future of clean, sustainable \nenergy use.\n  In my State of Illinois and in many other States, enacting this \nstandard is a no-brainer. This winter, Illinois Governor Blagojevich \nannounced a plan to adopt a renewable portfolio standard requiring \nIllinois electric utilities to provide 8 percent renewable energy as \npart of their overall power mix by 2012. This bold vision will make \nIllinois the second biggest wind power State in the country by 2012. \nThe city of Chicago also has a strong commitment to using renewable \nsources of energy and is already planning to surpass a 10 percent \ncontribution from renewables in its electricity stream and achieve a 20 \npercent goal.\n  In the 18 other States where renewable portfolio standards have been \nsuccessfully adopted, innovations in electricity generation have \nflourished at virtually no cost to the consumer. Just imagine what \nwould happen to this industry of the future if we enacted a Federal \nstandard. And, here is the best news: According to the Union of \nConcerned Scientists, a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard on the \nFederal level would not add a single penny to consumers' bills.\n  Introducing renewable electricity into the mix of electricity \ngeneration also brings us a measure of physical security. By creating \ngeographically dispersed sources of energy generation, we are providing \nourselves with greater electricity security by providing smaller \ntargets and reducing the transport of combustible materials. This is \nsmart policy at a time when we must be vigilant about homeland \nsecurity.\n  Our country's demand for electricity is expected to continue growing \nfor decades to come. Enacting a renewable portfolio standard ensures \nthat clean technologies will help us meet that enlarged demand, while \nnot offsetting the importance of investing in clean technologies in \nother energy production methods, especially coal. Coal will undoubtedly \nplay a large role in our energy portfolio for years to come, and I look \nforward to a vigorous debate on how we can best assist the utility \nindustry in employing clean coal technologies.\n  Abraham Lincoln once said: ``I am a firm believer in the people. If \ngiven the truth, they can be depended upon to meet any national crises. \nThe great point is to bring them the real facts.'' The real facts are \nthat without forward-thinking amendments such as this one, the energy \nbill is not going to bring us independence from the 20th century \nmindset of energy production. Let us give the American public this tool \nso they too can rise to meet this national energy crisis before it gets \nworse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am informed that the Senator from \nMichigan and the Senator from Washington want to interrupt the \nremainder of our debate on the Bingaman amendment in order to discuss \nand do a modification of the Cantwell amendment. I ask unanimous \nconsent that they be yielded whatever time they need to accomplish that \nand it not count against the Bingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BURR). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 784, as Modified\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and I call up amendment No. 784 and send a \nmodification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 784), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 120, strike line 23 and all that follows \n     through page 122, line 14, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 151. REDUCTION OF DEPENDENCE ON IMPORTED PETROLEUM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) based on the reports of the Energy Information \n     Administration entitled ``Annual Energy Outlook 2005'' and \n     ``May 2005 Monthly Energy Review''--\n       (A) during the period beginning January 1, 2005, and ending \n     April 30, 2005, the United States imported an estimated \n     average of 13,056,000 barrels of oil per day; and\n       (B) the United States is projected to import 19,110,000 \n     barrels of oil per day in 2025;\n       (2) technology solutions already exist to dramatically \n     increase the productivity of the United States energy supply;\n       (3) energy efficiency and conservation measures can improve \n     the economic competitiveness of the United States and lessen \n     energy costs for families in the United States;\n       (4) United States dependence on foreign energy imports \n     leaves the United States vulnerable to energy supply shocks \n     and reliant on the willingness of other countries to provide \n     sufficient supplies of oil;\n       (5) while only 3 percent of proven oil reserves are located \n     in territory controlled by the United States, advances in \n     fossil fuel extraction techniques and technologies could \n     increase United States energy supplies; and\n       (6) reducing energy consumption also benefits the United \n     States by lowering the environmental impacts associated with \n     fossil fuel use.\n       (b) Goal.--It is a goal of the United States to reduce by \n     40 percent the amount of foreign oil projected to be imported \n     during calendar year 2025 in the reference case contained in \n     the report of the Energy Information Administration entitled \n     ``Annual Energy Outlook 2005''.\n       (c) Measures To Reduce Import Dependence.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and every two years thereafter, the \n     President shall--\n       (A) develop and implement measures to reduce dependence on \n     foreign petroleum imports of the United States by reducing \n     petroleum in, end-uses throughout the economy of the United \n     States sufficient to reduce total demand for petroleum in the \n     United States by 1,000,000 barrels per day from the amount \n     projected for calendar year 2015; and\n       (B)(i) subject to clause (ii), develop and implement \n     measures to reduce dependence on foreign petroleum imports of \n     the United States by reducing petroleum in end-uses \n     throughout the economy of the United States sufficient to \n     reduce total demand for petroleum in the United States by \n     7,640,000 barrels per day from the amount projected for \n     calendar year 2025.\n       (ii) If the President determines that there are \n     insufficient legal authorities to achieve the target for \n     calendar year 2025 in clause (i), the President shall develop \n     and implement measures that will reduce dependence on foreign \n     petroleum imports of the United States by reducing petroleum \n     in end-uses throughout the economy of the United States to \n     the maximum extent practicable and shall submit to Congress \n     proposed legislation or other recommendations to achieve the \n     target.\n       (2) Requirements.--In developing measures under paragraph \n     (1), the President shall--\n       (A) ensure continued reliable and affordable energy for the \n     United States, consistent with the creation of jobs and \n     economic growth and maintaining the international \n     competitiveness of United States businesses, including the \n     manufacturing sector; and\n       (B) implement measures under paragraph (1) under existing \n     authorities of the appropriate Federal agencies, as \n     determined by the President.\n       (3) Projections.--The projections for total demand for \n     petroleum in the United States under paragraph (1) shall be \n     those contained in the Reference Case in the report of the \n     Energy Information Administration entitled ``Annual Energy \n     Outlook 2005''.\n       (d) Report.--\n       (1) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the President \n     shall submit to Congress a report, based on the most recent \n     edition of the Annual Energy Outlook published by the Energy \n     Information Administration, assessing the progress made by \n     the United States toward the goal of reducing dependence on \n     imported petroleum sources by 2025.\n       (2) Contents.--The report under paragraph (1) shall--\n       (A) identify the status of efforts to meet the goal \n     described in subsection (b);\n       (B) assess the effectiveness of any measure implemented \n     under subsection (c) during the previous fiscal year in \n     meeting the goal described in subsection (b); and\n       (C) describe plans to develop additional measures to meet \n     the goal.\n       (e) Savings Clause.--Nothing in this section precludes the \n     President from requesting additional authorities to achieve \n     the targets in subsection (c).\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Michigan has\n\n[[Page S6691]]\n\ngiven a great deal of thought to this issue and to the modified \namendment, and I yield the floor to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank our friend from Washington for \nmaking this modification. This is a very important modification from my \nperspective. But for this modification, the language of the amendment \nwould propose that the goals that are set forth--which are only goals \nbut nonetheless they are goals--would need to be achieved by \nimplementing measures ``under existing authorities of the Federal \nagencies.''\n  That is the language which is in 151(c)(2)(B) of the amendment. That \nis lines 8 and 9 on page 4 of the amendment.\n  Now, that is very problematic language and unacceptable language \nbecause if we are going to achieve the goals that are set forth, if we \nhave any chance of doing so, it would have to be with significant \nchanges in our authorities--for instance, in the tax incentives which \nwould be so essential in order to achieve a reduction in imports of \noil. There is no way I can see or that many others can see that we \ncould achieve the kinds of reductions that are hoped for without \nsignificant tax incentives being put into the law--tax incentives that \ndo not now exist.\n  There are some existing authorities and some existing tax incentives, \nbut they do not come close to what they must be if we are going to \nreduce the amount of imported oil that we use. So it is important to me \nthat the existing authorities language either be removed or superseded \nin this amendment so that the President could seek and we could grant, \nif we so chose, new authority, additional authorities, new tax \nincentives, for instance, to move to new technologies. That is the \neffect of the modification to the amendment that was sent to the desk, \nwhich reads:\n\n       Nothing in this section precludes the President from \n     requesting additional authorities to achieve the targets in \n     subsection (c).\n\n  So that change seems to be very essential since there is no practical \nway that these goals can be met, in my book--either the short-term \ngoals of one million barrels per day or the long-term goals of 7.64 \nmillion barrels per day--unless there are changes in our tax structure \nand the other authorities that we provide in the executive branch. This \nsavings clause now makes it clear that both as to the short-term and \nthe long-term goal for savings, there is not a limit in the amendment \nto using existing authorities but rather additional authorities can be \nsought by the President.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for making that change. In the \ncolloquy between myself and the Senator from Washington, it makes clear \nthat the amendment does not assume or require changes in technologies \nor CAFE standards or anything else. It is technology neutral. According \nto this colloquy, the amendment does not assume or propose an increase \nin CAFE standards. All of the other potential changes, technologically, \nthat could help get us to where we want to go, including diesel \ntechnologies that are so important, hybrid technologies, hydrogen \ntechnologies--it does not put those specific technologies in place, \neither requiring them or, of course, not precluding them because this \nis technology neutral. That becomes critically important because, \nagain, without those technologies there is no way we can achieve these \ngoals. But there is no effort in this amendment to identify the \nspecific technologies or the mechanisms by which these goals would be \nachieved. Particularly important, obviously, is the language that \nstates that the amendment does not assume or propose an increase in \nCAFE standards, and another part of the colloquy makes it clear that \nthe amendment neither assumes nor proposes regulatory changes to the \nCAFE system and that is not part of this amendment.\n  So the colloquy will speak for itself. It is a lot longer than I have \njust summarized, but it is a very significant colloquy to me in terms \nof what the amendment does and what it does not do.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for working out this colloquy \nwith me.\n\n\n                 modification of cantwell amendment 784\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment sets a goal for a savings of 7.6 million \nbarrels of oil by 2025. Are there assumptions made by the amendment?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. This amendment is technology-neutral. It simply lays \nout a vision that the United States should attempt to achieve over the \ncourse of the next 20 years. The only assumption underlying this \namendment is that the United States has the ingenuity and innovative \nspirit to reverse the rising trend of American dependence on foreign \noil imports. Today, foreign oil constitutes approximately 58 percent of \nour domestic supply, a figure that is projected to reach 68 percent by \n2025. Because of the nature of world oil markets and the geologic fact \nthat two-thirds of global reserves are located in the Middle East, the \nUnited States is on track to become increasingly dependent on OPEC to \nfuel our economy; and will be competing with developing nations such as \nChina for access to these oil supplies. Because of the economic and \nnational security implications of foreign oil dependence, this \namendment simply states that it is in the national interest of the \nUnited States to attempt to curb our appetite for imported oil. The \nunderlying bill provides a number of tools to help this country achieve \nthe goal established by my amendment, and there are many potential \npathways to its attainment. However, none of them are specifically \nassumed by the Cantwell amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the amendment assume an increase in CAFE standards?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. This amendment neither assumes nor proposes an increase \nin CAFE standards. In fact, some have erroneously concluded that \nincreasing CAFE standards is the only means of achieving the goal \nestablished by the Cantwell amendment. Multiple analyses by national \nsecurity-related organizations and others have concluded that \nincreasing CAFE standards is not necessary to attain savings of 7.6 \nmillion barrels of oil a day by 2025. In addition, it is important to \nnote that some have circulated erroneous estimates of CAFE standard \nincreases necessary to achieve the goal in the Cantwell amendment, \nattributed to the Energy Information Administration, EIA. The staff of \nthe EIA has said that these flawed estimates have no grounds in \nanalyses performed by the EIA.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the amendment assume an increase in ethanol \nproduction and use?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Because the amendment is technology-neutral and simply \nlays out a vision, accelerated ethanol production and use is not \nspecifically assumed. However, there is no question that biofuels can \nplay an important role in achieving the goal established by the \nCantwell amendment, by displacing imported petroleum-based products \nwith domestic fuel derived from plant matter. In fact, it has been \nestimated that increased domestic biofuels production can contribute \nmore than half of the oil savings goal established by the Cantwell \namendment. It is also worth noting that the underlying bill contains \nimportant provisions that will help accelerate the production of \nethanol and other alternative fuels, including provisions I authored \nthat would provide incentives, research, development and demonstration \nof processes to produce ethanol from cellulosic sources. While not \nspecifically prescribed by the Cantwell energy security amendment, \nthese measures would assist substantially in achieving the amendment's \ngoal.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the amendment assume an increase in use of biodiesel \nfuels and technology?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Again, increased use of biodiesel fuels and technology \nis not specifically assumed by the Cantwell amendment. However, these \nfuels can also help achieve the amendment's goal. It is worth noting \nthat one of the barriers to achieving cost-effective biodiesel \nproduction is increasing the diversity of feedstocks from which \nbiodiesel can be economically produced. The key to unlocking the \npotential of biodiesel is performing the research, development and \ndemonstration of new technologies that will allow the co-production of \nbiodiesel fuel and value-added bioproducts that lower overall costs. I \nwas proud to add specific provisions to this underlying legislation \nthat authorize an Advanced Biofuels Technology program, designed to \naccelerate the development of these processes. Again, while one of the \npotential\n\n[[Page S6692]]\n\ntools the U.S. can use to achieve the goal, additional biodiesel \nproduction is not explicitly assumed by the Cantwell amendment.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the amendment assume an increase in the use of diesel \nengine technology?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. While advances in diesel engine technology are another \npotential tool for accelerating oil savings, they are not specifically \nassumed nor mandated by the Cantwell amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the amendment assume a major increase in the use of \nhybrid electric vehicle technology?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Because the amendment lays out a vision rather than \nmandating specific measures, increased hybrid use is not specifically \nassumed. However, some have estimated that growth in the hybrid vehicle \nmarket can achieve oil savings of up to 2 million barrels a day by \n2015, 10 years before the Cantwell amendment's ultimate goal. Taken \ntogether, biofuels production and growth in the market for hybrid \nvehicles could provide more than two-thirds of the energy security goal \nestablished by the Cantwell amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the amendment assume a major shift to use of \nrenewable hydrogen and fuel cell vehicles?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. There is no question that hydrogen provides another \npotential pathway to achieving substantial oil savings in the United \nStates. However, because the technology remains at a relatively early \nstage in its development, no specific estimates exist for the economic \nand energy efficiencies this technology may provide. It is not \nspecifically assumed by the Cantwell amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the amendment assume an increase in tax incentives to \nencourage use of advance technologies?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Certainly, tax incentives can help spur the development \nof markets for advanced technologies, and help expand the choices \navailable to American consumers. But these are not specified or assumed \nwithin the Cantwell amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the amendment assume regulatory changes in how the \nCAFE system works?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The amendment neither assumes nor proposes regulatory \nchanges to the CAFE system. I view the debate regarding the efficacy of \nthe existing CAFE program as beyond the scope of this amendment, which \nlays out a national vision for reducing American dependence on foreign \noil imports. Certainly any changes to the CAFE system's regulatory \nregime would require additional legislative action, action that is not \nassumed in the Cantwell amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the amendment assume regulatory changes that would \nallow for greater use of diesel technology?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Certainly other nations have begun the transition to \nmore wide-spread use of diesel technology, and initiatives or programs \nin this regard may ultimately be consistent with the Cantwell \namendment. But they are neither specifically assumed nor required.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the amendment assume the Congress will provide other \nnew authorities to the President?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The Cantwell amendment establishes a national goal. As \nsuch, it directs the President to design and implement measures \ndesigned to help achieve the goal, and assumes that, if the President \ndeems his existing authorities insufficient, he will propose to \nCongress legislation or recommendations that would help achieve the \namendment's energy security target. At that time, it would be up to \nCongress to consider the merits of the President's proposals, via the \ntypical legislative process.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the amendment assume that there are adequate \n``existing authorities of appropriate Federal agencies'' to meet the \ngoal of saving 7.64 million barrels of oil per day by 2025?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The amendment assumes that the President has at his \ndisposal adequate authority to develop and implement measures that will \nhelp achieve the goal of reducing imports on foreign oil. However, the \namendment is technology-neutral and establishes a 20-year vision. As \nsuch, it is difficult to predict with any specificity what direction \nnew technologies may take, and whether issues may arise that require \nadditional legislation or Congressional action. For example, if \nbiofuels begin to displace a significantly larger portion of petroleum-\nbased fuels in the United States, certain infrastructure-related \nbarriers may arise that require additional authority or Congressional \naction. Similarly, there are certain to be issues associated with \ninfrastructure, interoperability and international technology standards \nassociated with the development of hydrogen fuel cells. Because the \nCantwell amendment is a call to accelerate the development of \nalternatives to petroleum-based fuel, yet does not purport to choose \ntechnology winners and losers, it is premature to speculate on whether \nadditional authorities or Congressional action may be required. \nHowever, it does assume that proposals to expand the range of tools \navailable to the President to achieve the Cantwell amendment's goal \nwould be considered through the normal channels of Congressional debate \nand approval.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does this amendment set a goal of reducing imported oil or \nreducing overall use of fossil fuel?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The goal of this amendment is to reduce our foreign oil \nimports and exposure to the uncertainties of world oil markets. Because \nof the geologic realities of the way in which oil reserves are \ndistributed across the globe, continued increased demand for oil will \nresult in a growing dependence on imports. While the U.S. is situated \non just 3 percent of the world's reserves, the Middle East is home to \ntwo-thirds, with a full quarter located in just one country, Saudi \nArabia. In order to curb our growing reliance on imports, it is thus \nnecessary to reduce demand for petroleum itself, across all sectors of \nthe economy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. To achieve the one million barrels of oil a day in savings \nrequired by 2015, must the President use existing authorities, or can \nthe President seek additional authority?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. There is nothing in this amendment that precludes the \nPresident from requesting additional legal authority to achieve the \ntarget for 2015. Certainly, any legislative proposal or recommendations \nfrom the President would be considered by Congress, through the typical \nlegislative process. Rather, the provision in (c)(2)(B) is intended to \nmake clear that this amendment, on its face, does not grant the \nPresident any broad, new additional authorities not previously \ncontemplated.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the President can seek additional authority to meet the \nrequirement to save 1 million barrels of oil a day, would the Senator \nbe willing to modify the amendment to make that clear?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask how much time remains on the \nBingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has just under 23 \nminutes. The majority side has 10 minutes 40 seconds.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 791\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will take part of the time remaining \nfor me to respond to a few of the points made by my good friend from \nTennessee and clarify the effect of this amendment as best we \nunderstand it. Contrary to what a person might believe by listening to \na lot of the debate today, this is not an amendment just about \nwindmills. This is an amendment about trying to stimulate the \ndevelopment of a range of technologies, solar technologies, biomass \ntechnologies, wind technologies, clearly, and get the cost of producing \nelectricity from those different technologies down to a more reasonable \nlevel. That is the purpose of the legislation.\n  My good friend from Tennessee says that in his opinion, based on his \nunderstanding of the position the Energy Information Agency has taken, \nthis would result in an increase in electricity rates, or electric \nrates. He reads their analysis and their recent report in a totally \ndifferent way than I do. It is very clear this does not cause an \nincrease in electricity rates. It causes a decrease. It is clear it \ndoes not cause an increase in gas prices. It causes a decrease. It is \nclear it does not cost the electric power sector more. It costs the \nelectric power sector less than it otherwise would be spending.\n  Let me talk about this $18 billion he continues to refer to. It does \nsay in\n\n[[Page S6693]]\n\ntheir report that from 2005 to 2025, the renewable portfolio standard \nhas a cumulative total cost to the electric power sector of about $18 \nbillion. Now, that is true. Then it goes down a couple of sentences \nfurther on. It says, the cumulative expenditures for natural gas and \nelectricity by all end user sectors taken together will decrease by \n$22.6 billion. So what it is basically saying is if this amendment is \nadopted, which I hope very much it will be, there will, in fact, have \nto be more investment by the utility sector, by the electric power \ngeneration companies, in these alternative fuel generation \ntechnologies, these alternative energy sources. But it will be more \nthan offset by what they save in fossil fuels and what they save in \ninvestment in those other areas.\n\n  As far as rates are concerned, it is very clear in this language, and \nI will read this again. It says: ``Compared to the reference case.'' \nThat means with the amendment. It says: ``The cumulative residential \nexpenditures on electricity from 2005 to 2025 are $2.7 billion \nlower''--that is with the amendment--``while the cumulative residential \nexpenditures on natural gas are $2.9 billion lower with the \namendment.''\n  Residential expenditures it is talking about. These are the \nratepayers that we all represent in our individual States. They are \nsaying that, if this amendment is adopted, it is going to be cheaper \nfor them to pay their gas bills, cheaper for them to pay their \nelectricity bills in the future because, frankly, this will take some \nof the pressure off the price of natural gas. That is very much to be \ndesired.\n  Let me read further from their report. They say: ``The increase in \nrenewable generation''--which is contemplated by this amendment--``will \nlead to lower coal and natural gas generation. By 2025, coal generation \nis reduced by almost 9 percent, natural gas generation reduced by over \n5 percent from their respective reference case levels.'' That is from \nthe level that it would be if we didn't adopt this amendment.\n  So in my view, this is a very substantial improvement. This \nlegislation, this amendment will be a substantial improvement to the \nunderlying bill which I think is a very good bill. I do not disagree \nwith anything the Senator from Tennessee said about the advisability \nand desirability of seeing more nuclear power generated in our country, \nthe advisability and desirability of seeing cleaner technologies used \nin coal production. All of that is in the underlying bill. What this \namendment says is let's give an extra impetus to renewable power so \nthat we can get all of the benefit from renewable power that it is \nreasonable for us to achieve over the next couple of decades.\n  That is exactly the purpose of the amendment. I think that is what \nthe effect of the amendment will be. We have had the good fortune of \npassing this amendment before in the Senate. I hope very much we can \npass it again this time. It will strengthen the bill, it will persuade \nthe American people that we are trying to move this country in a \ndifferent direction, as far as its energy future is concerned.\n  We are not satisfied with just saying that current technologies are \nadequate. We are not satisfied with saying the current mix of energy \nsources is adequate. We are trying to get back to more use of American \ningenuity and creativeness to produce energy that we do not have to \nimport from somewhere else in the world.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. We will have a \nchance to summarize very briefly the reasons for the amendment. I will \nhave a chance, and my colleague from Tennessee will have a chance, to \nargue the other side of that argument before we have the vote. As I \nunderstand our agreement now, the Senator from Washington is going to \nhave an opportunity to once again argue the merits of her amendment. \nThat vote will occur, I believe, at 2:15. Then, after that, we will \nhave the vote on this RPS.\n  With that, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nWashington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 784\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for \nhis fine amendment. I would like to take a minute to state that I am a \ncosponsor of the Bingaman amendment and very much believe in the \nrenewable portfolio standard for our electricity grid. I guess if you \nlooked at the Northwest, particularly Washington State, you would say \nwe are already using 80 percent renewable energy because 80 percent of \nour electricity grid is provided by our hydro system. So we, in the \nNorthwest, are very big believers in renewable power.\n  But we also believe in the other technology that is in the underlying \namendment and in the underlying bill that will help us support \nrenewable technologies. We have a lot of wind farms. We have had a lot \nof discussion out here on the floor this morning about wind energy. We, \nin Washington State, are already employing wind energy in a variety of \nlocations in our State and getting great response. In some areas, it is \nsome of the best job growth we have had in rural communities. Farmers \nlove it because, aside from providing an agricultural product, they get \na second source of revenue from their land by having agriculture and \nwind technology on their farms. It works very well for our farmers, and \nthe combination of hydro and wind technology works very well for \nWashington state and the Northwest.\n  But we also have solar power. We are about to have one of the first \ndemonstrations of wave power. We, in the Northwest, are using all sorts \nof renewable technology to meet these goals. Certainly, I want to \nendorse this particular amendment as a great step forward, saying we \ncan do more with renewable technology.\n  I would like to turn to the Cantwell amendment, on which we are going \nto have a vote I believe at 2:15, and summarize, for my colleagues who \nmight have missed yesterday's discussion, a few points I think are \nimportant as we talk about our reliance on imported oil and the fact we \nwant to diversify.\n\n  In the New York Times, there was an article about OPEC and their \nincreases in quotas for various OPEC countries. It is interesting, and \nevery day Americans want to know what is going to happen with oil \nfutures and gas prices. You look to find out what OPEC is doing. This \narticle, I think, brings up the very point we were trying to make \nyesterday; that is, that China's demand for oil continues to grow. In \nfact, this article says that global oil consumption climbed 2.4 or 2.5 \nmillion barrels a day in 2004, the fastest growth rate since 1978. That \nis world demand for energy increasing. Basically, that was a result of \nChina's increasing energy consumption. We know what the trends are, and \nwe know what the challenges are that are facing us.\n  I found it interesting, too, that the New York Times article talked \nabout how OPEC was actually concerned that alternative fuels might \naffect their future price of product. They are almost telling us, yes, \nthey are a little concerned about competition from alternative fuels.\n  I welcome that. I think it is about time that America make an \ninvestment in alternative fuels and about time we give consumers a \nchoice when it comes to the demand and supply of oil in the future and \nnot continue to be held hostage by foreign governments.\n  I would like to review for my colleagues what exactly the Cantwell \namendment does because it is so important that we understand what the \nunderlying bill does and what our challenges are as a country going \nforward.\n  In 1973, we were importing only 28 percent of our demand--our U.S. \ndemand--for oil. We were importing 28 percent of what we used as a \ncountry.\n  Today, 2004, we are at 58 percent, a huge jump, a huge dependency by \nthe United States on a foreign source to provide us an oil supply.\n  When I look at the countries involved and I look at the instability \nin the Middle East, I don't want to be 58 percent reliant on foreign \nsources of oil. I want American ingenuity to be a driver in what we can \nprovide to the American people in driving down the cost of energy.\n  If we do nothing, in 2025, the United States will be importing 68 \npercent; nearly 70 percent of our oil supply will come from abroad. Who \nin their right mind thinks that 70-percent dependence on foreign oil is \nwise economically, to our national security, or internationally as we \nhave to deal with international competition? Why would\n\n[[Page S6694]]\n\nwe want to be almost 70-percent reliant on foreign entities for \nsomething that is the backbone of our economy--energy?\n  I am offering a simple amendment. My amendment simply says by 2025, \ninstead of being reliant on foreign sources for 68 percent of our \nsupply, we bring that down to 56 percent. That is not much of a change. \nWe are at 58 percent today, and we want to go down to 56 percent. That \nis a modest goal.\n  It is hard to achieve because our amendment assumes the growth and \ndemand that will happen as our Nation grows. That is why we have to \nassume in 2025 we will be at 68 percent, and we want to see a serious \nreduction. That is the way my amendment is crafted.\n  The underlying bill says we are currently at 58 percent and let's \nreduce our consumption of foreign oil by 1 million barrels a day. One \nmillion barrels a day by 2015 still has us importing 60 percent of our \nsupply from foreign sources. In 2015, instead of consuming 58 percent \nof our oil supply from foreign sources, we would be at 60 percent. The \nunderlying goal in the bill does nothing to get us off our overreliance \non foreign oil. It is the status quo and a bump in an increase. It is \ntoo timid in responding to what has been a gouging of the American \nconsumer on gas prices.\n  This debate we have just had for the last couple of hours is \ninteresting because a lot of my colleagues have said they refuse to \nsupport a mandate. They do not want to have a mandate in this bill. I \nam not proposing a mandate. It is interesting: Some Members do not \nsupport mandates. They do not even support goals. The American people \ndeserve, on something as important as our national security and \neconomic livelihood, to have this Senate, in transportation and energy \npolicy, set a goal to get off our overdependence on foreign oil. Are my \ncolleagues just giving lip service to this idea of a goal of getting \noff overdependence on foreign oil? Or are we willing to set a goal and \ndo something about it?\n  I have pointed out that the goals we have are doable. My amendment \ndoes not say specifically how or what the mandate is. We have simply \nsaid, that from various studies, we know we can get the savings my \namendment calls for in a goal. Here are a variety of sources: Fuel \nefficiency for tires and motor oil. The encouragement of a biofuels \nindustry. A big chunk of this comes from alternative fuels. That is why \nOPEC, in today's paper, says they are very concerned about this because \nthey know it is competition. They realize it is competition. Why don't \nwe realize it is competition and ensure we get about making an \nalternative product?\n  Other countries certainly have this idea. One is Brazil and based on \ntheir overdependence on foreign oil they came to the same conclusions. \nThey did not want to be in the same boat we are in today. In 1975, they \nwere importing 80 percent of their fuel supply from foreign sources. \nThey made a decision that was too much for them, both economically--I \ndon't know if there are security issues--but economically they thought \nthat was not wise so they started a process of taking steps. In 1990, \nthey almost cut that in half. By 2003, they were down to importing only \n11 percent of their fuel supply. Next year, they might achieve the \ngreat milestone of not only becoming self-sufficient but actually \nbecoming an exporter of fuel to other countries.\n  They have done this because they made an investment in ethanol. They \nmade decisions about their transportation sector so they could run on \nbiofuel products. They have changed the economic picture of their \ncountry.\n  Is there something Brazil possesses that the United States cannot \nachieve? Are they smarter than we are? Do they have greater political \nwill than we do? Do they have more consumers holding their politicians \naccountable than we do? What Brazil showed is they have a resolve \nbecause of their own national interests to get off the foreign \naddiction to oil. I applaud them for that.\n  They are only one-eighth the size of our economy, but they are proven \nto be smart enough to figure out how to make sugar-based ethanol in a \ncost-productive way, so efficient they can send it to the United States \ncheaper than we can produce it to the degree that some of my colleagues \nwant to put a tax on it so that it is on a more level playing field \nwith what sugar-based ethanol in the United States costs. To me, the \nBrazilians have come up with something.\n  I ask my colleagues, if you do not want mandates and you do not want \ngoals and you do not want to get off our overdependence on foreign oil \nby setting a milestone or coming up with a goal or statement, what is \nit that you do want to do? The underlying bill increases our dependence \nby 2015 on foreign oil to 60 percent. We are at 58 percent today. It \nincreases it to 60 percent. So we have accomplished nothing in the goal \nin the underlying bill.\n  I would like to set, primarily for international reasons, a goal to \nget off our dependence on foreign oil because these are our suppliers. \nThese are the countries where the majority of U.S. oil supply comes \nfrom: Saudi Arabia sits on the largest percentage of oil reserves in \nthe world today. I wish geography and geology had been kinder to the \nUnited States and that we sat on more than 3 percent of oil reserves. \nBut we don't. We do not have that product. We have a very small \npercentage of the world reserve for oil. That is a fact of life. These \nare the countries and this is the State ownership of companies that are \npart of OPEC and have the oil supply of the future.\n\n  I didn't expect I would be in the Senate agreeing with George Shultz \nand James Woolsey and a bunch of neoconservatives who were espousing \nideas about our national security, but I actually do agree with them \nthat reducing our dependence on foreign oil should be a national \npriority and a national goal. That is why we have crafted this \namendment this way.\n  We simply want to say to our colleagues and to the President of the \nUnited States that we believe increasing our consumption of foreign \nproducts as a way to support our economy is not a wise decision, given \nwhat growth and demand and oil prices are going to be. Yesterday, the \nmarket closed at $56.20 for oil. Economists at various Wall Street \nfirms are saying we could easily see an oil spike of $100 a barrel. \nThey say that oil futures have a fear premium on them; that is, there \nhas been lots of discussion about how the price of oil futures is \nbasically impacting the price of oil on a day-to-day basis. That is \nright, the speculative market about energy futures in oil basically \ncauses the price at the pump today to increase. I find that unfortunate \nbecause the speculative price of oil futures takes into consideration \nthose nine countries I mentioned, the fact that you could have a \nterrorist attack, the fact that you could have unrest in a region and \nthat somehow supply would be diminished, thus affecting the price of \noil futures.\n  Economists and people on Wall Street--Goldman Sachs and others--\nbasically say there is a fear premium on the price of oil futures; that \nis, we are paying more for oil because we are paying for the \nuncertainty and the instability in the political and geographic region \nwhere oil exists. That is what I am supposed to tell Washington State \nresidents as to why they pay some of the highest gas prices in the \ncountry? That is why they should pay almost $2.30 a gallon for \ngasoline? That is why I should tell people they have lost their \npensions in the airline industry because the airline industry has not \npassed on the high fuel costs? That is what I am supposed to tell the \nfarmers who cannot keep their farms running because of high fuel costs, \nor somebody who has lost their job in a transportation-sensitive \nindustry. I am supposed to tell them that I am going to continue to put \nan energy goal in legislation that makes us more dependent on foreign \noil than we are today?\n\n  No. We want to reverse the trend. That is what the Cantwell amendment \ndoes. It is not a mandate. It is a goal. It says that instead of being \nmore dependent on foreign oil in 2015, as the underlying bill directs \nus, let's become less dependent. Let's go from 58 percent, where we are \ntoday, down to 56.5 percent. It is a goal we can achieve. It is a goal \nI am willing to set as a legislator for our country because I believe \nin the ingenuity of Americans to achieve this goal.\n  There is nothing the country of Brazil can do that the United States \ncannot do. I guarantee you that if we set our resolve to do it as a \nnation, we will achieve this goal as well. The reason why we, as a \ngovernment entity,\n\n[[Page S6695]]\n\nneed to set this goal is because the private sector is going to \ndiversify at its own darn pace; that is, the oil companies will decide \nwhat their investment in new technology and alternative fuels is at \ntheir own pace, their own wishes, their own response to their corporate \nshareholders, not at the interest of individual consumers who are \ngetting strangled by the high cost of gasoline.\n  It is our job to set this goal and that is why we are on the Senate \nfloor today. We are here to say we agree with the American farmers that \nthey can produce a biofuel product in the future that can be \ncompetitive, that we agree with neoconservatives that the security risk \nof being 70 percent dependent on foreign oil is too great a security \nrisk for our Nation, that we agree with technology and research experts \nthat American ingenuity can get us to this 56.5-percent goal.\n  I ask my colleagues, what is wrong with setting this goal? Let's not \ncontinue to give lip service to a goal of getting off our foreign \ndependence and then do nothing about it in a legislative proposal. \nLet's show the American people we are concerned about the economic \nhardship they are facing and that we believe in American ingenuity. We \nbelieve in our farmers. We believe in our technology leaders. We \nbelieve that we, as a country, can achieve this great goal. If the last \ngeneration of Americans were smart enough to put a man on the Moon in a \ndecade, this generation of Americans ought to be smart enough to reach \nthis goal. I ask my colleagues to have the courage to set it in a piece \nof legislation as a mark for us to achieve.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I understand--because of certain committee \nmeetings and time considerations--that we have been asked to extend the \ntime in which there will be a vote. So I ask unanimous consent that the \ntime of 2:15 be extended until 2:30 on a vote on the two amendments \nthat are on the floor and that time be equally divided between both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am not objecting, but I am just asking \nfor the yeas and nays on my amendment. I think moving to 2:30 is fine, \ngiven the markup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am sure many people have been following \nclosely the debate on the Energy bill, an 800-page bill that is trying \nto set the energy policy for America. It is an important piece of \nlegislation we have debated for several years. It has so many different \nsections involved in all the aspects of energy. It has as its goal \nmaking certain that America has enough energy to fuel its economy, \nmaking certain that we use that energy in a responsible fashion so it \ndoes not create pollution that would cause environmental harm. These \nare some of the basic elements of what we are trying to achieve here.\n  But the pending amendment we have before us comes to a basic \nconclusion that I think most Americans agree with. America cannot be a \nsafer and more secure nation in the future if we are more dependent on \nforeign oil. The more we have to depend on Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and \nother countries to send their oil to us, the less secure we are. The \nmore independent we are in terms of our own energy needs and \nproduction, the stronger we are as a nation.\n  In 1973, we imported 28 percent of the oil we consumed. Today, 32 \nyears later, we are importing 58 percent, more than double. We are that \nmuch more dependent on foreign countries to provide us with oil, which \nmeans two obvious things. If the OPEC cartel should decide they want to \nrestrict the oil they will produce, prices will go up in the United \nStates. Reduce the supply, and if demand stays the same, the price goes \nup. It is a basic law of economics. And they have done it. You have \nseen it at the gas pump.\n  When the OPEC cartel sits down and tries to figure out ``How can we \nmake the maximum profit?'' they do not shed tears for American families \nand consumers and businesses. They try to figure out how they can make \nthe maximum profit on the oil they have in the ground. They have the \nvast majority of the oil resources in the world today.\n  The second thing we know is that if you want to strike a crushing \nblow at the American economy, you may consider attacking the United \nStates, but it may be a lot simpler to attack our oil supplies coming \ninto the United States. If, God forbid, they could interrupt those oil \nsupplies coming into the United States, it would really create a \ndangerous situation.\n  So the more dependent we are on that foreign oil, the less secure we \nare when it comes to the price of energy and the availability of \nenergy. You would think that one of the things we would try to do as \npart of a national energy policy is to think ahead 10 years, 20 years, \n``How can we reduce our dependence on foreign oil?'' since most people \nagree that would be a good thing.\n  Well, there is one provision in the bill which suggests that over the \nnext 10 years we would reduce our demand for foreign oil by 1 million \nbarrels a day.\n  That is about 6 or 7 percent of the total amount that is being \nconsumed each day in the United States, but it is a step forward over \nthe next 10 years. It is something the Senate agreed on 99 to 1. So \nover 10 years we will think of strategies which will reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil at least a million barrels a day. That is in \nthe bill. It is a good provision.\n  Two days ago, President Bush sent a letter to us and said: You keep \nthat provision in the bill, and I will veto the bill. Stop and think: \nWhy? Why wouldn't the President want us to move as a national goal to \nreducing our dependence on foreign oil? It makes no sense. It is a tax \non our economy. It is a question of national security. But, in fact, \nthat is what the White House said. If you put a provision in here to \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil by 1 million barrels a day over \nthe next 10 years, I will veto the bill.\n  I don't understand. In fact, I think the President has it exactly \nwrong. We should be even more ambitious and more innovative in our view \ntoward this challenge.\n  Senator Cantwell has an amendment now pending that will be voted on \nsoon. Her amendment says: Keep to that goal over the next 10 years, but \nover 20 years, let us reduce our dependence on foreign oil by 40 \npercent of what we anticipate. So what does it mean? Fifty-eight \npercent of the oil we use is imported. If we do nothing, in 20 years, \nit will be 68 percent. More than two-thirds of the oil we use will come \nfrom overseas. If we adopt the Cantwell amendment, it will go down to \n56 percent of the oil we use in 20 years being imported. It is still a \nlot. But keep in mind, the economy is going to grow. Energy needs are \ngoing to grow. We are going to find ways to work together to reduce \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  I would think most families and people who think about our \nenvironment and think about our economy would applaud the idea of \nsetting this as a national goal, a challenge to the President, to \nCongress, and to the American people: Find ways to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil. It will make us stronger as a nation. It \nwill make our economy stronger. Instead of sending billions of dollars \noverseas to the Saudi oil princes, the money comes into the United \nStates for investment in our own economy, building businesses, helping \npeople prosper and create jobs.\n  Sadly, there is resistance to this amendment, the idea of setting \nthis goal. There are those who say: Don't set any goals. Leave it \nalone. Don't touch it.\n  How could you possibly draw that conclusion from the current \nsituation?\n\n[[Page S6696]]\n\nLeft untouched, we will continue to be dependent on foreign oil and our \neconomy will suffer.\n  How do you reach a goal of reducing dependence on foreign oil by 40 \npercent over the next 20 years? There is a variety of ways. There are \nways within this bill to do it--some large, some small. Some have to do \nwith the most basic thing, the tires on our automobiles. Replacement \ntires give more fuel efficiency and reduce the oil consumption and the \ngasoline consumption. Idling trucks--have you ever gone by a truckstop? \nThey are all over my State of Illinois. There are lines and lines of \nthese tractors with trailers behind them with the engines running \nconstantly, around the clock, idling engines burning up oil just to \nkeep that engine alive and ready to perform when the driver comes out \nand is ready to go. There is a provision in this bill that talks about \nsmarter ways to do that. Is there a way to use an electric engine to \nkeep that tractor in a position where it can go into service and not be \nburning all this fuel while the driver is in eating dinner, for \nexample?\n  These are simple things which, when added up over the course of our \neconomy, lead to dramatic improvements. There are many ways to address \nthis. They come down to three basic things we can do. First is \nconservation. I just gave you two examples of conservation, the ways to \nreduce the use of energy and still get as much performance as we want \nfrom the vehicles we use and the vehicles we drive. The second is \nalternative fuels. What can we use instead of the oil that now is being \nimported, 58 percent of it from overseas? This bill talks about it. It \ntalks about ethanol. What is ethanol? An alcohol fuel is made from \nthings such as corn and cellulose that can, in fact, create more \nindependence in our economy.\n  Senator Cantwell tells the story that the nation of Brazil, 10 or 20 \nyears ago, imported 80 percent of its oil and said as a nation: We \ncan't continue to prosper if we are so dependent on imported oil. They \nset out on a national goal of reducing dependence on foreign oil. They \nare now down to 11 percent. They have done it. They are choosing \nalcohol fuels. That is included in this bill, the concept of alcohol \nfuels. It can be done. So alternative fuels--ethanol, biodiesel--are \npractical alternatives to importing more oil.\n  The third, of course, is to find environmentally responsible ways for \nmore exploration. There is a limit to where that will take us. The \nUnited States owns about 3 percent of the known oil resources in the \nworld. We consume 25 percent of the oil that is consumed each day. So \neven if we were able in an environmentally responsible way to take \nevery drop of oil out of the ground, you could see it is not going to \nsustain our economy. We are going to be dependent on foreign sources.\n\n  Despite this challenge and despite the obvious ways to meet it in \nthis bill, there are some who have come to the floor--on the other side \nof the aisle, particularly--and have argued against setting this goal \nof lessening our overdependence on foreign oil. One of the arguments \nthey make is: If you do this, you are going to have to have more fuel-\nefficient cars and trucks, as if that is something that should be \navoided in America. Why would we avoid that?\n  Take a look at Ford Motor Company. They had a huge advertising drive \nto tell us about their new Ford Escape hybrid. They had so many \nrequests to buy that car, they couldn't make it fast enough. I think \nFord produced about 20,000. There were some 50,000 people who wanted to \nbuy it. They liked the idea, a small SUV that has an electric engine as \npart of it that is going to get better gas mileage. Ford was moving in \nthe right direction. I know about this because my wife and I decided to \nbuy one. We like it. I wish it got better mileage than it does, but we \ndidn't make any great sacrifice in our way of life. We maybe spent a \ncouple extra thousand dollars to buy it. Yet we have a more \nenvironmentally responsible, energy-responsible vehicle.\n  The other side of the aisle argues we shouldn't even suggest to \nAmerican consumers to change their buying habits. I will bet if Detroit \nor any other company started producing more and more energy-efficient \nvehicles, more and more Americans would be interested, not only because \nit reduces the cost at the gas station, but because it is good for the \nenvironment. Why wouldn't you want to do that? Why would you want to \nknowingly drive something that is more polluting and uses more energy \nor more gasoline?\n  The American consumers would, in fact, gravitate toward those \nautomobiles as they did toward the Ford Escape hybrid. They like the \nidea. It is a good concept. The other side says: You don't want to tell \npeople they can't buy whatever they want to buy. If they want to buy \nthe heaviest, least fuel-efficient SUVs, you can't stand in their way. \nI suppose that is true, but we will pay a price for it. By buying and \ndriving inefficient vehicles over and over, it not only costs more at \nthe pump and makes our country more dependent, it draws us into the \nMiddle Eastern problems. Witness 150,000 American soldiers now risking \ntheir lives today in that part of the world.\n  Moving toward more efficient vehicles is a good thing economically. \nIt is certainly a good thing from a security viewpoint. It is a good \nthing in terms of our future as a nation.\n  I believe we are up to the challenge. Most of the critics of the \nCantwell amendment say it just can't be done. Don't challenge America. \nAmerica can't rise to the challenge. We can't possibly in 20 years \nfigure out a way to do this. Those naysayers have no place in the \nAmerican tradition. We have risen to the challenge time and again. When \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt needed an atomic bomb to end World War II, \nhe created the Manhattan project and got the job done. When John \nKennedy came to the Presidency in 1960, he said: We will put a man on \nthe Moon. And in 9 years, it happened. He challenged America, and we \nrose to the challenge. We can rise to the challenge, and we must. \nOtherwise, we will continue to be dependent on foreign sources of oil.\n  When I consider some of the challenges we face, I look at the loss of \njobs. It troubles me. In the State of Illinois, 400,000 or 500,000 \nmanufacturing jobs in the last several years have been lost. I don't \nknow if these jobs are ever coming back. I have been to Galesburg and \nplaces around our State where good-paying jobs have disappeared. A lot \nof them have gone to China. China has one of the fastest growing \neconomies in the world.\n  We just had a little presentation in the other room. The CEO of \nGeneral Electric Energy was there. He said China is in a position to \ndominate the world energy scene over the next 10 years, that in 10 \nyears China will have 30 percent of the electric generating capacity in \nthe world. China's economy is no longer a closed, backward, Communist \neconomy. It is an exploding, expanding economy that is taking jobs away \nfrom the United States.\n  There are two things we ought to think about: The Chinese have fuel \nefficiency standards for their vehicles higher than the United States.\n  They know they don't have the energy in their own country. They are \ntrying to find the most fuel-efficient vehicles to move their economy \nforward and they are thinking about the future. Are we? Is the United \nStates thinking about the future and the cost of fuel inefficiency, or \nthe cost of dependence upon foreign oil?\n  The second point is this. If we are in a position of competing with \nChina for foreign oil, since they have to import it, too, what happens \nwhen there is more competition for a limited supply? The price goes up. \nSo $50 a barrel oil today may be $100 a barrel 5 or 10 years from now. \nLook at what $50 a barrel oil has meant to you and your family and our \neconomy. Filled up lately? Taken a look at what it costs? It has gone \nup dramatically in a short period of time to fill your car or truck. \nTalk about the airlines and their future lately? The cost of aviation \nfuel has gone up so dramatically that a lot of airlines are in \nbankruptcy, or facing it. That is at $50 a barrel. What happens when we \nreach $100 a barrel? What will it mean to the future of these same \ncompanies?\n  If we don't take a serious look at our energy future, sadly, we are \ngoing to leave ourselves vulnerable to competition from China, with \nhigher costs for the basics to keep moving. Senator Cantwell's \namendment is a challenge, but one we should accept. As this President \nends his term in office, another President of his party or another \nparty will come in and see the same national goal: Reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil. It will call for work and\n\n[[Page S6697]]\n\ndedication. We have risen to that challenge time and time again. There \nis no reason we cannot rise to it today.\n  I impress upon my colleagues the absolute necessity to reduce \nAmerica's dependence on foreign oil. This is not an issue of whether we \ncan, this is something we must do. It is imperative we impress upon \nAmerica that setting a national goal of reducing our dependence upon \nforeign oil is a national priority and in the best interests of the \nAmerican people. I believe when we send a signal we are serious about \nchanging the future and the track we are on, people will join us in \nthat effort. The best and brightest minds in our country will rise to \nthe challenge.\n  When we go back to our States and constituents and they ask what we \nhave done in Washington to address the growing threat to our oil supply \nposed by the emerging markets in China and India, and the high gasoline \nprices, we can take pride in the fact that the Cantwell amendment says \nwe are charting a new course for our Nation's future. Opponents have \nargued we cannot do it, we don't have the smarts or the technology; \nthey wring their hands and curse the darkness and say, ``This is the \nway it is always going to be. We will be just more dependent upon \nforeign oil, so be prepared for it.''\n  I disagree. There is technology available today, let alone \nadvancements that may come over the next 20 years, that can move us \nforward on this goal. We, as leaders in this country, must signal that \nwe won't let the future of America fall into the hands of foreign \ngovernments that own the oil supply of this world. Many of these \ngovernments are politically unstable and they don't promote the same \nvalues we do in the United States. The uncertainty of that alliance for \nour future oil should be enough to give us pause.\n  Security experts, economists, foreign policy experts, and scientists \nrecognize that the terrorist organizations want to target the United \nStates, that they can target the supply of our energy and threaten our \neconomy. This is an amendment about national security, economic \nsecurity, and the belief that America, with the right leadership and \nvision, will rise to the challenge, as we have so often done in the \npast.\n  We can use American ingenuity, innovation, and genius to reduce the \ngrowing stranglehold the foreign governments that are supplying oil to \nthe United States have on America's future. I encourage colleagues on \nboth sides to embrace this challenge. Don't run from it, don't be \nafraid of it. It is about the future of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from North \nCarolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I am glad I stayed on the floor because I \nwas a little dismayed when I heard Senator Cantwell describe her \namendment. Senator Durbin helped to clear it up for me in the fact that \nif we cut trucks off at the truckstop and if all the American people \ntake the tires that are on their car now and we change those to new \ntires, we can eliminate a million barrels of oil. It is incredibly \neasy. It is unrealistic, but if you hear it portrayed, it is portrayed \nas something that is easy to accomplish.\n  I rise in opposition to the Senator's amendment because I believe one \nof the responsibilities we have as Members of the Senate is to, in \nfact, pass legislation that is reasonable for the American people, \nlegislation that is technologically possible to achieve--even if we \nstretch technology and we push technology, and even if we were to \ncreate a ``Manhattan Energy project.'' The reality is that some of the \nsame individuals who stand in this chamber and claim this is easily \nachievable are the same ones who for the last decade have blocked \ndomestic exploration, which is crucial to less reliance on foreign oil.\n\n  I believe every American agrees with me that we want to become less \nreliant on imported oil, but it is not just for national security, it \nis for job security. When we talk about policies on this floor that \naffect the cost of manufacturers in a global marketplace, we are \ntalking about the jobs our constituents have, about the manufacturers \nwho used to compete domestically within North Carolina or within the \nSoutheast, or within this country, and now compete with people they \nwill never meet. Of this year's group of graduates from college, 20 \npercent of them will compete for a job with somebody they will never \nmeet and who will never live in this country because technology allows \nus to do it. It will be incredible when technology gets to that point, \nthat it won't take government pushing it and saying implement it; it \nwill implement itself because it brings efficiencies and savings to the \nmarketplace naturally.\n  I think, as the occupant of the chair does, as we have gone through \nthe creation of this energy bill, we have pushed technology and we have \nbrought those minds into the committee in a bipartisan way and said: \n``Tell us where this can go over the next decade.'' We have truly tried \nin this legislation to create a blueprint for the American people and \nfor the American economy, one that makes predictable what energy costs \nwill be and how it will affect our competitiveness in this country and \ninternationally. At the end of the day, if we do anything that forces \nAmerican business to be at a competitive disadvantage, we have done a \ndisservice to the American worker, who is the recipient of that \nbusiness.\n  We need to vote against the Cantwell amendment. We need to tell the \nAmerican people we have an energy policy. And if we believe that policy \nwill lead us down the road to new technologies this year, next year, 10 \nyears from now, it may be that 20 years from now we are all driving \nhybrid cars. I happen to believe that technology will make the hybrid \ncar, 20 years from now, probably obsolete; there will be a new \ntechnology out there. But I am confident of one thing: You cannot push \nthe mileage standards of automobiles further than where technology will \nallow; that for every place you surge and you try to reach a little too \nfar, you cause, in fact, an unintended consequence on the other side.\n  We will also have an opportunity to vote on Senator Bingaman's \namendment on a renewable portfolio standard, one I know the Senator \nfrom New Mexico is passionate about.\n  I want to correct something that Senator Cantwell said. She said--and \nshe is from Washington--that hydroelectric power makes up a majority of \ntheir electricity generation today, and she is right. The unfortunate \nthing is, hydroelectric power is not considered a renewable source of \nelectricity unless it is new hydro.\n  It is incredible, the history we have in this country of \nhydroelectric generation, but we do not consider that to be a \n``renewable source of electricity.'' The only way hydro would qualify \nunder a renewable portfolio standard is if it is new hydroelectric \ngeneration.\n  For those of us in the Southeast of the United States who for years \nhave used electricity generated by hydro plants to compliment our coal-\nfired generation facilities or our nuclear facilities or our gas-fired \nfacilities, we have understood for some time what made up a portfolio, \nand we assumed part of it was made up of what we considered to be \nrenewable-hydroelectric power.\n  At 50 years old and now in my 11th year in Congress, I am reminded \nthat hydroelectric power is not renewable, that water is not a \nrenewable substance.\n  It is crazy it is not included. If we did include hydroelectric \ngeneration, North Carolina would in all likelihood hit the 10 percent \nmandate required in this amendment. I believe the Presiding Officer \nwould hit the 10 percent possibly in Tennessee today. But the reality \nis we are being asked to accept a renewable portfolio standard that \ndoes not even include the generation of electricity with hydro. It does \nnot require that rural electric cooperatives that generate electricity \nparticipate in the renewable portfolio standard. Electric co-ops \naccount for a sizeable amount of the electricity generated in this \ncountry on an annual basis, but they are not included. We just want to \nplace it on the backs of the ratepayers of investor-owned utilities.\n  I happen to come from a State that is rich with investor-owned \nutilities, but it is rich in electric co-ops and municipal power, \nprobably richer than any State in the country. I defend them, but I do \nnot believe if we put a burden like this on the ratepayers of the \ninvestor-owned utilities that we should leave anybody out and say they \nshould be unaffected.\n\n[[Page S6698]]\n\n  The fact is, what they have tried to do is put the cost of the \nrenewable portfolio standard on the backs of one slice of electric \ngeneration, and that is the ratepayers of investor-owned utilities. \nThey know if it extended to electric co-ops, there would be no way for \nthis amendment to pass. There would be opposition on both sides of the \naisle, on every level of our desks to this amendment.\n  The fact is, today we are here because we need to defeat the Bingaman \namendment for a renewable portfolio standard, but we also need to \ndefeat the Cantwell amendment. She said it is not a mandate but a goal, \na goal that we cannot achieve today based upon available technology and \none we ought not put into this bill, in fact, because it is \nunachievable.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell. I am proud to be \nsubmitting this amendment.\n  Forty-four years ago, John F. Kennedy challenged America to put a man \non the moon by the end of the 1960s. A bipartisan coalition in Congress \njoined with Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon to make this goal a \nreality.\n  Today, we are considering a similarly bold challenge to the Nation--\nto reduce America's dependence on foreign oil by 40 percent by the year \n2025. This challenge is no less important, no less laudable, and no \nless worthy of bipartisan support, Presidential leadership, and \nnational commitment.\n  The bill before us purports to offer a comprehensive energy solution \nfor the future. But, as currently drafted, the bill does nothing more \nthan lead us down the same dangerous and unsustainable path that we \nhave been traveling for the last several decades. Unless we draw the \nline now, outlining a bold change in course, with time enough to \nprepare, we will see the United States in 2025 even more tethered to \nforeign oil, and even more subject to economic shocks, than the United \nStates of 2005. Unless we reverse course, we will continue putting our \neconomic well-being and national security at the mercy of unstable \nforeign governments.\n  Some will argue that the goals in this amendment are unrealistic and \nunattainable. I do not agree with these naysayers. When President \nKennedy announced his challenge in 1961, he said the following: ``This \ndecision demands a major national commitment of scientific and \ntechnical manpower, materiel and facilities, and the possibility of \ntheir diversion from other important activities where they are already \nthinly spread. It means a degree of dedication, organization and \ndiscipline which have not always characterized our research and \ndevelopment efforts.''\n  Likewise, meeting the requirements of the Senator's amendment will \nrequire a similar commitment. But I believe the task before us is much \nsimpler than the one that faced President Kennedy, because we already \nknow how to decrease our reliance on foreign oil. A smart energy policy \nthat focuses on a greater commitment to technology; including hybrid \nand hydrogen fuel cell technology, renewable fuels, and greater \nefficiency can take us a long way, if not the entire way, to the goal \nproposed by the Senator from Washington.\n  As difficult as it may be, we must try to meet the goal set forth in \nthis amendment. We would be far worse off as a country if we just threw \nup our hands and admitted defeat.\n  The people I meet on my travels around Illinois are ready for the \nchallenge. They are tired of giving their hard-earned dollars to \nforeign governments in the form of record-high gasoline prices. They \nare tired of seeing their foreign policy being influenced by America's \ninsatiable need for Middle East oil. They are looking to their leaders \nin Washington for innovative leadership. If we lay down the challenge \nin this amendment, I have every reason to believe that the American \npeople will rise up to meet it--much like they met a similar challenge \n40 years ago.\n  In 1962, President Kennedy traveled to Rice University to speak about \nthe challenge that he had laid down the year before. He stated: \n``Surely the opening vistas of space promise high costs and hardships \nas well as high reward. So it is not surprising that some would have us \nstay where we are a little longer, to rest, to wait. But this city of \nHouston, this State of Texas, this country of the U.S. was not built by \nthose who waited and rested and wished to look behind them.''\n  When it comes to our energy policy, we are long past the point of \nwaiting and resting and looking behind us. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment offered by the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to briefly explain why I \nsupport Senator Cantwell's oil savings amendment to H.R. 6, the Energy \nbill.\n  First, Senator Cantwell's amendment sets a goal for the United States \nof reducing our dependence on foreign sources of oil by 4 percent by \n2025. I do not understand how anyone could argue that it is not in this \nNation's best interests to increase our domestic energy security and \nreduce our dependence on unreliable and undemocratic regimes abroad. We \nall like to talk about energy independence, but our efforts in that \ndirection are lacking, as evidenced by the rapid growth in our \ndependence on oil imports that is projected to continue well into the \nfuture. I think Senator Cantwell's amendment sets a worthy target that \nwe can all work together to achieve.\n  Second, we--the world' s greatest economy--can certainly achieve this \ngoal in a way that not only reduces our reliance on foreign oil but \nspurs new innovation and economic growth, without penalizing any sector \nof our economy. This amendment is not a back-door effort to \ndramatically increase Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, which I \nwould not support. As modified it allows the President the flexibility \nto achieve the oil savings goal with existing authorities, or with new \nauthorities that he or she requests from the Congress. Thus, the goal \ncould be reached through a variety of means, including increased \ninvestments and incentives for hybrid vehicles and other transportation \ntechnologies or increased use of biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel.\n  Additionally, if the President is having difficulty reaching the \ngoal, he or she need only reduce our depenence on foreign oil to the \nmaximum extent practicable, and must ensure reliable and affordable \nenergy for the country, and maintain a healthy economy with strong job \ngrowth.\n  This is a fair and sensible amendment, and I support it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the goals for reducing this \nNation's dependence on foreign oil that are embodied in the Cantwell \namendment. We need to strive for energy independence, and I believe it \nis important to take bold steps toward reducing our oil consumption. \nOur policies have long ignored the problem of U.S. dependence on \nforeign oil, and we remain as vulnerable to oil supply disruptions \ntoday as we have been for decades. Taking the steps necessary to reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil is a critical objective for this country.\n  I have long supported a broad array of Federal efforts to meet this \nobjective. I believe that we need a long-term, comprehensive energy \nplan, and I have supported initiatives that will increase our domestic \nenergy supplies in a responsible manner and provide consumers with \naffordable and reliable energy. There are many provisions included in \nthis bill that will help take important steps in this direction--\nparticularly those provisions of this bill that address energy \nefficiency and renewable energy and will lead us toward greater uses of \nalternative fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel.\n  I have also long advocated Federal efforts that will lead to \nrevolutionary breakthroughs in automotive technology. As many of my \ncolleagues have said, we need a level of leadership similar to the \neffort of a previous generation to put a man on the moon. I believe we \nneed our own moon shot in the area of automotive technology to develop \nalternatives to petroleum and to make more efficient use of all forms \nof energy.\n  We need a significantly larger effort than anything on the drawing \nboards. We need to put greater Federal resources into work on \nbreakthrough technologies--such as hybrid technologies, advanced \nbatteries, advanced clean diesel, and fuel cells--that will provide \npotentially dramatic increases in vehicle fuel economy and help us\n\n[[Page S6699]]\n\nmove toward making this Nation less dependent on foreign oil and \nreducing our emissions of greenhouse gases.\n  Federal Government investment is also essential not only in research \nand development but as a mechanism to push the market toward greater \nuse and acceptance of advanced technologies. For example, expanding the \nrequirements for the Federal Government to purchase advanced technology \nvehicles will help provide a market for advanced technologies. We also \nmust have far greater tax incentives for advanced technologies than \nhave been proposed to date.\n  I believe the goals for reducing our dependence on foreign oil in the \nCantwell amendment can be met by taking bold actions in the areas I \nhave mentioned and without relying on increases in Corporate Average \nFuel Economy standards. Higher CAFE standards will not produce real \nresults--they will only exacerbate the inherent discriminatory features \nin the CAFE system that give an unfair competitive advantage to foreign \nauto manufacturers and have contributed to the loss of manufacturing \njobs in this country. Senator Cantwell and the sponsors of this \namendment have assured the Senate and her amendment was modified so \nthat there are no policy assumptions in this amendment that will \nincrease CAFE standards. The goals of this amendment are laudable, and \nsince they are simply goals--which after the modification can be \nachieved with new authorities, tax incentives for instance, and do not \nrely on use of existing authorities--I can now support the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I strongly support the objective of \nSenator Cantwell's amendment. It is difficult to disagree with \nlegislation that proposes to achieve the important goal of reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil. Unfortunately, the amendment is an exercise \nin setting expectations without establishing how they will be met. As \nsuch, I cannot support it.\n  The job of Congress is not only to determine policy objectives, but \nalso to establish the means to achieving such goals in a manner that \nbest services the public interest. While this amendment sets aggressive \ngoals for cutting America's dependence on foreign oil, it places the \ntotal burden on the President and the administration to develop and \nimplement the measures to reduce our dependence without one iota of \nguidance as to how this reduction should occur. Frankly, that is both a \nrisky and an irresponsible proposition.\n  What if this or any future President were to decide to meet this \namendment's targets by drilling in ANWR, or by raising gasoline taxes? \nThis amendment does not speak to those policy options, and--as shown by \nthe examples I have set forth--the end of reducing our dependence on \nforeign oil does not necessarily justify the means. Instead of relying \non wishful thinking and trust that the executive branch will do the \nright thing, we should consider and approve commonsense policies that \nwill make our Nation more energy efficient, less dependent on foreign \noil, and more competitive in the global energy market, and that will \neffectively address global warming.\n  The national energy policy that we establish in this Congress will \ndeeply impact our security, economy, and our environment. Even though \nwe agree on goals, we cannot in good faith transfer all responsibility \nfor determining how to achieve them to the executive branch. That is a \ndereliction of our duty as Senators--a duty that I take seriously and \nwill not relinquish merely to show that I support the laudable goal of \nreducing our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I support the Cantwell energy security \namendment, which would set a national goal of reducing projected \nimports of foreign oil by 40 percent by 2025 in the United States.\n  I strongly believe we must be more proactive in reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil, and Senator Cantwell's amendment is a great \nstart to accomplishing that goal. The current path we are on is \ndetrimental to numerous facets of our economy, environment and national \nsecurity. This is due to the ongoing instability in the Middle East, \nwhich is where the vast majority of our oil comes from, and coupled \nwith the environmental problems associated with the use of fossil \nfuels. At present, petroleum imports account for fully one-half of our \nnational oil use and one-third of our trade deficit. In addition, the \nuse of oil and other fossil fuels contributes to global climate change, \nair pollution, and acid rain.\n  In order to achieve this ambitious plan we will have to implement \nmany comprehensive energy saving policies. Many people believe this \namendment down the road could raise fuel efficiency standards on \nautomobiles. There are many energy policies we need to pursue to \nachieve this ambitious goal. In the past I have not supported raising \nCAFE standards and I do not believe this amendment would require such a \nchange. In order to make this plan successful we need to support the \ndevelopment of alternative energy, such as ethanol, hybrid vehicle \ntechnology and others.\n  I have long believed that our Nation must implement a sensible \nnational energy policy which emphasizes greater energy conservation and \nefficiency, as well as the development of renewable resources. Simply \nput, we cannot continue to rely on imported oil to meet such a large \npart of our Nation's energy needs and that is why I support Senator \nCantwell's amendment to the energy bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dodd are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All remaining time is controlled by the \nmajority.\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the only time \nremaining is that of the majority. Is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use leader time or, if no one is \ngoing to use their time, I will just use whatever is available.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. REID. If someone from the majority wants to speak, I will be \nhappy to put the vote over for a few minutes for whatever few minutes I \nuse.\n  I, first, want to thank Senator Bingaman for his leadership on the \nrenewable energy issue. He has always been there. It is also important \nto mention Senator Jeffords. Senator Jeffords has been so stalwart. I \nremember an Energy and Water bill that Senator Domenici and I did in \nyears past. We did not put enough renewable in there and Senator \nJeffords brought amendments to the floor and fought us on this on the \nSenate floor. He has been a stalwart.\n  In this particular instance, the leader has been Senator Bingaman, \nand I appreciate very much the work he has done.\n  There is no question in my mind that we must harness the brilliance \nof the Sun, the strength of the wind, and the heat of the Earth to \nprovide renewable energy for our Nation. There are many reasons our \nNation needs to develop more renewable energy. It can power our homes \nand businesses without polluting the air we breath or the water we \ndrink. Renewable energy will protect consumers from wild price swings \nby providing steady, reliable sources of energy. There is a reason we \ncall the famous geothermal geyser Old Faithful, and that is because \nrenewable energy is as old as the wind, as durable as the Sun, and as \nconstant as the Earth.\n  Renewable energy will bolster our national security because it is \nmade in the USA. The supply cannot be manipulated by any foreign power. \nScientists have said, for example, the Nevada Test Site where we have \ndetonated about 1,000 nuclear weapons, one could have solar power that \nwould supply the whole Nation with electricity.\n  We do not have that, of course. We have no solar energy at the Nevada\n\n[[Page S6700]]\n\nTest Site, but it is an example of what can be done.\n  Finally, renewable energy creates jobs, often in rural areas that \nneed them the most. Nevada is a perfect example. Most of our geothermal \nenergy is in rural Nevada. The steam has been coming from the ground in \nthose places since man started coming there. When the pioneers came \nacross Nevada, one of the places they would come after leaving the area \nthat is now Utah is this dry, parched desert. The first thing they \nwould see is water in a place near Gerlach, NV. The first few pioneers, \nimmigrants, and their animals went into that water. They did not do \nthat very often. They could not do it because it would kill them. It \nwas boiling water. As thirsty as they were, they would have to siphon \nthe water down and cool it.\n  It is still there, the same hot water, the same steam coming from \nareas around Gerlach. There is tremendous potential for renewable \nenergy. In 2002 and 2003, the Senate passed the renewable energy \nelectricity standard requiring that 10 percent of the electricity sold \nby utilities be generated from renewable energy sources. We should do \nno less this year. It would be even better if we could match our \nfriends in Europe and achieve 20 percent.\n  Other nations have been developing renewable energy resources at a \nmuch faster rate than the United States. In 1990, America produced 90 \npercent of the world's wind power. Today, it is less than 25 percent. \nGermany now has the lead in wind energy; Japan in solar energy. We have \nan opportunity to regain the position as a world leader in renewable \nenergy. In the United States today we get about 2 percent of our \nelectricity from renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, \ngeothermal, and biomass. That is a paltry sum. The potential is there \nfor a much greater supply.\n  The renewable electricity standard and the production tax credit are \ncritical to growth of renewable energy in America. The State of Nevada \nis blessed with enough geothermal energy to generate one-third of the \nneeds of Nevada today, but geothermal supply is only about 2 percent of \nour power. I am happy that Nevada has adopted one of the most \naggressive renewable portfolio standards in the Nation. We set a goal \nof generating 15 percent of our electricity with renewable energy by \nthe year 2013. Our legislature is to be commended. They did that 2 \nyears ago.\n  Developing these resources will protect our environment, will help \nconsumers, and will create jobs in our State. If Nevada can meet its \nrenewable energy goal of 15 percent by 2013, then the Nation certainly \nshould be able to meet a goal of 10 percent by 2020.\n\n  Many States are blessed with abundant supplies of renewable energy \nresources. Twenty-one States have already adopted renewable electricity \nstandards. If we consider environmental and health effects, the real \ncosts of energy become more apparent, and we see the renewable energy \nis a winner. A national renewable electricity standard by 2020 will \nalso spur nearly $80 billion in new capital investment and $5 billion \nin new property tax revenues to communities.\n  Let's never lose sight of the fact that renewable energy sources are \ndomestic sources of energy and using them instead of foreign sources \ncontributes to our energy security.\n  I urge my colleagues, both the majority and minority, to vote for the \nBingaman amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield back all remaining time on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Parliamentary inquiry: What is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). There are 2 minutes evenly \ndivided on the Bingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, when I go home on the Fourth of July \nand my constituents ask what I did about high natural gas prices, high \ngasoline prices, about our competition with China and Japan and India \nto keep our jobs, I am going to tell them I voted no on the Bingaman \namendment to order utilities to make 10 percent of their energy from a \nlimited number of renewable fuels, because it is an $18 billion \nelectric rate increase over 20 years. At a time of high natural gas \nprices, high gasoline prices, the last thing we should do is an $18 \nbillion electric rate increase over 20 years.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Mexico will tell us that it will \nbe offset by natural gas reductions, but that is only if there is a $5 \nnatural gas rate in 2025. One thing we know is, it is a big electric \nrate increase when we should be reducing prices.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment which says \nutilities that produce electricity in this country by the year 2020 \nshould ensure that up to 10 percent of their electricity comes from \nrenewable sources. It doesn't specify which renewable sources. It gives \nthem a variety of choices. According to the Energy Information Agency, \nthe $18 billion is more than offset by the savings these utilities will \nget by not having to invest in additional traditional sources of \ngeneration. This will result in a reduction in electricity rates and a \nreduction in gas rates, according to our own Department of Energy. I \nbelieve this is good legislation. I hope my colleagues will support it. \nIt will strengthen this bill and give us a much better energy bill to \ntake to conference.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Snowe of Maine be added as a \ncosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 791.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Are we, under \nregular order, scheduled to move on to another amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no amendment pending at this time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia would like to engage in a colloquy with the Senator from \nNew Mexico. For that purpose, I yield to the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in hope that the chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, the Senator from New Mexico, \nwill engage in a colloquy with myself, as well as Senator Smith of \nOregon, regarding some concerns we have about the renewable portfolio \nstandard amendment.\n  While I support the development of renewable energy and other clean \nenergy resources, I believe that each region of the country has the \nability to develop these resources in a variety of ways. In fact, at \nleast 21 States already have a State RPS, and many other States have \nprograms to promote renewable energy, all of this being accomplished \nwithout a Federal mandate.\n  The problem with the RPS amendment is that it imposes a one-size-\nfits-all mandate on the whole country without regard for whether the \nrequirement is technologically or economically feasible. Not every \nState or region has the same amount of renewable energy available to \ncomply with the rigid 10-percent RPS mandate the amendment would \nimpose. As a result, utilities in States that do not have enough \nrenewable energy will need to comply with the RPS mandate by purchasing \ncredits at a cost of 1\\1/2\\ cents per kilowatt hour. Mr. President, \n1\\1/2\\ cents may not sound like a lot of money, but when it is \nmultiplied by the number of kilowatts needed to comply with a 10-\npercent RPS by 2020, it can add up to billions of dollars--billions of \ndollars in what should be called a tax on consumers. I call it a tax \nbecause that is essentially what it is. It is dollars that will come \nout of the pockets of consumers and go straight to the Federal \nGovernment. That makes no sense at all.\n  If the Government wants more renewable energy, it does not make sense \nto take billions of dollars away from consumers in a region simply \nbecause they do not have access to adequate renewable resources at a \nreasonable cost.\n  If there must be an RPS provision in this Energy bill--and I do not \nbelieve it is necessary--it must, at a minimum, allow more flexibility \nfor each State and region.\n  I ask that the distinguished chairman commit to work with me in the \nconference to modify the provision to allow greater flexibility and to \nprotect consumers from unnecessary cost increases. In particular, I ask \nthat we work together to address the regional issues inherent in any \nsuch provision and ensure that States that do not have the \ntechnological capabilities to comply with the RPS mandate are not \npenalized. I note that even many supporters of a Federal RPS mandate \nrecognize the need for State-by-State flexibility.\n  The Senator from Oregon does have a comment relative to this issue, \nand I yield to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for his \ncomments. He reflects well the views of his State and the region.\n  Those of us, such as myself, who voted for this RPS standard \nunderstand the regional differences. In my view, an important purpose \nof an RPS is to diversify the Nation's energy supply. I understand that \ndifferent States have different resources. For that reason, I believe \nit is appropriate to provide for greater flexibility for the States.\n  I would like to work with the Senator from Georgia and the \ndistinguished chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to \nmake appropriate modifications to the provision.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his \ncomments. Again, I strongly oppose the RPS, but if there must be one in \nthe Energy bill, I ask the distinguished chairman if he will commit to \nwork with the Senator from Oregon and myself in conference to make \nthese modifications to the provision to ensure that the RPS promotes \nrenewable energy where it is most needed without harming consumers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I respond by saying to the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia and the distinguished Senator from \nOregon that I would be delighted to work with them and, obviously, with \nother members of the conference in an effort to do what I can to ensure \nthat each State is treated fairly and that none are penalized by an \noverly rigid mandate.\n  I am fully aware of the disparity between States, and I say to the \nSenator from Georgia and the Senator from Oregon that their States were \non the map showing they are the have-not States in terms of wind. They \nhave a lot of other items with which they can meet a standard. \nRenewable is going to be the test here, and it is going to be \ndifficult.\n  The Senate has spoken--close vote. We will do what we can in \nconference. The Senator understands there is no such provision in the \nHouse bill. We will do our best to see what we can do to recognize the \nSenator's position and yet recognize the closeness of the vote and the \nvery severe repercussions on some States.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his comments, \nand I look forward to working with him.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today with a profound sense of \noptimism and appreciation. We have not enacted a comprehensive energy \nbill since 1992. Many programs need reauthorization and many need \nrevision. Programs and demonstrations must be updated to today's and \ntomorrow's energy parameters.\n  I have long said that the Nation needs a comprehensive blueprint for \nan energy policy that will take us in advanced directions, away from \ndependence on declining reserves of fossil fuel and foreign sources of \noil. We need a policy which will reconcile growth and energy \nconservation in our transportation, manufacturing, utility, and \nconsumer sectors across the Nation. We need to bring down the high \ncosts of electricity and gasoline for the country, particularly in my \nState of Hawaii, and pursue greater energy independence from petroleum \nproducts. S. 10, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, provides the best \nopportunity that I have seen in years.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, I am familiar with cutting-edge technologies and approaches \nto generating energy. I was closely involved in crafting several parts \nof this energy bill--legislation that contains three bills that I have \nintroduced, and a hydrogen title that was crafted with the leadership \nof Senators Dorgan, Graham, and myself as members of the Senate \nHydrogen and Fuel Cell Caucus. I have contributed to comprehensive \nenergy bills in 2002 and in 2003.\n  I wish to thank both Senators from New Mexico for their leadership \nand hard work in bridging many regional\n\n[[Page S6702]]\n\ndifferences in this comprehensive bill, while still keeping in mind the \noverall vision for an energy bill. The Energy Committee, under the \nleadership of Senators Domenici and Bingaman, held a series of \nstructured hearings that were informational briefings from a broad \nspectrum of industry, environmental groups, non-profits, and small \nbusinesses. Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman are to be commended \nfor keeping an open mind about the potential for new energy sources and \na balance of renewable and fossil fuels, science and research and \ndevelopment. In sum, this is a balanced energy bill.\n  The energy policies that we address in this legislation cover a vast \nrange of authorities and a patchwork of unruly regional alliances. This \ntranslates to an enormous challenge, and I appreciate Senator Domenici \nand Senator Bingaman's hard work and the work of their staffs. I want \nto compliment them on crafting an energy bill that will help the Nation \nas well as States with special ``off-grid'' energy needs such as \nAlaska, my state of Hawaii, and insular territories and commonwealths.\n  I support this bill and voted for it in our Committee. The bill is \nwell-balanced between renewable energy production, energy efficiency \nprovisions, oil and gas technologies, electricity provisions, and \nalternate and visionary sources of energy such as hydrogen. The bill \ninvests in the Nation's Research and Development for energy \ntechnologies, something that we must continue doing to remain leaders \nin the world, as global demand for energy increases. The last title of \nthe bill, Title Fourteen, provides much-needed incentives for \ninnovative technologies, through loan guarantees for new energy \nfacilities and projects.\n  I greatly appreciate the inclusion of title VIII, the Hydrogen title. \nI am an original cosponsor of S. 665, the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell \nTechnology Act of 2005, and worked with Senators Dorgan, Graham, and \nother members of the Hydrogen Caucus to craft this bill, which is \nincluded in S. 10. The bill reauthorizes and amends the Spark M. \nMatsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of \n1990, which has been the basic authority for Federal hydrogen programs \nfor the last 20 years. Reauthorization of the Matsunaga Act is badly \nneeded and I have been working toward that goal for several years. The \nbill provides for robust R for hydrogen fuel cells. It includes a \nprovision to enhance sources of renewable fuels and biofuels for \nhydrogen production among its R priorities, which is very important \nfor isolated areas such as Pacific islands and rural areas across the \nNation.\n\n  In addition to the R section, the bill includes hydrogen fuel cell \ndemonstration programs for vehicles and for national parks, remote \nisland areas, and on Indian tribal land. The bill authorizes system \ndemonstrations, including distributed energy systems that incorporate \nrenewable hydrogen production and off-grid electricity production. In \nother words, the bill includes a broad range of hydrogen energy \napplications that will reach out to rural communities and lower income \nfamilies, hospitals, military facilities--not solely vehicle \napplications and infrastructure. It recognizes the importance of \ndeveloping hydrogen from renewable sources and demonstration projects \nfor stationary and distributed energy systems in remote areas and \nislands.\n  I am pleased that the bill contains my request for an energy study in \nHawaii. I thank Senators Domenici and Bingaman for including my bill, \nS. 436, the Hawaii Energy Study bill. Hawaii is uniquely dependent on \ncrude oil for its energy sources. Before we invest in a different \nenergy mix and infrastructure, we need to make transparent all the \ndynamics between fuels, generating electricity, and the consequences of \nthe directions we choose.\n  The bill directs the Secretary of Energy to assess the short- and \nlong-term prospects of oil supply disruptions and price volatility and \ntheir impacts on Hawaii, and to assess the economic relationship \nbetween oil-fired generation of electricity from residual fuel and \nrefined products consumed for transportation needs of Hawaii. In \nHawaii, the costs of gasoline, electricity, and jet fuel are \nintertwined in an intricate relationship, because they all come from \nthe same feedstock, and changes in the use of one can potentially drive \nconsumer prices up or down.\n  Although we approved an ethanol title yesterday, I would like to add \na few words on the topic of the ethanol mandate. First, I would like to \nextend my appreciation to Senators Talent and Johnson, and their staff, \nwho have shown great leadership in working with committee members to \nunderstand the challenges that States face with a Federal ethanol \nmandate. I am particularly sensitive to States' needs with respect to \nrenewable fuels and renewable energy. In Hawaii and other remote areas \nwe lack the ability to produce ethanol. We would like to have that \nability to free us from importing ethanol and the rising price of crude \noil.\n  Hawaii has had the highest gasoline prices in the Nation over the \nlast 10 years. We also have a State mandate to use ethanol, enacted \nlast year and due to go into effect in spring of 2006. Our State \nethanol mandate is driven by the desire to increase the use of biomass, \nincrease the renewable content in our transportation fuels, and \ndecrease the imports of crude oil to Hawaii. These are all good goals. \nOur sugar interests and ethanol producers are struggling to put \nfacilities into place to produce ethanol because we need to meet our \nState mandate.\n  This is why Senator Inouye and I greatly appreciate the inclusion of \ncellulosic and sugar cane-to-ethanol provisions in this bill. The \ndemonstration provisions will greatly assist us in reaching our ethanol \ngoals in the State.\n  We also need a loan guarantee program to help our producers. The loan \nguarantee program in the amendment we adopted is more restrictive than \nthe one approved and reported by the Energy Committee. Hawaii's ethanol \nfacilities are projected to produce between 7 and 15 million gallons of \nethanol and the market in Hawaii is about 45 million gallons. Hawaii \nhas an independent market and a State requirement for ethanol. Our \nplants will be smaller than in other States and would greatly benefit \nfrom a loan guarantee program for smaller producers. This is very \nimportant to my State and I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto further address this issue in conference.\n  In other titles of the Energy bill, I am pleased that title VI, \nNuclear Matters, includes provisions of a bill I introduced earlier \nthis year, S. 979, to require the Department of Energy to provide for a \nfacility for the safe storage of greater-than-class-C radioactive \nwaste. Radioactive sealed sources, which can be used to create a \n``dirty bomb,'' are all around us and pose a great risk. The \nadministration must take action to ensure the control and safe disposal \nof those sources.\n  The energy bill also includes S. 711, a bill I introduced with \nSenator Murkowski to reauthorize the methane hydrates program at the \nDepartment of Energy. Hydrates are important--the U.S. has enormous \nhydrate resources, perhaps as much as a quarter of the world's gas \nhydrates. As increased demand draws down natural gas reserves, we must \nlook to additional sources, such as hydrates, for the future. The bill \nincludes a robust methane hydrates program that includes the \nrecommendations of the National Research Council's study on the program \nand future of methane hydrates.\n  We still have much work ahead of us. The bill does not include fuel \neconomy standards which significantly increase the fuel efficiency of \nautomobiles and are a vital component of a comprehensive energy policy. \nThe American people want to spend less money on gasoline, be less \ndependent on foreign oil, address the issue of climate change, and \nbreathe cleaner air. Strong fuel economy standards help provide some \nsolutions. Also the bill does not address the growing emissions of \ncarbon dioxide, which are radically changing the world around us. I am \nhopeful we will address these matters on the floor and I look forward \nto the debate.\n  Again, I appreciate and commend my colleagues Senators Domenici and \nBingaman on the bipartisan nature of this bill and the process by which \nit was developed.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 794\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator \nBingaman, I send a managers' amendment to the desk. It has been agreed \nto on both sides, is predominantly technical, and\n\n[[Page S6703]]\n\nhas been agreed to by anyone who has any interest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 794) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I would like to begin my remarks by \nthanking Chairman Domenici and Senator Bingaman, the ranking member, as \nwell as their staffs, for the hard work and excellent effort they have \nmade in preparing an energy bill. Their leadership has allowed the \nSenate to come together on a comprehensive energy policy that is of \nparamount importance to our Nation's future security and economic \ninterests. While there are provisions in this bill about which I am \ntroubled, I did vote for it in committee and would like very much to do \nso here on the floor. But there are some reservations I have. There are \nsome things that were omitted, some that have actually been included \nand others that might be included about which I would like to speak, \none in particular is one of great importance to the State of New \nJersey.\n  I see my esteemed colleague Senator Frank Lautenberg here as well. He \nwill be speaking about this issue. That is the threat of oil and gas \ndrilling off the coast of southern New Jersey's 127 miles of shore.\n  All of you heard Senators Nelson and Martinez speak on the floor \nearlier this week about Florida's treasured coast and how important it \nis to Florida's environment and economy that its coast be protected \nfrom any weakening of the moratoria on drilling in the Outer \nContinental Shelf. My colleagues from Florida should take every step \nnecessary to protect their beaches and coastal waters. As a Senator \nfrom a coastal State where tourism is the second largest industry, I \nthink Senator Lautenberg and I also want to take every step necessary \nto protect the New Jersey shore from any effort to weaken the \nlongstanding, bipartisan moratorium that exists on drilling in the \nOuter Continental Shelf.\n  As I understand it, the chairman and ranking member have both agreed \nto oppose any amendments that open up the OCS moratoria on submerged \nlands off of Florida's coast. I am, of course, pleased that recognition \nwas taken in that instance. But it is a bit disconcerting that the rest \nof the moratoria on offshore drilling was not addressed. Many OCS areas \nstill seem vulnerable to something that could destroy that moratoria, \nand that is a problem. It is a problem for the State of New Jersey. I \nthink it is for many, if not all, of the other coastal States that are \nprotected by the moratoria.\n  This has been a priority of mine since I have been in the Senate. \nAlong with Senator Lautenberg, I introduced the Clean Ocean and Safe \nTourism Anti-Drilling Act in the 107th, 108th, and 109th Congresses. \nThis bill would make permanent the moratoria on drilling in the Mid- \nand North Atlantic Planning Areas, as opposed to having it be an issue \nthat is dealt with year to year in the appropriations process or by \nExecutive order.\n  I know, with certainty, the people of New Jersey--I mean with \ncertainty--do not want to see oil and gas rigs off their coast. The \nJersey Shore is one of the fastest growing parts of the State of New \nJersey. It is in the most densely populated State already. The New \nJersey shore is one of those things that defines our State. We want to \nmaintain the beauty and cleanliness of our beaches as well as protect \nour fishing grounds as they make up a huge portion of our State's \nrevenue.\n  The New Jersey Department of Commerce calculates that tourism in our \nState generates more than $31 billion in spending. Almost all of that \nis focused on our shore. It directly and indirectly supports 836,000 \njobs, more than 20 percent of the total State employment. In addition, \nit generates about $16.6 billion in wages and $5.5 billion in tax \nrevenues for the State. It is a big deal for us, a very big deal. If we \nare going to take a risk with our shoreline, we must first look at the \ncost-benefit analysis.\n  Any threat of drilling, any threat to New Jersey's environment and \neconomy compel me to stand here and make sure people understand how \nimportant it is to us.\n  New Jersey is not alone in this. This is something that people \nrecognize up and down the eastern seaboard and on the western coast.\n  New Jersey is already a State that is carrying a heavy load in terms \nof supporting the energy production needs and the refining needs of \nthis Nation. We have three nuclear powerplants. We export energy. We \nhave many traditional powerplants, and support siting of an LNG \nterminal. We are also a\n\n[[Page S6704]]\n\nplace that has been supportive of alternative energy. We are moving in \nthe direction toward all of those things that promote efficiency. New \nJersey is the east coast hub for oil refining, for the chemical \nindustry. We are doing our part in growing and sustaining the Nation's \nenergy resources.\n  But risking and exploiting our shore, to do that is a step too far. I \nrepeat, it is a step too far, risking what I think no one else would do \nif it were related to their economy, their people's quality of life, \ntheir people's needs.\n  I am not the only Senator who has concerns about amendments to this \nbill that will weaken the moratorium. I have been in contact with a \nnumber of coastal State Senators. We will have a letter that speaks \nagainst any changes to the current OCS moratoria. My concern about some \nof the provisions of the bill, including the inventory provision, are \nreinforced by some of the rumblings I hear about trying to move further \nin opening up this Outer Continental Shelf.\n  I fear we are on a slippery slope that would lead to eventual \ndrilling off the New Jersey coast, which is of great concern and will \nlead to the kinds of actions that can stand in the way of the overall \nbill. It will not be just a New Jersey issue; it will be a broader \nissue.\n  Given the minimal benefit of offshore drilling--at least based on the \nscience that has been applied to this issue--I don't see the need to be \nthreatening over 800,000 jobs and the state revenues I mentioned \nearlier for what the Minerals Management Service (MMS) estimated in \n2000 to be roughly 196 million barrels of oil off our coast. That, by \nthe way, is enough to fuel this country's needs for only 10 days. The \nMMS also estimated a mean of only 2.7 trillion cubic feet of natural \ngas for the entire Mid-Atlantic region. Compare that to areas already \nopen to drilling in the Gulf--not those adjacent to Florida--that \ncontain 18.9 billion barrels of oil and 258 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas.\n  I don't know what kind of cost-benefit analysis is being taken to be \npushing forward with this offshore inventory, when the studies have \nalready shown the great capacity of one area versus what is expected to \nbe found off of New Jersey's coast.\n  We want to protect this moratoria. It is an issue I take very \nseriously. We hear there is the potential for weakening the moratoria \nin another way by providing for potential amendments that allow States \nto opt out of the moratoria and possibly even revenue-sharing \namendments that would encourage states to opt out of the moratoria. \nAllowing States to opt out would be detrimental to States' neighbors. \nThis is an argument long understood and argued by Florida. New Jersey's \ncoastline, obviously, is very close to other States. Tides move across \nstate borders and fisheries don't recognize state borders. One State's \nchoice could end up being detrimental to another.\n  We have ample reason to say that coastal states ought to be concerned \nabout this issue. In fact, we have, for planning purposes, divided up \nthe country into planning areas. The Mid-Atlantic and the North \nAtlantic OCS Planning Areas, which extend from North Carolina to Maine, \nis of most concern to New Jersey. But I understand the same arguments \nfrom everyone else in every other planning area. Water does not \nrecognize the borders we have established in a political contest. We \nneed to protect the offshore moratoria so that we can protect our \nbeaches and our shores as we go forward.\n  Mr. President I have here a bipartisan, bicameral ``Dear Colleague'' \nletter from almost every member of the New Jersey Congressional \nDelegation that expresses the concern of those who represent New Jersey \nthat this moratoria be sustained. I also have a bipartisan letter \nsigned by over 100 Members of the House of Representatives, both sides \nof the aisle, stating their strong support for the legislative \nmoratoria on activity in submerged lands of the Outer Continental \nShelf. I ask unanimous consent that these two letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 2005.\n     Hon. Peter Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman and Ranking Member: We are writing to express \n     our strong opposition to any amendment to the Senate Energy \n     bill that would weaken or destroy the 24-year moratoria on \n     drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).\n       As we understand, you have agreed not to vote for any \n     amendments that alter the current OCS moratoria with respect \n     to submerged lands off of Florida's coast.\n       While believe that the current OCS moratoria off the \n     Florida's coast should be protected, we are deeply concerned \n     that this agreement leaves the coasts of our states \n     vulnerable to amendments that would weaken the moratoria off \n     other areas of the Outer Continental Shelf.\n       As senators of coastal states whose environment and \n     economies would be in serious danger should the OCS moratoria \n     be weakened in any way, we will oppose any provision that \n     would threaten the moratoria, including, but not limited to \n     amendments allowing states of opt out of the OCS moratoria or \n     provide for revenue-sharing as an incentive for states to opt \n     out of the moratoria.\n       We are liking your commitment to oppose any amendments that \n     endanger the moratoria on one oil and gas leases in the \n     entire Outer Continental Shelf. As you know, Congress has \n     infused language protecting the current OCS moratoria in \n     annual appropriations bills since 1982. In addition, \n     President George H.W. Bush declared a leasing moratorium on \n     many OCS areas and President Clinton issued a memorandum to \n     the Secretary of the Interior that extended the moratorium \n     through 2012 and included additional OCS areas.\n       Given this history, any change to the moratoria will be a \n     dramatic change in policy. It is our hope that this important \n     bill will not get bogged down by this issue, but without \n     assurances that you would oppose any amendments that would \n     undermine the current moratoria, we will be forced to use all \n     procedural tactics to protect our precious resources.\n       We hope we will be able to work together with you to \n     resolve this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jon S. Corzine, Paul Sarbanes, John F. Kerry, Dianne \n           Feinstein, Patty Murray, Frank R. Lautenberg, Edward M. \n           Kennedy, Barbara Boxer, and Ron Wyden.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2005.\n     Hon. Charles Taylor,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Interior and Environment, Committee \n         on Appropriations, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Norm Dicks,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Interior and Environment, \n         Committee on Appropriations, Longworth House Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Taylor and Ranking Member Dicks: We are \n     writing to express our strong support for the longstanding \n     bipartisan legislative moratorium on new mineral leasing \n     activity on submerged lands of the Outer Continental Shelf \n     (OCS). We are deeply appreciative of the leadership your \n     Subcommittee has shown on this issue over the years and hope \n     to work with you this year to continue this vital protection.\n       The legislative moratorium language prohibits the use of \n     federal funds for offshore leasing, pre-leasing and other oil \n     and gas drilling-related activities in moratoria areas, \n     enhancing protection of those areas from offshore oil and gas \n     development. As you know, in 1990 President George H.W. Bush \n     signed an executive memorandum placing a ten-year moratorium \n     on new leasing on the OCS. In 1998, this moratorium was \n     renewed by President Bill Clinton and extended until 2012. As \n     you know, President George W. Bush endorsed the moratorium in \n     his 2006 budget. These actions have all been met with public \n     acclaim and as necessary steps to preserve the economic and \n     environmental value of our nation's coasts.\n       With a renewed interest in developing natural gas and oil \n     on the OCS, we believe it is again imperative for Congress to \n     reaffirm its authority on this issue. Therefore, we \n     respectfully urge you to include the OCS moratorium language \n     in the fiscal year 2006 Interior and Environment \n     Appropriations legislation. Specifically, we ask you to use \n     the language in Sections 107, 108 and 109, Division E, \n     Department of the Interior and Related Agencies of the fiscal \n     year 2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-447). \n     These sections restrict oil and gas activities within the OCS \n     in the Georges Bank-North Atlantic planning area, Mid-\n     Atlantic and South Atlantic planning area, Eastern Gulf of \n     Mexico planning area, Northern, Southern, and Central \n     California planning areas, and Washington and Oregon planning \n     area.\n       Once again, we encourage the Subcommittee to support these \n     important provisions, which represent over 20 years of \n     bipartisan agreement on the importance of protecting the \n     environmentally and economically valuable coastal areas of \n     the United States. Thank you for your consideration of this \n     request.\n           Sincerely,\n         Members of the House of Representatives:\n\n         Lois Capps, Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham, Jeff Miller, Jim \n           Davis, Michael\n\n[[Page S6705]]\n\n           Michaud, Madeleine Bordallo, Ginny Brown-Waite, Jay \n           Inslee, Frank LoBiondo, Rob Simmons, Mark Foley, Jim \n           Langevin, Ed Case, Jim McGovern, Sherrod Brown, Chris \n           Smith, Dennis Cardoza, Frank Pallone, Jr., G.K. \n           Butterfield, Tom Feeney.\n         Pete Stark, Robert Wexler, Anna Eshoo, Zoe Lofgren, \n           Katherine Harris, Jerry Nadler, Carolyn Maloney, Alcee \n           Hastings, Mike Honda, Hilda Solis, Grace Napolitano, \n           Mark Kennedy, Brian Baird, Susan Davis, Sam Farr, Clay \n           Shaw, Christopher Shays, Rush Holt, Betty McCollum, \n           Ellen Tauscher.\n         Barbara Lee, Dennis Moore, Raul Grijalva, Chris Van \n           Hollen, Rahm Emanuel, Nick Rahall, Loretta Sanchez, Tom \n           Allen, Anthony Weiner, Jan Schakowsky, Brad Sherman, \n           Jim McDermott, Kendrick Meek, Bob Etheridge, Dale \n           Kildee, George Miller, Donald Payne, Tom Lantos, Earl \n           Blumenauer, Maxine Waters.\n         Wayne Gilchrest, Rosa DeLauro, Nancy Pelosi, Richard \n           Neal, Dennis Kucinich, Ed Markey, Henry Waxman, Michael \n           McNulty, Michael Bilirakis, Jane Harman, Bart Stupak, \n           Robert Menendez, Barney Frank, Lynn Woolsey, Luis \n           Gutierrez, Jim Saxton, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, William \n           Delahunt, Peter DeFazio, Mike Thompson, Juanita \n           Millender-McDonald.\n         David Wu, Carolyn Maloney, Bob Filner, Mario Diaz-Balart, \n           Robert Andrews, Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Xavier Becerra, \n           Howard Berman, Walter Jones, Connie Mack, Diane Watson, \n           Doris Matsui, Linda Sanchez, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, \n           Ric Keller, Adam Schiff, Corrine Brown, Jim Costa, Joe \n           Baca, Bill Pascrell, and Eliot Engel.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. This is a big deal for the State of New Jersey. It is \nfor anyone who is exposed to the coast and has a tremendous amount of \nindustry and tourism that is the livelihood of those individuals who \nlive near the shore. We can avoid the conflict as it relates to the \noverall energy policy. But it is the responsibility of those who are to \ndefend the interests of our State, to stand up firmly to protect our \neconomy, to protect our environment, to protect our quality of life. We \ndo not need this conflict with regard to this bill.\n  I hope my colleagues will keep that in mind in the days ahead. \nOtherwise, there will be those who have to fight in ways that are not \nour preferred approach especially when we would like to get a \nbipartisan energy bill to go forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first let me say to my friend and \ncolleague from New Jersey how much I admire his commitment to our State \nand to the things that protect our environment and our well-being. I am \nvery proud of Senator Corzine. I have mixed feelings about whether I \nwant him to win the race in New Jersey because it is nice to have a \nhometown boy around.\n  I join Senator Corzine in this attempt to protect our State from \nbeing affected by drilling for oil off our shore line. When I was a \nboy, I had occasion to spend time at the New Jersey shore. It was, for \nme, a matter of almost paradisiacal value to be able to get to that \nshore and never think about whether we were going to step on plastics, \nneedles, oil spills, or anything like that. It was so much a part of \nour culture that to change it in any way that we do not have to is an \nact of poor judgment.\n  The top of the list, as far as we are concerned, is the New Jersey \nshore. We call it ``the shore.'' In the summertime, few things are \nbetter than a day at the beach, watching your children or your \ngrandchildren play in the surf or go out on a fishing boat or learn \nsomething about marine life. We have seen times when a spill occurs how \nit spoils an entire area.\n  We are at a time now where in desperation we are searching for ways \nto make up for our profligate use of oil. We are looking around, trying \nto find ways to substitute for the bad judgment we used for so many \nyears, for letting it go, for not requiring cars to meet standards for \noil consumption or gas consumption.\n  Hurting our environment, having oil ruin our most delicate and \nprecious resources. It is just not right.\n  If one wants to fish or walk along the boardwalk, those from New \nJersey go to the shore. If you want an evening's recreation, you go to \nthe shore. It is nearby. It is part of our life. It is part of what we \nthink of as the periphery of our State: 127 miles of shore line, the \nmajor economic engine for New Jersey.\n  Tourism, as we heard from my colleague, is a $30-billion industry and \nsupports hundreds of thousands of jobs. Seventy percent of all the \nState's tourism revenues originate at the shores. Our shores are very \nimportant to us. But it goes beyond the economy. It goes beyond all \nkinds of things that one might think. When you look at the marine \necology, when you see what happens with clam beds or shellfish beds, we \ncannot fish them any more because of contamination, because of toxins. \nThose affect our everyday lives.\n  For 35 States in this country, the coast is at our door, the shore is \nright there for us--for 35 coastal States. Of course, it includes the \nStates in the Great Lakes area. They too have an interest in protecting \ntheir waters. So when anyone proposes something that could put our \nshores at risk, we take it very seriously.\n  Of course, that brings us to the bill we are currently considering. \nThere has been a great deal of discussion about violating our \nlongstanding prohibition against offshore drilling by allowing States \nto opt out of the moratorium. Now, what would that mean? We recently \nhad a spill in the Delaware River. Did it do more damage to New Jersey \nthan it did to Pennsylvania or Delaware? It damaged all of them. Oceans \nknow no boundaries, unless we put up a seawall that extends beyond the \nborders of our State way out into the ocean and say: OK, you can drill \non that side but not the other.\n  I see the majority leader and Democratic leader looking at me so \nwistfully, and I wonder if it is in admiration or whether it is \nsomething else they had in mind.\n  Mr. REID. Admiration.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield, provided I do not lose the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we will have a very short colloquy here as \nto what to expect over the next several days. It will take 3 or 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. President, Senators have been asking about the schedule for the \nafternoon, tomorrow, and Monday. First of all, let me congratulate the \nchairman and ranking member. We are making good progress. The fact that \nwe do not have a lot of amendments flowing out tonight or a lot of \nrequests even for tomorrow or Monday is a good sign. That, coupled with \nthe fact we made substantial progress, leaves me very optimistic. We \ndealt with ethanol and oil consumption. So we are making progress.\n  I will come back to what we are going to have to do next week. We \nwill remain in session this afternoon for Members to offer additional \nenergy-related amendments. However, if the amendment requires a \nrollcall vote, we would order that for next week because of the \nschedule of tomorrow. We will have no further rollcall votes today. \nAfter our business today, we will return to the bill on Monday.\n  I do want to continue to rely on the continued efforts of our \ncolleagues to come forward and offer amendments now. They have the \nopportunity this afternoon, early into the evening, and throughout \nMonday.\n  I do want to put our colleagues on notice that if it looks as though \nthere is any question about finishing this bill Thursday or Friday of \nnext week--I have told Senators on our side of the aisle to expect \nvotes on Friday, but we are going to complete this bill next week. If \nthere is any question about that, I do want to put our colleagues on \nnotice that I likely will file cloture on Wednesday. And that is not \neven a veiled threat at all, but it demonstrates the importance on \nbehalf of our leadership, working with the Democratic leader, that we \nneed to move ahead now and that we will finish this bill next week.\n  Finally, it is also our intention on the Bolton nomination to \nreconsider the cloture vote on Monday evening. I mentioned earlier that \nwe might do that today, but discussions have continued, constructive \ndiscussions have continued over the course of yesterday and over the \ncourse of today, and that being the case, we have elected to have that \nvote on Monday evening. That vote will likely occur--I have not talked \nspecifically with the Democratic leader--around 6 o'clock. Therefore, \nSenators should be present for that important vote.\n  Let me turn to the Democratic leader. I would ask if he concurs that \nwe must finish this bill next week. And that is why, indeed, I \nmentioned we\n\n[[Page S6706]]\n\nmay have to file cloture, if we do not make continued progress.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the two managers of the bill are here. They \nare ready to take amendments. All amendments cannot be offered next \nweek. When we come to these bills, it is always: I am not quite ready; \nI will do it tomorrow or next week. That time has arrived. We have \nworked through some very difficult amendments this week--three \nextremely difficult amendments. They are disposed of now. They were \ncomplicated. They were difficult in the eyes of many.\n  As I see it, Mr. Leader, I think the big issue left, in major scope, \nis the global warming issue. A number of Senators on both sides are \nconcerned about this. I would hope that an amendment would be offered \nMonday when we come in, debate this however long it takes, within a \nreasonable period of time, and dispose of it, maybe Tuesday. I just \nthink it is time we move on.\n\n  I think what the majority leader has outlined, in consultation with \nme, is extremely good; that we are going to finish this bill next week. \nAnd no one has been jammed on time. It has been a hard week also \nbecause there have been funerals and events that have taken some of our \ntime, but we have worked our way through that.\n  I think it would be good for the country that they see we are now \nlegislating. We have had a number of problems earlier in the year. \nThose are over. And now the leader has said he wishes to pass a couple \nof appropriations bills before we leave in August. That would set a \ngood tone. The Appropriations Committee met today. That work has been \ndone. The bill is ready to bring to the floor.\n  So I hope we can move forward. There is a tentative agreement--it is \nnot finalized in any written form yet, but I have worked with the \ndistinguished majority leader now for a couple weeks. There is an issue \nthat is before the country, and that is stem cell research. We are \ngoing to try to work out something on that so we do not have a bunch of \nside issues coming up on the legislation we have. We have had a number \nof important meetings, and I think we are at a point soon where we can \narrive at some way to dispose of this at a time certain.\n  We have other issues that we have talked about--the Hawaiian issue \nand China. These are all in the Record that we have to bring those up \nat a specified time. So we have our plates full. And I would \nacknowledge we probably might have to do some of this next Friday.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader. I believe it \nis pretty clear in terms of the plans: No more rollcall votes today. We \nwill have a pro forma session tomorrow. We expect people to continue \ntoday to offer amendments and to bring them forward on Monday as well.\n  We will have a rollcall vote on the Bolton nomination, to reconsider \nthe cloture vote on the Bolton nomination, at 6 o'clock on Monday. We \nwill complete the Energy bill next week. And then we will turn to the \nappropriations bills, as we had planned.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, I also think if cloture is going \nto be filed on this bill, it would be on a bipartisan basis. I think \nyou would have an equal number of Democrats and Republicans signing \nthat cloture motion. And I think that it is really important for this \nbody that we do that on occasion.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is the cloture motion----\n  Mr. REID. On the Energy bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. On the Energy bill.\n  Mr. President, we yield the floor and do thank our distinguished \ncolleague from New Jersey for his consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the point I was making just a few \nminutes ago was that we ought not permit States to opt out of this \nmoratorium, this prohibition against offshore drilling because what \nhappens in a neighboring State, whether it is Delaware or Maryland or \nNew York State or Connecticut or Massachusetts, affects what happens in \nmy State very often. The same is true on the Pacific side of things. \nThe same is true for the Gulf of Mexico. You cannot simply say: Let a \nState do the drilling. They may be more interested in the income than \nin the protection of the environment. But we are not. I can't emphasize \nstrongly enough the importance of protecting the sensitive marine areas \noff the New Jersey coast and other coastal States.\n\n  For more than two decades, both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations have respected the moratorium on leasing and preleasing \nactivities on the Outer Continental Shelf. But now we are talking about \ndoing away with this protection. It would be foolish and shortsighted. \nOne only needs to look at the list of accidents at sea and see what \nhappened to neighboring States or neighboring communities not at all \nconnected to the place where the accident happened. We just ought not \npermit it.\n  The Department of Interior's Minerals Management Service estimated in \nthe year 2000 that the waters off New Jersey might hold enough oil to \nsupply the country with 10 days of oil. What does it mean in the scheme \nof things? Ten days of oil and run the risk of destroying marine life \nand a culture that is associated with coastal States? It is a part of \nour lives. Heaven forbid that it changes from being part of our daily \nlives.\n  Do we want to risk hundreds of thousands of jobs for 10 days? I don't \nthink so. Do we want to risk changing the culture of our society, our \ncoastal society? I don't think so.\n  The people of my State and the residents of all coastal States do not \nwant oil and gas rigs marring their treasured beaches and fishing \ngrounds. The occupant of the Chair, coming from a beautiful coastal \nState, tiny though it is, but so much dependent on the sound and the \nocean, I am sure understands the risks of having oil rigs out there \nthat could damage the culture of the State as well as the marine life \nand the ecology. We don't want that to happen. I don't mean to speak \nfor the Presiding Officer, but I know that Rhode Island has similar \nproblems to States such as New Jersey.\n  Drilling poses serious threats to our environment and to our economy. \nDrilling requires onshore infrastructure that can harm sensitive \ncoastal zones. The massive amounts of mud it displaces when drills go \ndown into the earth must be dumped somewhere else.\n  The constant risk of oil spills cannot be minimized.\n  I was chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee of Appropriations \nabout 15 years ago when the Exxon Valdez ran aground. Because I had \nCoast Guard in my subcommittee, I took the opportunity to get up to the \nplace where the vessel was floundering within 3 days after it ran \naground. It was in some way kind of a mystical allure. You could see \nthe sheen on the water, and it spread with all of its color but all of \nits menace at the same time. I saw brave people from our Department of \nInterior and Fish and Wildlife getting off on these tiny islands with \nhelicopters and small boats and taking the birds out and fish and \ntrying to clean them up one by one wherever they could. It was \ndevastating. I visited there at that time. I find out that today, 16 \nyears later, that disaster is still taking a toll on the environment.\n  When I take my grandchildren to the beach, I don't want them to \ndiscover oil underneath a rock, as one still does in the area where the \nExxon Valdez ran aground. I don't want them to see birds or mammals \nsickened by their inability to breathe properly as a result of a \ncoating of oil. I don't want to hear about the coral destruction that \nprovides the nutritional base for our fish and marine life.\n  The Exxon Valdez spill was one of the largest oil spills we have \nsuffered, and it was only one of many. According to the Department of \nInterior, 3 million gallons of oil spilled from offshore operations in \n73 incidents between 1980 and 1999. It is an average of about four \nincidents a year, more than 40,000 gallons of oil per spill. That is \nmore than enough oil to ruin a beach town's tourist season for years to \ncome.\n  We cannot afford to damage our shorelines--and we should not be asked \nto do it--or the marine life that inhabits our coastal waters. Nature \nhas been good to us. It supplies us with the seas and the water and the \nland and the mountains. We ought to try as much as possible to keep \nthat intact.\n  Ending the moratorium in any State completely undercuts the position \nour Nation has upheld for many decades. It clearly undercuts the stated \nwishes of coastal States that would incur the\n\n[[Page S6707]]\n\ngreatest damage. The United States needs new sources of energy. I agree \nwith that. But where have we been in these past years as the \nconsumption of oil increased? Buying it from people who aren't even \nfriends of ours, but who are always asking us to protect them in \nmoments of trouble. And some of those states we know have been accused \nof and it has been established that they support terrorists who fight \nagainst us. Did that cause us to say: Hey, we ought to change things? \nNo. It didn't. We simply said: Get bigger cars and use more gas and let \nthe devil take the high road. It ought not be that way. The United \nStates needs new sources of energy.\n  Fortunately, our Nation has many energy sources that are vastly \nunderutilized. One of those sources for finding our way out of this \nmess is to continue to invest in alternative methods for producing \nenergy in universities and research institutes. We can bolster our \nNation's energy security without drilling offshore. A day at the beach \nshould mean fun, clean water, natural beauty, not oil slicks or \ndrilling rigs. We need to keep the existing prohibition on offshore \ndrilling in place. That is what Senator Corzine and Senator Bill Nelson \nand other Senators from coastal States and I intend to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Energy bill. Before \nstarting my remarks, I want to once again thank Senator Domenici and \nRanking Member Bingaman for their excellent work on this bill for the \nlast 5 months. It is a source of great pride for me to see my two \nneighbors from the South, from the Land of Enchantment, working so well \ntogether on such an important issue.\n  I also want to reiterate my thanks to their key staff, Alex Flint, \nJudy Pensabene, Lisa Epifani, Bob Simon, and Sam Fowler. Without the \nwork of the staff, we would not have gotten to the point in this \nlegislation where we are today.\n  I also want to congratulate Senator Bingaman and his staff on their \nsuccessful inclusion of the RPS amendment. They have done this Nation a \ngreat favor.\n  The Nation has a real problem. When I look at the issues that face \nAmerica today, I believe the two most significant domestic issues \nfacing America, America's families and America's businesses are health \ncare and the energy crisis of America. Today, this Chamber is \naddressing the challenge of energy.\n  The problem can be described in lots of different ways, but it is, in \nfact, an emergency. In the 1970s, our Nation imported about one-third \nof our oil needs. Many of us still remember then-President Jimmy Carter \ntalking about the OPEC oil embargo and talking about the energy \nindependence of America being the moral equivalent of war. Yet, since \nthat time during the last 30 years, we have seen continuing reliance \nand dependence on foreign oil so that today 58 percent of the oil we \nneed is being imported. By 2020, we will be importing 70 percent more \nof our oil. America today consumes one-quarter of the world's oil \nsupplies but has only 3 percent of the global reserves. Currently, OPEC \nmember countries produce about 40 percent of the world's oil and hold \n80 percent of the proven global reserves, and 85 percent of those \nreserves are in the greater Middle East, including countries that are \nnot particularly friendly to the United States: Iran, Iraq, and Saudi \nArabia.\n  Twenty-two percent of the world's oil is in the hands of state \nsponsors of terrorism and under U.S./U.N. sanctions, and only 9 percent \nof the world's oil is in the hands of countries ranked ``free.''\n  We are importing more oil at a time when other growing nations \ncontinue to increase their imports of oil, including China, which is \nexponentially increasing its oil demand and imports. China's oil \nimports were up 30 percent from the previous year, making it the \nworld's No. 2 petroleum consumer only after the United States, and \nthere is no end in sight in terms of how this nation of 1.3 billion \npeople will continue to import oil from other places around the world.\n  Experts predict China's large and rapidly growing demand for oil will \nhave serious implications for United States oil prices and supplies. \nFully one-quarter of the U.S. trade deficit today is associated with \noil imports, and as we have continued to grow on our overreliance on \nforeign oil, it is incredible for me to take a look at the statistics \nwith respect to American vehicles. American vehicles today get fewer \nmiles per gallon than they did in 1988.\n  What that tells us is this Nation has not taken the energy crisis we \ncurrently have in a series enough fashion. It is an imperative for us \nto do so, and this energy bill we are considering today in the Senate \nis part of our response to try to make sure we live up to the \nchallenges we face in America today.\n  In my view, the answer to the energy crisis we face is that we must \ndo everything we can to set America free from its overdependence on the \nimportation of foreign oil. Indeed, leading American conservatives and \nprogressive organizations, both Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents alike, have come forward with a concern about the security \nand economic implications of America's growing dependence on foreign \noil. These groups have formed a coalition called Set America Free. We \nshould embrace the Set America Free agenda as an imperative for America \nfor energy independence and security.\n  Since most of the oil and the overwhelming source of known oil \nreserves lie in one specific region of the world, the Middle East, our \nnational security is held hostage to the whims of despotic or \nincreasingly unstable regions. Ominously, the money we pay for foreign \noil helps pay for the activities of extremists and terrorists who hate \nthe United States and the West in general. We need only to recall the \nhorrors of 9/11 to know this hatred is real. Even worse, the money pit \ngrows deeper because as the world consumes more oil, that oil becomes \nmore expensive and the money that keeps some of those regimes in place \ngets more and more concentrated. So America is held hostage in a \ntighter and tighter grip. There is only one way for us to fix this. \nAmerica must embrace an imperative of energy independence and security. \nWe have to set America free.\n  This energy bill, which is a bipartisan bill, is a good first step. \nThis energy bill that is before the Senate takes some very important \nsteps: an important step in energy conservation, which means we will do \nmore with what we have; an important step in embracing a new ethic of \nrenewable energy for the 21st century, which will help us grow our own \nenergy resources in our country; an important step in developing new \ntechnologies that will help us address the energy demands of our Nation \nand, also importantly, balanced development of existing fuel supplies. \nThese are important steps to lead us to the goal of energy independence \nand security.\n  I want to review each of those steps briefly. First, conservation. \nEnergy efficiency is the cheapest, cleanest, and quickest way for our \ncountry to extend its energy supplies and to begin to tackle the \nalarming increases in energy prices we have witnessed in the past few \nyears.\n  This is far cheaper than any other form of energy, and for a good \nreason. Energy efficiency is not subject to transmission losses, and it \nis not subject to fluctuations in the price of fossil fuels or the \navailability of a renewable resource.\n  The Energy bill contains a number of very good provisions for \nconservation. It establishes requirements for energy and water savings \nin congressional buildings so that we in Congress can tell the rest of \nthe Nation that we also will walk the walk on conservation. It \nestablishes new conservation goals on energy measurement and \naccountability standards for Federal buildings and agencies all over \nthe country. This is significant, for one of the Nation's largest if \nnot the largest landlords is the Federal Government.\n  It extends the energy savings performance contracts, ESPCs, for 10 \nyears. These contracts are an excellent mechanism by which the Federal \nGovernment is guaranteed to save money\n\n[[Page S6708]]\n\nand save energy, savings that can be passed on directly to the \ntaxpayers of America.\n  The program provides private financing of energy-saving improvements \nfor Federal buildings.\n  The Senate Energy bill also authorizes or extends energy assistance \nfor State programs, such as weatherization assistance, energy-efficient \nappliance rebate programs, and grants to States and local governments \nto create more energy-efficient buildings.\n  The Senate Energy bill also sets energy efficiency standards for exit \nsigns, for lamps, certain transformers, traffic signals, heaters, \nlamps, refrigerators and freezers, air conditioners, washing machines, \ndehumidifiers, commercial ice makers, pedestrian signals, mercury vapor \nlight ballasts, and pre-rinse spray valves. The energy portions of this \nlegislation are a strong indication of the direction in which this \ncountry has to head, and that is to be more efficient with the fuel \nresources that are available for us.\n  Second, renewable energy--renewable energy is a great opportunity for \nthe United States of America in the 21st century. Nothing is more \nimportant in this bill than its call for increased use of renewable \nenergy. I am particularly proud of the people of Lamar, CO. Their \nefforts to produce clean, renewable energy are a great service to the \nentire Front Range of Colorado. The efforts in Lamar literally keep the \nlights on.\n  This morning, in our Denver Post in Colorado, they talked about the \ntown's efforts to make their voices heard on the Senate floor. I assure \nyou, Mr. President, and all of the people in Lamar, we hear you, and we \nthank you for your support for renewable energy.\n  The Energy bill directs the Secretary of Energy to compile a detailed \ninventory of the Nation's renewable energy resources and also \nestablishes a renewable fuels standard. I am proud to be a cosponsor of \nthe renewable fuels standard provision of the Senate Energy bill.\n  This amendment calls for 8 billion gallons of ethanol and biodiesel \nto be produced in America by 2012. This amendment is good for America \nand good for the environment.\n  Growing our own transportation fuels directly reduces our dependence \non foreign oil. It not only reduces our dependence on foreign oil now, \nit promises to reduce our imports even more in the near future. The \nproduction and use of 8 billion gallons of ethanol and biodiesel by \n2012 will displace more than 2 billion barrels of crude oil, and it \nwill reduce the outflow of dollars to foreign oil producers by more \nthan $60 billion.\n  An important provision of this renewable fuel standard is that it \nprovides incentives for the development of cellulosic ethanol. Current \nmethods of producing ethanol have an energy return of about 35 percent, \nbut cellulosic ethanol, which will soon become economically feasible, \nwill provide as much as 500 percent energy return. And once we are at \nthat point, we will be on the edge of a brand new frontier for domestic \nbiofuel production.\n  Finally, ethanol and biodiesel are good for the environment. Net \ncarbon dioxide emissions from biofuels are lower than from fossil \nfuels, because the carbon released during combustion was taken out of \nthe air by the agricultural crops in the first place.\n  Ethanol and biodiesel are both young industries in Colorado, but I \nbelieve that these biofuels are essential to our energy future, and the \nfarmers of Colorado believe that they are a key component of that \nfuture. And truth be told, I simply like the idea of growing and \nharvesting our transportation fuels. It seems to me that this is a true \nway forward for America.\n  Third, Technology. The energy bill also includes provisions for the \ndevelopment of Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle plants--IGCC, \ncommonly referred to as gasification. Using this technology, we can \nextract energy from coal in a much more environmentally responsible way \nthan the pulverized coal plants in use today. IGCC significantly \nreduces mercury, sulfur, and nitrogen oxide pollution. It uses our most \nabundant natural resource--coal. And it can be used to fake a synthetic \nnatural gas, which means coal can help drive down the price of natural \ngas. IGCC can also be used to make fertilizer--fertilizer is normally \nmade from natural gas. The fertilizer industry has been shutting its \ndoors in America, and fertilizer prices have been going up ever since \nour natural gas prices became so high. IGCC also offers modest gains in \nefficiency today, and the potential for great gains tomorrow. I think \nthat the steps the energy bill takes towards developing IGCC are good \nones. And I it comes at a crucial time.\n  Although the bill contains good provisions to move forward with \ngasification for electrical energy production, it does not yet have the \nnecessary incentives for reducing gasoline consumption by motor \nvehicles.\n  There are about 800 million cars in active use worldwide. By 2050, as \ncars become more common in China and India, it will be 3.25 billion.\n  In America alone, two-thirds of U.S. oil consumption is due to the \ntransportation sector.\n  These two facts alone tell us that we need greater fuel economy.\n  I do not believe we are doing enough to promote vehicle fuel economy.\n  The Energy Future Coalition and Set America Free are promoting the \nidea of a plug-in, hybrid car that gets 500 miles per gallon. Unless \nyou are a multimillionaire, I imagine you--most consumers in America--\nwould go for cars that can go 70, 100--500 miles on a gallon of gas. As \nrevolutionary as it sounds, consider that a significant portion of \nAmerican driving is done over short distances to and from the store or \nto and from work. With shorter trips powered purely by electrical \nbatteries, the amount of gasoline conserved in America would increase \nsignificantly.\n  This kind of out-of-the-box thinking, combined with solid \ntechnological underpinnings, is exactly what America needs to move us \nforward.\n  Already a hybrid plug-in car has been demonstrated at over 100 miles \nper gallon, nearly 4 times our current national fuel economy. Five \nhundred miles per gallon is a lofty goal, no doubt. But only by setting \nhigh standards can we achieve great results and see progress soar.\n  Let me address balanced development and non-traditional sources of \nenergy in the bill. To pursue energy independence, we must also work to \ndevelop our own natural resources. But this development must be done in \na balanced and responsible way.\n  Over the past 2 decades the Rocky Mountain West, including my State \nof Colorado, has experienced an incredible boom in natural gas \nexploration and production. This activity has been centered in Western \nColorado, also known as the Western Slope.\n  The exploration and production taking place on the Western Slope is \non public lands as well as private lands. With over 60 drilling rigs \noperating in our state this month--as many as Wyoming--there is \ntremendous pressure on our local land and communities.\n  Responsible development, balanced development, means that some places \nare simply not appropriate for drilling or exploration. Some places are \ntoo pristine to allow the potential environmental damage that comes \nwith fossil fuel development. In Colorado, we have the unique Roan \nplateau, and I do not believe the top of the Plateau should be opened \nfor drilling.\n  Colorado is also home to the world's best deposits of Oil Shale from \nwhich unconventional oil can be derived. Estimates are that over one \ntrillion barrels of unconventional oil could be recovered from the oil \nshale in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. Even a fraction of that amount \nwould be an important contribution to what must be a national priority: \nlessening our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Oil shale development has failed in the past due to technical, \nenvironmental and economic problems. If we are to successfully develop \noil shale we must follow the principle of sustainability; a marathon, \nnot a sprint. Sustainability will focus on the long-term development of \noil shale. The development must take place in cooperation with States \nand local communities. The development must be based on sound \neconomics. We must make sure we have developed oil shale in an \nenvironmentally responsible manner.\n\n  I am cautiously optimistic that the future of oil shale will include \nits contribution to lessening the dangerous dependence of the United \nStates on foreign oil. If we do not rise to meet this opportunity, we \nwill only have ourselves to blame when in the years\n\n[[Page S6709]]\n\nahead we look back and wonder what we might have done better to set \nAmerica free.\n  There is a component of the energy challenge we face which must be \naddressed and on which there will be further dialog in this Senate in \nthe days ahead, and that is the issue of climate change. Climate change \nis happening. The scientists of America agree that climate change is \nhere and that we must address it. The business community of America \ncomes together with companies such as DuPont and GE. They say we must \naddress this issue. As we move forward in the days ahead to complete \nour work on the energy legislation, it is my hope that we include \nprovisions that address the issue of carbon emissions and global \nwarming.\n  In conclusion, let me say that when I think back to the greatest \ngeneration of time, just like many of my colleagues in this Senate, I \nthink back to my father and my mother, part of that ``greatest \ngeneration'' of World War II, where they knew that anything was \npossible in America and no challenge was too high or too steep to climb \nas an American nation. That was truly the unique spirit of the American \npeople.\n  Today, when we face the crisis we are in with our overdependence on \nforeign oil and our energy crisis, it requires the same kind of spirit \nwe saw in that generation of World War II. It requires the kind of \nleadership and courage we saw with people such as Abraham Lincoln, who \nstaked the life of the Nation over the Civil War and resulted in the \n13th, 14th, and 15th amendments and forever changed our Nation. It \nrequires the leadership and vision and courage of someone such as \nFranklin Roosevelt, who could lead us through the Depression and \nprepare us to win World War II. It requires the leadership of people \nsuch as John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who said that we could reach the Moon \nand we could do it within 10 years. That is the kind of boldness we \nneed in this energy legislation to make sure we get rid of our \noverdependence on foreign oil and that we set America free, not only \nfor our generation but for generations to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from \nColorado for his remarks on energy and for his work on the Energy \nCommittee this year.\n  The Senator from Colorado is new to the Senate. I have not been here \nthat long myself, but it is refreshing to see him here. I loved it when \nsomeone asked, How long have you have been in the United States--12 \ngenerations or 13?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. We were here before the United States was here, so 407 \nyears ago.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. So he has the longest lineage--his family does, I \nbelieve--of anyone in the territory we now call the United States of \nAmerica. He has made a terrific contribution on energy. I appreciate \nhis remarks.\n  We have come a long way in our work on energy over the last couple of \nyears, and while we still have some important differences of opinion--\nwe saw some of those expressed today--they are differences of emphasis, \nimportant differences of emphasis. I don't want to minimize that. For \nmy part, I see us moving toward a different way of thinking about how \nwe produce energy in this country. We have gone from having the lowest \nnatural gas prices in the world to the highest. Gasoline prices are too \nhigh. We see that despite all of our efforts to reduce our use of oil, \nwe are still importing more oil than we should. So we need to do things \ndifferently.\n  My formula for doing that is largely representative of the bill that \nwas reported 21 to 1. First, conservation and efficiency. I heard the \nSenator talk about that. Second, new supplies of natural gas, as well \nas oil try to get the price of natural gas down for farmers, for \nhomeowners, and for businesses. To do that, unfortunately, we will have \nto import liquefied natural gas for the next few years. Otherwise, we \nwill be exporting jobs. We can either import some gas or export the \njobs, one or the other--that is going to be our choice--so we have an \nadequate and substantial supply of low-cost American-produced clean \nenergy. We then need to aggressively move on nuclear power, and we \naggressively need to--and I believe there is a consensus on this--we \naggressively need to explore the best technology for clean coal \ngasification and to make that work best to see if we can find a way to \ncapture the carbon that is produced and put it in the ground. If we are \nable to do that, we then will have enough clean energy to run this \neconomy and keep our jobs here as well as set an environmentally good \nexample for the rest of the world. I hope that is the path we are on.\n  I salute the Senator for his contributions.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Of course.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I wish to provide a note of commendation \nfor the junior Senator from Tennessee. We have long known his work as \nGovernor of Tennessee, where he worked hard on behalf of land and water \nissues. It was through his leadership and the leadership of both \nDemocrat and Republican colleagues on the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee that we were able to accomplish what is only seldom \ndone in Washington, DC; that is, the production of a bipartisan piece \nof legislation that is a very good beginning for energy policy \nframework for the 21st century. I acknowledge the great contributions \nto that effort on the part of Senator Alexander and all the members of \nthe Energy Committee. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I first thank Chairman Domenici and the \nranking member, Senator Bingaman, as well as both of their staffs on \nthe Energy Committee for all of their hard work on preparing an energy \nbill. Their leadership has allowed tbe Senate to come together to \ndevelop a comprehensive energy policy that is paramount to our Nation's \nfuture national and economic security.\n  With reservation on some issues, I supported the Energy Committee \nbill.\n  I rise today to speak about one of those particular issues--one of \ngreat importance to the people of New Jersey--the threat of oil and gas \ndrilling off the coast of New Jersey's 127 miles of shore.\n  All of my colleagues heard Senator Nelson and Senator Martinez speak \non the floor this week about Florida's treasured coasts and how \nimportant it is to Florida's environment and economy that its coasts be \nprotected from any weakening of the moratoria on drilling in the Outer \nContinental Shelf.\n  My colleagues from Florida should take every step necessary to \nprotect their beaches and coastal waters. As a Senator from a coastal \nState where tourism is the second largest industry, I, too, will take \nevery step necessary to protect the Jersey shore from any effort to \nweaken the longstanding bipartisan moratoria on drilling in the OCS.\n  As I understand it, the chairman and ranking member have both agreed \nto oppose any amendments that would open up the OCS moratoria in the \nsubmerged lands off of Florida's coast.\n  I am, of course, opposed to any such exemptions from the moratoria, \nso I am pleased that both Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman have \nalso taken that position.\n  That being said, I find it more than a little disconcerting that the \nrest of the moratoria on the OCS still remain vulnerable to similar \namendments that seek to weaken or destroy the moratoria.\n  As you may know, protecting the OCS moratoria has been a priority of \nmine since my tenure began in the Senate.\n  Along with Senator Lautenberg, I introduced the Clean Ocean and Safe \nTourism Anti Drilling Act, COAST, in the 107th, 108th and 109th \nCongresses. This bill would make permanent the moratoria on OCS \ndrilling in the Mid- and North Atlantic planning areas.\n  I know with certainty the people of New Jersey do not want to see oil \nand gas rigs off of our coast. As one of the fastest growing regions in \nthe most densely populated State in the country, the New Jersey shore \nrelies on the beauty and cleanliness of its beaches and the protection \nof its fishing grounds for a huge part of our State's revenue.\n  The New Jersey Department of Commerce calculates tourism alone \ngenerates more than $31 billion in spending, directly and indirectly \nsupports more than 836,000 jobs, more than 20\n\n[[Page S6710]]\n\npercent of total State employment, generates more than $16.6 billion in \nwages, and brings in more than $5.5 billion in tax revenues to the \nState.\n  Any drilling or even the threat of drilling poses a real threat to \nNew Jersey's environment, economy, and way of life. Remember, New \nJersey is a State that already holds its own in supporting energy \nproduction and refining for the Nation.\n  We have three nuclear power plants, many traditional power plants, \nsupport siting of an LNG terminal, and we are debating wind \nalternatives. And New Jersey is the East Coast hub for oil refining. We \nare growing our energy businesses. But risking and exploiting our shore \nis a step too far.\n  I am not the only Senator who has concerns about the amendments to \nthis energy bill that would weaken the OCS moratoria. I have been in \ncontact with many coastal State Senators who agree that this bill must \nnot include any provisions that undermine the moratoria.\n  My concern is reinforced by the inventory provision already included \nin the underlying bill. I am strong1y opposed to this provision and \nvoted against it during committee markup.\n  I consider this provision a step onto a slippery slope toward the \neventual drilling off the New Jersey coast and other areas currently \nunder the OCS moratoria and possibly exposing our beaches and fisheries \nto unnecessary risks from adjacent locals.\n  Give the minimal benefit and significant downside of drilling off the \ncoast of New Jersey, I do not believe it is worth threatening over \n800,000 New Jersey jobs to recover what the Minerals Management Service \nestimated in 2000 to be 196 million barrels of oil, only enough to last \nthe country barely 10 days and 2.7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas \nfor the entire Mid-Atlantic region.\n  This level of estimated production can in no way be justified.\n  In comparison, areas off the Gulf of Mexico already open to drilling \ncontain 18.9 billion barrels of oil and 258.3 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas.\n  There are other amendments being floated about which cause even \ngreater concerns with regard to weakening the moratoria. One of these \npotential amendments would allow States to opt out of the moratoria.\n  Allowing States to opt out of the moratoria could be detrimental to a \nState's neighbors--an issue Florida has long understood and argued.\n  New Jersey's coastline is very close in proximity to other States' \ncoasts.\n  Tides move across State borders. Fisheries and fish don't recognize \nState borders. New Jerseyans have more than ample reason to be \nconcerned if a nearby State decided to opt out of the moratoria and \nallow drilling off its coast.\n  As you can see, we appear dangerously close to the beginning of the \nbreakup of the OCS moratoria. This should not occur, and I am prepared \nto fight any amendment promoting a weakening of the moratoria. These \nactions are as threatening to New Jersey's economy as killing ethanol \nis for corn growing States.\n  I am also prepared to fight any amendment that would provide a \nrevenue-sharing incentive for States to opt out of the moratoria. There \nis much that is good in this bill and many good amendments to be \nconsidered, especially those offered by Senator Cantwell and Senator \nBingaman.\n  I have a bipartisan, bicameral Dear Colleague letter from the New \nJersey delegation expressing our concern with the inventory included in \nthis bill, as well as these moratoria-threatening amendments I have \nbeen discussing. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 13, 2005\n       Dear Colleague: We are writing to express our strong \n     opposition to a provision in the Senate Energy Bill that \n     directs the Department of Interior to inventory all potential \n     oil and natural gas resources in the entire Outer Continental \n     Shelf, including areas off of the New Jersey coast.\n       This provision runs directly counter to language that \n     Congress has included annually in appropriations bills to \n     prevent leasing, pre-leasing, and related activities in most \n     areas of the Outer Continental Shelf.\n       Since 1982, a statutory moratorium on leasing activities in \n     most Outer Continental Shelf, OCS, areas has been included \n     annually in Interior Appropriations acts. In addition, \n     President George H.W. Bush declared a leasing moratorium on \n     many OCS areas on June 26, 1990 under Section 12 of the OCS \n     Lands Act. On June 12, 1998, President Clinton used the same \n     authority to issue a memorandum to the Secretary of the \n     Interior that extended the moratorium through 2012 and \n     included additional OCS areas.\n       In addition, this provision in the Energy Bill would allow \n     the use of seismic surveys, dart core sampling, and other \n     exploration technologies, all of which would leave these \n     areas vulnerable to oil spills, drilling discharges and \n     damage to coastal wetlands.\n       The people of New Jersey, and other residents of States \n     along the Atlantic Coast, do not want oil or gas rigs \n     anywhere near their treasured beaches and fishing grounds. \n     Such drilling poses serious threats not only to our \n     environment, but to our economy, which depends heavily on \n     tourism along our shore. Coastal tourism is New Jersey's \n     second-largest industry, and the New Jersey Shore is one of \n     the fastest-growing regions in the country. According to the \n     New Jersey Department of Commerce, tourism in the Garden \n     State generates more than $31 billion in spending, directly \n     and indirectly supports more than 836,000 jobs, more than 20 \n     percent of total state employment, generates more than $16.6 \n     billion in wages, and brings in more than $5.5 billion in tax \n     revenues to the state.\n       Considering the minimal benefit and significant downside of \n     drilling off the coast of New Jersey, we do not believe it is \n     worth threatening over 800,000 New Jersey jobs to recover \n     what the Minerals Management Service (MMS) estimated in 2000 \n     to be 196 million barrels of oil, only enough to last the \n     country barely ten days. The MMS also estimated a mean of \n     only 2.7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas for the entire \n     Mid-Atlantic region. In comparison, areas of the Gulf of \n     Mexico already open to drilling contain 18.9 billion-barrels \n     of oil and 258.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n       In addition, we will also work to fight against any \n     provision that would allow states to opt out of the OCS \n     moratorium. If a state chooses to opt out of the moratorium, \n     it would be impossible for nearby states to protect their \n     coasts from accidents that could happen as a result of \n     drilling.\n       We will take every step to oppose any provision that would \n     weaken the OCS moratorium. We ask you to join us in our \n     effort to protect our nation's precious coastlines, marine \n     ecosystems and ocean waters.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jon Corzine, Frank B. Lautenberg, Frank Pallone, Jr., \n           Frank A. LoBiondo, Jim Saxton, Robert Menendez, Donald \n           M. Payne, Steven R. Rothman, Bill Pascrell, Jr., Robert \n           E. Andrews, Rush Holt, Chris Smith, Mike Ferguson, and \n           R.P. Frelinghuysen.\n\n       Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am also circulating a letter \n     that has already been signed by many coastal Senators and I \n     expect will be signed by additional Senators that expresses \n     our firm resolve that any amendments that threaten the OCS \n     moratoria in any way is unacceptable.\n  Finally, I have a bipartisan letter here signed by over 100 Members \nof the House of Representatives stating their strong support for the \ncurrent legislative moratorium on new mineral leasing activity on \nsubmerged lands of the Outer Continental Shelf. I ask unanimous consent \nthat this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2005.\n     Hon. Charles Taylor,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Interior and Environment, Committee \n         on Appropriations, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC\n     Hon. Norm Dicks,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Interior and Environment, \n         Committee on Appropriations, Longworth House Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Taylor and Ranking Member Dicks: We are \n     writing to express our strong support for the longstanding \n     bipartisan legislative moratorium on new mineral leasing \n     activity on submerged lands of the Outer Continental Shelf \n     (OCS). We are deeply appreciative of the leadership your \n     Subcommittee has shown on this issue over the years and hope \n     to work with you this year to continue this vital protection.\n       The legislative moratorium language prohibits the use of \n     federal funds for offshore leasing, pre-leasing and other oil \n     and gas drilling-related activities in moratoria areas, \n     enhancing protection of these areas from offshore oil and gas \n     development. As you know, in 1990 President George H.W. Bush \n     signed an executive memorandum placing a ten-year moratorium \n     on new leasing on the OCS. In 1998, this moratorium was \n     renewed by President Bill Clinton and extended until 2012. As \n     you know, President George W. Bush endorsed the moratorium in \n     his 2006 budget. These actions have all been met with public \n     acclaim and as necessary steps to preserve the economic and \n     environmental value of our nation's coasts.\n       With a renewed interest in developing natural gas and oil \n     on the OCS, we believe it is again imperative for Congress to \n     reaffirm its\n\n[[Page S6711]]\n\n     authority on this issue. Therefore, we respectfully urge you \n     to include the OCS moratorium language in the fiscal year \n     2006 Interior and Environment Appropriations legislation. \n     Specifically, we ask you to use the language in Sections 107, \n     108 and 109, Division E, Department of the Interior and \n     Related Agencies of the fiscal year 2005 Consolidated \n     Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-447). These sections restrict \n     oil and gas activities within the OCS in the Georges Bank-\n     North Atlantic planning area, Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic \n     planning area, Eastern Gulf of Mexico planning area, \n     Northern, Southern and Central California planning areas, and \n     Washington and Oregon planning area.\n       Once again, we encourage the Subcommittee to support these \n     important provisions, which represent over 20 years of \n     bipartisan agreement on the importance of protecting the \n     environmentally and economically valuable coastal areas of \n     the United States. Thank you for your consideration of this \n     request.\n           Sincerely,\n         Lois Capps, Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham, Jeff Miller, Jim \n           Davis, Michael Michaud, Madeleine Bordallo, Ginny \n           Brown-Waite, Jay Inslee, Frank LoBiondo, Rob Simmons, \n           Mark Foley, Jim Langevin, Ed Case, Jim McGovern, \n           Sherrod Brown, Chris Smith, Dennis Cardoza, Frank \n           Pallone, Jr., G.K.

Mr. President, a big event is taking place in another \ncountry tomorrow. The Iranian elections are going to take place for the \npresidency and leadership in Iran. This is a bogus election. The people \nof Iran are not having a fair choice. A number of people are calling \nfor a boycott of elections in Iran, which is unusual for us but not for \nthem, because the whole slate of those who have been nominated has been \nselected by the ruling council of Iran.\n  If you were even going to be on the ballot, you had to have been \nselected by the ruling council. So there may be eight people running \nfor president; some have dropped out, others added in. They all had to \nbe appointed, actually, to be candidates.\n  I wanted to draw this point to the body that there is not just a \nnuclear crisis going on in Iran; there is a human crisis that is taking \nplace in that country. These elections that will be reported on are not \nelections. They are appointments that are taking place. It is in many \nrespects a fairly porous society, and yet there are severe restrictions \nplaced on freedom of speech, on press, assembly, association, and \nreligion.\n  The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has concluded \nthat ``the government of Iran engages in or tolerates systematic, \nongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom, including \nprolonged detention and executions based primarily or entirely upon \nreligion of the accused.'' I just met with members of the Ba'hai faith \nwho talked about the severe persecution of the Ba'hai in Iran.\n  But the specific item I wanted to point out even prior to this \nelection is the gender apartheid that takes place in Iran. I received \nthis recently from the Alliance for Iranian Women.\n  The State Department has reported that the testimony of a woman in \nIran is worth half that of a man in court. The blood money paid to the \nfamily of a female crime victim is half the sum paid for a man. A \nmarried woman must obtain the written consent of her husband before \ntraveling outside the country.\n  In his book, Ayatollah Khomeini requires that young girls should be \nmarried before they reach the age of puberty. A woman does not have the \nright to divorce her husband, but a man can divorce his wife anytime he \nwishes and without her knowledge. A man is allowed to marry four wives \nand have as many temporary wives as he wants and may end the contract \nat any time with a temporary wife on a temporary marriage. Temporary \nmarriage is often viewed as the Islamic Republic's way of sanctioning \nmale promiscuity outside of marriage. Mothers do not get custody of \ntheir children when husbands divorce them. A widow does not get the \ncustody of her children after the death of her husband. The children \nwill be given to the parental grandparents, and the mother has no right \nto visitation. If the husband has no family, the mullah of the \ncommunity takes custody of the child. Daughters get half the \ninheritance than that of their sons.\n  I point this gender apartheid out because when I heard about it, I \nwas stunned. I wanted other Members of the body to realize this is \ntaking place.\n  The greater focus of what is taking place in Iran has been primarily \non nuclear weapons development. But there is a humanitarian and a human \ncrisis and certainly a human rights crisis in that country.\n  I have come here shortly before the Iranian presidential elections. \nThese elections hold no hope of change for the people of Iran. They are \nelections that will be boycotted and protested, and they are elections \nthat have been manipulated by the supreme leader and the council of \nguardians. Just last week women in Iran staged a sit-in to protest the \ndisqualification of women from running in the elections.\n  The people of Iran want change. That change will not come through \nthese elections. But it will come through internal, strong \ndemonstrations, and it will come through strong international support \nfor the very people who protest and boycott these elections.\n  Iran has a young and vibrant base that, with the support of the \ninternational community, could promote major change in Iran and the \nregion. I encourage the Iranian-American community to unite, build \nstrong coalitions to further promote democracy and fundamental respect \nfor human rights in Iran. I encourage this body to support democracy \nbuilding, civil society building in and for Iran.\n  I encourage other Members to continue to speak up on behalf of the \noppressed in Iran and voice strong support for the people who so \ndesperately want to see democracy flourish.\n  This is a key issue and a timely one. These elections are taking \nplace soon. People need to know this is a bogus set of elections.\n\n[[Page S6712]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday, apparently, on the floor of the \nSenate and elsewhere, certain statements were made with regard to the \nAmerican service personnel serving in Guantanamo. I am now paraphrasing \nwhat was reported in the Washington Times of June 16, when it is \nalleged that in this article on the floor of the Senate, this statement \nwas made:\n\n       If I read this to you and did not tell you that it was an \n     FBI agent describing what Americans had done to prisoners in \n     their control, you would most certainly believe this must \n     have been done by Nazis, Soviets in their gulags, or some mad \n     regime--Pol Pot or others--that had no concern for human \n     beings. Sadly, that is not the case. This was the action of \n     Americans in the treatment of prisoners.\n\n  Mr. President, as you can see by this shock of gray hair, I have \nlived now these 78-plus years, and I remember these periods of history \nthat were cited on the floor of the Senate yesterday very well.\n  I see the leader standing. Does he wish to be recognized?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Virginia, I was \ninclined to ask the Senator a question, if it will not interrupt his \ntrain of thought.\n  Mr. WARNER. Not at all.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I was listening carefully to my friend from Virginia, \nand I gather one of our colleagues equated what happened in Guantanamo \nto Pol Pot or some equivalent of that. My recollection--I just ask the \nSenator from Virginia if his recollection is similar to mine--Pol Pot \nmurdered 1 to 2 million of his fellow countrymen.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. In World War II, \nwith which I was going to commence my remarks in that context, I served \nat the very end. As a 17- or 18-year-old sailor, I was simply in a \ntraining command, but I remember that period of history very vividly.\n  All through my early years, prior to going into the Navy, late in the \nfall of 1944 and starting active service in 1945, the whole of this \ncountry was consumed with that frightful conflict in which, at the \nhands of Nazis, some 9 million people perished, 6 million of whom were \nof the Jewish faith. It is just extraordinary.\n  I was deeply disturbed by these comments to try to draw any analogy \nwhatsoever to that period of history.\n  Then, following the Soviet gulags, I served as Secretary of the Navy \nduring the height of the Cold War for some 5 years in the Pentagon and \nactually had a great deal of work with the Soviet Union at that period \nof time in the context of that threatening situation of the Cold War.\n  There is just no relationship to this. I was astonished. I did not \nwant to let the Sun go down on this day without conveying to the Senate \nmy own historical perspective and the danger that loose comments such \nas that--comparisons which have no basis in history--could do harm to \nthe men and women serving wherever they are in the world today in this \nwar on terrorism because this is the type of thing that is picked up \nand utilized by press antithetical to the interests of the United \nStates and distorted in their own way.\n  It has to be addressed. I was prepared to do that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator one other \nquestion?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Virginia mentioned the gulags in the \nSoviet period. It is my recollection--correct me if I am wrong--that up \nto 20 million people were murdered during that period from 1930 to \n1950.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. I do not have the accurate figures. I know Stalin \nhad purged part of his country for no other reason than he just wanted \nto get rid of the people by the millions. The gulags came into focus \nprimarily during the latter chapter of the Soviet Union when people \ndisappeared by the tens of thousands into these encampments, never to \nbe heard from again. It is not a chapter which Russia today looks back \non with any pride at all.\n  I feel every day that I get up, and I hear of the casualties of our \nbrave men and women, be they in Afghanistan, Iraq or occasionally in \nother areas of the world--I say what is it that we can do in this \nChamber, what is it that we, as citizens, can do to bring them home \nsafely? They are making enormous sacrifices together with their family \nto go into harm's way to protect us here at home from the threat of \nterrorism.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Virginia for \nclearing up any notion anyone might have that anything the United \nStates is involved in, in incarcerating prisoners, would be in any way \nrelated to experiences such as those carried out by the Nazis or by the \nRussians during the Stalin period.\n  Mr. WARNER. I feel very strongly about that. I really feel so \nstrongly, I say to the distinguished leader of our party, that I feel \napologies are in order to the men and women of the Armed Forces. I do \nnot ask it for myself. But I feel these young men and women, all of \nwhom are volunteers, all of whom have gone into harm's way and who are \nbearing the brunt of the present conflict, that these allegations have \nabsolutely no basis in fact with history. I regret they occurred.\n  I yield the floor to anybody who wishes to question me or I will \ncontinue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I wish to ask the Senator from Virginia \na question relating to this.\n  I also was troubled by the comments. I was troubled by the fact that \nthere seems to be no proportionality between the abuse of the civilian \npopulation in a systematic way versus the detention of combatants in a \nvery different sense, in a different way.\n  I think the proportionality is important to be kept in mind. I had \nearlier last week made some comments of my concerns about Guantanamo in \nwhich I wondered if it was serving our public diplomacy, our long-term \ninterests. However, I do know that the treatment, having been there, is \nappropriate as to the detainees.\n  I used to be mayor of Orange County, and I know the conditions under \nwhich the prisoners in the Orange County jail, which was terribly \novercrowded, at times would be sleeping on mattresses on the floor, and \nsituations such as that.\n  Having visited both facilities, the detainees at Guantanamo seem to \nhave a much better day-to-day living situation, and certainly I saw no \nevidence of any systematic abuse.\n  So while I had raised some questions about the long-term advisability \nof our public diplomacy interests, I do want to make clear I do not in \nany way believe there is mistreatment of our detainees, that the \ndetainees must continue to be detained given the threat they present to \nour U.S. citizens, and I most of all want to make clear that what I saw \nfrom our Armed Forces personnel who are looking after these detainees \nwas tremendous dedication and caring. I believe their sacrifice, in a \nplace far away from their homes, dealing on a daily basis with very \ndifficult and unsavory people who are not related to an armed force, \npeople not connected with a military that has been trained or fights \nunder a given flag, and they have been labeled as enemy combatants, is \na far different situation than that which can be portrayed by any \nsuggestion of systematic abuse or even the loss of life, as would be \nassociated with Pol Pot.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say in response to the Senator's \nquestion that yesterday afternoon the Secretary of Defense, Mr. \nRumsfeld, came over to my office--we frequently visit each other in our \noffices. We spent over an hour and a half on a variety of subjects, and \nwe addressed this issue. We discussed his coming up, which he is quite \nwilling to do, for a hearing in the Armed Services Committee.\n  We are continuing to look into this matter. But let me point out, we \nare talking about millions of people, as the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky said, in the period of World War II,\n\n[[Page S6713]]\n\nwhich I remember very well as a young man and as Secretary of the Navy \nduring the period of the Vietnam era and Pol Pot. There is no \ncomparison. Not one incarcerated individual at Guantanamo has lost his \nor her life. Not one.\n  In sharp contrast to those mentioned about facts elsewhere in the \nhistory of this world, our Nation should look with pride as to how the \nDepartment of Defense has specifically addressed each of the \ngrievances. They have allowed any number of us to come down there. It \nis in the hundreds who have come down.\n  There are courts-martial being considered for some at this point in \ntime. In other words, when wrongs are done, we carefully, methodically \naddress them, giving due process to those who are under suspicion for \nhaving committed offenses.\n  Given time, this entire situation at Guantanamo will be spelled out \nfully to the public. If there are individuals who have done wrong, they \nwill be held accountable.\n  I come back to the central theme that I have is these young men and \nwomen serving all over the world in uniform today and, indeed, members \nof our diplomatic corps, members of other Government agencies serving \nin harm's way, we have to think of them when issues are raised such as \nthey were raised yesterday.\n  I understand the Senator wishes to address a question to the Senator \nfrom Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Virginia has \nexpired.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that my time may be continued \nwithout limitation at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I understand the rules of the Senate, I \nam supposed to address the Senator in the form of a question, and that \nmakes it impossible for me to make a statement at this point.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do not wish to create a parliamentary \nsituation that precludes the Senator from expressing himself in any way \nthat he wishes. I understood the Senator was about to ask a question. I \nwill withdraw that. I will finish my statement, if I may, and then I \nwill yield the floor.\n  To equate actions of the men and women in the Armed Forces, proudly \nserving in uniform and thereby representing this Government of the \nUnited States with regard to their services down there in Guantanamo \nmaintaining the detainees, to the genocidal acts of murder and \nrepression of the Nazis or Soviet gulags or Pol Pot is insulting to our \nmen and women in uniform who are fighting for the safety of all of us \nat home and, indeed, our friends and allies abroad. To the contrary, \ncompletely unlike the repressive regimes of the Nazis--and I was moved \nto come down here because I think there are only a few of us around who \nlived during that period of time and were able to fully absorb the \nfrightful consequences of that worldwide conflict. We had 16 million \nmen and women of the U.S. military in uniform at that time. I just \nthink that there is absolutely no comparison to what that chapter of \nhistory brought upon mankind by means of death to this situation we \nhave, which is under investigation.\n  I was assured by the Secretary of Defense--I did not need the \nassurance because I knew it would be the case--that we will account for \nany wrongs that have been done under the due process of our system. The \nDepartment of Defense and others have investigated this situation and \nmade known a series of facts at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, my staff contacted me to alert me that \nseveral of my colleagues had come to the Senate floor to address \nstatements that I made on the floor on June 14, 2005. Those statements \nrelated to the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo. The statement I \nmade involved an FBI report, a report which has been uncontroverted and \none which I read into the Record in its entirety. I said at the \nbeginning when I read it into the Record that I did so with some \nhesitation because it was so graphic in its nature, but I felt that in \nfairness, so that the record would be complete, I had to read it.\n  Because there have been allusions made to statements made by me, I \nbelieve it is appropriate to read it again so that my colleagues who \nmay not have reflected on it will have a chance to do so. Let me read \nthis report from an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation about \nthe treatment of a prisoner at Guantanamo Bay. I hope my colleagues \nfrom Kentucky, Virginia, and other States who are following this debate \nwill listen to this and then listen to what I said in the Record \nafterwards so they understand the context of my remark. It has been \nnothing short of amazing what some elements of media have done with \nthis remark and what some of my colleagues have drawn from this remark \ntoday. So I want to read it in its entirety, if my colleagues have not, \nand I want them to hear it in its entirety before they reach \nconclusions as to what was intended.\n  I quote from the Record of June 14, 2005, page S6594 of the \nCongressional Record:\n\n       When you read some of the graphic descriptions of what has \n     occurred here--I almost hesitate to put them in the \n     Record, and yet they have to be added to this debate. Let \n     me read to you what one FBI agent saw. And I quote from \n     his report.\n\n  This is a quote:\n\n       On a couple of occasions--\n\n  Let me underline that, on a couple of occasions--\n\n       I entered interview rooms to find a detainee chained hand \n     and foot in a fetal position to the floor, with no chair, \n     food or water. Most times they urinated or defecated on \n     themselves, and had been left there for 18-24 hours or more. \n     On one occasion, the air conditioning had been turned down so \n     far and the temperature was so cold in the room, that the \n     barefooted detainee was shaking with cold. . . . On another \n     occasion, the [air conditioner] had been turned off, making \n     the temperature in the unventilated room well over 100 \n     degrees. The detainee was almost unconscious on the floor, \n     with a pile of hair next to him. He had apparently been \n     literally pulling his hair out throughout the night. On \n     another occasion, not only was the temperature unbearably \n     hot, but extremely loud rap music was being played in the \n     room, and had been since the day before, with the detainee \n     chained hand and foot in the fetal position on the tile \n     floor.\n\n  And then I said:\n\n       If I read this to you and did not tell you that it was an \n     FBI agent describing what Americans had done to prisoners in \n     their control, you would most certainly believe this must \n     have been done by Nazis, Soviets in their gulags, or some mad \n     regime--Pol Pot or others--that had no concern for human \n     beings. Sadly, that is not the case. This was the action of \n     Americans in the treatment of their prisoners.\n\n  I have heard my colleagues and others in the press suggest that I \nhave said our soldiers could be compared to Nazis. I would say to the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, I do not even know whether \nthe interrogator involved was an American soldier. I did not say that \nat any point. To suggest that I am criticizing American servicemen--I \nam not. I do not know who was responsible for this, but the FBI agent \nmade this report. To suggest that I was attributing all of the sins and \nall the horrors and barbarism of Nazi Germany or the Soviet Republic or \nPol Pot to Americans is totally unfair. I was attributing this form of \ninterrogation to repressive regimes such as those that I noted.\n  I honestly believe that the Senator from Virginia, whom I respect \nvery much, would have to say, if this, indeed, occurred, it does not \nrepresent American values. It does not represent what our country \nstands for. It is not the sort of conduct we would ever condone. I \nwould hope the Senator from Virginia would agree with that. That was \nthe point I was making.\n  Now, sadly, we have a situation where some in the rightwing media \nhave said that I have been insulting men and women in uniform. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. I respect our men and women in \nuniform. I have spent many hours, as I am sure the Senator from \nVirginia has, at funerals of the servicemen who have been returned from \nIraq and Afghanistan, writing notes to their families, and calling them \npersonally. It breaks my heart every day to pick up the newspaper and \nhear of another death. The total this morning is 1,710. To suggest that \nthis is somehow an insult to the men and women serving in uniform--\nnothing could be further from the truth.\n\n[[Page S6714]]\n\n  It is no credit to them or to our Nation for this sort of conduct to \noccur or for us to ignore it or in any way, shape, or form to condone \nit. And understand why we are in this situation. We had a rule of law. \nWe had agreed to the Geneva Conventions. We had agreed to policies \nrelative to torture of prisoners. They were the law of the land. The \nBush administration came in after 9/11 and said: We are going to \nrewrite the rules.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld, to whom the Senator referred, who visits his \noffice, was party to that conversation about how we were going to treat \nprisoners differently. When the suggestion was made to this \nadministration to change the rules on interrogation of prisoners, the \nstrongest and loudest dissenter was the Secretary of State Colin \nPowell, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who came to this \nadministration and said: This is a mistake, to change the rules of \ninterrogation.\n  Why? Because, he said, when you torture a prisoner you will not get \ngood information. They will say anything to stop the torture. And, \nsecond, he said, if we change the rules at this point in our history, \nsadly it is going to just give solace to our enemy, give them \nencouragement that somehow the United States is backing away from its \ntraditional values.\n  Those are not my words. They are a characterization of the words of \none of the highest ranking members of the Bush Cabinet, former \nSecretary of State Colin Powell.\n  Unfortunately, he was right. That decision by the Bush \nadministration, with the support of Secretary Rumsfeld, led us down a \nroad. I hope that that road does not include any more incidents than \nthe one that has been described here. But to say that the interrogation \ntechniques here are the kind you would expect from a repressive regime, \nI do not believe is an exaggeration. They certainly do not represent \nthe values of America. They do not represent what you risked your life \nfor, Senator, when you put the uniform on and served our country or \nwhen you served as Secretary of the Navy or in your service in the \nSenate. That doesn't represent the values that you stood for or that \nany of us should stand for.\n  That was the point I was making. To say that by drawing any kind of \ncomparison to this outrageous interrogation technique and using the \nwords ``Nazi'' or ``Soviets'' is to demean or diminish all of the \nhorrors created by those regimes is just plain wrong.\n  I have seen firsthand, as you have too, people who survived that \nHolocaust. I have visited Yad Vashem, the tribute to the people who \ndied in the Holocaust. I understand that the millions of innocent \npeople killed there far exceed the horror that occurred in Guantanamo. \nBut when you talk about repressive regimes doing things that in history \nlook so bad, I am afraid that this that I described to you falls closer \nto that category.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. WARNER. You are reading from a report of one of our investigative \nagencies. There is no verification of the accuracy of that report. You \ntake it at face value. I pointed out--and I discussed it with Secretary \nRumsfeld--this allegation of the FBI agent, together with a lot of \nother facts, is now being carefully scrutinized under our established \njudicial process.\n  I trained as a lawyer and many years as a prosecutor and dealt with \nthe Bureau. I have the highest respect for them. But I do not accept at \nface value everything they put down on paper until I make certain it \ncan be corroborated and substantiated.\n  For you to have come to the floor with just that fragment of a report \nand then unleash the words ``the Nazis,'' unleash the word ``gulag,'' \nunleash ``Pol Pot''--I don't know how many remember that chapter--it \nseems to me that was the greatest error in judgment, and it leaves open \nto the press of the world to take those three extraordinary chapters in \nworld history and try and intertwine it with what has taken place \nallegedly at Guantanamo.\n  I am perfectly willing to be a part of as much of an investigation as \nthe Senate should perform and will in my committee. But I am not going \nto come to the floor with just one report in hand and begin to impugn \nthe actions of those in charge, namely, the uniformed personnel, at \nthis time. We should allow matters of this type to be very carefully \nexamined before we jump to a conclusion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I can respond to the Senator from Virginia, I do not \nhave a copy with me--perhaps my staff can give it to me--of the memo \nfrom the FBI.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could we inquire of the Senator as to the use of this \nmemo on the floor? Is that consistent with the practices of this body \nas regards--\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say this memorandum was not obtained from any \nclassified sources.\n  Mr. WARNER. I do not know how it came into your possession.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I say to the Senator from Virginia what we are \ndealing with, in terms of these interrogation techniques, was disclosed \nin a letter, as I understand it--let me make certain I am clear--to \nGeneral Ryder, on July 14, 2004, almost a year ago--almost a year ago. \nI have not heard a single person from this administration say this is \nin any way false or inaccurate. Certainly, if it were, we would have \nheard that, would we not, long ago?\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask the Senator, is it to be treated as a public \ndocument or is it part of an investigative process which--ordinarily \nthe materials used in the course of an investigation are accorded \ncertain privileges.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Virginia, I was informed by my \nstaff this was released by a Freedom of Information Act disclosure by \nour Government.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So I don't believe there is any question about its \nauthenticity in terms of it being a document in the position of our \nGovernment. In terms of the content of the document, almost a year has \npassed since this was written, and if it were clearly wrong, inaccurate \non its face, would the Senator from Virginia not expect the \nadministration to have made that clear by now?\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my understanding is it is currently under \ninvestigation and being carefully scrutinized in the context of another \nseries of documents. Until the administration has had the opportunity \nto complete the investigation and make their own assessment of the \nallegations, it seems to me premature to render judgment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, whom I respect very much, what I described was the \ninterrogation techniques approved by this administration, in the \nextreme. There was nothing in this description here, from the agent of \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, which was different than the \ninterrogation rules of engagement which had already been spelled out--\nalready spelled out.\n  So here is what we have. A letter sent to General Ryder almost a year \nago, released under the Freedom of Information Act, with specifics \nrelated to the interrogation of prisoners which are consistent with the \nvery rules of interrogation which Secretary Rumsfeld had approved in a \nmemo.\n  So I do not believe that coming to the floor and disclosing this \ninformation is an element of surprise. The administration has known it \nfor almost a year. I do not believe there is any question of \nfalsification. The document was presented under the Freedom of \nInformation Act. And it certainly is not, sadly, beyond the realm of \npossibility because the very techniques that were described in here \nwere the techniques approved by the administration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My concern was not the words of the FBI agent, but the \nwords of the Senator from Illinois. I believe I heard the Senator \nrepeat today--let me ask the Senator if in fact this is what he meant \nto say--because it was the quote I had from the Senator, not from the \nFBI agent, earlier yesterday or the day before, which I believe the \nSenator repeated today. I\n\n[[Page S6715]]\n\nwas curious if the Senator does stand by his own words, not the words \nof the FBI agent, which I believe were:\n\n       If I read this to you and did not tell you that it was a \n     FBI agent describing what Americans had done to prisoners in \n     their control, you would almost certainly believe that this \n     must have been done by the Nazis, Soviets in their gulags, or \n     some mad regime, Pol Pot or others, that had no concern for \n     human beings. Sadly, that is not the case. This was the \n     action of Americans in the treatment of their prisoners.\n\n  So my question of the Senator is not the words of the FBI agent but \nthe words of the Senator from Illinois. Does the Senator from Illinois \nstand by these words, comparing the action of Americans in the \ntreatment of their prisoners to the Nazis, Soviets in their gulags, or \nPol Pot or others?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say, in response to the Senator from Kentucky, in \nthis particular incident that I read, from an FBI agent describing in \ndetail the methods that were used on prisoners, was I trying to say: \nIsn't this the kind of thing that we see from repressive regimes?\n  Yes, this is the type of thing we expect from a repressive regime. We \ndo not expect it from the United States. I hope the Senator from \nKentucky would not expect that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is the Senator aware that Pol Pot murdered 1 to 2 \nmillion of his fellow countrymen, the Nazis murdered from 6 to 9 \nmillion men, women, and children, mainly Jews, and the Soviets, in \ntheir gulags, murdered some estimated 20 million people over a 20-year \nperiod between 1930 and 1950?\n  My observation, obviously, is this a fair comparison?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The comparison related to interrogation techniques. It is \nclear, and I will state it for the record, that the horrors visited on \nhumanity by those regimes were far greater than these interrogation \ntechniques. But the point I was trying to make was, what do we \nvisualize when we hear of this kind of interrogation technique?\n  I say to the Senator from Kentucky, I visualize regimes like those \ndescribed. Did they do more? Did they do worse? Of course they did. The \npoint I was trying to make is, this is not what America should expect. \nThis is not what we should believe reflects our values.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So the Senator thinks this is a fair comparison?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is a comparison in the form of interrogation that a \nrepressive regime goes too far, that a democracy never reaches that \nextreme. But to say that I am in any way diminishing the other horrors \nbrought on by these regimes is plain wrong. Those are different \nelements completely.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will yield, again, I go back on my own \nrecollections, those three examples the Senator used. I don't know what \ninterrogation took place. Perhaps if we go into the sinews of history \nthere were some, but what the world recognized from those three \nexamples the Senator used, they were death camps--I repeat, death \ncamps--where, as my colleague from Kentucky very accurately said, \nmillions of people perished. It is doubtful they were ever often asked \ntheir names.\n  To say that the allegations of a single FBI agent mentioned in an \nunconfirmed, uncorroborated report give rise to coming to the Senate \nand raising the allegation that whatever persons of the uniformed \nmilitary, as referred to in that report--albeit, uncorroborated, \nunsubstantiated report--are to be equated with those three chapters in \nworld history is just a most grievous misjudgment on the Senator's \npart, and one I think is deserving of apologizing to the men and women \nin uniform.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me say this to the Senator in response. I have said \nclearly in the Senate, and obviously the Senator does not accept it, \nbut I will say it again: There were horrors beyond interrogation \ntechniques committed by those three regimes. That is clear.\n  But I want to ask the Senator from Virginia, does he even accept the \npremise or possibility that this happened at Guantanamo?\n  Mr. WARNER. I would say, Madam President, I served as assistant U.S. \nattorney for 5 years and dealt with the FBI all the time. I have very \nhigh regard for that service. But the Senator knows full well that is \njust an investigative report by one agent. It is under investigation by \nthe Bureau and by the Department of Defense at this time in the context \nof many other pieces of evidence.\n  One cannot come to this great forum, which is viewed the world over \nas one which is known for trying to assert the rights of this country \nas taking its place in the world, as following due process and \nprinciples of our Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights--\nand comment to the Senate about some young uniformed person who \nprobably is the subject of that FBI report--until such time as that \nperson in uniform is adjudicated in a proper forum as to having done \nwhat is alleged in that report, or not done, it seems to me we \nshouldn't be discussing it in the Senate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might say in response to the Senator from Virginia, I \ndon't know if it is a uniformed person reported in this interrogation. \nThe FBI did not say that. For those suggesting this reflects on our men \nand women in uniform, I don't know if that is a fact. I don't know if \nit was, in fact, a member of our armed services. I cannot say that. Nor \ndid I, in my earlier statement, make any reference to the men and women \nin uniform.\n  But I will say this: When this type of serious allegation has been in \nthe public forum for as long as this has been, without any denial by \nthe administration, it raises some question as to the fact that the \nSenator raised, whether it should be taken as truthful or not. And I \nthink it can be.\n  Now, if facts come out later on and it turns out this is not the \ncase, so be it. I will be the first to concede that in the Senate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the damage has been done. The Senator \nshould have taken the precautionary steps prior to----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me say to the Senator from Virginia, the damage was \ndone when we changed our interrogation policy which allowed for some of \nthe conduct we used to hold to be unacceptable by American standards. \nThat is when the damage was done. That is when Secretary of State Colin \nPowell said we were crossing a line we should not cross. And we have \ncrossed that line.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In a hearing yesterday before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee we heard there is a real controversy within this \nadministration as to whether the people being held in Guantanamo have \nany rights to due process. The Senator mentioned due process earlier. \nThat is an issue which is being litigated as high as the Supreme Court. \nThe court came to the conclusion that the administration was wrong in \nthe way it is treating prisoners at Guantanamo. They have not accorded \nthem due process as they should have. Many of those aspects are still \non appeal and still being debated.\n  I say to the Senator that to raise these issues in this forum is, \nfrankly, the only place that one can raise them. If we do not raise \nquestions about those interrogation techniques and whether they violate \nthe most basic standards which we have stood by as a Nation, then I \ndon't believe we are responsible in our duties. I don't believe we \nshowed good judgment in ignoring what is happening, what happened at \nAbu Ghraib, what may be happening, based on this FBI memo, at \nGuantanamo Bay.\n  That is part of our responsibility, as difficult as it may be for the \nadministration to accept.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the use of the words ``due process'' by \nthe Senator from Virginia was restricted to due process that is taking \nplace with regard to allegations in that report and others according to \nthe actions of either uniformed or civilian personnel under the clear \nsupervision and jurisdiction of the Department of Defense at \nGuantanamo. That was my use of due process.\n  It is a separate issue as to the due process of the detainees, the \nSenator is correct. That is a matter that should be openly discussed, \nis being discussed, and will be reviewed by this Chamber.\n\n[[Page S6716]]\n\nI come back again, and I just conclude--I see there are other Senators \nwaiting to speak--we have to be extraordinarily careful in our remarks \nin the Senate as they relate to the safety of our people because this \nseries of statements the Senator has made, factual references to \nchapters of history, can be manipulated by other people throughout the \nworld to their advantage. That is my deep concern.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have just one final question, very briefly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I want to make sure I understand this correctly: Is it \nmy understanding that my good friend from Illinois stands by his own \nwords, because he read them again today, and it is his view that even \nif this allegation from this one FBI agent were true--and as the \nSenator from Virginia has pointed out is being investigated--even \nassuming this allegation from this one FBI agent were true, the Senator \nfrom Illinois still believes that could be correctly equated to the \ntreatment by the Nazis, by the Soviets in the gulags, and by the Pol \nPot regime?\n  Is that an accurate description of that, even assuming this one \nallegation is proven to be true?\n  Mr. DURBIN. What I have said is, if you were asked, without being \ntold where this might have occurred, as I said here directly in the \nRecord, you might conclude that it was done by one of those repressive \nregimes because that was the kind of heavy-handed tactic they used, the \nkind of inhumane treatment in which they engaged. You would be \nsurprised to learn that according to the FBI, it was something that \noccurred at Guantanamo in a facility under the control of the United \nStates of America.\n  Madam President, let me conclude by saying that I know there is some \nsensitivity on this issue relating to Guantanamo. I could tell it in \nthe hearing yesterday. I can tell it from the response today. But I \ncontinue to believe the United States should hold itself to the highest \nstandards when it comes to the interrogation of prisoners, that we \nshould never countenance in any way, shape, or form, the torture of \nprisoners we have seen in other countries by other governments in \nhistory.\n  That was the point I was trying to make, and it is a point I still \nstand by. Secretary of State Colin Powell was right when he criticized \nthe change of the interrogation techniques by this administration and \nsaid it does not reflect well on the United States, torture does not \nproduce good information, and that we would pay a price, sadly, in \nterms of public and moral opinion if we engaged in that kind of \nconduct. His premonition or his prophecy has turned out to be accurate. \nThat was the point I made.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. It is amazing to me, Madam President, the more the \npopularity of the President plummets, the more the people downtown try \nto play this game ``I gotcha.'' Families are attacked, reputations are \nimpugned, bogus, baseless statements are made. The attacks by the very \nnoisy noise machine of the far right never stops, and it has gotten so \nmuch more in operation in the last few weeks with the numbers on the \nPresident dealing with Social Security, the unpopularity of the efforts \nmade to spend 2 months on judges, five people, basically.\n  This is all a distraction by the White House. Why? Because this \ncountry is in trouble for lots of reasons, only one of which is Iraq. \nIn the last 48 hours, 11 American soldiers have been killed in Iraq. \nScores of Iraqis have been killed in the same period of time. I do not \nknow--I do not know if anyone knows--the death and destruction that is \ntaking place in Iraq as we speak. We focus on the dead. The dead \nAmerican soldiers are on page A26 of the newspapers now. Sometimes they \ndo not even make the front section. We do not know because we are not \nfocusing on the blind, the maimed from that war.\n  But that is only one of our problems we are not focusing on. Health \ncare: 45 million Americans are without health care. Have we spent 5 \nminutes this year talking about health care? No. No. We have been \nspending time on five judges.\n  Have we spent any time about what is happening in our public school \nsystems around this country? No, not a single minute. The average age \nof a public school in America is approaching 50 years. The Leave No \nChild Behind Act is leaving kids behind in Nevada and all over this \ncountry.\n  The environment is something we do not even talk about anymore \nbecause global warming does not exist in the minds of the people at the \nWhite House.\n  Do we spend any time here talking about the devastating deficit that \nis affecting people in my little town of Searchlight and all over the \ncountry? No. This administration took over with a surplus in the \ntrillions. We now have approached a $7 trillion debt in this country.\n  So this is all an attempt to distract us from the issues before us. \nRather than spending time on my friend, the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois, whom I have known for going on 23 years, who has dedicated \nhis life to public service--do we have a problem in this country with \nthe issues he is discussing? Yes. Focus on them, not anything he said. \nLet's focus on the issues before us.\n  I would hope it would be worth a little bit of our time here to see \nwhat we could do about the Defense authorization bill. Five weeks it \nhas been out of committee--5 weeks. We have our Guard and Reserve that \nare overwhelmed with responsibilities in that war. We have men and \nwomen who are there on duty station as we speak. But we do not have a \nDefense authorization bill. Why? We always did them in years past. Why? \nBecause we may get an amendment on that bill dealing with what is going \non with the subject about which my friend speaks. There may be other \namendments that may not be in keeping with the mindset of the White \nHouse.\n  I want the record to reflect I have great affection for the chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee. He is my friend. He is truly a \nSouthern gentleman, and I care for him a great deal. I am sure he must \nbe frustrated by the fact that the Defense authorization bill is not \nbefore us.\n  But I also have great affection, loyalty, and deep friendship that \nwill be with me for the eternities for my friend from Illinois, who has \nbeen such a good friend over all these many years. He is a person who \nloves to talk about issues, whether it is an issue dealing with energy, \nas we have talked about here for a few days--the first real substantive \nissue we have dealt with, really, in a long time on this Senate floor--\nor whether it is any of the other issues I have spoken about here: the \ndeficit, education, the environment, health care.\n  Nothing is being talked about. But he cares about those issues \ndeeply. I would hope we can turn down the noise machine downtown a \nlittle bit and understand the American people want to focus on issues, \nissues important to them. They are tired of this ``gotcha'' game \nbecause they don't get you; it is just an attempt to divert attention \nfrom the issues before this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, on Sunday, June 19, the Nation will honor \nfathers with the celebration of Father's Day. Fathers certainly deserve \na day to relax and to put aside for a time the heavy burden of work and \nworries that they carry. Most fathers are, I believe, great worriers. \nThey feel the pressure to perform. They feel the pressure daily to go \nforth and to battle in conditions over which they have little control. \nYet they feel that they must present to their families a facade of \nmastery. That is, after all, part of the ``dad mystique''--the desire \nof fathers everywhere to be seen as the unvanquished protector of the \nfamily, the benevolent provider of all good things, the safe harbor \nagainst all harm and all fears.\n\n  Today's economic conditions worry most fathers, no matter what their \ncurrent earning prowess. If they are looking for work or to find a \nbetter job, recently reported economic indicators keep them awake at \nnight. Housing prices continue to climb. Hiring is weak. Outsourcing \nand the offshore movement of jobs create heartburn. News that Chinese \nautomobiles may soon be competing for sales in the United States will \ncreate a few ulcers, too, I am sure, as hard-working fathers\n\n[[Page S6717]]\n\nwonder how they can compete against Chinese workers making only $2 an \nhour.\n  Fathers at the upper end of the pay scale are not immune from such \nnightmares either. They must still worry about corporate scandals that \ncould rob them overnight of their pensions, stock options, and the \nrising cost of college education. All fathers feel a sense of growing \nunease about the spiraling deficits, the uncertain future of Social \nSecurity, the weakening of America's global competitiveness to the high \nprice of international conflict. What kind of future are they leaving \nto their children?\n  On a very personal level, fathers also share common fears. Where are \ntheir children? Are they behaving? Are they growing up to be good \npeople? Will the world be good to them in return? I know that fathers, \nwith sons and daughters in the military, carry particularly heavy \nburdens of worry these days, as well as fathers who are in uniform \nthemselves with families waiting, waiting, waiting and praying for them \nat home. I hope these fathers know that the prayers of the Nation are \nwith them.\n  Fathers want the best for their children, which is why they push \ntheir children to do their best. To be sure, some fathers have taken \nthis perhaps to unseemly, even dangerous, extremes, as the stories of \nsome ``sports dads'' attest. But most fathers want their children to \ndevelop a healthy sense of competition, coupled with fairness, to learn \nto win and to learn to lose graciously, to foster a sense of \nperseverance that will stand their children in good stead no matter \nwhat field of endeavor they play upon.\n  Fathers want to encourage a good work ethic. They want to encourage \ngood study habits. They want to encourage the character traits of \nreliability--according to an old Greek ideal, character is destiny--and \ndependability, thoughtfulness, and generosity of spirit, traits that \nwill make good students, respected leaders, able employees and, some \nday, good fathers and mothers.\n  The best fathers, of course, practice what they preach. Parents are \nthe best teachers, sometimes without ever giving a word of instruction. \nThey teach by the example of their own lives.\n  My own dad was such a man, the greatest man I ever knew, my dad. He \nwas not my father. He was the man who raised me. But he was the \ngreatest man I ever knew. I have met kings and shahs and Presidents, \nprinces, Governors, Senators. Just that old coal miner dad was the \ngreatest man I ever knew--hard working, God-fearing, generous with the \nlittle that he had. He took me in when my mother died, and he raised me \nas his own.\n  ``It is not flesh and blood but the heart which makes us fathers and \nsons,'' wrote Johann Schiller. He is right. Titus Dalton Byrd was not \nmy biological father, but he was my dad, pap. He is looking down from \nheaven right now. He is looking down. And some day I will meet him \nagain. He was my dad.\n  He encouraged me in my studies. He didn't buy me a cowboy suit. He \ndidn't buy me a cap buster. He bought me a watercolor set, a book, a \ndrawing tablet, and some crayons. He took pride in my accomplishments.\n  Benjamin West said that he was made a great painter because of his \nmother who, when he went to her with little drawings about birds and \nflowers and so on, she took him up on her knee and she kissed him on \nthe cheek. She said: Some day you are going to grow up. You will grow \nup to be a great painter. And that made him a great painter. He did \ngrow up to become a great painter, made so by a mother's kiss.\n  So about my old coal miner dad. After a long day at work, he would \nspend time with me. He talked with me. He listened to me. He watched me \nrecite. He watched me play the violin. He feared for me when I wanted \nto follow him into the coal mines. He shared his fear; he shared the \nlove that was behind it. He gave me a whipping a time or two. He always \ntold me before he whipped me that he loved me, and it hurt him probably \nmore than it hurt me. That was my dad. He pushed me to do better, to \nreach higher, to work harder. He didn't want me to have to work in the \nmines as he did. He gave me pride in him. He never used crude language. \nI never heard him use God's name in vain in all the years that I knew \nhim--ever.\n  He never raised a fist in anger. He never treated anyone with \nanything but courtesy. He was a poor, humble, hard-working coal miner. \nHe took life as it came. He didn't grumble at what was placed before \nhim on the table. He never complained. He never said anything about \nmom's cooking. He never used bad language, as I said. He carried \nhimself--a poor miner without two nickles at times to rub together--\nwith the quiet dignity of a true gentleman. There was a man. I am proud \nto share his name. I think that is one of the greatest compliments that \nany child can give to his or her father--that proud inflection in their \nvoice when they say: This is my dad.\n  Like fathers everywhere, I delight in their every triumph, from the \nfirst breath onward, just as I mourn their every setback and \ndisappointment. In speaking from my own experience, no father ever \nceases to worry about his children and the kind of world they are \ninheriting. That is why I suppose it is whatever hair fathers are \nallowed to keep turns white.\n  So on this Father's Day, I remember the old coal miner dad that I \nhad. I could see him coming from the mines. I watched him as he walked \ndown the railroad tracks, and I ran to meet him. As I came near, he put \ndown that dinner bucket he had carried into the bowels of the Earth \nthere in the darkness--the darkness of the coal mine. He put down that \ndinner bucket and lifted the lid, and he took out a little cake that my \nmom had put into the dinner bucket, and he always saved the cake for \nme. He gave me that cake. Yes, he took the cake into the mine, but he \ndidn't eat the cake. He always saved the cake for me.\n  So on this Father's Day, I wish I could tell fathers across America \nto relax and enjoy the day, to sleep well, basking in the love and \naffection of their families. I wish I could, but I know they are still \nworried. That is what a father does.\n  Madam President, I close with a bit of verse that I memorized as a \nlittle boy. Over the years, I have come to appreciate its lesson more \nand more. I am sure that old coal miner dad knew it, too, for he lived \nwith simple wisdom. It is called ``The Little Chap Who Follows Me.''\n\n     A careful man I ought to be,\n     A little fellow follows me,\n     I do not dare to go astray\n     For fear he'll go the selfsame way.\n\n     I cannot once escape his eyes,\n     Whate'er he sees me do, he tries;\n     Like me, he says, he's going to be,\n     The little chap who follows me.\n\n     He thinks that I am good and fine,\n     Believes in every word of mine.\n     The base in me he must not see,\n     The little chap that follows me.\n\n     I must remember as I go,\n     Through summer's sun and winter's snow,\n     In building for the years to be\n     The little chap who follows me.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, first, I have been here for most of the \nremarks of the senior Senator from West Virginia, who has this evening \ncaused me to reflect on my father on this Father's Day. I am sad to say \nthat my father has now passed on, and that fact has caused me to think \nabout things I probably should have thought a lot more about before he \nleft. But it is good to be reminded of the qualities we look for in \nfathers and in our fathers, those who have led the way for us, and that \nas Father's Day approaches, I join my colleague from West Virginia in \nsuggesting that we would all do well not only to think back on our \nfathers and set a good example but to think about what makes a good \nfather in everything we do, and in whatever our roles are, to try to \nfollow those precepts. I appreciate the important words spoken by the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I want to take a few moments to reflect \non an important holiday coming up this weekend--Father's Day.\n  On Sunday, families across America will celebrate their dads with \nlunches\n\n[[Page S6718]]\n\nand dinners, homemade gifts, and, if my family is typical, some gentle \nteasing. It is a day we show our gratitude, and we remember how \nimportant our dads are in our lives.\n  I was very close to my dad, and I cherish my memories of him.\n  When I lived in Nashville, I used to drive by my parents' house \neveryday on my way to work. And everyday, no matter where I was, I \nwould call to touch base and say hello.\n  My father was a man of extraordinary kindness and generosity. He was \nknown throughout the community for his good works.\n  Before he died, he wrote a letter to his grandchildren, passing on \nhis humble wisdom collected over a lifetime. In it, he told them:\n\n       ``Be happy in your family life. Your family is the most \n     important thing you can ever have. Love your wife or your \n     husband. Tell your children how great they are. Encourage \n     them in everything they do.\n       ``Be happy in your community. Charity is so important. \n     There's so much good to do in the world and so many different \n     ways to do it.''\n\n  He also wrote that,\n\n       ``I believe that life is made up of peaks and valleys. But \n     the thing to remember is that the curve is always going up. \n     The next peak is a little higher than the previous peak, the \n     next valley isn't quite so low.\n       ``The world is always changing, and that's a good thing. \n     It's how you carry yourself in the world that doesn't \n     change--morality, integrity, warmth, and kindness are the \n     same things in 1919 when I was born, or in 2010 or later when \n     you will be reading this. And that's a good thing, too.''\n\n  I have worked hard to live up to his high ideals and the sterling \nexample he set before us. And I have worked hard to instill these \nvalues in my own sons Bryan, Jonathan and Harrison. If I have half \nsucceeded, that is a very good thing.\n  As we celebrate our fathers this weekend, I also encourage everyone \nto reflect on the importance of fathers to the social fabric.\n  The National Fatherhood Initiative, a non-profit devoted to promoting \nresponsible fatherhood, reports that today's fathers are more present \nin their children's lives than ever. Dads in two-parent families spend \nmore time with their children than the previous generation of dads. \nResearch also indicates that today's fathers are more active and more \nnurturing.\n  And it has a big impact.\n  Children with involved, loving fathers--as compared to children \nwithout--are more likely to do well in school, have healthy self-\nesteem, show empathy, and avoid drug use, truancy, and criminal \nactivity. The bottom line is kids do better when their dads are around. \nFor a while America forgot just how important dads are, but now we know \nin our heads what we have always known in our hearts.\n  So, this Father's Day, we salute them. Dads on the front line who \nrisk their lives for our freedom. Dads on the home front who go to work \neveryday to support their families. America honors you as everyday you \nhonor us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6718-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6718-S6721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    STATEMENTS REGARDING GUANTANAMO\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, one of the things I remember that my father \ntaught me--and it has stood me in good stead, though I have not always \nfollowed the advice--is to have strong convictions but always to deal \nin moderation and be reasonable in your approach, to listen to other \npeople and try to be responsible in what you say. In all things, \nmoderation would have applied to the advice he gave me frequently. \nAgain, not to say one should not have strong views, but you can be more \neffective in communicating those views if you treat people decently, if \nyou listen to what they have to say, and if you express your own views \nwith a degree of humility and moderation. That is something that, sad \nto say, even in my relatively short time in the Congress, I have seen \nadhered to, sadly, less and less.\n  Certainly, the Senator from West Virginia sets a standard for all of \nus in the way that he treats this body, the revere he has for the \ninstitution and, therefore, the care he takes to deal in this body in \nan appropriate and responsible way, in the great tradition of the body.\n  I mention that because the coarsening of our language, I suppose, can \nbe expected to be manifested first in the political environment. It \ncertainly has occurred with increasing intensity over the years, \nthough, not just in political campaigns but even on the floor of the \nSenate and engaged in by colleagues in the Congress as well as pundits \nand others.\n  Strong subjects sometimes evoke strong emotions, and perhaps that \nexplains why some of the rhetoric surrounding the discussion of our \ndetention of enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay has reached such a \nhigh-pitched level, to such a high degree of hyperbole and \nexaggeration--I daresay, in some cases, irresponsible \ncharacterizations.\n  If this were simply a matter of political rhetoric and partisan \npolitics, I suppose that in some senses it could be excused, though it \nis not helpful. But here the consequences of such language, this over-\nthe-top kind of rhetoric, can actually be detrimental to the effort of \nthe United States that all of us support--certainly to the people we \nput in harm's way, our men and women in the military, and the other \nservices that are helping us to fight the war on terror.\n  This is why it distresses me to hear the characterizations of \nAmerican activities and Americans as being equated with some of the \nworst actors in the history of mankind--phrases thrown around, \napparently, somewhat thoughtlessly, without due regard for the \nconsequences, when enemies of the United States seize on the flimsiest \nof things to take to the streets and riot and kill each other.\n  The unfortunate reporting of Newsweek Magazine--which turned out not \nto be true--regarding desecration of the Holy Koran caused Muslims in \nthe world--thousands and thousands--to riot and cause harm to each \nother. I believe there were at least three deaths that resulted, if I \nam not mistaken. Words have consequences, and when Americans speak in \nirresponsible terms about the actions of Americans who are simply \ntrying to do their best in trying circumstances, in ways that denigrate \ntheir motives, denigrate their actions, and that call into question the \nentire character of America, because of these actions, it is \nirresponsible. And it should not be engaged in, especially it should \nnot be countenanced by Members of this body or the Congress, certainly \nnot engaged in by leaders in this body. Yet, sad to say, we all have \nheard in the last few days this kind of language.\n\n  I will get back to that in a moment. Let me go back and try to \nprovide some perspective about this entire debate about Guantanamo Bay.\n  Guantanamo Bay is a place where the United States Government has had \na lease from the Cuban Government for a long time and spent about $150 \nmillion to build a prison facility to house many of the people who had \nbeen detained in the war on terrorism, primarily people who were on the \nbattlefield in Afghanistan, there being no facilities adequate in \nAfghanistan.\n  It is a place that was designed to be able to accommodate people of \ndifferent cultures. It is significantly managed by Americans who have a \nsignificant degree of medical background and training in the culture of \nIslam in order to ensure that the people there are treated as humanely \nas possible under the circumstances and with due regard for not only \ntheir human rights but their faith as well.\n  This country need apologize to no one in the way that over the years \nwe have tried to adhere to human rights standards and treat people of \nfaith appropriately. Certainly the stories--and I say ``stories'' \nbecause in most cases, they are mere allegations that are untrue--of \ntreatment of people at Guantanamo Bay have raised the interest of \nAmericans because we are a people who instinctively pull back from such \nkind of conduct. We do not want to be even against terrorists engaged \nin inhumane activity. That is why these stories have such resonance.\n  Yet this facility, which takes care of these people in some respects \neven better than the troops there--in terms of the sleeping quarters, \nmeals, and so on--this facility is as good, I think, as any prisoner of \nwar facility in recent memory and certainly with the attention of the \nmedia, the International Red Cross, visits by American officials--there \nhave been thousands of visits. It is a very wide open facility in that \nsense.\n\n[[Page S6719]]\n\n  With all of this attention, I think the very small number of specific \ncomplaints that have been investigated and found to have any merit at \nall--something like five in number--is a testament to the commitment of \nthe United States to adhere to standards of decency and humanity when \ndealing with people.\n  Who are these people? These are the worst of the worst. We do not \nhave the time or the ability to round up people and hold them for the \nsake of it. It is too costly. Over 10,000 people have been captured in \nthis war against the terrorists. Something like 520 are at Guantanamo \nBay. These are the people who are the bombmakers, the bodyguards of \nOsama bin Laden, the financiers, the plotters, the people who have been \nsent out to be assassins, to be suicide bombers. These are the worst of \nthe worst, the killers who, if let go, will return to their killing.\n  Since the detentions at Guantanamo Bay, the United States Supreme \nCourt has said there is one right that these detainees have, and that \nis a right to have their status determined, even through a habeas \ncorpus petition, which in the United States means a right to have \nquestioned the appropriateness of your being detained. The Supreme \nCourt did not hold they have a right to a trial, that they have a right \nto be charged with anything, that they have a right to a particular \nkind of legal proceeding. Simply, they have a right to have their \nstatus reviewed by an appropriate tribunal.\n  And since then, their status has been reviewed, every one of them. \nThere is a process by which it is reviewed annually to determine \nwhether they not only are still appropriately held, but whether they \nneed to be held, whether they pose a threat.\n  In this period of time, a dozen of these detainees--many were \nreleased, something like 200, as I recall--a dozen have already been \nrecaptured on the battlefield. They went right back to killing \nAmericans.\n  This is why prisoners of war are detained when captured, and it has \nthus been throughout modern history. In World War II, for example, we \nhave all seen the movies and read about the internment camps of Germans \nand Japanese and, of course, the way Americans were held as POWs as \nwell. With the rare exception of the people at the very top of the Nazi \nGovernment and a few of the Nazi generals, the German POWs were not \ncharged with crimes or tried for those crimes. They were simply held in \nthese camps until the end of the war.\n  A couple of these camps were in Arizona. I know an Arizona physician \nwho went through one of these camps, I believe in Nebraska. When he got \nout, he decided he liked America a whole lot and became a renowned \nphysician in Phoenix. These were places that people were held until the \nend of the war so they could not go back to fighting against Americans. \nThat is precisely the primary purpose of Guantanamo Bay.\n\n  For the worst of the worst, the people we do not want to go back \nfighting against us or committing terror against anyone else, we have \nto have a place to detain them.\n  I must say, in a debate with the senior Senator from Vermont last \nnight on television--and he and I disagreed generally about this \nissue--he acknowledged this is not about Guantanamo Bay. As he said, we \nhave to have a place to hold these people, and I agree with that \nproposition. Some have even suggested we close this brand-new facility. \nIf you close it, where are you going to put them? Would you like to \ntake one of the military bases that is being closed in your State and \nmake it available for these detainees? Maybe that is the place to \ndetain them. I do not think so.\n  The issue is not closing Guantanamo Bay. I think it is, frankly, \ncriticism of the American Government and leaders of the American \nGovernment. Some people do it for partisan political purposes. Others \ndo it, to bring down certain people. Others, frankly, have a disregard \nfor this country and are quick to criticize almost anything we do.\n  But look at some of the specific charges. One of them is these people \nare being held in limbo. They are not being held in limbo any more than \nany other prisoner of war or enemy combatant has been held in the past. \nThey are being held until the conflict is over so they do not go back \nto fighting us again.\n  Then they demand to know of the general and admiral who were before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday when we held a hearing on \nthis: Well, how long are they going to be detained? We demand to know. \nWe do not know how long the war is going to last, Senator. I demand to \nknow. Will it be forever? What if the war lasts for forever, will they \nbe detained forever?\n  These are pretty silly questions, if you ask me. We do not want to \ndetain these people. We would like not to have to do it. We would like \nto bring the war to a close, but until it is safe to release them, they \nare not going to be released, not unless we are going to jeopardize the \nservice people and others who are subject to terrorism. So let's get \nback to reason and solid logic here.\n  Another question is, Why are we treating these people possibly a \nlittle bit differently than other prisoners of wars have been treated? \nThe answer is they are not prisoners of war. That does not mean we do \nnot treat them humanely and in accordance with the Geneva Conventions.\n  That is another charge, that we violated the Geneva Conventions. No, \nwe have not. No, we have not. The United States adheres to the Geneva \nConventions, and we have not violated them, and we do not intend to. \nEnemy combatants are not entitled to the protection of the Geneva \naccords to which prisoners of war are entitled.\n  The reason for the Geneva accords for the POWs is we want to reward \npeople who adhere to the laws of war. What does that mean? They fight \nfor a country, they wear the uniform of that country, they adhere \nthemselves to the rules of war. In the case of terrorists, that does \nnot apply. They do not fight for a country, they fight for a cause. \nThey do not wear a uniform. They do not fight by the rules of war. They \nkill innocent people indiscriminately. That is their modus operandi. \nThat is their preferred action.\n  That is why they are enemy combatants, not prisoners of war. So we \nwould not have to accord them any standards of treatment except that we \nare the United States of America and we say, and the President has said \nand Secretary Rumsfeld and everyone else in the Government has said, \nfor the United States of America it is inappropriate to do anything \nless than treat people humanely, and we will not violate the Geneva \naccords.\n  So even though they are not entitled to all of the rights of \nprisoners of war, there are standards of treatment that have been \nestablished and have been adhered to. In the few situations in which \nthere is an allegation that maybe those standards might have been \nviolated in some small way, the people have been held responsible who \nhave violated the standards. I think there have been five cases of \ndealing inappropriately with the Koran at Guantanamo Bay, not having \nboth hands on it at once or not having a white glove when dealing with \na prisoner. It is that kind of violation.\n  This kind of thing has been compared by some to Pol Pot and Nazi \nGermany and the Soviet gulag and the human rights abuses that the \nUnited Nations complains about each year. These comparisons are not \napt. They are not responsible. They are not appropriate. They do not \neven begin to appropriately describe the kind of conduct that our \npeople have engaged in and the crimes against humanity that were \nreferred to. To even think of them in the same sense is unthinkable.\n  What about the question about charging them? There is a suggestion \nthey should either be charged or released. Well, this is not a fishing \ncontest. This is not catch and release. This is serious. This is war. \nWhen somebody is trying to kill you and you can detain them, you do it. \nThe alternative is, obviously, you kill them. But hopefully you do not \nhave to kill them; you can detain them, and you can put them in a place \nthat, until the end of the war, is safe for them and safe for you.\n  For those who have committed war crimes, we have the option of \ncharging them with such crimes, and there is a special tribunal set up \nto try them for those crimes, and they can be tried. Now, there are \ncases in the courts of appeal right now that are helping to define the \nparameters of those trials and until that is very clear those will not \nproceed, but that is the way we will deal with those cases.\n\n[[Page S6720]]\n\n  So for those that can be tried, obviously we will do that, but that \nis a very small percentage. There is no point in charging prisoners of \nwar or enemy combatants with anything because the whole point of their \nbeing held is to prevent them from going back to war against you.\n  The final purpose for this detention is intelligence gathering. We \nhave found that human intelligence is the best intelligence and that \nthe highest percentage of human intelligence is the interrogation that \nhas occurred here and elsewhere that has led us to learn a lot about \nthe techniques of the terrorists, their plans, the names of others, and \nother important information that has helped us save lives. So the point \nof this detention is to save lives, to keep people from killing us, and \nto get information that will help us to prevent future killing. That is \nan appropriate purpose of Guantanamo.\n  So when people use irresponsible language, when they seem to leap to \nconclude that the United States must have done wrong simply because a \nlawyer or some group or a prisoner has alleged abuse--and by the way, \nremember that the al-Qaida training includes a manual instruction on \nhow to allege that they are being abused as a prisoner, as a detainee. \nThey are supposed to allege abuse, and they do. So let us not jump to \nthe conclusion that any al-Qaida terrorist who alleges abuse at \nGuantanamo Bay must be right and all of the Americans, from the \nPresident on down, must be wrong. I like to put my chances on Americans \ntrying to do the right thing. We will make mistakes, but we will try to \ncorrect those mistakes and punish those responsible. In the meantime, I \nthink the benefit of the doubt goes to those people whom we have given \na very hard job to do.\n  To get back to my original point, the use of irresponsible language, \nirresponsible charges, has consequences. It can hurt those people that \nwe put in harm's way by turning international public opinion against \nthe United States. When responsible American officials make \nirresponsible charges, all the world listens. When they listen, \nsometimes they react very badly. It does our cause no good when--as \nsome of my colleagues have said, this is all about winning the hearts \nand minds of the Muslim world. There is a great deal of truth in that. \nIt does no good in that battle to denigrate our own actions in a way \nthat is calculated to or one must know will inflame the passions of \nterrorists and others around the world that support the terrorists. It \ndoes no good to this ultimate goal of winning hearts and minds to \nunduly criticize America, Americans and American leaders for actions \nthat are nothing more than what any Nation has the right to do when it \ncaptures people who have been engaged in combat or terrorism against \nit.\n  I urge my colleagues to keep this issue in perspective, to understand \nthe reason we detain people, to understand the impact of irresponsible \nlanguage, to tone down the rhetoric, understand that the President and \nall acting on his behalf are trying their very best to do what we want \nthem to do, and at the end of the day, this is all about winning the \nwar on terror, saving American lives and moving on to a more peaceful \nworld.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, in the past few weeks a number of \nallegations have been leveled against the Guantanamo Bay detention \ncenter.\n  There have been some legitimate questions about the treatment of \ndetainees, which is fair and responsible. The United States is governed \nby the rule of law. And it is proper for the Congress, in its oversight \nrole, to ask the executive branch about such matters and make sure the \ninterests of our constituents and the Nation are being properly \naddressed.\n  That being said, in many cases, the allegations that have been made \nrecently have been false, distorted or misreported.\n  Newsweek, as we are all too familiar, erroneously reported that an \nAmerican guard flushed a Koran down a toilet. That report, which was \nlater withdrawn, resulted in widespread protests and the deaths of \nseveral individuals.\n  When the facts came out, we learned that, in the 3 years that Gitmo \nhas been in operation, there have only been 5 cases of ``mishandling'' \nof the Koran by our military staff.\n  In those few instances where mistakes were made--and people do make \nmistakes--they were corrected and persons were held accountable.\n  We also learned that the prisoners themselves had abused the Koran 15 \ntimes, in some cases, reportedly, to implicate our soldiers in a \nreligious crime.\n  Multiple inquiries have found that the detainees at Guantanamo are \nbeing treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions and U.S. law. \nThey are well fed and well housed. They have access to clean showers, \nMuslim chaplains, and even psychological counseling if they request it.\n  Some might say they are living in more luxury and safety than our \nsoldiers and marines fighting the terrorists in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Our service men and women in the field usually eat cold, packaged \nmeals; sleep in crude living areas without beds; and often wonder if \nthey will live to see the next day, all in the cause of promoting \nfreedom and democracy and defending our country.\n  One thing is for sure, the detainees are enemy combatants who were \npicked up off the battlefields of Afghanistan and elsewhere. They are \nhardened terrorists and have pledged their lives to jihad, the death of \nAmericans, and the destruction of our country.\n  They are being held at Guantanamo so they don't kill more Americans, \neither at home or abroad.\n  They are being held at Guantanamo so that we can question them, so \nthat we can prevent their colleagues from committing more terrorist \nacts.\n  The intelligence we have learned about the terrorists, their \nnetworks, their plans, and so on, has been a treasure trove that has \nsaved lives and is helping us win the war on terror.\n  Personally, I am convinced that Guantanamo is humanely and fairly \nserving its much needed purpose. And I am also convinced that if we \nclosed the camp, it wouldn't make one bit of difference to the \nterrorists who hate us and murdered 3,000 innocent American citizens \nbefore Guantanamo or the war on terror was ever conceived of.\n  And it will make no difference to those who have agitated and \nprotested against American policy from the very start.\n  We can debate whether Guantanamo helps us save lives and win the war \non terror. But what I can't stomach are the comparisons being made \nbetween Guantanamo and some of the most egregious symbols in the \nhistory of mankind.\n  I am referring to the remarks of Amnesty International officials that \ncompared the U.S.-run Guantanamo to the Soviet gulag.\n  I am referring to the International Committee of the Red Cross \nofficial who reportedly compared U.S. soldiers to Nazis.\n  And, regrettably, I am referring to a Senate colleague who, this \nweek, called Guantanamo a ``death camp'' and drew parallels to Hitler's \nGermany, Stalin's gulags, and Pol Pot's killing fields.\n  This was a heinous slander against our country, and against the brave \nmen and women who have taken great care to treat the captured \nterrorists with more respect than they would ever have received in any \npoint in human history.\n  It is reported that nearly 9 million people were killed by Adolf \nHitler; about 20.7 million were killed in the soviet gulags from 1929-\n1953; and over 1.5 million people were killed in Cambodia from 1975 to \n1979.\n  And there is no need to recount the brutal torture and manner in \nwhich many of these people died, most of whom, if not all, were \ninnocent people.\n  Do we know how many people have been killed at Guantanamo? Zero. \nThat's right: zero people.\n  And yet we have members of this body who have come to the Senate \nfloor to level the most egregious charges, compare our troops to Nazis, \nand charge the United States with crimes against humanity. To accuse \nour sons and daughters, who are serving proudly to keep killers from \nthe battlefield, with committing genocide and war crimes is beyond the \npale.\n  It is wrong to make these comparisons; it is wrong to suggest such \nthings. It is unfair to our military; it is unfair to the American \npeople; and it is unfair to this body. This is wrong and it is the \nworst form of demagoguery.\n  It is anti-American and only fuels the animus of our enemies who are \nconstantly searching for ways to portray\n\n[[Page S6721]]\n\nour great country and our people as anti-Muslim, anti-Arab. It is this \ntype of language that they use to recruit others to be car bombers; \nsuicide attackers; hostage takers, and full-fledged jihadists.\n  It is darkly ironic that those who want to close Guantanamo for the \nsake of public diplomacy are themselves wreaking great damage to our \npublic diplomacy by floating outlandish and slanderous allegations.\n  It has to stop. We can, and should, have serious debates about \nlegitimate policy questions. But comparing our Nation, our Government \nand our military to the regimes of Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Soviet \nRussia, and Pol Pot's Cambodia is the height of irresponsibility.\n  Frankly, I think it demands an apology to our service men and women, \nand to all others in our Government who are working hard every day to \nstop the terrorists, prevent attacks on our homeland, and to win the \nwar on terrorism.\n  We are fighting a war. And young men and women are out in the field, \nrisking their lives. For their sake, the toxic rhetoric must stop.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6721-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CMA FESTIVAL\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President. Nashville, TN is home to some of the best \nmusic in the world. Last weekend, I had the pleasure of being back home \nduring the 2005 Country Music Association Festival--``Country Music's \nBiggest Party.''\n  More than 130,000 country music lovers from around the world come to \nhear their favorite stars perform for the 4-day extravaganza. The \nenergy is electric.\n  From legendary artists like Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton, to new \ntalents like Sarah Evans, Rascal Flats, and Gretchen Wilson, more than \n400 country music stars perform over 70 hours of music.\n  Not only are fans treated to the best country music has to offer, \nthey get to meet their favorite stars up close and personal at the Fan \nFair Exhibit Hall where performers sign autographs and mingle with the \ncrowd.\n  This year, fans were treated to the first ever Music Festival Kick-\nOff parade in downtown, and a spectacular fireworks display, Sunday \nnight, at the Coliseum. In just 4 days, the festival generates more \nthan $20 million for the local economy.\n  The CMA Festival has become a Nashville institution, joining the \nGrand Ole Opry and the Ryman Auditorium as symbols of our rich musical \ntraditions.\n  Nashville's thriving music scene has also attracted another festival \ncalled Bonaroo--a 4-day event that brings more than 75,000 music lovers \nto Manchester, TN. The event showcases a wide variety of music \nincluding rock, jazz and bluegrass.\n  This year, more than 80 bands participated, including: the Allman \nBrothers; Dave Matthews; and Alison Krauss. In just 4 years, Bonaroo \nhas become America's premier rock festival.\n  Tennessee is truly a musical mecca. And it has launched some of the \nbiggest careers in music history, including: Elvis Presley; Hank \nWilliams; Johnny Cash; Loretta Lynn; B.B. King; and Garth Brooks, one \nof the biggest selling popular music artists of all time.\n  I'm proud and blessed to be from this extraordinary place. And I am \nproud to be from Nashville, ``Music City USA.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6721-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6721-S6722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            OBSTRUCTIONISTS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, on Tuesday--for the record, today is \nThursday--President Bush gave a speech in which he complained that \nDemocrats are obstructionists because we are not accepting his entire \nagenda.\n  The President also said that we say no to everything. I listened to \nhim and I watched him on TV. But look at all the things he says no to. \nPresident Bush said no to Tony Blair when the Prime Minister was here \nto ask for more help for Africa, to help with AIDS, hunger, and loan \nreduction. He said no.\n  President Bush says no to kids with juvenile diabetes, autism, or \nother childhood diseases, when they ask to be permitted to do stem cell \nresearch to see if we can prevent those diseases from plaguing these \nyoungsters for life.\n  President Bush said no to parents and teachers who want education \nfully funded.\n  President Bush said no to a real Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  President Bush said no to making polluters pay for Superfund \nenvironmental cleanups, a program that has been very successful. I was \nauthor of the second iteration of Superfund in 1986. It was a program \nthat needed some time to get going. But now we can look at lots of \nsites that have been cleaned up and are put to useful purposes that \ndon't threaten children or families who live in the area. President \nBush said no to making the polluters pay. He said yes to making the \ntaxpayers pay for the cleanup problems the polluters created.\n  President Bush said no to getting tough with the Saudi Arabians, so \nwe can really bring down oil prices. The Saudis said no to us when we \nasked for help in keeping oil prices down. Look what has happened to \noil prices. I remember so vividly in the last Presidential campaign, \nwhen Senator Kerry challenged President Bush. The thing that came out \nof the White House--the statement most clearly was: If Senator Kerry \nbecomes President, you are going to see taxes on oil prices. If you \nwant to see taxes on oil prices, just look at what happened. The only \ndifference is these taxes are being paid to Saudi Arabia and other \nplaces that are not friendly to the United States. But the public is \npaying for it. Gasoline has gone from $1.20 to, in some places, $2.50, \nwhich I paid recently. I don't hear the President saying no to them \nwhen they call and say they want help from us.\n  And the President calls us the obstructionists? I find that label \nvery interesting. What it means is, if you oppose any of President \nBush's policies, you are an obstructionist. Frankly, in a democratic \nNation, that is unacceptable. It is a disastrous line of thinking. In \nmy view, if you don't like challenge, then you don't understand \ndemocracy. This is not a nation where we have a dictator. There should \nnot be a time when simply because the President of the United States \nthinks it is a good idea that we avoid debate or challenge that we \nshould. No, not on your life. That is how we get ideas and how we \nchallenge the public in this country to say something about the \nprograms in which we are engaged.\n  The President says: If you don't like my programs, then you are an \nobstructionist.\n  Tell that to the people whose pensions are fading in front of their \neyes. Tell that to the people who work 25, 30 years for a company and \nsee their jobs ended, without the prospect of coming anywhere near the \nsalary they were earning. No, he doesn't say no to the people he ought \nto say no to. The President proposed the other day--yesterday--that the \ntax rate that has done us so much good is something he wants to make \npermanent--I wish he would say no to that--so that the wealthiest among \nus don't go ahead and wait for their airplanes to be delivered after 3 \nyears. If you order a private airplane--a $25 million or $30 million \nairplane--if you want to buy one, sorry, there is a line. If you want \nlarge yachts, 100 to 200 feet, you have to wait 2 years. What a pity it \nis for those rich guys to have to pay their share of taxes. I am one of \nthose who have been so fortunate in America. I created a business that \ngot to be very big, along with two other friends who grew up in the \npoor neighborhood in which I lived. I am more than willing to pay more \ntaxes because, if I do that, I have more money left.\n\n  I wish the President of the United States would say no to those \npeople and yes to the people struggling to make a living; yes to the \nkids who cannot afford to pay for college tuition; yes to those people \nand don't accuse the Democrats of being obstructionists. Saddam Hussein \ndidn't have to worry about obstructionists in his country. He killed \nthem or jailed them. Mr. President, leaders who are free of \nobstructionists are also known as dictators.\n  Our constituents elected us to represent them and their viewpoints in \nthe Senate. One thing I knew when I came to this Senate--now over 20 \nyears ago--I wasn't elected by all the Republicans, by a long shot. I \nam not even sure I was elected by all of the Democrats. But I won. When \nI stood and took my oath, I never thought once\n\n[[Page S6722]]\n\nthat I don't have to pay attention to those who did not vote for me--\nthe Republicans, typically. When I won this seat and the \nresponsibility, I accepted the responsibility, and I had an obligation \nto every citizen in my State and the citizens of this country to listen \nto them and try to understand their needs. That is what you get in a \ndemocracy. You get the opportunity to represent all of the people. It \nis not just the rubberstamp of the President's initiatives. The \nConstitution created the Senate as a check on Presidential power. The \nFounding Fathers created the Senate in order to obstruct the President, \nwhen necessary.\n  Mr. President, throughout history, so-called obstructionists have \nbeen the champions of democracy. Looking at these photos of people like \nthis who resisted tyranny, are they obstructionists? Are the people who \nstood up against tyranny in so many other countries obstructionists? \nAre they people who are fighting for a cause, or are they \nobstructionists? This picture looks like Boston. Can those people be \ncalled obstructionists as they tried to defend their land? I don't \nthink so. If we look further, there were people who disagreed with some \nof the Founding Fathers' views, who obstructed the King of England with \nour Declaration of Independence. It was a pretty good idea, one would \nhave to assume. There was another time when an obstructionist stood up \nwith incredible courage; her name was Rosa Parks. She obstructed \nimmoral rules in her State, and in the picture you see her being \nfingerprinted before she goes to jail. Obstructionist? There was a \nformer Republican Senator, Margaret Chase Smith. She spoke so \neloquently in 1950 in the Senate in order to obstruct the tactics of \nSenator Joe McCarthy, with his bullying, sadistic kind of approach. Is \nthat an obstructionist or is that a heroine? Women fought for the right \nto vote. The young women who are here tonight cannot think about times \nlike that. Imagine a woman not being allowed to vote. Were they \nobstructionists?\n  Mr. President, the signs in the picture say, ``How long must women \nwait for liberty?'' And ``Mr. President, what will you do for woman \nsuffrage, for the right to vote?'' Yes, they obstructed immorality.\n  So obstructionism, per se, is not an evil force if you are on the \nside of the people.\n  I say here today, in light of our democracy's heritage of productive \nobstructionism, I will be proud to obstruct some of President Bush's \nproposals this year.\n  I am happy to obstruct the President's plan to privatize Social \nSecurity and throw our retirement security into the stock market. I \nwill be happy to obstruct those. If people want to take a chance, if \nthey want to gamble, they should go to Atlantic City or Las Vegas, but \ndo not do it with your pension because when you need it, it is liable \nnot to be there.\n  A few months ago the President presented an unrealistic and flawed \nbudget to Congress, and I hope to obstruct many items in the \nPresident's misguided budget proposal. For example, I hope to obstruct \nPresident Bush's plan to cut Medicaid by $60 billion over 10 years. \nCuts that hurt the poor and the elderly, our Nation's most vulnerable \npopulations. They need that help for their health and for their \nfamilies. I am not going to stand by and not obstruct those cuts.\n  President Bush wants to take health care away from lower income \nfamilies and lower income senior citizens. Is there any compassion \nthere? I do not think so.\n  If we look at Amtrak, the Nation's premier rail service, the \nPresident wants to leave it without money, zero fund Amtrak, shut down \nthe system. You better believe I am going to be there to obstruct that \nplan whenever I can. Shut down the system that took 25 million riders \nto their destinations last year?\n  The President also wants to slash community development programs. He \nproposes cutting funding to these programs by more than a third. Nearly \n$4 billion will be taken out of communities across the country. I want \nto obstruct that.\n  In regard to protecting our homeland, President Bush has proposed \nreducing homeland security block grants, cutting them by $253 million. \nAmerica's soil, America's land, it is a second front in this war \nagainst terrorism, and our soldiers are paying a price for their fight \nthere, a terrible price, because the President said no to having enough \nsoldiers to do that job right from the beginning. There are great \ngenerals who now reflect on the mission and say: We could have used \nmore soldiers there. One very senior general got fired for suggesting \nwe need over 300,000 troops there.\n  The President said no to them, but he should not say no to having \nhomeland security financed sufficiently to protect our citizens when \nthey go to work, go to school, go to the library, or travel about our \ncountry. I hope everyone in this Chamber will obstruct that cut. I \nwould like my colleagues to say no to that.\n  On the issue of airline travel, President Bush wants to increase the \nairline passenger tax by $3 for each leg of a flight. A family of four \ntraveling with a layover each way could see their taxes increase by up \nto $64 for their round trip.\n  People are already paying too much in airline passenger taxes. I will \nobstruct, yes, obstruct President Bush's tax increase.\n  On our environment, President Bush's budget cuts environmental and \nnatural resource programs by $2 billion. With child asthma cases \nincreasing and other environmental dangers increasing across the \ncountry, why would we reduce environmental protection?\n  I have a grandson who is 11, and he happens to have asthma. He is the \noldest of my 10 grandchildren. He is a very good athlete. But whenever \nmy daughter takes him to compete in a baseball game or a soccer game, \nshe always checks where the nearest emergency clinic is in case he has \nan asthma attack. Childhood asthma is growing in this country by leaps \nand bounds, and it is because the air is bad and we are not doing \nenough to clean it up. Asthma and other environmental dangers are \nincreasing across the country. Why would President Bush say no to \nenvironmental protection? President Bush, I do not know why you want to \nobstruct funding for those programs.\n  Obstructionism is all that separates democracy from dictatorship. \nSometimes obstruction is necessary, and in the case of President Bush's \nagenda, it deserves a healthy amount of obstruction. I hope my \ncolleagues on this floor, regardless of party, will look at each of the \nPresident's programs and say: Remember that President Bush obstructed \nfunding for teaching, for schools, for stem cell research, for research \non Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. Remember, he obstructed funding for \nthose programs. He took care of the rich, who are only getting richer.\n  If you looked in the New York Times about 2 weeks ago, there was an \narticle about how the richest in this country are leaving the rich \nbehind, about how 90 percent of the people in this country who work to \nkeep their families together own only 10 percent of the assets of the \ncountry, and it is just the reverse on the top side.\n  In the case of President Bush's agenda, it deserves a healthy amount \nof obstruction, and I hope the people in this Chamber have the courage \nto stand up and say: No, I obstruct those terrible cuts and that mean, \nunhelpful disposition to make it tougher for hard-working families in \nthis country to be able to support themselves, their children, and \ntheir needs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6722-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6722-S6723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BOLTON NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, last evening, something rather \nextraordinary happened here in the waning minutes of the session. My \nvery good friend from Kansas, the distinguished chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, took the floor to discuss the Bolton \nnomination--an issue, I say to my colleagues, no one wants to be \nresolved more quickly than the Senator from Connecticut. I have been \ninvolved in this for two straight months. The Presiding Officer and I \nare both on the Committee on Foreign Relations. This goes back to April \n11, the day we had hearings. My hope is that we can resolve this matter \nsooner rather than later.\n  Last night, my friend from Kansas took the floor and announced that \nhe knew what names the members of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee were concerned about when dealing\n\n[[Page S6723]]\n\nwith the Bolton nomination. This is the matter of the intercepts Mr. \nBolton requested--some 10 of them--involving 19 names of U.S. citizens, \nAmericans, on those 10 intercepts. We made the request earlier on to \nallow the chairman and ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, as \nwell as the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, to review the raw data on those 10 intercepts to determine \nwhether there were any problems associated with Mr. Bolton's desire to \nsee those intercepts, since there has been a basis of information \nconcerning efforts by Mr. Bolton to intimidate a number of people \nwithin the intelligence community--of both the intelligence and \nresearch division of the State Department, as well as the CIA--\nconcerning certain intelligence conclusions. Therefore, it is a matter \nof concern to many of us on the committee that we have an opportunity \nto review whether there has been any further intimidation.\n  I offered initially that we have the four Senators I mentioned review \nthe matter. That was rejected by the administration. I then suggested \nwhy not just submit the names we are interested in and have the \nIntelligence Director inform us as to whether those names were part of \nthe intercepts. If they were not, end of matter. If they were, we might \nwant to proceed further to determine why those names were sought out. \nThat was also rejected because the number of names requested to be \nreviewed was some 36 names. The reason I made the request for 36 names \nis because we had no idea specifically what these 10 intercepts \ninvolved. We were even denied a synopsis of what may be involved. We \nwere flying in the dark about this information.\n  At any rate, my colleague and friend from Kansas proceeded to say he \nwas familiar with what the six or seven names would be that we should \nbe interested in. As a result, he proceeded to publicly name five of \nthe seven individuals he identified. Not surprisingly, he also \nannounced he consulted with Director Negroponte, who informed my friend \nthat none of the names Senator Roberts provided to the administration \nwere among the names Mr. Bolton and his staff were given by the \nNational Security Agency.\n  What is remarkable about what happened last evening is that the \nSenator from Kansas is not a member of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee--the committee of jurisdiction with respect to the Bolton \nnomination. The Senator did not participate in more than 10 hours of \nhearings on the nomination. I sincerely doubt whether our colleague \nreviewed the more than 1,000 pages of transcripts from more than 30 \ninterviews conducted by the bipartisan staff who jointly conducted \nthose interviews. I know of no one on the committee who was consulted \nby our friend from Kansas to provide any input to the list that was \nsettled upon.\n  I do believe we owe our colleague from Kansas a debt of gratitude, \nbecause the administration has at least now accepted the principle of \ncross-checking names against the list of names reviewed by Mr. Bolton. \nIf the administration, in a matter of hours can cross-check seven names \noffered up by Senator Roberts, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, \nwhy is it a problem to cross-check the 36 names we have drawn up based \non our own participation in the 10 hours of committee hearings and \nreview of over 1,000 pages of interview?\n  We are not on some fishing expedition here at all to derail the \nBolton nomination. We have not opened the State Department phonebook \nand selected names at random. There is a very specific rationale for \neach of the names on the list of 36 developed as a result of 10 hours \nof hearings, 1,000 pages of transcripts, and some 30 interviews.\n  The report of Mr. Bolton's hearing quite clearly and starkly paints a \npicture of an individual who is an ideologue determined to have his own \nway. We know what he tried to do with the underlings at the State \nDepartment and CIA--that is not in debate--who dared resist his efforts \nto endorse as fact what was not supported by available intelligence. \nMr. Bolton tried to crush them. We know what he tried to do with other \ncareer State Department employees who ran afoul of him for inexplicable \nreasons. He sought to have them excluded in legal deliberations in \nareas of their responsibility or blackballed them from being assigned \npositions within the Department.\n  Mr. Bolton was a very driven individual when he sought to get his way \nwith underlings. He even went so far as to propose a CIA analyst be \ndenied country clearance so that he could not undertake official \nforeign travel.\n  He even sought to have the same individual's State Department \nbuilding pass revoked. I do not need to go over these matters in \ndetail, but the fact is, there is more than ample justification for \nseeking these 36 names, as well as the information that Senator Biden \nhas raised regarding the raw data, the draft speeches dealing with \ntestimony before the House committees on Syria.\n  These are not difficult requests to satisfy. As I said a minute ago, \nmy friend from Kansas submitted seven names to the Department, and he \nwas told within a matter of hours or less that they were not on the 10 \nintercepts. So whether or not the 36 names sought by the Foreign \nRelations Committee are included on those intercepts should also be a \nquestion that can be answered in a reasonable amount of time.\n  I have not told anyone, despite a number of requests, the names of \nthe 36 people we would like to have checked out. I think acknowledging \ncertain names is dangerously close to bordering on revealing the \nimportance of the intercept traffic. When certain names are mentioned \nand then excluded, there is an implication that maybe they should be on \nthose lists. So I would caution Members from publicly talking about the \nnames. We have made no effort to do so. We, of course, want to limit \nthe number of Senators who would actually be able to review this matter \nto four Senators out of the 100 in this body.\n  In all my years here, I have never faced such a situation where a \ncoequal Member of this body has presumed to speak on behalf of \nanother--in this case, suggesting that he knew which names we should \nrequest. Having submitted those names, he then discovered, of course, \nthat those names were not on the intercept list that we saw.\n  So I am still hopeful this matter can be resolved. I do not think it \nshould take that long. Certainly, if the administration would just \nrespond to the two requests regarding the draft statements--\ncongressional testimony by Mr. Bolton--and check out the names that we \nhave requested regarding these intercepts, if that information is \nprovided and clears up those two matters, then I think this body is \nready to vote up or down on Mr. Bolton.\n  Perhaps he behaved more judiciously in dealing with his peers and \nsuperiors than he did with those below him in rank. Perhaps the \ninformation he requested from the NSA was routine and solely to carry \nout his responsibilities as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control \nand International Security.\n  But given Mr. Bolton's zealotry on proliferation, on North Korea, on \nLibya, on Syria and other policy areas, it is not unreasonable to worry \nthat he used all tools at his disposal to advance his causes. That is \nwhat we seek to find out through a cross checking of our names of \nconcern against the names provided to Mr. Bolton.\n  As a matter of institutional right, we have, I think, an absolute \nright, as a coequal branch of Government, to solicit information that \ndirectly pertains to the qualifications of this individual to be \nconfirmed by the Senate for the position to which he has been \nnominated. So I would hope that the information would be forthcoming \nand that we would be able to get the answers and move on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6723-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6723-S6724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TOBACCO\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this morning's reports on the Justice \nDepartment's tobacco case are deeply disturbing for all Americans \nconcerned about the health of their children. The Justice Department \nmemos obtained by reporters show that high-level Bush administration \npolitical appointees overruled professional lawyers in the case in \nslashing damages the tobacco companies would be required to pay. There \nis no clearer example of this administration's view that Government and \nthe courts should protect big corporations first and real people last. \nWhether it is global warning or Iraq or tobacco, their view is that the \nfacts\n\n[[Page S6724]]\n\nshould never be allowed to get in the way of their rightwing politics.\n  There are few initiatives that would have a greater impact on the \nhealth of our children than smoking prevention. No parent in America \never says, ``I hope my child grows up to be a smoker.'' Parents know \nthat every child we prevent from smoking will have a healthier, fuller, \nhappier life.\n  That is what this lawsuit was all about--requiring big tobacco \ncompanies to pay for antismoking programs.\n  I urge the President to intervene with his Justice Department. They \nmade a political decision to back big tobacco. Now the President should \nmake the responsible decision to back America's families.\n  If the tobacco companies do not pay for their misdeeds, then our \nfamilies will pay with more cancer, more illness, and shortened lives.\n  From a public interest perspective, the worst thing would be for the \nJustice Department to settle with the tobacco companies based upon the \nweak and inadequate demand that DOJ made to the court last week. At \nthis point, we have far more confidence that the court will do the \nright thing than the Justice Department will do the right thing. The \ncourt has the authority to look beyond the Justice recommendations and \nto order strong remedies based on the evidence presented at the trial. \nWe should let the court decide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6724-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6724-S6726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           AGAINST RACE-BASED GOVERNMENT IN HAWAII, PART III\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam. President, I rise today to ask unanimous consent that \nthe following account of the history of the Hawaiian monarchy be \nprinted in the Record following my present remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. This history is in the appendix to ``Hawaii Divided Against \nItself Cannot Stand,'' an analysis of the 1993 apology resolution and \nS. 147, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, that was \nprepared by constitutional scholar Bruce Fein. I previously have \nintroduced earlier parts of that analysis into the Record--this is the \nthird and final instalment.\n  The appendix to Mr. Fein's analysis carefully explains the nature of \nthe Hawaiian monarchy, its evolution toward constitutional democracy, \nthe attempt by the last monarch to undercut those reforms and \ncompromise the judiciary, and the actors involved in stopping that \nmonarch and establishing a democratic republic. This account is a \nuseful antidote to the tendentious blame-America narrative provided in \nthe 1993 apology resolution. The truth is much more nuanced than the \nresolution's ``Whites vs. Natives'' account. The real story is about a \nmultiracial constitutional monarchy slowly evolving toward democratic \nnorms and equal rights--a process whose final step was the admission of \nHawaii as a State in the Union. That step was approved in 1959 by 94 \npercent of Hawaii's voters--large majorities of non-Natives and Natives \nalike.\n  The Native Hawaiian Government Act would undo that step--Hawaii's \nadmission to the Union as a unified people and State. Indeed, it would \neven undo the progress made under the Kamehameha monarchy. That \nconstitutional monarchy was not a monoracial institution. It included \nHawaiians of all races. This bill would create, for the first time in \nHawaii since the early 19th century, a government of one race only. \nThis is not progress.\n  I urge my colleagues to read Mr. Fein's history, and to ask \nthemselves why we would want to undo the achievements of past \ngenerations of Hawaiians by enacting S. 147 and creating a race-based \ngovernment in Hawaii.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         [From the Grassroot Institute of Hawaii, Jun. 1, 2005]\n\n               Hawaii Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand\n\n                            (By Bruce Fein)\n\n\n                                APPENDIX\n\n       The apology issued by the United States Congress in 1993 to \n     the Native Hawaiians for the ``illegal'' overthrow of the \n     Hawaiian monarchy and its annexation to the United States is \n     riddled with historical inaccuracies. The resolution alleges \n     that the Committee of Safety, the political juggernaut that \n     deposed Queen Lili'uokalani, ``represented American and \n     European sugar planters, descendants of missionaries, and \n     financiers.'' The language fails to disclose the Hawaiian \n     monarchy's deep and lasting ties with the most powerful sugar \n     planters on the islands. Many of the wealthiest sugar barons \n     steadfastly supported the monarchy in opposition to the \n     Committee for Safety.\n       Chinese and Japanese immigrants provided an abundant source \n     of cheap labor on the sugar plantations. They labored for \n     wages below what was required on the American mainland. The \n     sugar planters owed their impressive profit margins to these \n     workers. Annexation to the United States would have \n     eliminated the sugar planter's labor cost advantage. Many \n     sugar barons vigorously defended the monarchy to retain their \n     access to cheap labor.\n       The sugar barons invested heavily in the monarchy. Claus \n     Spreckels, the wealthiest sugar baron on the islands, \n     established Claus Spreckels & Co. Bank in 1885. King Kalakaua \n     borrowed heavily from Spreckels' bank; the planter's \n     substantial influence garnered him the nickname ``King \n     Claus''. King Kalakaua unsuccessfully endeavored to secure a \n     two million dollar loan from the British to settle his debts \n     to Spreckels' bank. Spreckels' financial stake in the \n     monarchy provided him with considerable political capital, \n     which he spent securing his business interests. After the \n     Committee of Safety deposed the Queen, Spreckels vigorously \n     lobbied for her re-instatement.\n       Some planters and financiers did offer their support to the \n     Committee of Safety due to economic concerns. Prior to 1890, \n     the United States conferred the privilege of duty free sugar \n     imports only on Hawaii. The McKinley Tariffs eliminated \n     Hawaii's advantage by allowing all foreign suppliers to \n     export their sugar to the United States duty free and \n     subsidizing domestic sugar production. Some businessman \n     favored establishing a free trade agreement with the United \n     States; others contended that annexation would assure \n     unfettered access to American markets for Hawaiian goods. \n     However, the congressional resolution exaggerates the \n     presence of sugar planters on the Committee of Safety. Two \n     members did hold management positions at sugar companies, and \n     the Honolulu Ironworks, a provider of equipment to the \n     plantations, employed another member. No member held a \n     controlling interest in a sugar company, nor would it be \n     accurate to assert that any of the members were sugar barons.\n       Queen Lili'uokalani herself furnished the proximate cause \n     of the revolt. Since its inception in 1810, the Hawaiian \n     monarchy embraced increasingly democratic governance. Queen \n     Lili'uokalani reversed that trend when she sought to \n     unilaterally change the constitution to augment her own power \n     and weaken the government's system of checks and balances. \n     The Hawaiian constitution, that the Queen had sworn to \n     uphold, explicitly limited the power to revise the \n     Constitution to the legislature, which represented native and \n     non-Native Hawaiians alike. Her proposed Constitution allowed \n     the monarch to appoint nobles for life, reduced judges' \n     tenure from life to six years, removed the prohibition \n     against diminishing judge's compensation, and admonished \n     Cabinet members that they would serve only ``during the \n     queen's pleasure.'' The Queen's own cabinet refused to \n     legitimize her autocratic constitution. Her disregard for \n     democracy provoked the 1893 revolution. The congressional \n     resolution blatantly ignores the historical circumstances \n     surrounding her overthrow.\n       While the apology expressly condemns the alleged military \n     intervention by the United States, the Hawaiian monarchy \n     itself established its primacy through a series of bloody \n     conflicts with rival chieftains. King Kamehameha I succeeded \n     in uniting the islands and establishing control over foreign \n     immigration, which began with Captain Cook's arrival nearly \n     thirty years earlier. He did not hold elections. He gained \n     power through brute force and ruthless measures. During a \n     battle in the Nuuanu Valley, Kamehameha's forces drove \n     thousands of Oahuan warriors off steep cliffs to their death. \n     According to the logic of the congressional Apology \n     Resolution, King Kamehameha I's seizure of land by force \n     amounts to a violation of international law. The Hawaiian \n     monarchy, which the resolution holds in such high regard, is \n     guilty of far more egregious ``illegal'' actions than those \n     supposedly perpetrated by the United States.\n       In 1819, shortly after the death of Kamehameha I, his \n     widow, Kaahumanu, became the de facto ruler and installed the \n     deceased King's 23 year old son by another wife, Liholiho, as \n     the nominal ruler, thereafter known as Kamehameha II. Under \n     pressure from Kaahumanu and Keopuolani, the young king's \n     mother, Liholiho broke the kapu, ordered the destruction of \n     heiaus (stone alters) and the burning of wooden idols. \n     Anthropologists have long regarded pre-contact Hawaii as the \n     most highly stratified of all Polynesian chiefdoms. The \n     chiefly elite from Maui and Hawaii Island had exercised a \n     cycle of territorial conquest, promulgating the kapu system, \n     an ideology based on the cult of Ku, a human sacrifice-\n     demanding god of war, to legitimize chiefly dominance over \n     the common people. The chiefs typically imposed the death \n     penalty for violating kapu; women and those of lower castes \n     suffered disproportionately under the system. When Liholiho \n     broke the kapu by sitting down to eat with the women Ali'i, \n     Kaahumanu announced, ``We intend to eat pork and bananas and \n     coconuts\n\n[[Page S6725]]\n\n     and live as the white people do.'' The following year, 1820, \n     the first American missionaries arrived in Hawaii. Soon \n     after, Kaahumanu took charge of Christianity and made it the \n     official religion of the Kingdom. These shattering changes in \n     the religion, culture and governance of Hawaii were the work \n     of the Native Hawaiians themselves.\n       All foreigners came under the purview of the Native \n     Hawaiian monarchy. The Apology Resolution decries the \n     imperialist tendencies of the missionaries, yet their access \n     to Native Hawaiians remained contingent on the monarchy's \n     good graces. Several attempts to inject the Ten Commandments \n     into the civil code failed, and King Kamehameha III actually \n     banned Catholic missionaries for a time.\n       The Hawaiian monarchy had gained international recognition \n     by the reign of King Kamehameha III. The child king ceded \n     power to his regent, Kaahumanu, who remained the de facto \n     ruler until her death in 1832. While the regency yielded \n     significant changes in Hawaiian common law, including the \n     introduction of jury trials, King Kamehameha III affected a \n     seismic shift toward democracy when he produced the \n     Constitution of 1840. The influx of foreign merchants and \n     settlers had exposed the Native Hawaiians to new modes of \n     jurisprudence and governance. These revolutionary ideas found \n     expression in the new Hawaiian constitution. King Kamehameha \n     III took a particular interest in studying political \n     structures; he requested that an American missionary, William \n     Richards, tutor him in political economy and law.\n       The king, the chiefs, and their advisors convened to draft \n     a declaration of rights and laws in 1839. The declaration \n     secured the rights of each Hawaiian citizen to ``life, limb, \n     liberty, the labor of his lands, and productions of his \n     mind'' and represented a critical concession to the king's \n     subjects. The language ensured that native and non-Native \n     Hawaiian citizens enjoyed equal protection under the law.\n       The following year, the council of chiefs and King \n     Kamehameha III drafted a formal constitution. The document \n     provided for the creation of a ``representative body'' chosen \n     by the people and a supreme court consisting of the king; the \n     kuhina-nui, the premier or regent; and four judges appointed \n     by the ``representative body.'' Moreover, the document \n     specified that only the legislature could approve alterations \n     to the constitution following a year's notice of the proposed \n     change. The government followed the mandated procedure and \n     revised the constitution in 1852, which more explicitly \n     outlined the powers accorded to each branch of government. \n     While the Hawaiians borrowed many of their political \n     philosophies from Western civilization, they forged a \n     government of their own accord.\n       The Apology Resolution contends that ``the Indigenous \n     Hawaiian people never directly relinquished their claims to \n     their inherent sovereignty as a people or over their national \n     lands to the United States,'' yet the land system remained \n     virtually unchanged after the 1893 overthrow and subsequent \n     annexation. King Kamehameha III embarked on an ambitious land \n     reform program in 1848, termed the ``Great Mahele.'' The \n     original spate of reforms, the Buke Mahele, divided the land \n     amongst the King and the 245 chiefs. The King further divided \n     his lands into the Crown Lands and the Government Lands, the \n     latter was to be ``managed, leased, or sold, in accordance \n     with the will of said Nobles and Representatives . . .'' \n     [Footnote: R.S. Kuykendall, The Hawaiian Kingdom 1778-1854 \n     Vol 1, pg. 289.] Then, the Kuleana Grant program offered fee \n     simple titles to the native tenants tilling each plot or \n     kuleana. The commoners' share of land constituted a small \n     fraction of the total; however, the kuleana lands were the \n     primary productive agricultural land of the Kingdom and were \n     considered extremely valuable. The Kuleana Grants awarded \n     land to approximately two out of every three Native Hawaiian \n     families.\n       The editor of the Polynesian newspaper extolled the grant \n     as ``the crowning fact that gives liberty to a nation of \n     serfs.'' Indeed, fifty years prior to annexation, the \n     Hawaiian monarchy dismantled the ``subsistent social system \n     based on communal land tenure'' that the Apology Resolution \n     references. The government only extended the possibility of \n     land ownership to foreign born residents two years after the \n     Kuleana Grant. The provisional government of 1893 simply \n     gained ownership of the crown lands and the government lands. \n     The Apology Resolution faults the United States for acquiring \n     those lands from the provisional government without providing \n     compensation to Hawaii. Yet, the United States assumed over \n     3.8 million dollars of Hawaii's public debt, largely incurred \n     under the monarchy, after annexation. That debt burden \n     amounts to twice the market value of the land the United \n     States inherited. Native Hawaiians did not forfeit one acre \n     of land as a consequence of the overthrow or annexation.\n       King Kamehameha III's reign institutionalized a measure of \n     representative democracy and property rights in Hawaii. King \n     Kamehameha V's failure to designate a successor afforded \n     native and non-native subjects alike the opportunity to elect \n     the next two monarchs, King Lunalilo and King Kalakaua. The \n     Hawaiian monarchy itself infused democracy, property rights, \n     and a system of common law into Hawaiian society. The \n     annexation did not alter those institutions.\n       The Constitution of 1887 extended democracy to the \n     selection of nobility, reduced the arbitrary power of the \n     King, stipulated that only the legislature could approve \n     constitutional changes, and mandated that no cabinet minister \n     could be dismissed without the legislature's consent. While \n     the King signed the new constitution under pressure from a \n     militia group, the Honolulu Rifles, the net effect of the \n     revisions provided Hawaiian citizens with a more democratic \n     government. Many natives expressed concern over the extension \n     of suffrage to resident foreigners of western descent and the \n     property qualifications to vote for or become nobles. A \n     minority embarked on an ill-fated effort to depose King \n     Kalakaua and install Lili'uokalani in his place. However, \n     most native and non-native dissenters sought redress within \n     the democratic system. Their opposition parties, the National \n     Reform Party and the Liberal Party, garnered a substantial \n     number of seats in the legislature. Queen Lili'uokalani's \n     autocratic demands in 1893 appear even more egregious against \n     the backdrop of liberalization that her predecessors \n     championed.\n       The Apology Resolution also casts United States Minister to \n     Hawaii, John Stevens, in a sinister light, charging that he \n     ``conspired with a small group of non-Hawaiian residents of \n     the Kingdom of Hawaii . . . to overthrow the indigenous and \n     lawful Government of Hawaii.'' Moreover, the resolution \n     contends that the United States Navy invaded Hawaii and \n     positioned themselves ``near Hawaiian Government buildings \n     and the Iolani Palace to intimidate Queen Liliuokalani.'' \n     There is not a shred of hard evidence to support either of \n     those claims. The Blount Report itself, cited by the Apology \n     Resolution, contains statements from the leaders of the \n     revolution and from John Stevens himself which directly \n     refute those allegations. W.O. Smith recounted the \n     Committee of Safety's contact with Minister Stevens in \n     Blount's report: ``Mr. Stevens gave assurances of his \n     earnest purpose to afford all the protection that was in \n     his power to protect life and property; he emphasized that \n     fact that while he would call for the United States troops \n     to protect life and property, he could not recognize any \n     government until actually established. He repeated that \n     the troops when landed would not take sides with either \n     Party, but would protect American life and property.''\n       Minister Stevens consistently denied any involvement in the \n     revolution. Any statement to the contrary amounts to little \n     more than speculation.\n       The Blount Report was a partisan endeavor. The newly \n     elected Democratic President Cleveland castigated the \n     outgoing Republican administration of President Harrison for \n     its ``interventionist'' tactics in Hawaii prior to any \n     investigation. Cleveland accused Minister Stevens of \n     orchestrating virtually every aspect of the revolution in an \n     address to Congress claiming that ``But for the notorious \n     predilections of the United States Minister for annexation, \n     the Committee of Safety, which should be called the Committee \n     of Annexation, would never have existed.'' In fact, King \n     Kamehameha III first proposed annexation to the United States \n     in 1851, despite strenuous objections from the French and the \n     British. When Cleveland commissioned the Blount report, the \n     ongoing effort to discredit the Harrison administration \n     colored Blount's impartiality. He did not swear in his \n     witnesses, nor did he interview all involved. Cleveland even \n     attempted to re-instate Queen Liliuokalani, although he \n     aborted those efforts after the Queen repeatedly insisted \n     that all involved in the Committee of Safety be executed. The \n     Senate's bipartisan Morgan Report found little evidence to \n     support Queen Lilioukalani's fraudulent claims that United \n     States pressure forced her to abdicate the crown.\n       The provisional government encountered little resistance. \n     Just 800 Hawaiian royalists staged a short-lived counter-\n     revolution in 1895. Under the leadership of President Sanford \n     B. Dole, the new government convened a constitutional \n     convention in the summer of 1894. The resulting document \n     cemented civil liberties for all Hawaiian citizens, similar \n     to the American Bill of Rights, and mandated that a Senate \n     and House of Representatives be elected by the people. \n     Royalists continued to express their frustrations in \n     opposition newspapers without censure. After the 1898 \n     annexation, Native Hawaiians proved a dynamic force in island \n     politics. While just one of the Washington-appointed \n     Governors, Samuel Wilder King, possessed Hawaiian blood, five \n     out of ten elected Delegates to Congress boasted Native \n     Hawaiian ancestry. In 1903, a Native Hawaiian Delegate to \n     Congress of royal ancestry, Prince Kuhio, delivered Hawaii's \n     first petition for statehood to Washington.\n       August 21, 1959 remains a day of celebration for Hawaiians \n     of all races and creeds. Hawaii's induction into the union as \n     the fiftieth state marked the culmination of its protracted \n     struggle for statehood. Native and non-Native Hawaiians voted \n     overwhelming in favor of statehood in the plebiscite \n     preceding the formal declaration. Native Hawaiians did not \n     rally in opposition to statehood; just 6 percent of the \n     voters opposed the measure whereas 94 percent resoundingly \n     announced their support. As Senator Inouye of Hawaii so \n     eloquently testified, ``Hawaii remains one of the greatest \n     examples of a multiethnic society living in relative peace.'' \n     Congressional Record, 1994, Page S12249. He echoes the same \n     sentiments Captain Ashford expressed in 1884 to King Kalakaua \n     when he referred to the Hawaiian flag as, ``this beautiful \n     emblem of the unity\n\n[[Page S6726]]\n\n     of many peoples who, blended together on a benignant basis of \n     political and race equality, combine to form the Kingdom of \n     Hawaii . . .'' The Akaka Bill would thus represent a wretched \n     regression in race relations that would occasion equally \n     wretched racial ills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6726-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      JUNETEENTH INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam. President, I was pleased to join the Senator from \nMichigan, Senator Levin, in submitting a resolution on the Juneteenth \nIndependence Day.\n  I have heard people ask, ``Why celebrate Juneteenth?'' We have so \nmany holidays and remembrances already--why add more history to the \ncalendar?\n  But of course, Juneteenth is not just about celebrating history. It \nis about learning from it. Just like the day when the greatest civil \nrights leader of our time was born or the day when we finally gave \nAfrican Americans a ballot and a voice, Juneteenth is a day when we can \nlook back on a time when everyday Americans faced the most daunting \nchallenges and the slimmest odds and still persevered. When they said \n``we shall overcome,'' and they did. When the hopes held by so many for \nso long finally led to the victory of freedom over servitude; of \nindependence over enslavement.\n  Juneteenth is a day that allows us to remember that America is still \nthe place where anything is possible. It has been that place in the \npast, and it can be that place in the future when it comes to the \nchallenges we have yet to meet.\n  And so when we think of those challenges--when we think of the \ninjustice we still face and the miles we have left to march--when we \nthink of the millions without health care, the children without good \nschools, the families without jobs, and the disparities that still \nexist between black and white, rich and poor, educated and uneducated--\nwhen we think about all these challenges, we can also think \n``Juneteenth.''\n  We can think of a day when the word began to spread from town to \nplantation to city to farm that after more than a hundred years of \nslavery, millions were now free. That after so many hopeless days and \nyears of despair, the impossible was now truth; the shackles were now \nbroken and a new day was finally here.\n  In the memory of this day, I believe we can find hope for all the \ntrying days we have yet to face as a people and as a nation. And as we \ncontinue to overcome, we will continue to celebrate those victories as \nhistorical markers that give future generations the same hope we have \ntoday.\n  I commend Senator Levin for his longtime leadership on civil rights \nissues and urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the upcoming Juneteenth \ncelebration that will occur this Sunday, June 19, 2005. This \ncelebration commemorates the end of slavery throughout the United \nStates. Although the Emancipation Proclamation was issued on January 1, \n1863, the information had not been passed to the most rural parts of \nthe South until some two and a half years later when General Gordon \nGranger entered Galveston, TX on June 19, 1865, and issued the \nproclamation, officially freeing the town.\n  There are a number of theories to explain why it took so long for the \nmessage of freedom to reach many slaves throughout the South. While \nthere is yet to be a definitive explanation for the delay, as we \ncontinue to recognize the importance of this date, we can be assured \nthat scholars will continue to research this part of our Nation's \nhistory.\n  Annual Juneteenth celebrations have long been a part of our Nation's \nhistory. Although they were held in the years immediately following \n1865, they were not popular in the Jim Crow-era South. In fact, they \nwere banned from public property, and, in order to continue the \ncelebrations, churches throughout the South held fundraisers to sponsor \nJuneteenth events. This was common until the Great Depression, when \npeople could no longer afford the necessities of everyday life, let \nalone celebrations of our past. At the same time, in many public \nschools, teachers often focused discussion on the day of the \nEmancipation Proclamation, even though it had no immediate impact for \nslaves in many parts of the South. Thus, there was limited recognition \nof the importance of Juneteenth until the Texas legislature recognized \nit as an official holiday on January 1, 1980.\n  This weekend we recognize this important celebration. In so doing, we \ntake time to reflect on the evil of slavery. This is a time to learn \nfrom the past and to redouble our efforts to ensure that the values of \nfreedom and liberty in this country are afforded to all its citizens. \nJuneteenth is a day for reflection, for prayer and for hope that our \ncountry will continue to grow together in the spirit of liberty, \nequality and justice.\n  I am proud to honor the 140th commemoration of the African American \nemancipation day, Juneteenth, June 19, 1865.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6726-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ``HEROES AMONG US'' AWARD RECIPIENTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin\n\n[[Page S6727]]\n\nthe Record my statement on the nomination of Thomas Griffith.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Nomination of Thomas Griffith\n\n       Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the \n     nomination of Thomas Griffith to the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the District of Columbia. I intend to vote for Mr. \n     Griffith's nomination today. When the Judiciary Committee \n     reported Mr. Griffith's nomination to the floor on April 14, \n     I opposed his nomination because of my concern over the nexus \n     between his public views on title IX and his views on stare \n     decisis. More specifically, I expressed concern that Mr. \n     Griffith had not clearly indicated that he would respect 27 \n     years of the accepted legal interpretation espoused by \n     successive administrations and other Federal appellate courts \n     regarding the ``substantial proportionality'' test of title \n     IX. In my view, failure to accept this consensus as \n     ``applicable precedent'' would mark a monumental, and \n     unacceptable, shift in the ability to enforce title IX.\n       When I voted against Mr. Griffith in the Judiciary \n     Committee, however, I stated that I would reconsider my vote \n     on the floor if I received assurances that he would respect \n     the unanimous consensus of the Federal appellate courts and \n     prior and current administration interpretations on title IX. \n     When I was unable to reach Mr. Griffith, I had my staff \n     director speak to him to ask a series of followup questions. \n     Mr. Griffith assured my staff that he would consider the \n     consensus views of the appellate courts and administration \n     views as ``applicable precedent'' with respect to any \n     challenge to title IX he might face as a sitting judge on the \n     DC Circuit. He also reiterated the point, made in his earlier \n     written responses, that he would recuse himself in any case \n     where the DC Circuit's recusal rules required it. Mr. \n     Griffith also noted that he has five daughters who are all \n     active in sports and who had been direct beneficiaries of \n     title IX. He stated that, having seen first-hand the tangible \n     effects of increased participation for women in sports, he \n     would never do anything to curtail the continued success of \n     title IX.\n       By all accounts, Mr. Griffith is an honorable man and I \n     take him at his word. It is my hope and expectation that he \n     will apply the consensus precedent on title IX matters should \n     he consider them on the bench. I am fortified in my views by \n     the strong endorsement of Mr. Griffith's nomination by three \n     individuals for whom I have great respect--Judge Abner Mikva, \n     Gregory Craig, and Lanny Breuer. I served in Congress with \n     Judge Mikva, helped shepherd his nomination to the Federal \n     bench, and worked closely with him when he was White Counsel \n     and I was chairman, then ranking member, of the Judiciary \n     Committee. I have worked with all three of these individuals, \n     and their personal assurances to me that Mr. Griffith is both \n     a man of his word and possessed of the requisite judgment and \n     temperament to sit on the Federal bench is a significant \n     factor in my decision to support his nomination. Finally, I \n     am hopeful that Mr. Griffith will also remain true to his \n     word for the sake of his five daughters who have been direct \n     beneficiaries of title IX.\n       For these reasons, I have decided to support Mr. Griffith's \n     nomination on the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6727-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             RECOGNITION OF ECONOMIC EDUCATION ACHIEVEMENTS\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I want to recognize the achievements \nof several individuals from Hawaii who have excelled in an area of \ngreat interest to me, the area of economic education.\n  First is Lance Suzuki, a teacher at Maryknoll High School in Hawaii. \nFor his AP Economics class he developed a new and very innovative piece \nof curriculum, a novel approach to involve the students in learning \neconomics. This lesson is called ``What Does 2 Trillion Dollars Buy?'' \nwhere students participate in learning the political side of the \neconomy as well as how the federal budget is developed and approved by \nthe Congress. For this lesson, he was recognized by the NASDAQ Stock \nMarket Educational Foundation, Inc. and the National Council on \nEconomic Education as the Grand Winner of their 2005 National Teaching \nAward.\n  Economic education is very important to our nation. Commercial \nmarketing continues to target younger audiences--not just teenagers, \nbut young children--to become consumers and in some cases provides them \nwith easy access to lines of credit. We must ensure that our students \nhave the necessary tools for sound financial decision making. Lance \nSuzuki's curriculum achieves this important goal. Not only will his \nstudents and school benefit, but all of us will gain from the \ninnovative efforts of Lance Suzuki. I am proud that a teacher in my \nhome State of Hawaii has been recognized with this prestigious award \nfor expanding economic education.\n  I also wish to congratulate a group from Iolani School. They are \nstudents Justin Van Etten, Lara Malins, Tyler Mizumoto and Reed Ayabe, \nand their coach, Col. Richard Rankin. These four students along with \nteam member Steve Schowalter, who was unable to attend the competition, \ncomprise the top Iolani School Economics Team. On May 23, 2005, they \nwon the 2005 National Economics Challenge, a competition that started \nout with 34,000 teams nationwide. The future of our country depends on \nour students, and I am pleased to know that Hawaii is turning out such \nsuccessful young people. I earnestly congratulate them for their \nachievement.\n  I have been very active in working to address economic and financial \nilliteracy in the United States. I have introduced legislation \nincluding the Mutual Fund Transparency Act, the College Literacy in \nFinancial Education Act and the enacted Excellence in Economic \nEducation Act. We must strive for better economic and financial \nliteracy, which, in turn, will result in stronger families, better-\nfunctioning markets, and a more secure future for our nation.\n  It is a critical time for citizens to be literate in economic issues. \nMore than ever, the need for leadership in the classroom is foremost \nand the involvement of students is paramount. Lance Suzuki and the \nIolani Economics Team are role models for our country and I am proud to \nextend my sincere congratulations and appreciation for their hard \nwork.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6727-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING JULIA DYER\n\n Mr. ALLEN.

Mr. President, on June 17, 2005, more \nthan a half-century baseball tradition continues in Omaha, NE. This is \nthe 56th year in a row that Omaha plays host to what is officially \nnamed the NCAA Men's College World Series. Of course, baseball fans \nnationwide know it by its unofficial name--``The Road to Omaha.''\n  The Men's College World Series features the best teams that college \nbaseball has to offer. Many of the players are the professional \nsuperstars of tomorrow. One has even gone on to become President of the \nUnited States.\n\n[[Page S6728]]\n\nAs a student at Yale University, President George H.W. Bush played in \nthe College World Series in Kalamazoo, MI, in 1948, 2 years before the \ngames found their permanent home in Omaha.\n  In 2001, President George W. Bush came to Omaha to throw out the \nfirst ball at Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium. The stadium, named in honor of \na former Omaha mayor and avid baseball fan, serves as the home ballpark \nfor the Omaha Royals, which is the Pacific Coast League AAA farm team \nof the Kansas City Royals.\n  Since the College World Series came to Omaha in 1950, there have been \n799 games played at Rosenblatt Stadium with 5,692,950 fans in \nattendance. The attendance shows remarkable growth from that first year \nwhen fewer than 18,000 fans showed up for the entire series. Today, the \naverage attendance for the entire 10-day event approaches 230,000 with \nan average per-session attendance of nearly 23,000.\n  Credit for this phenomenal success story goes to College World Series \nof Omaha, Inc., a nonprofit organization which has captured the \nimagination of the people of Omaha, its business leaders, city \nofficials and volunteers.\n  We are often asked by fans that follow their teams here and are \nattending their first College World Series, ``Why Omaha?'' The answer \nis easy. The entire city rolls out the red carpet for visiting teams \nand their supporters. Baseball fans, most from the Omaha area, fill the \nstadium for each game. They cheer all participating teams equally, \nmaking players, families and fans from other parts of the country feel \nwelcome. Even when hometown favorites, the Nebraska Cornhuskers or \nCreighton Bluejays make it to the series, fans continue to cheer for \nteams coming from other States.\n  Many Omaha supporters take time off from work during the 10-day \nevent, tailgating on the stadium grounds and attending games each day. \nThey will often wait in line all night to buy tickets which remain low \nin price despite sellouts and the fact that games are telecast \nnationwide on ESPN and ESPN2. A book of 50 general admission tickets \nsells for $50. Even box seats for the championship games sell for only \n$30.\n  The College World Series in Omaha has become as much of a tradition \nas baseball itself. Even the name, Omaha, has become synonymous with \nchampionship baseball. Instead of referring to it as the College World \nSeries or the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship, teams competing to \nplay here all refer to Regional and Super Regional tournaments as the \n``Road to Omaha.''\n  In the same year that baseball returned to Washington, DC, I am proud \nthat the College World Series returns to Omaha for its 56th consecutive \nyear with contractual assurances that it will remain here at least \nthrough 2010.\n  I'd like to extend a warm Nebraska invitation to all of my colleagues \nand baseball fans everywhere to come to Omaha from June 17 through 27 \nto enjoy college baseball's finest tradition. You are certain to enjoy \nyourselves, and like many of the players who earn the right to \nparticipate in the College World Series, you, too, will find yourself \npart of the ``Road to Omaha'' experience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6728-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6728-S6732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOL M. LINOWITZ\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, when Sol M. Linowitz died \nrecently, at the age of 91, this country lost a distinguished citizen \nand his family lost a loving, wise and generous husband, father, \nbrother and grandfather. Those who had the privilege of working with \nhim--and there are many of us--lost a colleague and wise counselor and, \nabove all, a dear friend.\n  It says much about Sol Linowitz that he opened his 1985 memoir, The \nMaking of a Public Man, with a citation from Justice Oliver Wendell \nHolmes, Jr.: ``It is required of a man that he should share the passion \nand action of his time at peril of being judged not to have lived.'' \nThat is precisely what Sol did over the course of what his brother, Bob \nLinowes, described--too modestly--as Sol's ``exemplary and productive \nlife.'' Indeed, it can be said of Sol Linowitz that almost from his \nbirth in 1913 until his death earlier this year, he reflected in his \nown life the highest ideals, aspirations and achievements of 20th-\ncentury America.\n  Sol Linowitz was the eldest of Joseph and Rose Linowitz's four sons. \nBoth his parents had come to this country as adolescents from what was \nthen the Russian empire. They met and married in this country, settling \nin Trenton, NJ, and raising their family there. Of his parents Sol has \nwritten simply but eloquently: they ``were not highly educated people; \nthey had come across the ocean . . . bringing their hopes and little \nmore . . . their life was a struggle.'' From his parents he received \nthe priceless gift of principles by which to live his own life: the \nfundamental importance of education; values taught by example, not \nrhetoric; people helping others in need. He grew up in a neighborhood \nof families similar to his own, except that they had come from Ireland, \nand Italy and in an earlier time and under different conditions, from \nAfrica. He could see that his parents ``most of all loved and trusted \nthis country.''\n  On the strength of advice from a high school teacher and a modest \nscholarship, Sol Linowitz went to Hamilton College, where he went on to \nbecome the Class of 1935 Salutatorian. Advice from a distinguished \nHamilton alumnus, Elihu Root, led him to law school; when he told Root \nthat he was thinking of becoming a rabbi or studying law, Root replied: \n``Become a lawyer. I have found that a lawyer needs twice as much \nreligion as a minister or rabbi.'' Once again, this time at Cornell Law \nSchool, he rose to the top of his class, finishing first and serving as \neditor-in-chief of the Cornell Law Quarterly. A number of his law-\nschool friends, like Senator Edmund Muskie and Secretary of State \nWilliam Rogers, went on to become eminent public servants and \npractitioners of the law. But Sol wrote with typical understatement in \nhis memoir that ``the most significant social contact'' of his years at \nCornell was Toni Zimmerman, a Cornell student. All who know Toni \nZimmerman Linowitz would certainly agree. Sol and Toni were married for \n65 years.\n  Sol chose to practice law in Rochester with the small family firm of \nSutherland and Sutherland. Following government and military service \nduring World War II, he and Toni returned to Rochester. Sol resumed his \nlaw practice. At the same time, he entered into the sustained \nengagement in community and national affairs that was to illuminate his \nentire life.\n  Sol Linowitz's commitment to public service extended far beyond his \ngovernment service, which began with his OAS ambassadorship, in 1969. \nHe found an extraordinary range of opportunities to serve. For many \nyears he was a trustee of Hamilton College and of Cornell University, \nwhich had both served him so well--and also of Johns Hopkins \nUniversity, in Baltimore, and the University of Rochester and the \nEastman School of Music, in Rochester. He was chairman of the Jewish \nTheological Seminary of America. He served as president of the National \nUrban League. He was a co-founder of the International Executive \nService Committee, in 1964, and the founder of the InterAmerican \nDialogue, in 1982. He was an advisor to three U.S. Presidents, and was \nPresident Carter's representative in the Israel-Egypt negotiations \nfollowing the Camp David Accord.\n  With Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker, Sol Linowitz led the U.S. team that \nnegotiated the Panama Canal Treaties. It has been reported that years \nlater Sol said of this daunting challenge, ``In retrospect, I'd have to \nsay that assignment was probably the most difficult and the most \nchallenging of my life. It is also the accomplishment of which I am \nmost proud.'' Sol had reason to take pride in his achievement. The \ntreaties were brilliantly drafted and negotiated. They put an end to a \ngrowing source of friction in U.S. relations not just with Panama but \nwith all of Latin America, and assured the continuing, smooth operation \nof the Canal.\n  It was in my capacity as a manager of the floor debate over the \nSenate's advice and consent to the treaties that I worked closely with \nSol Linowitz over many months and got to know him well. He was an \nextraordinarily skillful diplomat, an honorable and dedicated public \nservant. He was also a person of singular intelligence, integrity, and \nhuman compassion. It was my privilege to consider him a friend.\n  Sol opened his memoir with the quotation cited above from Justice \nOliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. In closing, he\n\n[[Page S6729]]\n\nturned to Archibald MacLeish. MacLeish, he noted, ``once said that \n'America is promises,' but these promises have not been kept equally to \nall. Those of us for whom the most extravagant promises of this land \nhave become a reality are, I think, required to seek appropriate \nexpressions of their gratitude.'' Sol Linowitz never ceased to find \nopportunities to express his gratitude. Again and again over the course \nof his long and productive life, he found innumerable ways to make our \nNation a better place for all its people.\n  At a memorial service at Adas Israel Congregation on March 29, 2005, \nSol Linowitz was remembered in a series of moving tributes from members \nof his family, friends and colleagues. Every tribute reminded us yet \nagain how deeply the loss of Sol Linowitz is felt. He was ``a man \ncomfortable with himself, and thus everyone was comfortable with him,'' \nsaid Jim Lehrer. ``He asked questions and then he listened to the \nanswers.'' Bernard Kalb observed, ``Sol Linowitz may have been the \npresident of Xerox but no one has yet succeeded in making a copy of \nSol.'' Mr. President, I ask that the service be printed in the Record.\n  The service follows.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Memorial Service\n\n\n                       rabbi jeffrey a. wohlberg\n\n       We begin with a poem:\n\n     To the living, death is a wound,\n     It's name is grief, it's companion loneliness.\n     But death belongs to life\n     As night belongs to day\n     As shadow belongs to substance\n     As the fallen leaf belongs to the tree,\n     So does death belong to life.\n\n       Death is normal and natural, it is part of reality--we know \n     that. And yet, when it comes, when it touches someone close \n     to us, when it takes someone, that is beloved we are somehow \n     not ready and unprepared no matter what we know, no matter \n     what we think we know and no matter what the age of the \n     person who is gone. This is the difference between intellect \n     and emotion.\n       So we gather to mourn and to eulogize and to share \n     memories, vignettes and strength as we come together for Sol \n     Linowitz. There is a void in your lives, an unfillable hole \n     for which we feel unprepared.\n       We have all lost someone precious, a man who was \n     extraordinary, quite unique and very special. Your loss is \n     shared by many of us outside the family, not merely because \n     we knew Sol or because he had done something for us, but \n     because of what he's done for all including many who never \n     knew him, and yet who are in his debt. Outside the family he \n     was known, admired and respected by world leaders, by people \n     of prominence, by people of stature. He was a quintessential \n     attorney, an accomplished businessman, an effective diplomat, \n     a trusted counsel to presidents and prime ministers, as well \n     as to rabbis and the public in general. He served as Chairman \n     of the Board of the Jewish Theological Seminary and that of \n     course brings him added distinction.\n       But beyond all his successes--as an attorney at Xerox, in \n     service to our government, on boards and boards at \n     universities--and other accomplishments, it all comes down to \n     family. Our condolences are extended to brothers David, \n     Robert, and Harry, who remember parents Joseph and Rose, \n     growing up in Trenton, New Jersey, Hamilton College and \n     Cornell University and so much more that they shared over \n     these many years. Our condolences are extended to Toni, his \n     wife of 68 years. Theirs was a love affair which began when \n     she was in college and he was in law school. She remembers \n     wearing a green dress and that she signed up for archery so \n     that she could meet him on the path when he came out of law \n     school and would see her. Our condolences are extended to \n     daughters, to Anne, June, Jan, and Roni as well as their \n     spouses who have always been close and supportive as well as \n     supported by his love. And of course to eight grandchildren, \n     Judy, David, another David, Michael, Steven, Danny, Jessie \n     and Sandy, who were the dividends of his life. He shared \n     their trials, challenges and successes. The family was of \n     critical importance to him no matter what was going on. You \n     said that after dealing with family he was ready to deal with \n     anything and it made him a great negotiator. And so there is \n     a great deal of pride, pleasure and strength that you shared \n     as you gave each other mutual support.\n       Long after the violin is set aside the music plays on. And \n     so it is with a human life. Sol (who played the violin) is \n     gone, but the music of his life will remain with us forever.\n\n     Servant of God well done;\n     Rest thy loved employ\n     The battle fought, the victory won\n     Enter the martyrs' joy.\n     The pain of death is past,\n     Labor and sorrow cease,\n     Life's long warfare closed at last,\n     May thy soul now rest in peace.\n                                  ____\n\n       May the memory and name of Sol Linowitz bring comfort to \n     all who hold it dear.\n\n\n                             june linowitz\n\n       Hello and we1come. On behalf of my family I want to thank \n     everyone for being here. It means a lot to us.\n       My name is June Linowitz and it is my honor to speak on \n     behalf of my sisters--Anne, Jan and Ronni. What I'm going to \n     say is the result of the conversations with my sisters. I \n     assume that other speakers this afternoon will discuss my dad \n     as diplomat, humanitarian, businessman and sage. I just want \n     to talk about Sol Linowitz--our dad. Implied in this \n     discussion is, of course, our mother Toni Linowitz. My \n     parents were married for 65 years and had a remarkable \n     marriage. My parents respected each other, supported each \n     other, encouraged each other, adored each other and truly \n     shared their lives. As far as we kids were concerned they \n     presented a united front. So often when I talk about my dad, \n     I'm talking about my mom too.\n       I can't talk about Dad without mentioning his sense of \n     humor. A lot of you know he had a story for every occasion \n     but what we kids remember is was how funny he could be. My \n     dad loved to laugh and to make other people laugh. He felt \n     that one of the best ways to relate to a person was through \n     laughter and he was very good at making that happen.\n       My sisters and I remember a routine from when we were \n     little and he'd put us to bed. He'd tuck us in, say \n     ``goodnight'' turn off the light and--walk into the closet. \n     He'd come out of the closet saying ``oh, oh, sorry'' and bump \n     into a wall. Flustered he'd walk into another wall. Then he'd \n     say ``ok now, enough. I'm leaving now'' and (walk down \n     imaginary stairs). We'd howl with laughter! My dad was our \n     favorite playmate! And a routine like that was \n     psychologically pretty savvy for small kids because we knew \n     no monsters were hiding anywhere. He'd been everywhere trying \n     to get out of the room!\n       My dad was a great amateur psychologist. For example--My \n     sister Jan used to be painfully shy. My dad would talk with \n     her saying ``A woman visited me in the office today. She's \n     concerned about her son Johnnie because he's afraid of \n     meeting people. She doesn't know what to do. What do you \n     think I should tell her?'' Jan would confer with dad and come \n     up with a way to tackle Johnnie's shyness and of course her \n     own. It was a very effective tactic.\n       My dad the amateur psychologist even devised behavioral \n     charts. With Jan he devised a chart where she would get a \n     star each day she shook somebody's hand and if she did that \n     for 2 weeks she'd get a treat.\n       No big surprise! My sister Jan has grown up to be a \n     psychologist!\n       My parents wanted us to know the value of money. We got \n     what we needed but not necessarily what we wanted. We were \n     given allowances (small ones, I might note) that were \n     defendant on our performing certain chores. Unfortunately my \n     parents would also dock us if we didn't do certain things or \n     if we misbehaved and I was the kind of kid who at the end of \n     the week often ended up with nothing. At holidays, or our \n     birthdays, our gifts weren't extravagant. We got socks and \n     underwear wrapped as presents for Chanukah. We got other \n     gifts too but at least some of our presents were things we \n     needed and should have been grateful to receive. Because my \n     dad didn't want us to take things for granted. He wanted us \n     to know how fortunate we were. We had food on the table and \n     clothes on our backs and a place to sleep and he knew and \n     wanted us to know that most of the children in the world \n     weren't as fortunate.\n       We talked about current events at the dinner table. My dad \n     made it a priority to be with us at dinner time. He was a \n     busy man but he had time for his family. We'd talk about the \n     events of the day, not just what happened with us kids at \n     school, but what dad had experienced and what had happened in \n     the world. And my dad would be interested in our opinions. \n     He'd question our views and so taught us how to think.\n       He wanted us to think for ourselves and be independent. And \n     of course he paid for that. When we got older, and we \n     realized what a big shadow he cast, we fiercely stated our \n     independence. When we started looking for jobs--we wouldn't \n     use his contacts. When we had problems--we wouldn't take his \n     advice. We didn't really want to be seen with him. We wanted \n     to be successful and respected on our own terms and to my \n     dad's credit, he respected us for that. We made him kind of \n     crazy, but he was proud of us.\n       And as we've made our way in the world, Anne is a social \n     worker, Jan is a psychologist, and Ronni and I are artists, \n     he became our biggest fan. He was our good friend and wise \n     counsel. No matter what was going on in his life, no matter \n     how busy he might be, our dad was always available if we \n     needed him. He would listen to us and we listened to him too.\n       We would discuss our careers, our marriages, our families \n     and our lives. We would talk about the nature of death and \n     the purpose of life. We would discuss the state of the world \n     and the current conflicts. And, as many of you know, my dad's \n     outlook would always be hopeful. He would acknowledge the \n     difficulty of the situation but he'd believe in man's \n     capacity to prevail. He looked for the best in people and so \n     he would bring out the best in people. He was both a realist \n     and an optimist. He was quite simply an exceptional human \n     being.\n       My dad used to say that he felt closer to his own parents \n     after they died. My sisters\n\n[[Page S6730]]\n\n     and I are hoping and praying that we'll find that true too. \n     Because we miss our dad a lot.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                         ronni linowitz jolles\n\n       I am honored to be here today, as one of Sol Linowitz's \n     daughters, to speak about our father. My sister June spoke so \n     well about the wonderful father he was to the four of us. I \n     think you know of some of his tremendous accomplishments that \n     truly made the world a better place. I want to share with you \n     a conversation that I had with him that will give you a \n     different perspective about the kind of person he was.\n       I called him one Sunday morning--about 15 years ago, \n     although I remember it clearly--and asked him if I could come \n     talk to him about something that was bothering me. Without \n     hesitation, he instantly said, ``Yes, of course. Your mother \n     and I will be here all afternoon so come on over.'' He had a \n     certain excitement in his voice; he loved to talk about \n     things that were deep, or meaningful, and he loved to help \n     you to work through a problem and find solutions.\n       I came over that afternoon and went up to the den. I talked \n     to both mom and dad for a while, and then my dad and I went \n     to talk. When I came into the study, I could see that my dad \n     had set things up for our talk; he had cleared off his desk, \n     except for a big yellow legal pad and a pen. He was prepared \n     to do what he did better than anyone I have ever known; to \n     listen. And I was lucky enough to be listened to by the \n     wisest person I will ever know in my life.\n       So, I began to talk: I went over the most important things \n     in my life, because I knew that those things all would have \n     an impact on what was bothering me; I talked about my \n     marriage, my kids, my job, my synagogue, my close friends. I \n     talked about the balance I was seeking to find as I lived my \n     life.\n       Then I got to the issue at hand: ``Dad, `` I said, ``. . . \n     I've been really struggling with this: I hope you don't think \n     this is silly, but . . . I don't think I'm making a \n     difference in the world. I just don't feel like I'm doing \n     enough.\n       If I weren't here tomorrow, have I left a mark?\n       Have I made the world a better place?\n       I don't think I'm doing as much as I can to make a \n     difference.\n       He looked at me and started with what I knew he would say \n     first. ``Being a mother is one of the most important jobs \n     you'll ever have. . . . your teaching is such a gift.'' We \n     went back and forth about a few things, but it just wasn't \n     feeling right.\n       ``You know, Dad, this may just be due to having someone as \n     amazing as you as a father. I mean our dinner conversations \n     were a little unusual . . . I grew up hearing about world \n     peace, solving world hunger, starting new companies, building \n     new organizations!\n       ``Maybe I just have to come to terms with the fact that I'm \n     not you, and I am not going to be able to be do the kinds of \n     things that you did and are still doing. Maybe you can just \n     help me reach a peace about it so it won't bother me \n     anymore.''\n       He just looked at me for a few minutes, and finally said, \n     ``OK. I want to talk to you about, something. I know exactly \n     what you're feeling.''\n       He went on--``You know, you think I'm such an important \n     person. I know that you think I'm doing all of these \n     important things, and sometimes maybe I am, but I also wonder \n     if I'm making a difference.''\n       He went on, ``The truth is; I don't know if what I'm doing \n     is making a difference. I hope I'm making a difference, and \n     some days, after something very positive has happened, I do \n     feel like I'm really making a difference.\n       But I honestly don't know if the treaties I'm helping to \n     implement will be here in 50, or 100 years.\n       I don't know if the peace that I've worked towards will \n     last.\n       I don't know if the organizations that I'm working with \n     will still be here years from now.\n       No one can know that. So I also worry if I'm really doing \n     enough in this world.\n       Then he stopped and just looked at me and said, ``So I'm \n     going to tell you about something that I do that has helped \n     me. ``Every day I try to do things. Sometimes I'm not able to \n     do it, but I always try. 2 things.''\n       I may know of someone who is ill, so I'll send some flowers \n     and write a note.\n       Or I may know someone who has just lost a loved one, so \n     I'll write something meaningful and look for a quote that I \n     may have that may bring them some comfort.\n       It could be that I just went to a concert, saw a play, or \n     an art exhibit and I was touched by it and I wanted to write \n     something and say thank you.\n       As he was talking, I drifted off and thought about all of \n     the notes I had received from my dad over the years--the \n     notes telling me how great he thought I was in that play or \n     how much he enjoyed having me at that Passover seder or how \n     he always sent me flowers on my birthday with the most loving \n     of cards. I wonder how many of you have received a note or \n     two from my father.\n       He then continued, ``I try to do two things like that every \n     day--2 things that are reaching out to someone who I can \n     either appreciate or help or comfort or just say I love you \n     to. Those things I try to do every day give me a feeling that \n     I'm making a difference in the world and I find them very \n     fulfilling--perhaps more fulfilling than any of the other \n     things that I'm doing on a much grander scale.\n       Today, as I look at the people who are here--some of you \n     may be here because you respect my father and admire his many \n     public accomplishments--but I'll bet that most of you are \n     here because you loved him. Maybe he touched you in a very \n     personal and meaningful way that made you so appreciate him. \n     Maybe you were a part of his ``2 things.''\n       That is what I think made our Dad, Sol Linowitz, the truly \n     amazing man that he was.\n       And as we all think about his life and as we try to think \n     about ways we can remember him, it may be that some of us \n     might try to do 2 things every day--2 things for people we \n     know in your own lives that might make them feel comforted or \n     loved or appreciated, and we can think about Sol Linowitz \n     every time we do that. And truly, I can't think of anything \n     that would make him happier than knowing that the people he \n     touched throughout his life are remembering him by doing kind \n     things for others.\n       We have all been blessed by knowing Sol Linowitz.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             william brody\n\n       Some years back. John Updike wrote a short poem, titled \n     ``Perfection Wasted.'' which begins with these words:\n\n     And another regrettable thing about death\n     is the ceasing of your own brand of magic,\n     which took a whole life to develop and market--\n\n       Ambassador Linowitz's life was so long, and so varied, and \n     so full of marvelous adventures, that his own brand of magic \n     was, as a result, inexpressibly unique.\n       Of course, there were many stories. Who could live through \n     such times, and frequently be at the center of things, and \n     not have stories to tell?\n       One time in the 1960s, when he was ambassador to the \n     Organization of American States, he went on a particularly \n     grueling trip through Central and South America accompanied \n     by Lincoln Gordon, who had served as ambassador to Brazil and \n     was assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, \n     and was not far off from becoming the ninth president of \n     Johns Hopkins University. They were making arrangements for a \n     summit meeting that President Lyndon Johnson was planning to \n     attend, so the hours were very long, the work was hard, and \n     it involved traveling to many different countries in a very \n     short period of time.\n       When they finally arrived back in the United States, they \n     landed in San Antonio late in the evening, and were scheduled \n     to report to President Johnson at his ranch the next morning. \n     But at 11:30 at night the phone rang, and it was the \n     President, who said, `I want you out here tonight.' So Sol \n     got out of bed, woke up Lincoln Gordon, and they got on a \n     helicopter and flew out to the LBJ ranch in the middle of the \n     night.\n       When they landed there was a station wagon waiting for them \n     with a driver in the front seat. The helicopter people loaded \n     the bags in the back of the station wagon, and then Sol and \n     Lincoln Gordon climbed into the back seat. And the driver of \n     the station wagon said, `Welcome back home, Sol' and turned \n     around and it was the President of the United States. With \n     not a secret service agent anywhere in sight.\n       When Sol told that story, he said, you know, `I've worked \n     with several presidents. and there aren't many who would \n     drive out in the middle of the night and pick someone up.'\n       Which is a story that says more, perhaps, about Sol \n     Linowitz, than about Lyndon Johnson.\n       When someone of Ambassador Linowitz's stature and renown \n     dies, the articles in the New York Times and the Washington \n     Post have a favorite epithet they like to use: he or she was \n     `an advisor to presidents.' This signifies that these people \n     were not only powerful, but also sagacious. That they had \n     wisdom to share.\n       This was doubly true of Sol Linowitz, who shared his \n     insights not only with United States presidents, but also, \n     for many, many years with the presidents of a select and \n     lucky few colleges and universities. I count myself as \n     extremely fortunate to have been among that group, as were \n     presidents Dan Nathans, Bill Richardson and Steven Muller \n     before me at Johns Hopkins, and the presidents at Cornell \n     University, Hamilton College, the University or Rochester and \n     the Eastman School of Music, where he also serve as a trustee \n     and advisor.\n       We were fortunate in one respect because of Sol's often \n     shrewd analysis and penetrating insights. When Bill Clinton \n     awarded Ambassador Linowitz the Presidential Medal of Freedom \n     in 1998, he said ``Receiving advice from Sol Linowitz . . . \n     is like getting trumpet lessons from the angel Gabriel.'' And \n     he was right.\n       Sol was the quintessential Renaissance man: distinguished \n     lawyer, businessman and statesman, part-Rabbi, part-\n     psychiatrist. Sol was an accomplished violinist. But above \n     all, he was a true scholar. His passion for learning enhanced \n     the depth of his wisdom, compassion and insight into people's \n     behavior. And to this day, I have never met anyone other than \n     Sol who had given a college salutarian address at \n     commencement in Latin.\n       Sol Linowitz truly admired and valued higher education. He \n     was a champion of America's colleges and universities. He \n     believed that what we do is not only important, but it also \n     serves a higher cause. Later\n\n[[Page S6731]]\n\n     in his life he would say that when he enrolled in Cornell Law \n     School during the Great Depression, he went there ``burning \n     with a desire to do good.'' Colleges and universities, he \n     believed, could be instruments of social justice. They could \n     be bastions not only of learning, but also of the will to do \n     that which is needful and right.\n       Many years back, long before the cost and expense of a \n     college education had become a national obsession, Sol wrote \n     an article titled `A Liberal Arts College is Not a Railroad' \n     in which he very eloquently defended the utility and need for \n     a liberal education, even as it became more and more costly. \n     At one point in the article he wrote the following: `A \n     college may offer a course in Persian history, for example, \n     which only five students will attend during a particular \n     term. Should we abolish the course? Or should we hope that \n     the few students who do learn something of Persian history \n     will thereby become uniquely qualified to perform some \n     important service for which this particular aspect of their \n     education has especially fitted them?'\n       There he was; years and years ago, saying that it may not \n     appear needful, but that someday we may want to have some \n     people around who knew the history and culture of Persia--\n     modern day Iran. How prescient that was. How thoughtful. And \n     how like Sol Linowitz.\n       Which is why today, though we have come to celebrate a life \n     lived greatly, yet we cannot help but feel saddened that one \n     like this has passed from our midst. Sol's brand of magic \n     cannot be replaced. And John Updike, ending his poem, says it \n     all:\n\n     The jokes over the phone.\n     The memories packed in the rapid-access file.\n     The whole act.\n     Who will do it again? That's it: no one; imitators and \n           descendants aren't the same.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              martin mayer\n\n       I am grateful to Robert Linowes for this opportunity to \n     give public thanks for forty years of friendship with his \n     brother Sol.\n       When I met Sol he was the non-executive chairman of the \n     board of Xerox and the senior partner in a Rochester law firm \n     built significantly but by no means entirely on work for \n     Xerox. Bobby Kennedy and James Perkins, president of Cornell, \n     had suggested to The New York Times that Sol would be a good \n     candidate for the Democrats to run against Nelson Rockefeller \n     for Governor of New York in 1966, and Sol had not yet \n     declined the invitation. So the Times asked me to write a \n     profile of this unknown fellow in Rochester who had so \n     brilliantly used the patent laws and the anti-trust laws to \n     give his friend Joe Wilson's little company so large a lead \n     worldwide in the burgeoning business of copying. But Sol did \n     not define himself as a businessman. He was first of all an \n     attorney, and as such, like Brandeis, he was always a \n     professional who had clients, never just somebody's lawyer.\n       Joe Wilson wanted Sol at his side as Lyndon Johnson and \n     Jimmy Carter, various secretaries of state and the clients of \n     Coudert wanted him in later years, because his judgment was \n     always intelligent, widely focused, uncontaminated by self-\n     interest, and responsive to the problem. And generous. Sol \n     was a great man, but also--it is not a common combination--a \n     good guy. He was always looking for nice things to say about \n     someone, and even when he couldn't find any--which happened--\n     he remained reluctant to speak ill of anyone.\n       I worked with him on his memoirs and again only a dozen \n     years ago on his book The Betrayed Profession, his cry of \n     anguish at the dessication and corruption of lawyering. I \n     told him I would help on this book only on his promise that \n     when the book was published there would be people at the 1925 \n     F Street Club who would no longer smile at him when he walked \n     through the door. Instead, they had to tear down the F Street \n     Club.\n       Especially when dealing with questions of urban blight, \n     social justice, hunger and the obligations of successful \n     businesses, which he did from leadership positions, Sol could \n     slip into the trite and true, but he had a gift of expression \n     and an occasionally puckish irreverence. My favorite Linowitz \n     line was his last laugh at Arthur D. Little, which had saved \n     Xerox from the bear-hug of IBM by telling IBM that there \n     wasn't going to be any mass demand for copying machines. In \n     the Xerox case, Sol said, ``invention was the mother of \n     necessity.''\n       Having pulled off the near miracle of negotiating the \n     Panama Canal Treaty and selling it to the Senate, Sol was \n     lured by Jimmy Carter after the first Camp David accord to \n     take charge of closing the deal with Anwar Sadat and Menachim \n     Begin. He hung on his wall at the State Department Casey \n     Stengel's comment on the Mets, ``They say you can't do it, \n     but sometimes that doesn't always work.'' Arafat, as people \n     forget, was not then in the picture. In late 1980--and, \n     indeed, the last time we talked about it, only a couple of \n     years ago--Sol thought he was close to a deal that Begin and \n     Sadat could sign, including his invention of a ``religious \n     sovereignty'' that would allow Muslims to place a Muslim \n     flag, not a national flag, over the Muslim holy places on \n     Israeli soil (``What does `religious sovereignty' mean?'' \n     Begin asked, and Sol replied, ``Exactly'')--but Ronald Reagan \n     and Alexander Haig thought it best to let the Middle East \n     stew in its own bloody juice; and Sol, still a young man at \n     67, went back to the practice of law and the chairing of \n     civic organizations.\n       One thought he would always be around, to call and ask how \n     a book was coming or to tell me what great things he'd heard \n     my wife was doing as the American executive director of the \n     IMF, to which she had been appointed in part because he had \n     lobbied Lloyd Bentsen on her behalf. ``You know,'' he'd say, \n     ``people talk to me.'' And so they did: this city is full of \n     people whose balance was restored by talking with Sol. His \n     lesson was that straightforwardness can get you there. Of \n     course nobody is always around, and Sol wouldn't have wanted \n     to be forever. Not fair; you have to get out of the way and \n     make room for the next crowd. But there won't be a Sol \n     Linowitz in the next crowd; there was only one of those.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           R. Robert Linowes\n\n       We are here today to say good-bye and pay tribute to a \n     great human being--Sol Myron Linowitz.\n       As most of you know, Sol was my brother. He was also my \n     closest friend and confidant. I admired Sol for many reasons. \n     He lived an exemplary and productive life. Much has \n     justifiably been said and written about his remarkable, \n     history-making achievements.\n       I'd like to just take a few minutes to talk about him--as a \n     person, as a brother, and as a man.\n       Sol sincerely cared about people and wanted to do whatever \n     he could to help. His compassion, his thoughtfulness and his \n     humility will be well-remembered by many. His advice and \n     counsel were constantly sought by people from all walks of \n     life, and he gave freely of his time and efforts. He listened \n     when people spoke to him, and he paid attention. He tried to \n     help everyone who called upon him, and if he couldn't do it \n     himself, he tried to enlist others who might be of help. I \n     know--I received a number of those calls to be of assistance.\n       He had an unparalleled sense of humor, and his story-\n     telling and quips were memorable. He was much sought after as \n     a speaker.\n       Many of you are aware that our family is very close. We are \n     each available and responsive when any one of us needs help \n     or guidance--and that includes not only the brothers, Sol, \n     Dave and Harry, and our wives, Toni, Dorothy, Ada, and Judy, \n     but also all the sons and daughters, and nieces and nephews--\n     quite a tribe, I might add. Sol was particularly nurturing of \n     this relationship and continually showed it.\n       Sol and I, however, had a special relationship. We would \n     meet once or twice each week for lunch at the Hay Adams or \n     the Cosmos Club, and solve all the problems of the city, the \n     Nation, and the world. Unfortunately, those solutions rarely \n     got any farther than our table.\n       For more than 40 years, Toni and Sol, and Ada and I would \n     vacation together, generally twice a year.\n       I remember every so often when things got a little boring, \n     we would be. sitting at a table or in a room with a number of \n     people around, none of whom obviously knew us, and Sol and I \n     would start talking to each other loudly in a made-up \n     language. We would talk with great animation and conviction \n     for about 15-20 minutes. You could see people looking at us \n     oddly, trying to understand who we were and what we were \n     saying. Meanwhile, our wives were trying to distance \n     themselves from us as much as possible.\n       When we travelled together, it was our regular practice to \n     exercise in the morning. I remember once on a cruise, Sol was \n     taking his exercise walk around the deck, while I was in the \n     fitness center on the treadmill. Later over breakfast, Sol \n     told me he looked in the window of the fitness center and was \n     amazed that there were six men all walking at the same \n     intensely vigorous pace as I. He marveled even more that they \n     all had the same shiny bald spot on the backs of their heads. \n     I told him that was impossible--there was nobody else in \n     there. He was adamant and demanded that we go up to the \n     fitness center to see. We made our usual bet of $100,000. As \n     it turned out, Sol had observed me reflected six times in the \n     fitness center mirrors. He used some convoluted logic to \n     avoid paying the debt.\n       We used to kid and get kidded often about the change of \n     names. I claimed he changed his name and he would point to me \n     and respond--How could anyone blame him with a brother like \n     me. I recall a dinner at which I was being honored by The \n     National Conference of Christians and Jews. Sol had been \n     similarly honored some years previously, and he was asked to \n     make the presentation. He noted in his introduction that he \n     was not sure whether or not this was the first time two \n     brothers had received this honor, but he was certain that it \n     was the first time that two brothers with different last \n     names had received this award.\n       Sol and I would talk on the phone frequently. It was one of \n     the highlights of the day. We would often call to tell each \n     other a story, or just talk, and often we would break out in \n     uncontrollable laughter, and not be able to continue the \n     conversation. People who would walk by my office thought I \n     needed an ambulance--or a strait jacket.\n       Let me just mention one other part of Sol's life that is \n     not generally known. We do know that Sol played the violin \n     and played it well, but what many of you do not know is that \n     during summer vacations when he was attending Hamilton \n     College, Sol organized, led, and played in a band in one of \n     the small hotels located at a New Jersey beach.\n\n[[Page S6732]]\n\n     The name of that outstanding entertainment enterprise was \n     Chick Lynn and his Chickadees. Sol never included that in his \n     bio.\n       Sol and Toni were married 67 years and it remained a love \n     story from start to finish. Toni committed and dedicated \n     herself completely to him, and Sol to her. Toni rarely left \n     his side the last year of his life while he was in failing \n     health.\n       Sol loved his four daughters and their husbands. He \n     regarded them not as sons-in-law, but rather as sons. His \n     grandchildren were the light of his life. He suffered \n     terribly at the tragedy endured by Judy.\n       Many people strive to leave this world a better place than \n     when they entered it. Sol was one of the few who actually \n     did. For this, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.\n       All of us have been most fortunate to have had the \n     opportunity to know Sol and to love him. All of us have \n     benefited from that relationship. All of us will sorely miss \n     him. The world has lost a great man, and I have lost my best \n     friend.\n                                  ____\n\n       Closing Prayer\n       Rabbi Wohlberg and Hazzan Tenna Greenberg\n     Exalted, compassionate God,\n     Grant infinite rest, in your sheltering Presence,\n     Among the holy and the pure,\n     To the soul of Sol Linowitz\n     Who has gone to his eternal home.\n     Merciful One, we ask that our loved one find perfect peace in \n           Your eternal embrace.\n     May his soul be bound up in the bond of life.\n     May he rest in peace.\n     And let us say: Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6732-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  AIDS\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I discuss the recent announcement by \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the number of \nAmericans living with HIV has now surpassed 1 million. An estimated \n1.039 million to 1.185 million people nationwide were HIV-positive as \nof December 2003, an increase over the estimated 850,000 to 950,000 \ncases at the end of 2002. While the number of persons with HIV in my \nstate of Oregon is small relative to other states, Oregon still saw an \n85 percent increase in the number of cases between 2002 and 2003. Not \nsince the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s has there been so \nmany Americans living with this terrible disease.\n  The latest estimate reveals both our success and failure at combating \nthis disease. On a positive note, the increase reflects the significant \nadvances in antiretroviral drug therapy that have allowed persons \ndiagnosed with HIV to live longer, healthier lives. On the other hand \nit also reflects our shortcomings in preventing the spread of this \ndisease. Despite the Federal government's goal to cut in half the \nnumber of new HIV cases each year, the figure continues to hold steady \nat about 40,000--the same rate of infection as in the 1990s. Moreover, \nsome researchers believe that the number of new infections may actually \nbe as high as 60,000 a year.\n  To be fair, responsibility for reducing the spread of HIV does not \nrest solely with the Federal government. According to the CDC, those at \nhighest risk of contracting HIV have become far too complacent in their \nbehavior, particularly as it relates to the practice of safe sex. \nNevertheless, there is much the Federal government can do to help stem \nthe spread of HIV.\n  One way to reduce the number of new HIV cases is to ensure that those \ninfected with HIV have access to treatment. Such treatments not only \nprevent individuals from developing full-blown AIDS, but also \nsignificantly lower the risk of transmitting the disease to others. \nUnfortunately, the cost of these treatments is prohibitive, especially \nfor those who are uninsured or underinsured. For this reason, it is \ncritical that Congress reauthorize and bolster the Ryan White Care Act \nthis year. Among other things, the act includes the vitally important \nAIDS Drug Assistance Program, ADAP, which helps low-income and \nuninsured HIV/AIDS patients afford their costly drug treatments. An \nestimated 150,000 people--30 percent of all Americans receiving \ntreatment for HIV currently receive their care through ADAP. Even with \nthis program, however, States and local communities are overwhelmed. \nThat is why I am requesting that Congress provide an additional $300 \nmillion for ADAP for the 2006 fiscal year.\n  As successful as ADAP has been, critical gaps in our approach to HIV \ntreatment and prevention remain. For example, HIV positive individuals \nhave access to treatment under Medicaid only after they have developed \nfull-blown AIDS. To remedy this flaw, I introduced the Early Treatment \nfor HIV Act, ETHA, S. 311, with Senator Hillary Clinton. By providing \naccess to HIV therapies before such persons develop AIDS, ETHA would \nreduce overall Medicaid costs and, as important, reduce the likelihood \nof additional infection.\n  By reducing the amount of virus in the bloodstream, early access to \nHIV therapies is a key factor in helping curb infectiousness and \nreducing HIV transmission. Strengthening ADAP and enacting ETHA will \nhelp put us on the right track to providing both adequate treatment for \nthose with HIV, as well as reducing the number of new HIV \ncases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6732-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6732-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6732-4", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 12:22 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 643.

Murphy, America's most decorated war \n     hero; compared to Audie L. Murphy, Lieutenant Conner was \n     awarded more Silver Stars for acts of valor, fought in more \n     campaigns, served on the front lines for a longer period of \n     time, and was wounded more times. Lieutenant Conner was \n     awarded many honors, including the Distinguished Service \n     Cross, the Silver Star with three Oak Leaf Clusters, the \n     Bronze Star, the Purple Heart with six Oak Leaf Clusters, and \n     other medals; and\n       Whereas, on June 20, 1945, Lieutenant Conner was awarded \n     the Croix de Guerre, the French Medal of Honor, which was \n     also awarded to Sergeant Alvin C. York, America's most \n     decorated World War I soldier. Lieutenant Conner and Sergeant \n     York were friends who lived only a few miles apart on the \n     Kentucky-Tennessee border; and\n       Whereas, Stephen Ambrose, America's foremost World War II \n     historian, founder of the D-Day Museum in New Orleans, \n     Louisiana, and author of many books, wrote on November 11, \n     2000, ``I am in complete support of the effort to make \n     Lieutenant Garlin M. Conner a Medal of Honor recipient. What \n     he did in stopping the German assault near Houssen, France, \n     in January, 1945, was far above the call of duty. I've met \n     and talked at length with many Medal of Honor recipients and \n     am sure they would all agree that Lieutenant Conner more than \n     deserves the honor of joining them''; and\n       Whereas, on April 3, 2001, the 3rd Infantry Division \n     leaders named the new EAGLE BASE in Bosnia-Herzegovina after \n     Lieutenant Conner because of his gallantry in World War II \n     and because ``It's a company-grade forward operating base \n     named after a soldier with a company-grade rank''; and\n       Whereas, Richard Chilton, a former Green Beret from Genoa \n     City, Wisconsin, has been on a mission since 1996 to have the \n     Medal of Honor awarded to Lieutenant Conner; his research has \n     documented that Lieutenant Conner is one of the great combat \n     heroes of World War II, equal in every way to Audie Murphy; \n     and\n       Whereas, Mr. Chilton has made presentations to dozens of \n     schools about Lieutenant Conner's war record and has copies \n     of over 2,500 letters written by students to President George \n     W. Bush requesting the Medal of Honor be awarded to \n     Lieutenant Conner; after reviewing Mr. Chilton's information, \n     a host of war veterans have written Congress requesting \n     passage of legislation to award the Medal of Honor to one of \n     America's greatest Citizen Soldiers, Lieutenant Garlin Murl \n     Conner: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the One Hundred \n     Fourth General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the Senate \n     Concurring, That this Body urges the United States Congress \n     to enact legislation authorizing the President to \n     posthumously award a Medal of Honor to First Lieutenant \n     Garlin Murl Conner, United States Army, be it further\n       Resolved, That enrolled copies of this resolution be \n     delivered to: Congressman Duncan Hunter, Chairman of the \n     House Armed Services Committee; the Speaker and the Clerk of \n     the House of Representatives of the United States; the \n     President and the Secretary of the Senate of the United \n     States; each member of the Tennessee Congressional \n     Delegation; and the widow of First Lieutenant Garlin Murl \n     Conner, Mrs. Pauline W.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to the Lemoore Military \n     Operations Area (MOA) Initiative; to the Committee on Armed \n     Services.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 1\n\n       Whereas, The United States Navy at Naval Air Station (NAS) \n     Lemoore in joint partnership with the California Air National \n     Guard (CANG) 144th Fighter Wing, Fresno, have proposed the \n     establishment of a new Military Operations Area. (MOA) over \n     NAS Lemoore to satisfy many critical national defense \n     training requirements, the Lemoore MOA Initiative; and\n       Whereas, The current price of military aircraft training in \n     the existing training environment is substantial. The cost \n     per flight hour of military aircraft is high. The current \n     need to travel long distances to secure needed training \n     requires large amounts of fuel and time to transit to and \n     from the training location. Current training locations are \n     increasingly crowded with other joint users of the training \n     airspaces, which interferes with the quality of training and \n     the safety of these training events. The current need of our \n     military personnel to travel within the United States to \n     secure needed training unavailable in the current training \n     environment increases their time away from home, in a time \n     where they are already overtaxed with overseas commitments; \n     and\n       Whereas, The benefits of training in the new Lemoore MOA \n     would be substantial because pilots would train closer to \n     home base and reduce the costs of longer transits to existing \n     training locations. The establishment of an additional, new \n     training airspace location would relieve the pressure on the \n     existing training locations increasing their training quality \n     and safety. Our military personnel would have reduced \n     requirements to travel away from home to secure needed \n     training. It is estimated that up to 30 million taxpayer \n     dollars annually could be saved or better utilized in \n     training for national defense requirements. The increase in \n     military service member morale resulting from fewer training \n     deployments from home would also be significant; and\n       Whereas, The existing NAS Lemoore Air Traffic Control (ATC) \n     airspace already exists and is approximately 30 nautical \n     miles by 70 nautical miles to support current NAS Lemoore \n     airport operations. The Lemoore MOA Initiative would allow \n     tactical training flights inside this existing airspace. No \n     supersonic, weapons employment, or aggressive maneuvering \n     flights over populated areas will be allowed in the new \n     airspace; and\n       Whereas, It is estimated that the high altitudes of the \n     desired training flights and the sparsely populated rural \n     environment of the land below the Lemoore MOA will have \n     minimal environmental impact. To ensure this, the Navy in \n     cooperation with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is \n     completing an Environmental Assessment (EA). The Lemoore MOA \n     would not increase air emissions for the State Implementation \n     Plan. Military training flights over the Sierra Nevada \n     Mountains, including wilderness areas and the Sequoia and \n     Kings Canyon National Parks, could be reduced if some of \n     these flights were redirected to the Lemoore MOA; and\n       Whereas, The impact of the Lemoore MOA Initiative on the \n     current civilian air traffic environment is considered \n     minimal. The Navy in conjunction with the FAA is completing \n     an operational analysis on both military and civilian air \n     traffic patterns within the vicinity of NAS Lemoore. The \n     footprint of the Lemoore MOA does not impact most air traffic \n     flows; and,\n       Whereas, Both the Navy and FAA are conducting outreach \n     programs to the civilian aviation community to explain that \n     the Lemoore MOA Initiative will allow for simultaneous \n     military and civilian use of designated training airspace. \n     These outreach programs are also informing civilian pilots \n     that the Lemoore MOA will be managed in real time in an \n     effort to prevent a conflict between military and civilian \n     aircraft: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California urges the President and the Congress of the United \n     States to support the establishment of the Lemoore Military \n     Operations Area, for joint use by military aircraft from both \n     the Naval Air Station Lemoore and the California Air National \n     Guard, Fresno; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the California Legislature requests that the \n     Federal Aviation Administration approve the creation of the \n     Lemoore MOA as quickly as possible and that the California \n     Congressional delegation pursue all efforts to ensure that \n     the Lemoore MOA is established; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary, of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States, the \n     Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, the \n     Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Navy, the \n     Secretary of the Air Force, and both author for appropriate \n     distribution.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-93. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Hawaii \n     relative to Federal Community Block Grant Funding for fiscal \n     year 2006; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs.\n\n                            House Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the federal Community Development Block Grant \n     Program (Program) was initiated with the passage of the \n     Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Public Law 93-\n     383, and is one of the oldest programs in the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development (HUD); and\n       Whereas, the Program provides annual grants on a formula \n     basis to many different types of grantees through several \n     programs such as:\n       (1) Entitlement Communities, which provides annual grants \n     on a formula basis to entitled cities and counties to develop \n     viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a \n     suitable living environment and by expanding economic \n     opportunities, principally for low- and moderate-income \n     persons;\n       (2) State Administered Community Development Block Grant, \n     which awards grants only to units of general local government \n     that carry out development activities in participating states \n     that develop annual funding priorities and criteria for \n     selecting projects;\n       (3) Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program, which allows \n     Program entitlement communities to apply for a guarantee, and \n     is available to Program non-entitlement communities if its \n     state agrees to pledge the block grant funds necessary to \n     secure the loan;\n       (4) Department of Housing and Urban Development-\n     Administered Small Cities Program for non-entitlement areas \n     in the State of Hawaii directly administered by HUD's Hawaii \n     State Office in Honolulu;\n       (5) Insular Areas Program, which provides grants to four \n     designated areas, including American Samoa, Guam, the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands;\n       (6) Disaster Recovery Assistance, in which HUD provides \n     flexible grants to help cities, counties, and states recover \n     from disasters declared by the President, especially in low-\n     income areas, subject to availability of supplemental \n     appropriations;\n       (7) Colonias, which allows Texas, Arizona, California, and \n     New Mexico to set aside up to ten percent of their state \n     Program funds for use in colonias; and\n       (8) Renewal Communities/Empowerment Zones/Enterprise \n     Communities, a program with an innovative approach to \n     revitalization, bringing communities together through\n\n[[Page S6735]]\n\n     public and private partnerships to attract the investment \n     necessary for sustainable economic and community development; \n     and\n       Whereas, to be eligible, not less than 70 percent of the \n     Community Development Block Grant funds must be used for \n     activities that benefit low- and moderate-income persons over \n     a one-, two-, or three-year period selected by the grantee; \n     and\n       Whereas, all activities must meet one of the following \n     national objectives to be eligible for the Program: (1) \n     Benefit low- and moderate-income persons; (2) Prevention or \n     elimination of slums or blight; and (3) Community development \n     needs having a particular urgency because existing conditions \n     pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare \n     of the community; and\n       Whereas, the Program works largely without fanfare or \n     recognition to ensure decent affordable housing for all, to \n     provide services to the most vulnerable in our communities, \n     and to create jobs and expand business opportunities; and\n       Whereas, the Program is an important tool in helping local \n     governments tackle the most serious challenges facing their \n     communities and has made a difference in the lives of \n     millions of people living in communities all across this \n     country; and\n       Whereas, the fiscal year 2006 budget offered by the Bush \n     Administration eliminates the Program in its entirety by \n     combining it along with 17 other programs into two new \n     programs, reducing funding for the consolidated programs to \n     $3,700,000,000 and moving them to the Department of Commerce, \n     which has no experience in community development; and\n       Whereas, the City and County of Honolulu, and the counties \n     of Hawaii, Maui, and Kauai all receive Program grants from \n     HUD and have used the grants to provide a plethora of much-\n     needed facilities and services that have benefited low- and \n     moderate-income household across the State; and\n       Whereas, elimination of the Program has been denounced by \n     the United States Conference of Mayors, National Association \n     of Counties, National Association of Housing and \n     Redevelopment Officials, National League of Cities, National \n     Community Development Association, and Local Initiatives \n     Support Corporation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2005, That the Legislature expresses its strong support of \n     the Program and urges the United States Congress not to cut \n     federal Program funding as proposed by the Bush \n     Administration in the fiscal year 2006 federal budget and to \n     support its restoration into the HUD budget at its current \n     funding level of $4,700,000,000; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, Vice-\n     President of the United States, Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, members of Hawaii's Congressional \n     delegation, HUD Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian \n     Housing, the Governor, and mayor of each county.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-94. A joint resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Utah relative to financial \n     institutions; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs.\n\n                        House Joint Resolution 1\n\n       Whereas, the financial institution industry is a critical \n     part of Utah's economy;\n       Whereas, the state is benefitted by and relies upon a \n     diversity of financial institutions within the state \n     including the existence of a strong credit union industry and \n     a healthy commercial bank industry;\n       Whereas, nationally, the competitive environment for banks \n     and credit unions has changed significantly since the first \n     credit unions were formed in the early 1900's;\n       Whereas, the rise and scope of federal credit unions is \n     rooted in the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934, as amended \n     over the years;\n       Whereas, the early credit unions started as small groups of \n     people who shared a close and meaningful ``common bond'' such \n     as occupations, the neighborhood where they lived, or a \n     church they attended;\n       Whereas, such persons were less able to obtain loans from \n     other financial institutions because of low income and the \n     perceived high risk of default and were, therefore, \n     especially vulnerable to usury lending practices by those \n     that might unfairly take advantage of such conditions;\n       Whereas, a credit union chartered in this state is required \n     to be a cooperative, nonprofit association, incorporated to:\n       (1) Encourage thrift among its members; (2) create sources \n     of credit at fair and reasonable rates of interest; and (3) \n     provide an opportunity for its members to use and control \n     their resources on a democratic basis in order to improve \n     their economic and social condition;\n       Whereas, Congress has previously found that: (1) The credit \n     union movement in America began as a cooperative effort to \n     serve the productive and provident credit needs of \n     individuals of modest means; (2) maintaining a meaningful \n     affinity or common bond between members is critical to the \n     fulfillment of the public mission of credit unions including \n     promoting thrift and credit extension; and (3) credit unions \n     are exempt from federal and most state taxes because they are \n     member-owned, democratically operated, not-for-profit \n     cooperative organizations generally managed by volunteer \n     boards and because they have historically had the specified \n     mission of meeting the credit and savings needs of their \n     members, especially persons of modest means;\n       Whereas, financial institutions are subject to regulation \n     by different federal governmental entities depending on their \n     structure, charter, and identity as financial institution;\n       Whereas, the National Credit Union Administration charters \n     and regulates federally chartered credit unions and as \n     insurer oversees state chartered credit unions;\n       Whereas, commercial banks are subject to a variety of \n     federal regulators depending on their charter including the \n     Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal \n     Reserve Board, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;\n       Whereas, the National Credit Union Administration has \n     expanded its determination of what has historically \n     constituted a well-defined local community for purposes of \n     defining a field of membership to include large geographic \n     areas;\n       Whereas, the broad field of membership established by the \n     National Credit Union Administration allows state chartered \n     credit unions to easily convert to a federal charter, \n     allowing for: (1) Differences in tax treatment of federally \n     chartered credit unions; and (2) differences in the \n     regulations of member business lending;\n       Whereas, the U.S. Supreme Court held in 1998 that the \n     original intent of the Federal Credit Union Act was to \n     require a more narrow interpretation of credit unions' common \n     bond and field of membership than what now exists under \n     legislation adopted by Congress;\n       Whereas, commercial banks are subject to taxes on the \n     federal, state, and local level;\n       Whereas, under the Internal Revenue Code, federal or state, \n     chartered credit unions are exempt from paying federal income \n     taxes;\n       Whereas, under the Federal Credit Union Act, as amended in \n     1937, states are prohibited from imposing certain taxes on \n     federal credit unions;\n       Whereas, in Utah, federally chartered and state chartered \n     credit unions do not pay state income taxes;\n       Whereas, credit unions pay property taxes;\n       Whereas, federally chartered credit unions do not pay sales \n     and use taxes;\n       Whereas, the state and not the federal government should \n     control and determine public policy affecting, the imposition \n     of state taxes;\n       Whereas, all taxes on financial institutions, including \n     both credit unions and commercial banks, should be examined \n     to determine whether a different and more principled approach \n     to taxing could lessen the tax burden wherever possible;\n       Whereas, federal tax policies and regulations related to \n     financial institutions can result in the erosion of state and \n     local tax bases;\n       Whereas, the possible erosion of the state tax base because \n     of federal tax policy and regulations related to financial \n     institutions can result in lost revenues to the state;\n       Whereas, the loss of revenues to the state impacts the \n     state's ability to meet the essential needs of its citizens \n     including the funding of education;\n       Whereas, all income tax revenues collected by the state are \n     constitutionally dedicated in Utah to funding education;\n       Whereas, the funding of education is a top priority of the \n     Legislature and, therefore, all exemptions from paying income \n     tax are carefully scrutinized by the Legislature;\n       Whereas, the federal encroachment into state policy areas \n     regarding financial institutions is not limited to taxation \n     but also includes preemption of state regulation of the \n     business activities of financial institutions within the \n     state;\n       Whereas, this federal encroachment raises constitutional \n     issues under the 10th Amendment and the Supremacy Clause; and\n       Whereas, the Financial Institutions Task Force has found \n     that because of the conversion of many state chartered credit \n     unions to federally chartered credit unions, significant \n     issues of tax policy and competitive fairness among financial \n     institutions now need to be addressed at the federal level: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah affirms \n     its decision to differentiate between traditional credit \n     unions and those that have lost a meaningful affinity or bond \n     and encourages Congress to consider a similar approach; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature urges Congress to examine \n     the rulings of the National Credit Union Administration \n     regarding ``common bond'' and field of membership to \n     determine whether those rulings are over broad and \n     inconsistent with the original intent of the Federal Credit \n     Union Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, that the Legislature urges Congress to recognize \n     and affirm the authority of states and local governments to \n     determine whether federally chartered credit unions may be \n     taxed the same as state chartered credit unions according to \n     state law and related policy considerations; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature urges Congress to provide a \n     principled, fair, and equitable tax structure for financial \n     institutions, including credit unions and commercial banks \n     alike, that allows the states to determine what state and \n     local taxes shall apply to financial institutions whether \n     state or federally chartered; and be it further\n       Resolved, That once a principled, fair, and equitable tax \n     structure for financial institutions is adopted, Congress \n     should examine whether the economic circumstances have \n     changed since the enactment of the Federal\n\n[[Page S6736]]\n\n     Credit Union Act such that credit unions should have a \n     broader role in the current financial marketplace; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature requests that if Congress \n     elects to retain the current tax structure for financial \n     institutions unchanged, it provide Utah and other states with \n     a reasoned explanation for maintaining that tax structure \n     without alteration; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature requests that Congress in \n     determining monies provided to the state by the federal \n     government for programs, including education programs, take \n     into account revenues that may be lost to the state as a \n     result of federal tax policy and regulations related to \n     financial institutions; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature urges Congress to fully and \n     carefully consider the principles, policies, circumstances, \n     and conditions, identified and referenced in this resolution \n     and promptly act as needed in order to remedy the same; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, and the members \n     of Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-95.

Bush \n     announced a new vision for United States space exploration, \n     with the goal of returning humans to the moon within the next \n     decade and extending a human presence across the solar \n     system; and\n       Whereas, the President's fiscal year 2005 budget request \n     for NASA is $1 billion higher than the previous year's \n     request and would redirect $11 billion in the existing \n     funding to provide a total of $12 billion over five years to \n     help address the space exploration vision: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     expresses support for returning humans to the moon and \n     pursuing human exploration of Mars and the solar system; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature supports continued funding \n     of human space flight, Earth Science, and other programs, as \n     well as continued funding of the space-related Shuttle \n     Booster Program; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature encourages the United States \n     Congress to enact and fully fund the proposed budget for the \n     Space Exploration Program as submitted in the 2005 budget, \n     which will enable the United States and the state of Utah to \n     remain leaders in the exploration and the development of \n     space; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the Majority Leader of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, NASA, and the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-97. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to the sale of \n     violent video games to children; to the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 33\n\n       Whereas, Americans have grown increasingly alarmed about \n     youth violence. Inspired in part by violent media images, for \n     too many of our children are committing violent crimes; and\n       Whereas, Numerous medical organizations, including the \n     American Medical Association and the American Psychological \n     Association, as well as law enforcement agencies such as the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation, have concluded that viewing \n     entertainment violence can lead to an increase in aggressive \n     attitudes, values, and behaviors, particularly in children. \n     Recent academic literature corroborates the findings of \n     earlier studies that demonstrate exposure to violent video \n     games produces aggressive behavior in children and young \n     people; and\n       Whereas, Violent, point-and-shoot video games are such \n     effective combat simulators that law enforcement and military \n     organizations use them extensively for training to accurately \n     and effectively shoot firearms in real combat situations. \n     Such games could actually serve to create a more deadly \n     accurate youth criminal armed with a firearm; and\n       Whereas, There are concerns that current initiatives, \n     including rating systems, are largely ineffective in \n     shielding young children from video game images. While \n     parental and family actions are of the utmost importance in \n     this effort, there are steps that Congress can take: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to conduct an investigation and take action \n     to prevent the sale of violent video games to children; and \n     be it further\n\n[[Page S6737]]\n\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-98. A Senate Concurrent Resolution adopted by the \n     General Assembly of the State of Ohio relative to the \n     exclusion of the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center and the \n     Defense Finance Accounting Services Center in Cleveland, Ohio \n     from the list of base closures for the Base Realignment and \n     Closure process; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n            (Amended Senate Concurrent Resolution Number 12)\n\n       Whereas, The NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis \n     Field in Cleveland, Ohio, is one of NASA's ten field offices, \n     working to meet NASA's goals of understanding and protecting \n     our home planet, exploring the universe and searching for \n     life, and inspiring the next generation of explorers; and\n       Whereas, The focus of the Glenn Research. Center is on \n     research related to exploration systems; it leads NASA in \n     fields of microgravity science and works in partnership with \n     others to increase national wealth, safety, and security, to \n     protect the environment, and to explore the universe. The \n     Center also is NASA's leader in the area of aeropropulsion \n     research, which is important to NASA's goals to promote \n     economic growth and national security and have safe, \n     superior, and environmentally compatible civil and military \n     aircraft propulsion systems; and\n       Whereas, Congress authorized a new round of the Base \n     Realignment and Closure process (BRAC) to occur this year, \n     which has the potential to affect the NASA Glenn Research \n     Center and the community of Cleveland that supports the \n     Center; and\n       Whereas, The Glenn Research Center employs approximately \n     3,300 individuals, and the employment of these individuals \n     and the economic impact of the Center, along with the \n     Center's research, make the Center a vital installation to \n     Cleveland, the state of Ohio, and the nation; and\n       Whereas, The Defense Finance Accounting Services Center in \n     Cleveland efficiently provides accounting and payroll \n     services for our military and civilian personnel serving our \n     country; and\n       Whereas, The Defense Finance Accounting Services Center is \n     a vital part of Greater Cleveland's economy, providing \n     employment to 1,200 persons; and\n       Whereas, The Base Realignment and Closure Process has the \n     potential to affect the Defense Finance Accounting Services \n     Center and the community of Cleveland that supports the \n     Center: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 126th General Assembly of the State of \n     Ohio supports the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center and the \n     Defense Finance Accounting Services Center, and firmly \n     believes that neither Center should be included in the \n     Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission's list of \n     proposed bases to be closed, as both are valuable assets to \n     the state of Ohio and the defense of our nation, and \n     memorializes Congress to take appropriate action so that \n     neither Center is included in the Commission's closure list; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit duly \n     authenticated copies of this resolution to the President of \n     the United States, the Secretary of Defense of the United \n     States, the members of the Ohio Congressional delegation, the \n     Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President Pro Tempore and the Secretary \n     of the United States Senate, and the news media of Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-99. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to establishing and requiring the .xxx domain name \n     for adult-only web sites; to the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 30\n\n       Whereas, From 1983 to 1998, the federal government managed \n     the Internet, including the Domain Name System (DNS), a \n     central coordinating body that assigns unique e-mail and web \n     site addresses so that the network runs smoothly. As the \n     Internet evolved from a small-scale system of links among \n     American academic institutions into a mainstream \n     international communications, educational, and electronic \n     commerce medium, the federal government concluded that it \n     should no longer manage its development. In 1998, the United \n     States Department of Commerce (DOC), in an effort to \n     establish global standards and consensus-based policies, \n     agreed to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the \n     California-based private sector, nonprofit corporation called \n     the Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers \n     (ICANN). In part, the MOU calls for the joint development of \n     the DNS in order to facilitate its future transfer to the \n     private sector; and\n       Whereas, While the DOC continues to serve as the steward of \n     the DNS during its transition to private sector management, \n     it does not regulate ICANN, play a vital role in ICANN's \n     internal governance or day-to-day operations, or intervene in \n     ICANN activities unless the corporation's actions are \n     inconsistent with the MOU. The only way that the department \n     can influence ICANN decisions is either to not renew the MOU, \n     which expires September 30, 2006, or through informal \n     discussion with corporation officials; and\n       Whereas, In 2001, ICANN approved seven new top-level domain \n     names, but refused to approve the .xxx domain name, which \n     would have provided a cyber sanctuary to protect children \n     from the corrupting influences of online pornography. To \n     protect children, Congress has the authority to direct the \n     DOC to establish and operate the second-level .xxx domain \n     name within the United States. The .xxx domain name will \n     safeguard children by allowing parents and libraries to \n     employ filtering or blocking software technologies: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize Congress to enact legislation allowing the \n     Department of Commerce (DOC) to help shield children by \n     establishing and requiring the .xxx domain name for adult-\n     only web sites; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the United States Department of Commerce, the President of \n     the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-100. A concurrent memorial adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Arizona \n     relative to action that would improve storage, desalt and \n     augment the flow of Colorado River water supplies to river \n     basin states; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                     House Concurrent Memorial 2007\n\n       Whereas, in 1964, the United States Supreme Court decreed \n     that Arizona is entitled to 2.8 million acre-feet of water \n     from the Lower Colorado River each year. The water \n     allocations for California and Nevada, the other lower basin \n     states, were determined in the same litigation and each state \n     was given equal priority under the Supreme Court's decree; \n     and\n       Whereas, despite prevailing in the litigation, Arizona was \n     unable to practically use its entitlement to the water until \n     the Central Arizona Project (CAP) was constructed. As a \n     condition of obtaining congressional approval for the \n     construction of the CAP, Arizona accepted a limitation on its \n     water entitlement that effectively gives the state the lowest \n     priority in times of shortage in exchange for commitment on \n     the part of the federal government to augment Colorado River \n     water supplies; and\n       Whereas, CAP provides one-third of Arizona's renewable \n     water supplies and without this water, the many cities, \n     towns, Indian communities and agricultural water users that \n     depend on the CAP in Central Arizona would face critical \n     water supply shortages.\n       Whereas, the Yuma desalting plant was constructed by the \n     federal government pursuant to the Colorado River Basin \n     Salinity Control Act to treat water for delivery to Mexico in \n     satisfaction of United States treaty obligations, but the \n     United States has failed to operate the desalter, thus \n     causing the loss of more than one hundred thousand acre feet \n     of water annually from Lake Mead; and\n       Whereas, the lack of adequate regulatory storage facilities \n     in the Colorado River system above the Mexican border has \n     resulted in the continuing overdelivery of water to Mexico, \n     further reducing the supplies available to meet the needs of \n     California, Nevada and Arizona and increasing the risk of \n     shortage.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:\n       1. That the Congress of the United States take such \n     actions, including enacting legislation and appropriating \n     funds, as are required to construct or improve regulatory \n     storage facilities in the lower Colorado River system, \n     operate the Yuma desalting plant and augment the flow of the \n     Colorado River to protect Arizona's Colorado River water \n     supplies and allow the lower Colorado River basin states to \n     maximize the benefits of their water entitlements.\n       2. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United State Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State \n     of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-101. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Washington relative to the establishment of the Ice \n     Age Floods National Geologic Trail; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       Senate Joint Memorial 8000\n\n       Whereas, The Ice Age Floods Study of Alternatives and \n     Environmental Assessment recommends that the ``Ice Age Floods \n     National Geologic Trail'' be established by the Congress of \n     the United States of America to follow the floods' pathways; \n     and\n       Whereas, The floods are responsible for shaping a \n     fascinating landscape that spans much of Washington State \n     from its eastern border to the Pacific Ocean; and\n       Whereas, The landscape and its natural history are a draw \n     to recreators, scientists, and tourists, which stimulate \n     interest in the region and benefit local economies; and\n       Whereas, Many floods' resources are on public lands and can \n     be viewed from existing public roadways; and\n       Whereas, The envisioned trail is to be a public-private \n     partnership coordinated by the National Park Service; and\n       Whereas, The Study of Alternatives recommends that no more \n     than 25 acres be acquired by the National Park Service for \n     use in the trail: Now, therefore, Your Memorialists \n     respectfully support establishment of the Ice Age Floods \n     National Geologic Trail; and, further be it\n\n[[Page S6738]]\n\n       Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable George W.

A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Washington relative to the rejection of the proposal \n     to transition the Bonneville Power Administration from cost-\n     based rates to market-based rates; to the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources.\n\n                 Substitute Senate Joint Memorial 8018\n\n       Whereas, The Bonneville Power Administration supplies \n     seventy percent of the electrical power consumed in the state \n     of Washington; and\n       Whereas, Currently and since its creation the rates \n     established for such power have been based upon recovery of \n     its costs; and\n       Whereas, The ratepayers of the Pacific Northwest and West \n     Coast have paid those costs in their entirety through their \n     rates; and\n       Whereas, The Pacific Northwest region has experienced a \n     nearly fifty percent increase in wholesale power rates since \n     the energy crisis of 2001-2002; and\n       Whereas, The President's proposed fiscal year 2006 budget \n     would transition the Bonneville Power Administration from \n     cost-based rates to market-based rates;\n       Whereas, The Office of Management and Budget has estimated \n     that such change would result in an estimated increase of one \n     hundred dollars per year for each Pacific Northwest \n     ratepayer; and\n       Whereas, This budget proposal would cost the Northwest \n     region four hundred eighty million dollars next year and two \n     and one-half billion dollars over three years; and\n       Whereas, The first argument to justify these increased \n     rates, that the ratepayers of the Pacific Northwest are being \n     subsidized by the federal government, is not well-founded in \n     light of the fact that all of the Bonneville Power \n     Administration's costs, including repayment of debt at \n     market-based interest rates to the United States Treasury, \n     are recovered from ratepayers, primarily individuals and \n     businesses in the Pacific Northwest; and\n       Whereas, The second argument to justify these increased \n     rates, that of further accelerating Bonneville's debt \n     repayment to the United States Treasury, are not well-founded \n     in light of Bonneville's success in recent years of early \n     repayment of its debt, despite the sale of power at-cost and \n     during difficult economic times; and\n       Whereas, This proposal if enacted would essentially result \n     in a one hundred percent increase in power rates over a \n     seven-year period, which will severely harm the region's \n     businesses and industries, as well as all the residents of \n     the region; and\n       Whereas, The administration's additional budget proposal to \n     increase the types of transactions that would count against \n     the Bonneville Power Administration's authorized debt limit \n     would negatively impact the Bonneville Power Administration's \n     ability to upgrade existing or build new vital \n     infrastructure; and\n       Whereas, This proposal would lead to further limiting \n     investment in an already constrained transmission system \n     which could result in electricity shortages and decreased \n     reliability: Now, Therefore, Your Memorialists respectfully \n     pray that the proposal to transition the Bonneville Power \n     Administration from cost-based rates to market-based rates, \n     as expressed in the President's fiscal year 2006 proposed \n     budget, be rejected; and furthermore, your memorialists \n     respectfully pray that the proposal to add additional \n     transactions for inclusion into the Bonneville Power \n     Administration's authorized debt limit be rejected; and, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of \n     Congress from the State of Washington, and the Secretary of \n     the United States Department of Energy, Samuel W.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah relative to oil and gas drilling and \n     exploration; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n       Whereas, significant reserves of oil have been discovered \n     in Utah;\n       Whereas, many investors are working through the steps to \n     obtain oil and gas leases from the Utah state office of the \n     Bureau of Land Management;\n       Whereas, for all federal oil and gas leases sold in the \n     state, 50 percent of the proceeds go to the state of Utah;\n       Whereas, federal oil and gas lease sales for November 2003, \n     totaled $982,387; for February 2004, $6,325,314; for June \n     2004, $9,951,502; for September 2004, $28,030,004; and for \n     December 2004, $521,916;\n       Whereas, although the September 2004 oil and gas lease \n     sales were the largest in Utah in terms of acreage, roughly \n     190,000 acres were deferred or deleted from the sale when the \n     Bureau of Land Management received\n\n[[Page S6739]]\n\n     new information on wilderness characteristics of the land;\n       Whereas, every parcel available as part of an oil or gas \n     lease is scrutinized prior to the sale to determine if it can \n     be offered in compliance with, among others, the National \n     Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the \n     National Historic Preservation Act;\n       Whereas, to protect other resources, numerous stipulations \n     and stringent requirements are placed on the oil and gas \n     leases that are issued;\n       Whereas, currently over 400 oil and gas leases have been \n     awarded but not yet issued because of litigation instigated \n     by environmental groups;\n       Whereas, groups suing to halt the issuance of the awarded \n     oil and gas leases are not parties to the sales of the oil \n     and gas leases;\n       Whereas, much of the Bureau of Land Management's time is \n     taken up with addressing protests of the sales of oil and gas \n     leases;\n       Whereas, millions of dollars that could be invested in the \n     state are being held pending the outcome of these lawsuits;\n       Whereas, individuals and companies who have purchased oil \n     and gas leases in Utah or are contemplating a purchase are \n     greatly concerned with how long their funds have remained \n     tied up in a system that is not performing its intended \n     purpose;\n       Whereas, protests should be addressed up to the time that \n     the oil and gas leases are awarded, then should be restricted \n     unless an error was made in the plain language of the lease; \n     and\n       Whereas, unless concerns with the oil and gas lease process \n     are resolved, many potential investors in Utah oil and gas \n     leases will choose to do business in other states, costing \n     the state much needed revenues: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah urges \n     the United States Congress and the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation to take legislative steps necessary \n     to address Utah's oil and gas drilling and exploration lease \n     issuance problems; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah urges \n     that Congress and Utah's delegation act decisively to end the \n     legal delays caused by individuals and groups who are not a \n     party to the sale of an oil and gas lease; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the Utah office \n     of the Bureau of Land Management, and to the members of \n     Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-106.

That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State \n     of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-107. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the State of Ohio \n     relative to the Clear Skies Act of 2005; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                  (Amended House Resolution Number 21)\n\n       Whereas, Although the nation's air quality has improved \n     significantly since the early 1970's, pollutants such as \n     sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury continue at \n     levels that cause environmental and public health concerns. \n     Because of those concerns, the United States Environmental \n     Protection Agency has established stricter National Ambient \n     Air Quality Standards, most recently for ozone and \n     particulate matter; and\n       Whereas, Currently, 474 counties, including 33 in Ohio, are \n     in nonattainment with the ozone standard and 225 counties, \n     including 32 in Ohio, are in nonattainment with the \n     particulate matter standard. Nonattainment designations place \n     a significant burden on state and local governments, which \n     must develop plans to reduce emissions and come into \n     attainment by a specified date; and\n       Whereas, In order to ensure that the states have the most \n     effective means of attaining the new standards, the Clear \n     Skies Act of 2005 (S. 131) has been introduced in the United \n     States Senate. This legislation not only is based on the \n     successful Acid Rain Program, it also incorporates a multi-\n     emissions approach that takes advantage of the benefits that \n     would result from controlling multiple pollutants at the same \n     time; and\n       Whereas, The Clear Skies Act balances environmental, \n     energy, and economic needs. For example, it requires power \n     plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, \n     and mercury by 70% by 2018 and allows the nation to continue \n     burning coal, our most abundant and low-cost energy source, \n     while improving our nation's air quality: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the House of \n     Representatives of the 126th General Assembly of the State of \n     Ohio, support concepts in the Clear Skies Act of 2005 and \n     urge Congress to seek resolution of the issues involved and \n     enact legislation for the purpose of improving our nation's \n     air quality and ensure our nation's economic stability; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives \n     transmit duly authenticated copies of this resolution to the \n     President of the United States, the President Pro Tempore and \n     Secretary of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Clerk \n     of the United States House of Representatives, the members of \n     the Ohio Congressional delegation, and the news media of \n     Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-108. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Washington relative to Social Security; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Senate Joint Memorial 8014\n\n       Whereas, In August 1935, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt \n     signed into law the Social Security program, he asserted that \n     the fundamental purpose of the initiative was to ``give some \n     measure of protection to the average citizen and his family \n     against the loss of a job and against a poverty ridden old \n     age;'' and\n       Whereas, Today, seventy years later, about 48 million \n     Americans--both retired workers and those who are disabled--\n     receive modest checks from Social Security; and\n       Whereas, This modest support continues to be a bulwark \n     against the indignities of poverty, accounting for more than \n     half the income of two-thirds of those who receive benefits; \n     and\n       Whereas, Social Security is now widely recognized by the \n     public as one of the most successful programs in our nation's \n     history, guaranteeing as it does, to all Americans, today and \n     tomorrow, a basic standard of living; and\n       Whereas, It is being argued that Social Security should be \n     privatized by diverting payroll taxes from current \n     beneficiaries to private investment accounts; and\n       Whereas, Such reforms are likely to require the federal \n     government to borrow nearly $2 trillion, or $100 billion to \n     $150 billion per year for ten years, to finance the transfer \n     to create new private accounts; and\n       Whereas, In addition to adding to the already significant \n     federal debt, this proposal would partially replace \n     guaranteed benefits with ones that expose millions of retired \n     Americans to the ups and downs of the stock market: Now, \n     therefore, Your Memorialists respectfully request that the \n     Congress and the Administration reject the current effort to \n     privatize Social Security and instead engage in an open \n     dialogue with the American public to arrive at a sensible \n     solution that preserves the original intent of Franklin \n     Delano Roosevelt, making Social Security an insurance fail-\n     safe for the aged and disabled and a complement to every \n     individual's ability to invest in the private market on their \n     own; and be it\n       Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of \n     Congress from the State of Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-109. A concurrent memorial adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Arizona relative to Social \n     Security reform; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                     Senate Concurrent Memorial 1003\n\n       Whereas, Social Security is the foundation of retirement \n     income for most Americans; and\n       Whereas, preserving and strengthening the long-term \n     viability of Social Security is a vital national priority and \n     is essential for the retirement security of today's working \n     Americans current and future retirees and their families; and\n       Whereas, Social Security faces significant fiscal and \n     demographic pressures; and\n       Whereas, the nonpartisan Office of the Chief Actuary at the \n     Social Security Administration reports that:\n       1. The number of workers paying taxes to support each \n     Social Security beneficiary has dropped from 16.5 in 1950 to \n     3.3 in 2002;\n       2. Within a generation there will be only two workers to \n     support each retiree which will substantially increase the \n     financial burden on American workers;\n       3. Without structural reform, the Social Security system, \n     beginning in 2018, will pay out more in benefits than it will \n     collect in taxes;\n       4. Without structural reform, the Social Security trust \n     fund will be exhausted in 2042 and Social Security tax \n     revenue in 2042 will\n\n[[Page S6740]]\n\n     only cover seventy-three per cent of promised benefits, and \n     will decrease to sixty-eight per cent by 2078;\n       5. Without structural reform, future Congresses may have to \n     raise payroll taxes fifty per cent over the next seventy-five \n     years to pay full benefits on time, resulting in payroll tax \n     rates of as much as 16.9 per cent by 2042 and 18.3 per cent \n     by 2078;\n       6. Without structural reform, Social Security's total cash \n     shortfall over the next seventy-five years is estimated to be \n     more than $25,000,000,000,000 in constant 2004 dollars or \n     $3,700,000,000,000 measured in present value terms; and\n       7. Absent structural reforms, spending on Social Security \n     will increase from 4.3 per cent of gross domestic product in \n     2004 to 6.6 per cent in 2078; and\n       Whereas, the Congressional Budget Office, the Government \n     Accountability Office, the Congressional Research Service, \n     the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the President's \n     Commission to Strengthen Social Security have all warned that \n     failure to enact fiscally responsible Social Security reform \n     quickly will result in one or more of the following: 1. \n     Higher tax rates; 2. lower Social Security benefit levels; 3. \n     increased federal debt or less spending on other federal \n     programs;\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the President, the Congress and the American \n     people, including seniors, workers, women, minorities and \n     disabled persons, should work together at the earliest \n     opportunity to enact legislation to achieve a solvent and \n     permanently sustainable Social Security system.\n       2. That Social Security reform must:\n       (a) Protect current and near retirees from any changes to \n     Social Security benefits.\n       (b) Reduce the pressure on future taxpayers and on other \n     budgetary priorities.\n       (c) Provide benefit levels that adequately reflect \n     individual contributions to the Social Security system.\n       (d) Preserve and strengthen the safety net for vulnerable \n     populations including the disabled and survivors.\n       3. That the United States Congress should honor section \n     13301 of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990.\n       4. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State \n     of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-110.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom gross income amounts paid on behalf of Federal employees and \nmembers of the Armed Forces on active duty under Federal student loan \nrepayment programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \nGenerating Opportunity by Forgiving Educational Debt for Service Act of \n2005, a bill that will help Federal agencies and the Armed Forces \nrecruit talented individuals to serve in all areas of the Federal \nGovernment and the military. This legislation is a modestly expanded \nversion of a bill I introduced in the 108th Congress.\n  Current law authorizes Federal agencies to pay student loans up to \n$10,000 a year with a cumulative cap of $60,000, but the incentive is \ntaxed. Known as GOFEDS, this bill would amend the Federal tax code and \nallow the Federal Government's student loan repayment programs to be \noffered on a tax-free basis.\n  In recent years, many educational institutions have established \nprograms that repay a portion of the student loan debt their graduates \nowe. These programs are designed to encourage students to seek jobs \nwith government or non-profit organizations that cannot pay salaries \ncommensurate with the private sector upon graduation. Under current \nlaw, the amounts these institutions offer their graduates as student \nloan repayment are not taxed as income, provided the recipients choose \nto work for the government or non-profit organizations.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Tax Code does not treat the Federal \nGovernment's loan repayment programs in the same way, considering such \nloan repayment as taxable income to the employee. As a result, the net \nbenefit of any such program is reduced by the amount of tax that the \nindividual has to pay on the debt repaid. This bill would amend the tax \ncode so that the Government does not continue to undermine its own loan \nrepayment recruitment incentive. This change will help Federal agencies \nrecruit and retain well-qualified graduates.\n  This Congress, I have expanded GOFEDS to our military because recent \nreports indicate that all four services missed their recruiting goals \nlast year. Unfortunately, military recruiting levels are now at a 30-\nyear low. Under GOFEDS, military education loan programs, like the \nActive-Duty Loan Repayment Program will be offered on a tax free basis.\n  With more than half of the Federal workforce eligible for retirement \nin the next 5 years and surveys showing that fewer Americans find \ngovernment services attractive, the need for this legislation is even \nmore necessary. I believe the cost of this bill is minimal, but its \npotential impact is great.

A bill to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to \ndevelop regulations regarding the transportation of extremely hazardous \nmaterials, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Hazardous \nMaterials Vulnerability Reduction Act of 2005. It is regretful that I \nam introducing this legislation, as the Department of Homeland Security \nhas all of the legal authorities necessary to undertake the steps set \nout in this legislation. However, nearly 4 years after September 11, \nthe Department of Homeland Security is still not doing its job. Quite \nfrankly, officials at the Department of Homeland Security are either \nunaware, or even worse, they are purposely ignoring a grave threat to \nour cities. Hazardous materials being transported by 90-ton rail \ntankers has been described as a ``uniquely dangerous'' threat--\ncomparable only to a nuclear or biological attack. According to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Department of Transportation, \nthese materials pose special risks during transportation because their \nuncontrolled release can endanger significant numbers of people. In \naddition, there have been countless reports of lax security along the \nurban area rail routes they travel. Nevertheless, the administration \nhas done nothing to reduce this threat. The legislation that I am \nintroducing today will require the Department of Homeland Security to \ndevelop a comprehensive, risk-based strategy for reducing the threat of \na terrorist attack on extremely hazardous materials in our Nation's \nhigh-threat cities. The steps set out in this legislation should have \nbeen taken years ago, but it is clear that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity will not act. I hope that my colleagues will join me in \npassing this legislation to require them to act.\n  Within just a few miles of where we stand right now, rail tankers \ncarrying the world's most dangerous chemicals are being transported \nover tracks that are not sufficiently safeguarded or monitored. \nAccording to Richard A. Falkenrath, a former homeland security adviser \nto President Bush, this threat stands out ``as acutely vulnerable and \nalmost uniquely dangerous.'' He is not alone in this opinion. The \nHomeland Security Council released a report in July 2004 indicating \nthat an explosion, in an urban area, of a rail tanker carrying chlorine \ncould kill up to 17,500 individuals and could require the \nhospitalization of nearly 100,000. An analysis by the Naval Research \nLaboratory depicted a more troubling scenario when it studied the \npotential for damage if an attack occurred while an event was being \nheld on the National Mall, such as the annual Fourth of \nJuly celebration. According to this analysis, ``over 100,000 people \ncould be seriously harmed or even killed in the first half hour.'' Let \nme say that again, according to a study by the Naval Research \nLaboratory ``over 100,000 people could be seriously harmed or killed in \nthe first half hour.''\n\n  Terrorist groups already understand the potential impact of such an \nattack. The FBI and CIA have uncovered evidence that terrorists have \ntargeted chemical shipments, and just a few months ago during testimony \nbefore the Senate Intelligence Committee, FBI Director Mueller \nindicated that threats to rail remain a key concern. This should not be \na surprise. Rail systems are the most frequently attacked targets \nworldwide, and the wide open nature of their architecture makes them \nvulnerable at many points. In other words, rail systems present many \nsoft targets. Incidentally, I have introduced separate legislation in \nthe last three Congresses that would provide $1.2 billion to eliminate \nsome of the vulnerabilities in our rail system; however, this \nlegislation has not been supported by the Bush administration and it \nhas not passed Congress. In fact, the administration has not asked for \na single dime specifically for rail security. This is very troubling \nbecause we know that the modus operandi for many terrorist groups is to \ncause mass casualties and spectacular damage. According to the Chlorine \nInstitute, an attack on a 90-ton tanker could create a toxic cloud 40 \nmiles long and 10 miles wide. The Environmental Protection Agency \nestimates that in an urban area this toxic cloud could extend 14 miles. \nCan you imagine the psychological impact of a toxic cloud of poisonous \ngas expanding and moving slowly over one of our major metropolitan \nareas--leaving death and chaos in its path?\n  Given the potential damage and the direct threat against chemical \nrail tankers, you would think that the Bush administration has been \nbusy reducing or eliminating this threat. Unfortunately, as with so \nmany other areas involving our homeland security this does not appear \nto be the case. In January testimony before the Senate Homeland \nSecurity Committee, Mr. Falkenrath stated that ``to date, the Federal \nGovernment has not made a material reduction in the inherent \nvulnerability of hazardous chemical targets inside the United States.'' \nHe went on to say that this should be the highest priority for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. A Wall Street Journal article written \nlast year--``Graffiti Artists Put Their Mark on War Against \nTerrorism''--provides a chilling example of the exposure of these \nchemical tankers. The reporter followed a graffiti artist to a railroad \ntunnel along tracks that run near I-395 not far from where we stand. As \nhe was conducting the interview, a tanker carrying dangerous chemicals \nrolled by on an adjacent track. The graffiti artist noted that ``it \nwouldn't be hard at all for someone like Al Qaeda to wait right here \nfor the right poison and bang! Good-bye Washington.''\n\n  This threat and the lack of action by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity has led many city officials to consider local legislation to \nban shipments of hazardous materials. Right now, a dispute between the \nDistrict of Columbia and the transportation companies joined by the \nBush administration is being litigated in Federal courts. Other cities, \nsuch as Philadelphia and Boston are considering similar action. As a \nformer county executive, I am sympathetic to the plight of local \nofficials, and they should certainly be allowed to exercise their \npolice powers in appropriate situations. I believe, and I am sure most \nlocal officials would agree, that it would be better to have a \nnational, comprehensive policy on this issue. This is simply too \nimportant to have a patchwork strategy. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity should have already done this. Unfortunately, they have not, \nand this legislation will require the Department to take some basic, \nfundamental steps to enhance safety for the American people.\n  The legislation that I am introducing requires the Department of \nHomeland Security to issue regulations establishing a national policy \nfor dealing with the transport of the world's most dangerous chemicals \nby rail through our high threat cities. It will require the Department \nto develop protocols for the notification of State and local officials, \nand it will require the Department to study and report to Congress \nregarding security enhancing measures such as secondary containment \ntechnologies, GPS tracking of shipments, and the feasibility of \nsmaller, more secure tankers. The bill also includes a provision \nrequiring the Department of Homeland Security to work with State and \nlocal officials, the rail industry and other stakeholders to develop a \nstrategy for rerouting a small fraction of the most dangerous materials \naround our most threatened city. It is estimated that only 5 percent of \nall hazardous materials shipped by rail will be subjected to this \nregulation. Finally, the bill will provide $100 million to State and \nlocal governments and rail operators to purchase safety equipment and \nprovide training to first responders and rail workers who are likely to \ndiscover and respond to an incident involving hazardous materials. An \nadditional $10 million will be made available to the National Labor \nCollege to provide further training for rail workers.\n  I realize that the rail industry has invested considerable amounts of \nits own money to enhance security since September 11, and this \nlegislation is not an indictment of their efforts. I have been pushing \nto get more Federal funding for rail security for years, but this plea \nhas fallen on deaf ears within the administration. I realize that we \ncannot eliminate every conceivable risk, but at a time when we have \ntroops overseas fighting the war on terror and our Nation's law \nenforcement agencies are on high alert, the least that we should do\n\n[[Page S6744]]\n\nis ensure that we have a national strategy for handling a threat that \nis comparable in scope to a nuclear or biological attack. I will close \nby again referring to the grave warning set out in the study by the \nNaval Research Laboratory--``over 100,000 people could be seriously \nharmed or even killed in the first half hour'' of an attack. The danger \nis simply too great to ignore, and I ask my colleagues to join me in \npassing this critical legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1256\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Hazardous \n     Materials Vulnerability Reduction Act of 2005''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress has specifically given the Department of \n     Homeland Security, working in conjunction with the Department \n     of Transportation and other Federal agencies, the primary \n     authority for the security of the United States \n     transportation sector, including passenger and freight rail.\n       (2) This authority includes the responsibility to protect \n     American citizens from terrorist incidents related to the \n     transport by rail of extremely hazardous materials.\n       (3) Federal agencies have determined that hazardous \n     materials can be used as tools of destruction and terror and \n     that extremely hazardous materials are particularly \n     vulnerable to sabotage or misuse during transport.\n       (4) The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central \n     Intelligence Agency have found evidence suggesting that \n     chemical tankers used to transport and store extremely \n     hazardous chemicals have been targeted by terrorist groups.\n       (5) Rail shipments of extremely hazardous materials are \n     often routed through highly attractive targets and densely \n     populated areas, including within a few miles of the White \n     House and United States Capitol.\n       (6) According to security experts, certain extremely \n     hazardous materials present a mass casualty terrorist \n     potential rivaled only by improvised nuclear devices, certain \n     acts of bioterrorism, and the collapse of large occupied \n     buildings.\n       (7) A report by the Chlorine Institute found that a 90-ton \n     rail tanker, if successfully targeted by an explosive device, \n     could cause a catastrophic release of an extremely hazardous \n     material, creating a toxic cloud 40 miles long and 10 miles \n     wide.\n       (8) The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that in \n     an urban area a toxic cloud could extend for 14 miles.\n       (9) The United States Naval Research Laboratories concluded \n     that a toxic plume of this type, created while there was a \n     public event on the National Mall, could kill or injure up to \n     100,000 people in less than 30 minutes.\n       (10) According to security experts, rail shipments of \n     extremely hazardous materials are particularly vulnerable and \n     dangerous, however the Federal Government has made no \n     material reduction in the inherent vulnerability of hazardous \n     chemical targets inside the United States.\n       (11) While the safety record related to rail shipments of \n     hazardous materials is very good, recent accidental releases \n     of extremely hazardous materials in rural South Carolina and \n     San Antonio, Texas, demonstrate the fatal danger posed by \n     extremely hazardous materials.\n       (12) Security experts have determined that re-routing these \n     rail shipments is the only way to immediately eliminate this \n     danger in high threat areas, which currently puts hundreds of \n     thousands of people at risk.\n       (13) Security experts have determined that the primary \n     benefit of re-routing the shipment of extremely hazardous \n     materials is a reduction in the number of people that would \n     be exposed to the deadly impact of the release due to an \n     attack, and the principal cost would be the additional \n     operating expense associated with possible increase inhaul \n     for the shipment of extremely hazardous materials.\n       (14) Less than 5 percent of all hazardous materials shipped \n     by rail will meet the definition of extremely hazardous \n     materials under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to clarify \nthat persons may bring private rights of actions against foreign states \nfor certain terrorist acts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, along with my colleague, Senator \nLautenberg, I am introducing the Justice for Marine Corps Families--\nVictims of Terrorism Act. I am submitting this legislation on behalf of \nthe families of the brave servicemen who died when terrorists--with the \nsupport of the Government of Iran--sent a suicide bomber into the \nMarine Corps Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, on October 23, 1983, killing \n241 U.S. servicemen--18 sailors, 3 soldiers, and 220 marines.\n  This legislation clarifies a private right of action, in Federal \ncourts, for U.S. citizens against state sponsors of terrorism and will \nultimately make it easier for victims of such acts to collect court-\nordered damages against state-sponsors of terrorism. The specific \nprovisions of the legislation have been drafted to harmonize existing \nstatutory law with the recent decision by the District of Columbia \ncircuit in Cicippio-Puleo v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 353 F.3d 1024, \nD.C. Cir. 2004, which held that ``neither 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1605(a)(7) nor \nthe Flatow Amendment to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. . . ., \nnor the two considered in tandem, creates a private right of action \nagainst a foreign government.'' 353 F.3d 1024, 1032-33 (D.C. Cir. \n2004). This bill will permit the families of the brave servicemen who \ndied at the Marine Corps Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, to collect court-\nordered damages against state-sponsors of terrorism such as Iran.\n  The initial section of the bill clarifies that victims of a state-\nsponsored terrorist attack are permitted to bring a private suit \nagainst the sponsoring foreign terrorist government. Congress first \nallowed U.S. citizen victims of state sponsored terrorism to pursue \nprivate actions against a foreign terrorist government when we passed \nthe Flatow Amendment in 1996. Now, some 9 years and over 50 successful \ncases later, the Federal Appellate Court for the District of Columbia \nCircuit in Cicippio-Puleo v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 353 F.3d 1024 \nD.C., 2004, has held that the Flatow amendment did not create a private \nright of action against a foreign terrorist government. Accordingly, \nthe initial section of this bill will correct Cicippio-Puleo by \nexplicitly inserting language into the Flatow amendment enabling U.S. \ncitizens to once again bring private suits against foreign terrorist \ngovernments who have murdered or maimed their loved ones.\n  The second section of the bill eliminating many of the barriers which \nhave prevented U.S. citizens from collecting on court ordered damages \nagainst state sponsors of terrorism. The bill does this by changing the \nlegal standard of the Bancec doctrine from day to day-managerial \ncontrol to those under the beneficial ownership of the state. The \nSupreme Court enunciated the so-called Bancec doctrine in First Nat'l \nCity Bank v. Banco Para EI Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462 U.S. 611, \n626-27, 1983. In this case, the U.S. Supreme Court created a \npresumption against a party that seeks to satisfy an outstanding \njudgment against a foreign government by seizing the foreign \ngovernment's assets. This section of the bill will ease the burden on \nthe families of victims of terrorism by permitting them to attach the \nhidden assets of terrorist states held within the United States. \nFinally, the remaining portions of the bill would create a mechanism \nwhereby a lien could be filed in any jurisdiction in the United States \nwhere a state sponsor of terrorism directly or indirectly owns assets. \nThis would prevent foreign state sponsors of terrorism from removing \nthese assets from the country after the passage of this legislation.\n  On October 23, 2004, in Philadelphia, I was privileged to take part \nin a memorial service held in honor of the servicemen killed in the \n1983 Beirut attack. Some of the family members of those killed attended \nthe event. Their moving comments about how they had been denied the \nability to seek legal redress, despite clear findings implicating Iran \nin the attacks, were both poignant and persuasive. It is vitally \nimportant to victims' families that they have a private right of action \nagainst the state sponsor itself, not just against its officials, \nemployees, or agents acting in their official capacity. These victims \nand their families deserve not only a day in court but also the ability \nto recover damages from these terrorist states that commit, direct, or \nmaterially support terrorist acts against American citizens or \nnationals. This bill reaffirms that the United States will not tolerate \nstate-sponsored terrorism. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join us \nin support of this\n\n[[Page S6747]]\n\nbill. I yield the floor. I ask unaminous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1257\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the building located at 493 Auburn \nAvenue, N.E., in Atlanta, Georgia, as the ``John Lewis Civil Rights \nInstitute''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a man who has \nbeen at the front of our country's fight for civil rights. Born a son \nof sharecroppers in Troy, AL, John grew up to become one of the leading \nproponents fighting on the frontlines of the civil rights movement.\n  John grew up listening to speeches from the Reverend Martin Luther \nKing Jr., and observing many courageous acts, such as the Montgomery \nbus boycotts. Through those examples, Lewis could no longer stand idly \nby while others suffered for his sake. He was motivated to become an \nactive participant in these historical events. From organizing peaceful \ndemonstrations, to riding in the fronts of buses, Lewis was a key \nleader and played a dynamic role in the civil rights movement.\n  From 1963-1966 Lewis served as chairman of the Student Nonviolent \nCoordinating Committee. In 1963 Lewis was named one of the Big Six \nCivil Rights leaders along with Martin Luther King Jr., James Farmer, \nRoy Wilkins, Whitney Young, and A. Phillip Randolph.\n  In August 1963, John Lewis was a keynote speaker at the momentous \nMarch on Washington where Martin Luther King, Jr. gave his ``I Have a \nDream'' speech. On March 7, 1965, Lewis helped the now pivotal voting \nrights march from Selma to Montgomery, AL. Sustaining physical injuries \nfor the principles he believed in, John Lewis remained steadfast in his \ncommitment to promoting human rights in the United States. The violent \nreactions by Alabama state troopers that day sparked an outcry and\n\n[[Page S6748]]\n\neventually served to facilitate passage of the Voting Rights Act of \n1965.\n  Mr. President, as a congressman, statesman, humanitarian, the Nation \nhas benefited greatly from the lifelong contributions of John Lewis. I \nam proud to introduce legislation honoring John Lewis.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1258\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. JOHN LEWIS CIVIL RIGHTS INSTITUTE.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The building located at 493 Auburn \n     Avenue, N.E., in Atlanta, Georgia, shall be known and \n     designated as the ``John Lewis Civil Rights Institute''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     building referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be \n     a reference to the John Lewis Civil Rights Institute.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER:\n  S. 1261. A bill to simplify access to financial aid and access to \ninformation on college costs, to provide for more learning and less \nreporting, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in case the President may be wondering, \nand I asked consent about this, these are 7,000 regulations. We have \n6,000 autonomous institutions of higher education in the United States, \ncolleges and universities.\n  The Presiding Officer comes from the State that has some of the \nfinest colleges and universities anywhere in America. I will not begin \nto name them because there are so many of them I might leave one out. \nEvery single college or university, public or private, in North \nCarolina, Tennessee, or Colorado which has students with Federal grants \nor loans gets all of these boxes this year. These are the Federal \nregulations under title IV of the Higher Education Act that somebody at \nthe smallest college or the biggest university must wade through in \norder to help students have Federal grants and Federal loans. The \nFederal grant and Federal loans are one of the great success stories of \nthe United States of America. I will talk more about that.\n  Mr. President, 60 percent of our college students and university \nstudents at those 6,000 public and private and profit and nonprofit \ninstitutes of higher education, 60 percent of them have a Federal grant \nor loan to help pay for college. That has increased over the last 4 or \n5 years about 10 times faster--9 times faster--than State funding for \nhigher education.\n  But my goal today, in my remarks and in the bill I am introducing, is \nto make it easier for boys and girls and men and women who attend our \ncolleges and universities--and many of them are mature, older \nstudents--to make it easier for them to go through these documents. And \nthen, on the other hand, to make it easier for our colleges and \nuniversities to comply with all these rules and regulations. I would \nlike for them to be spending their time and their money helping our \nstudents learn instead of spending their time and their money reporting \nto us what they are doing.\n  That is the purpose of what I want to do today. I am introducing the \nHigher Education Simplification and Deregulation Act of 2005, a bill \nthat does what I just described. It will help students get access to \navailable financial resources. Second, it will reduce the burden on \ncolleges and universities imposed by Federal regulations so they can \ndevote more of their time doing what they are meant to do: provide the \nhighest quality postsecondary education in the world. And third, it \nwill ensure that the autonomy and independence of our 6,000 \ninstitutions of higher education are preserved.\n  I am delighted I am able to interrupt the energy debate to talk about \nhigher education because I think while it sounds like we are shifting \ngears, they really go together. If I am looking at our country today, \nand I had to take an exam this minute about the two greatest issues \nfacing the United States of America, I would say, No. 1, terrorism, \nand, No. 2, competitiveness. ``Competitiveness'' a big word, meaning: \nHow are we going to keep our jobs? How are we going to keep our \nstandard of living in this country when we have 5 or 6 percent of the \npeople in the world, and yet we produce a third of all the money, \nconsume 25 percent of all the energy? And China and India and Singapore \nand Malaysia, not to mention Japan and Europe, are saying: Wait a \nminute. Our brains are as good as those American brains. A lot of our \nstudents have been going to the United States, creating jobs for those \nAmericans. In fact, 572,000 foreign students are in this country today, \nbasically improving our standard of living by their work here.\n  So we are in a very competitive time. Just as we have been saying in \nenergy, here comes China, here comes Malaysia, here comes India buying \nup the oil reserves, driving up the price. Here comes Germany and other \nparts of the world with lower natural gas prices than we have. And our \njobs are going toward them.\n  The other thing we could do to ensure our good jobs and to keep our \nhigher standard of living is to focus on our brainpower. The great \nadvantages the United States of America has had since World War II have \nbeen our low cost, reliable supply and access to energy, our science \nand technology edge, and our educational institutions. There are so \nmany examples of that.\n  Mrs. Kay Bailey Hutchison, the senior Senator from Texas, and our \nmajority leader, Senator Bill Frist, had a little session in the \nleader's office last year. They invited the former Brazilian President \nFernando Henrique Cardoso. He was concluding his residency at the \nLibrary of Congress. I remember after he had said what he had to say, \nwe asked our questions.\n  Senator Hutchison asked of President Cardoso: Mr. President, what is \nthe one thing you are going to remember about the United States from \nyour stay here at the Library of Congress that you will take with you \nback to your country of Brazil? Without a moment's hesitation, he said: \nThe American university, the greatness and the autonomy of the American \nuniversity.\n  I will tell you another story. A few years ago, I was asked to be the \npresident of the University of Tennessee. It was 1988. I was glad to do \nit. I had been chairman of the board of the university for 8 years as \nGovernor, and I appointed a lot of the trustees, but I was not a \nskilled university president. So I sought out David Gardner, the \npresident of the University of California, which I regard, with all \nrespect to North Carolina, at least at that time, to be the outstanding \npublic university in America and perhaps one of the best in the world.\n  I said to David Gardner: Why is the University of California so good? \nWithout a moment's hesitation, he said: First, autonomy. When \nCalifornia created the university--they created four branches of \ngovernment, really: legislative, executive, judicial, and then the \nUniversity of California. He said: Fundamentally, they give us the \nmoney, and then our board and we decide how to spend it. Our autonomy \nhas permitted us to do the second thing, set very high standards. And \nthen he said the third thing was the large amount of Federal dollars \nthat follows students to the educational institution of their choice.\n  So autonomy, excellence, and choice--Federal dollars following \nstudents to the schools of their choice. That is how David Gardner \nexplained the California model for excellence in higher education.\n  That model has worked for our country since the GI bill for veterans \nwas enacted in 1944. I have wondered many times how we were fortunate \nenough to have decided to do it in the way they did it. This was for \nthe veterans. It was the end of World War II. There were college \npresidents who were very upset about the idea of giving the veterans \nmoney and just telling them to go wherever they wanted to go to \ncollege.\n  The president of the University of Chicago said it would make the \nUniversity of Chicago a hobo's jungle. But we know what it did. We had \nveterans coming back and taking their GI bill. Many of them took it to \nCatholic high schools and other high schools because they had not \nfinished high school. But they went wherever they wanted, to any \naccredited institution. They went to Yeshiva. They went to Vanderbilt. \nThey went to the historically Black colleges and universities across \nAmerica--Harvard. It did not matter. If it was accredited, they chose \nthe institution.\n\n[[Page S6749]]\n\n  The same formula was applied when the Pell grants were created by \nthis Congress in honor of Senator Pell, who was a former Member of this \nbody; as is true with Senator Stafford and the Stafford loans. Instead \nof giving those grants and loans to the University of North Carolina \nand the University of Tennessee, they went to the student. The student \nthen said: Well, I will decide where I want to go. I may want to go to \nRhodes College, or I may want to go to Lenore Rhyne or I may want to go \nto the University of Florida or Yeshiva or Howard. They go where they \nwant to go.\n\n  Because of that, we now have 6,000 autonomous institutions around the \ncountry. Many of them are nonprofit. Many of them are for profit. \nEighty percent of our students go to public institutions, but 20 \npercent go to private institutions. Because it is a marketplace of \n6,000 institutions, and some are, of course, better than others, \nbecause it is a marketplace, we have been able to adapt to a changing \nworld that now has different subjects, different standards, a more \nglobal environment, and students who are, by and large, much older and \nhave different needs than they did before.\n  If we had not had that kind of marketplace of colleges and \nuniversities, we would be stuck in the mud, and we would not have \nformer President Cardoso of Brazil talking so well about our colleges \nand universities.\n  We do not just have some of the best colleges and universities in the \nworld; we have almost all of them. And the rest of the world knows \nthat. We do not have 572,000 foreign students studying in our country \nthis year because we made them come, or even because we give them \nscholarships. They pay to come for the most part. They are the \nbrightest students in most of these countries. And 60 percent of our \npostdoctoral students are from overseas. Half our students in computer \nand engineering graduate programs are from overseas. They are here for \nthat reason. So we attract these students. The Federal Government has \ncontinued to be generous.\n  So there are two things I am introducing today with this bill. Number \none, this legislation would simplify the financial aid process and \nexpand access for students. We do it in these ways: (a) streamline the \nforms for Federal grants and loans, making access to student financial \naid easier; (b) provide students who want to expedite their education \nand study year-round the Federal support to do so; (c) provide students \nwith financial information about colleges and universities in a clear \nand concise manner that does not require additional reporting from \ninstitutions.\n  The second purpose of the bill is to protect that autonomy, that one \nword, that independence, that autonomy of these 6,000 institutions. \nThat is, in my view, a critical element of why we have the best \ncolleges and universities in the world.\n  What I mean by that is we did not order them to be good from \nWashington. That is not how they got to be great. They were autonomous \nand independent. We allowed them to be, and then we gave them students, \nfollowed by money, who created a competitive marketplace. And they \nbecame the best in the world.\n  So this legislation eliminates, streamlines, and evaluates \nregulations currently imposed on institutions of higher education with \nthe goal of lessening the burden on schools. That way, universities can \nfocus more on teaching and researching and less on maintaining \nreporting requirements for the Federal Government.\n  The bill, No. 1, appoints an expert panel to review Department of \nEducation regulations and to recommend how those regulations might be \nstreamlined or eliminated. Two, it accelerates the ``negotiated \nrulemaking process'' whereby universities negotiate new rules with the \nDepartment so that an end result can be reached without costly delays. \nAnd three, it develops a compliance calendar so that universities know \nwhat requirements they have to meet and when they to have meet them.\n  What I mean by that is, it will be up to us in the Federal Government \nto send to the University of North Carolina or Maryville College in \nTennessee a list of the rules they have to comply with so they don't \nhave to hire a whole team of people to try to wade through and read \neverything.\n  This is just one title of the Higher Education Act. It has several \ntitles. So a compliance calendar would help deregulate.\n  These changes build on the successful model for American higher \neducation. By making the financial aid process more user friendly and \nmore accessible, more students will have Federal funds following them \nto the college or university of their choice. And by relieving some of \nthe Federal regulatory burden, we are restoring university autonomy so \nthey can spend more time teaching and researching and less time filling \nout paperwork.\n  I have two major purposes. The first is to simplify and expand access \nto financial aid, to make it easier for the 60 percent of our college \nstudents who fill out a form to get a Federal grant or loan; and \nsecond, to reduce the burdensome paperwork on the colleges and \nuniversities.\n  In terms of simplifying access, we need to remember that the faces \nand needs of our college students have changed. More typically these \ndays, when I go to a graduation--this has been true for a number of \nyears--the cry you hear from the audience is: Way to go, mom. It is the \nmom who is getting her degree, or the dad, going back to school, \ncollege, community college, trade school, university to get the skills \nthey need to get a better job or another job in a rapidly changing \nworld.\n  In 1970, we had 7.4 million students, 28 percent of whom were \nenrolled part time and 38 percent at two-year colleges. Only 28 percent \nwere 25 or older. By 1999, enrollment had grown to 12.7 million, a 7.2-\npercent increase with 39 percent enrolled part time and 44 percent in \ntwo-year colleges. Nearly half our students in 1999 were in two-year \ncolleges. Our financial aid system needs to catch up.\n  The first thing we can do is to simplify what we call the Free \nApplication Federal Student Aid. As one might expect, it is known \naround here as FAFSA. Imagine that. You go out and try to talk to a \nfamily of someone who might be going to college for the first time and \nthat family says let me talk to you about FAFSA.\n  I think we ought to change the name. I think we ought to make it easy \nfor people to understand what we are talking about. I recently met a \nchief financial officer of a company who said she found the form \nchallenging when helping her high school daughter fill out a form for \nfinancial aid. I can only imagine the challenge to a high school \nstudent, or a working mother, when trying to answer over 100 confusing \nquestions, the vast majority of which are only applicable for the State \nof California.\n  So a second thing we can do is make sure students can use the Federal \naid for education they need year round. Flexibility for year-round Pell \ngrants is a part of this legislation so students can have the \nflexibility they need to go and continue their education in the summer. \nThere is a disincentive for that. Not only is that inconvenient for \nstudents and working students, it tends to encourage institutions to \nwaste the resources in the summertime, which they should be putting to \nbetter use.\n  The third thing we can do is make sure there is more information. \nThat is why I suggest the ``best buy'' list--a list of the 100 schools \nwith the lowest tuition and required fees, with the greatest \navailability of scholarships and grants. In other words, this would \nhelp parents and students decide where they could get the biggest bang \nfor their buck.\n  Many of the ideas that are in our legislation came from the Advisory \nCommittee on Student Financial Assistance. Senator Gregg, when he was \nchairman, and I invited them to work on this. They did a terrific job \nand they came up with 10 recommendations, 8 of which are in this bill, \nand I believe they have no cost to the budget.\n  The other area and my final comments have to do with the other side \nof the ledger. While we are making it easier for students to have \naccess to financial aid, we should work to relieve the regulatory \nburden on colleges and universities represented by these boxes of 7,000 \nregulations that contain all the forms any college or university in \nFlorida or Tennessee or North Carolina would receive this year to fill \nout. Thanks to the last two rounds of reauthorizing the Higher \nEducation Act,\n\n[[Page S6750]]\n\nthere are today more than 7,000 regulations associated with the title \nIV student aid program. With the exception of the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, every Federal \nagency is involved in regulating some aspect of higher education. That \nis incredible and it is absolutely ridiculous.\n  In 1997, Gerhard Casper, the president of Stanford University, said \nStanford spends 7 cents out of every tuition dollar on compliance with \nGovernment regulations. This has only gotten worse in the last 9 years. \nWe need to ease the burden. For example, under the Higher Education \nAct, universities are required to report how many full-time employees \nhave dental insurance, whether the university is a member of a national \nathletic association, and the number of meals that are in a ``board'' \ncharge. Colleges are required to hand every student a paper in-State \nvoter registration form and cannot use modern technology such as Web \nregistrations, which would actually reach more students. We are giving \nuniversity staff busy work to do when they ought to be helping \nstudents.\n  Here is another example. When a major chemical company such as DuPont \nproduces 55-gallon containers of a potentially hazardous waste, we \nrequire Dupont to report on how all that waste is disposed and ensure \nthat it is done in a certain manner. This is a good regulation and \nidea. Right now, we are applying the same regulation and paperwork to a \nchemistry class at a college that might produce half a test tube of the \nsame substance.\n  Mr. President, I don't know about the presiding officer, the Senator \nfrom Florida, and I now see the Senator from Virginia; I suspect that \nwhen we all go back to our States and speak to our Lincoln Day dinners, \nor when the Democrats go to the Jefferson Day dinners, we all say the \nthing we need to do once we pass these laws is to have more oversight \nand ease the burden of regulation. When I say that, I get a big round \nof applause, because at home people don't think we get any smarter when \nwe fly to Washington, DC, each week. They think it would be absurd to \nknow there are 7,000 regulations governing college grants and loans, \nand that Stanford University spends 7 cents out of--and this is a \nprivate university--every tuition dollar paying for the cost of \nGovernment regulations.\n\n  One reason we have an increased interest in regulating is because \nthere are a great many Members of Congress, as well as people in the \ncountry, who worry about rising tuition costs. I worry about those, \ntoo. When I was Governor of Tennessee, we used to have a deal with the \nstudents. The State will pay 70 percent of the cost, and you pay 30 \npercent, and if we raise your tuition, we will raise the State \ncontribution. That has changed, I am afraid, and I think it is \nimportant for us to know that. Tuition is not going up because the \nFederal Government is failing to do its job. Over the last 4 years, \nPell grants, work-study, scholarships all gone up about 30 percent. At \nthe same time, over the last 4 years, State spending for higher \neducation is up 3.6 percent. I will say that again. This is according \nto various educational institutions, including the Center for Study of \nEducation Policy, Illinois State University. In fiscal year 2001, there \nwas a 3.4 percent increase in State funding for higher education. In \n2002, there was a 1.2-percent decrease; in the next year, a 2.4-percent \ndecrease. This is State funding for higher education. Last year, there \nwas a 3.8-percent increase--3.6 over the 4 years.\n  So what our colleges and universities are feeling, and what our \nstudents are feeling, is decreased State support for higher education. \nOne reason they are feeling that is because we have not given States \nthe tools to control the growth in Medicaid spending. So in Tennessee, \nFlorida, Virginia, and North Carolina, our colleges and universities \nare hurting because the Governors and legislatures are spending the \ndollars that ought to be going for excellence in universities. They are \nspending it on huge increases in Medicaid costs. That is part of our \nresponsibility, too.\n  So I come to the floor today to introduce the Higher Education \nSimplification and Deregulation Act of 2005. I invite my colleagues to \njoin me in it. We will be marking up a Higher Education Authorization \nAct next month. It affects 60 percent of the college students in the \nUnited States. I am sure we are going to continue to fund those grants \nand loans, as we have from here, but we also need to do two other \nthings. One of them is in here, and that is not to get busy regulating \nmore colleges and universities. We should be deregulating. The other \nthing we should do, which is not a part of this bill, is to keep our \ncommitment to the Governors that, by about the fall of this year, we \nshould give them the legislative tools they need--and I believe also \nrelief from Federal court consent decrees, which are outdated--so they \ncan manage the growth of Medicaid spending, so that in turn we can \ncontinue to support higher education.\n  Our energy bill and our higher education bill are at the forefront of \nour policies to keep our jobs and our competitiveness.\n  Here's one more example: If you grab a pint bottle of rubbing alcohol \nfrom your bathroom and take it to a university laboratory, it will \nimmediately fall under the regulation and scrutiny of six different \nregulatory agencies:\n  (1) the air quality management district,\n  (2) the sewer district,\n  (3) OSHA,\n  (4) the local fire department,\n  (5) the county environmental health department, and\n  (6) the state hazardous waste agency.\n  While all of these are not directly governed by federal regulations, \nmany are responding to them, and we should do our part to reduce this \ntype of burden. In one instance, a prestigious institution in the \nMidwest was visited by the EPA and a bottle of dishwashing soap was \nfound in a lab near a sink. The institution was fined for improper \nmanagement of hazardous waste because the label was not still attached \nto the bottle. Even worse, the institution had to pay to have the soap \nanalyzed to document that it was not hazardous.\n  Colleges are in the business of teaching students, not sending \nmeaningless paperwork to the federal government. To fix this problem, \nmy legislation would establish an expert panel to review federal \nregulations applicable to colleges and universities and make \nrecommendations to the Secretary of Education and the Congress on how \nsome of these regulations could be streamlined or eliminated. The bill \nalso would assist institutions in complying with all these requirements \nby requiring the Department to develop a compliance calendar outlining \nspecific deadlines for paperwork submissions.\n  In those cases where there is already clarity about how to deal with \nregulations, the bill takes action. The bill will accelerate the \n``negotiated rulemaking process,'' a process whereby university \nrepresentatives negotiate new regulations with the Department. Today \nthis process can drag on for years, imposing unnecessary costs along \nthe way due to uncertainty over a final outcome for the rule. Under my \nbill, that process would have a one year deadline. To give schools a \nchance to adjust to newly agreed regulations, institutions of higher \neducation would be provided with a minimum of at least 270 days between \nthe publication of any final regulations or guidance and the initiation \nof data collection related to new disclosure requirements.\n  The bill also reinstates provisions to allow schools with a low \n``cohort default rate,'' meaning that less than 10 percent of their \nstudents fail to pay all their loans back on time, the option of \ndistributing loan money to students right at the beginning of the year \nrather than waiting a month or spacing the money out over the period of \na year. This is important since students incur many expenses up front \nduring their education and need the flexibility to pay for fees, books, \nand other costs.\n  Mr. President, since the end of World War II, our system of higher \neducation has been unmatched around the globe. According to the \nInstitute of Higher Education at Shanghai University, more than half \nthe world's top 100 universities are in the United States.\n  But our lead is slipping. During a trip to Europe, I discovered that \nChancellor Schroeder of Germany is putting a strong emphasis on \nreforming his country's university system to mirror--and perhaps even \neclipse--our own. British prime minister Tony Blair is overhauling his \nnation's system because he sees a growing gap between the quality\n\n[[Page S6751]]\n\nof American and British universities. Authorities in India and \nespecially China are working harder than ever to improve the quality of \neducation in their own countries and keep their brightest minds from \nleaving their countries. Australia and Canada are making strides as \nwell. And, for the first time, we have witnessed a decline in graduate \nstudent enrollment. The Council on Graduate Schools estimated that \nforeign applications to graduate programs in the U.S. were down this \nyear by five percent.\n  This greater competition means that not only do we find it harder \nthan ever to attract foreign students, but our graduates will find it \nharder to compete for top-paying jobs in the global economy since they \nwill be competing against talented, well-educated individuals from \naround the world.\n  Now is the time to fine-tune our own system of higher education and \nrestore its greatest strengths: generous financial assistance for \nstudents, autonomy, and high standards. Generous support is most \neffective when students can access it with a minimum of hassle and with \nmaximum flexibility to apply it to their accredited program. Freedom \nfrom over-regulation or control by government allows colleges and \nuniversities to quickly adjust to the needs of their students and focus \non teaching and research. High standards are the natural result of a \ncompetitive system where schools compete among each other for dollars \nand students.\n  My bill restores the pillars of our higher education system and gives \nus the ability to move forward with confidence in the twenty-first \ncentury. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a summary of the Higher Education Simplification and \nDeregulation Act of 2005.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Higher Education Simplification and Deregulation Act of 2005\n\n       There are 6,000 autonomous institutions of higher education \n     nationwide, and it is the autonomy and independence that our \n     universities possess that makes our system of higher \n     education the best in the world. While the federal government \n     partners with American students, families and institutions to \n     make a college education accessible, increased regulations on \n     these same entities threatens this remarkably successful \n     relationship. Countries around the world look to our higher \n     education system and are trying to emulate it. The Higher \n     Education Simplification and Deregulation Act of 2005 (the \n     Act) takes steps to reduce bureaucratic red tape, increase \n     autonomy and allow the U.S. to continue to be the best in the \n     world. As we reauthorize The Higher Education Act over the \n     next five years, our goal should be to make college more \n     accessible and not restrict that autonomy.\n\n\n   Simplify: Access to Financial Aid and Information on College Costs\n\n       (1) Simplify the Free Application for Federal Student Aid \n     (FAFSA)\n       Implement the majority of recommendations from the Advisory \n     Committee on Student Financial Assistance on simplification \n     of the FAFSA form including improved transparency, \n     verification of need and earlier notification of financial \n     aid eligibility. There is no cost associated with \n     implementing these recommendations.\n       (2) Year-Round Pell Grants and Flexible Loans for Year \n     Round Study\n       Authorize year-round Pell grants for both 2 and 4 year \n     institutions. This will help working students and older \n     adults who need increased flexibility and year round \n     financial aid.\n       Increase annual loan limits for greater funding flexibility \n     for students attending college for more than two academic \n     semesters.\n       (3) Secretary's list on College ``BEST BUYS''\n       Secretary will publish existing institutional data in a \n     user friendly way.\n       Best Buy List of ``the top 100'' will help students \n     decipher institutional expenses and financial aid.\n       Each year the Secretary shall publish a list of \n     institutions of higher education, by all nine sectors, that \n     identifies:\n       (a) The 100 schools with the lowest tuition and required \n     fees;\n       (b) The 100 schools with the lowest cost of attendance;\n       (c) The 100 schools with the largest percentage of incoming \n     full-time students who receive financial aid;\n       (d) The 100 schools with the largest average amount of \n     incoming full-time student financial aid on a per student \n     basis;\n       (e) The 100 schools with the largest percentage of students \n     who receive institutional grants and scholarships;\n       (f) The 100 schools with the slowest increase in tuition \n     and fees during the preceding 5 years; and\n       (g) The 100 schools with the slowest increase in total cost \n     of attendance during the preceding 5 years.\n       (4) Make the Department of Education's Graduate Programs' \n     Need Analysis consistent with other federal graduate \n     programs.\n       All graduate and professional students are, by definition, \n     independent students and therefore highly likely to have \n     financial need. The federal need analysis requirement in \n     Jacob K. Javits fellowship and Graduate Assistance in Areas \n     of National Need (GAANN) programs often causes lengthy delays \n     in processing grant applications. Instead of yielding helpful \n     distinctions among the applicant pool, the requisite \n     utilization of the federal needs analysis methodology creates \n     massive amounts of paperwork for students, institutions, and \n     the Department of Education. Comparable graduate fellowship \n     programs, such as the Title VI Foreign Language and Area \n     Studies program, and similar training and fellowship programs \n     at National Institutes of Health, National Science \n     Foundation, and the Department of Defense contain no such \n     requirement. Therefore, Javits and GAANN will not be subject \n     to federal needs analysis.\n\n\n                     More Learning, Less Reporting\n\n       Institutions of higher education are among the most \n     regulated entities in the United States.\n       With the exception of the Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, all federal \n     agencies are involved in regulating some aspect of higher \n     education.\n       In addition, there are more than 7,000 regulations \n     associated with Title IV student aid programs alone.\n       Seven cents of every tuition dollar is spent on government \n     regulations (Stanford University, 1997)\n       There are lots of regulators of higher education and even \n     more regulations issued by the Department.\n       (1) Appoint an Expert Panel to Review and Streamline \n     Department of Education Regulations\n       Panels, appointed by the Secretary, will review regulations \n     on financial aid, institutional eligibility, regulations \n     unrelated to the delivery of student aid and dissemination of \n     information requirements. The panel would then make \n     recommendations to the Secretary and the appropriate \n     Congressional committees on streamlining and eliminating \n     these regulations.\n       (2) One Size Does Not Fit All for Industry and Academic \n     Regulations\n       Fund a project by the National Research Council to develop \n     standards in environmental, health and safety areas to \n     provide for differential regulation of industrial facilities, \n     on the one hand, and research and teaching laboratories and \n     facilities on the other. The report will make specific \n     recommendations for statutory and regulatory changes that are \n     needed to develop such a differential approach.\n       (3) Accelerate Negotiated Rulemaking Process\n       The process, while somewhat successful, is costly, and \n     significantly delays implementation of regulations. This \n     process should be streamlined. This bill gives the Secretary \n     of Education the authority to engage in negotiated \n     rulemaking, but she is not required to do so if she decides \n     the process is too cumbersome or inefficient.\n       (4) Develop a Compliance Calendar\n       For financial aid programs alone, institutions must comply \n     with over 7,000 pages of regulations.\n       Each year, the Secretary will be required to provide \n     eligible institutions a list of the reporting and disclosure \n     requirements under the Higher Education Act to assist \n     institutions in complying with these requirements.\n       The list will include: (1) the date each report is required \n     to be completed and to be submitted, made available, or \n     disseminated; (2) the required recipients of each report, \n     including reports that must be kept on file for inspection \n     upon request; (3) any required method for transmittal or \n     dissemination; (4) a description of the content of each \n     report sufficient to allow the institution to identify the \n     appropriate individuals to be assigned the responsibility for \n     its preparation; (5) references to the statutory authority, \n     applicable regulations, and current guidance issued by the \n     Secretary regarding each report; and (6) any other \n     information which is pertinent to the content or distribution \n     of the report or disclosure.\n       (5) Reinstate two expiring provisions on disbursement of \n     student loans.\n       The first provision allows schools with cohort default \n     rates below 10 percent to disburse a loan in a single \n     installment rather than in multiple disbursements over the \n     year.\n       The second lets schools with low cohort default rates waive \n     the requirement that loan proceeds of a first-year, first-\n     time borrower loan be withheld for thirty days so that these \n     students can purchase books and supplies, pay housing costs, \n     and meet other expenses.\n       (6) Voter Registration Dissemination.\n       This bill clarifies that institutions can use electronic \n     means to meet the requirement to disseminate voter \n     registration forms to students. Electronic means will ensure \n     that dissemination to students occurs both effectively and \n     efficiently.\n\n\n   Eliminate or Alter the following Reporting Requirements in the HEA\n\n       (1) Application of Change of Ownership to non-profit \n     institutions\n\n[[Page S6752]]\n\n       The Department of Education applies provisions concerning \n     change of institutional ownership to nonprofit institutions, \n     despite clear expression of contrary congressional intent and \n     the common understanding that nonprofit institutions do not \n     have owners. This places unnecessary burdens on institutions, \n     and may act as a deterrent to governance changes intended to \n     make institutions more efficient and effective.\n       (2) Disclosure of Foreign Gifts\n       When an institution receives a foreign gift in excess of \n     $250,000 they must report it to the federal government. This \n     data is publicly available in the annual reports prepared by \n     every college and university and is carefully monitored for \n     public institutions by state governments. The Department of \n     Education reports that it never gets public requests for this \n     information. Institutions will no longer be required to \n     provide this information to the federal government, but make \n     it publicly available on an annual basis.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Martinez, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Talent, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Thune, and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 1262. A bill to reduce healthcare costs, improve efficiency, and \nimprove healthcare quality through the development of a nation-wide \ninteroperable health information technology system, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this morning I am pleased to be joined on \nthe floor by my distinguished colleague from the State of New York. \nTogether we share an important goal to improve health care quality and \nreduce costs through the use of health information technology tools.\n  I had the wonderful opportunity of spending 20 years as a physician \nand as a heart surgeon before coming to this body. Like most \nphysicians, I wanted to and, in fact, did use the very latest, most \nadvanced technology, anything that could possibly, in my practice, make \nmy patients live a healthier life, a better life, a more comfortable \nlife.\n  But amidst the artificial heart assist devices, the lasers that are \nused to remove lesions in the windpipe or the trachea, CT scan \nmachines, x-rays, digital x-rays, digital thermometers, doctors today, \nunfortunately, for the most part, keep patient records the very same \nway I did 10 years ago and, indeed, almost exactly as my dad did 60 \nyears ago as he practiced medicine, and that is handwritten on paper in \nmanila folders, typically stored in the basements of clinics or \ndoctors' offices or hospitals.\n  It is amazing because we design hospitals, structures on computers \ntoday, we conduct medical research with computers, we use computers in \nnearly every aspect of the clinical setting, the delivery of medicine. \nFrom very compact bedside monitors to these massive MRI scanners we \nhave today, computers power almost everything we use, everything we do \nin terms of diagnosis in medicine, in health care.\n  But--and this is what we have come to the floor to address--when it \ncomes to health information, when it comes to electronic medical \nrecords, we are in the stone age and not the information age.\n  Imagine a traveler far away from home who gets in an automobile \naccident and is taken unconscious or confused to a hospital. Paramedics \nrush them to a hospital, and at the very moment that individual arrives \nat the door of that emergency room, the emergency room physician meets \nthem, but emptyhanded, with no notification of allergies or past \nmedical history or preexisting illnesses, all of which is potentially \nlifesaving information. That is inexcusable in this day and age.\n  My colleague from New York knows this all too well.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to \nSenator Frist for his leadership on this issue because we certainly do \nneed to bring our health care system out of the information dark ages. \nI am pleased to be introducing this legislation today with the majority \nleader. It is a priority for both of us, and I look forward to \ncontinuing our partnership to move this legislation through the \nlegislative process.\n  For several years, I have been promoting the adoption of health \ninformation technology as a means to improve our health care system and \nbring it into the 21st century. I introduced health quality and \ninformation technology legislation in 2003 to jump-start the \nconversation on health IT. I am very pleased that I have had the \nopportunity now to work with the majority leader for more than a year \non realizing what we believe would work, that would enable patients, \nphysicians, nurses, hospitals--all--to have access electronically in a \nprivacy-protected way to health information.\n  We have a lot of challenges facing us in health care. We have a long \nway to go to achieve the goal of expanding access to quality, \naffordable health care for all Americans. But creating a health \ninformation technology infrastructure needs to be a key part of \nachieving our health care goals because we are facing an escalating \nhealth care crisis.\n  Information technology has radically changed business and other \naspects of our lives. It is time to use it to bring our health sector \ninto the information age.\n  Currently, the health industry spends 2 to 3 percent of its revenues \non information technology, compared to roughly 12 percent in industries \nsuch as finance or banking. That is why you can go to an ATM virtually \nanywhere in the world and access money from your bank account.\n  But despite evidence that greater investments could yield returns, we \nhave not put in place the necessary infrastructure to facilitate the \nnecessary investment in an interoperable health information technology \nand quality infrastructure.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this needs to change and it must change. We \nmust establish an interoperable privacy-protected electronic medical \nrecord for every American who wants one. Working together, our Nation \ncan confront these challenges, and we can build an interoperable \nnational health information technology system. We know it will save \nlives. We know it will save money. It will improve quality and it will \nlead to huge measurable progress in the medical field, in the health \nfield.\n  We face enormous problems as a result of the underinvestment in \nhealth information technology. No industry as important to our economy \nas health spends as little on information technology. Our Nation has \nnearly 900,000 doctors and over 2.8 million nurses. Americans visit a \ndoctor 900 million times per year. We have nearly 6,000 hospitals all \nover the country. Our health care system is enormous, yes, but it is \ndangerously fragmented. Even a small efficiency improvement can greatly \nreduce cost and improve quality, and there is plenty of room for \nimprovement.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I could not agree more. The majority \nleader comes to this debate with a lifetime of experience and \nexpertise. Researchers at Dartmouth University found that we waste as \nmuch as one-third of the $1.8 trillion we spend on health care on care \nthat is not necessary.\n  Doctors write over 2 billion prescriptions each year by hand. With \nall respect to my doctors, some are unclear or even illegible. \nHandwritten prescriptions filled incorrectly result in as many as 7,000 \ndeaths each year because we do not have access to a fail-safe system so \nthat providing the prescription electronically, which also would \ntrigger a response if it was interacting with another drug the patient \nwas taking, is not yet available.\n  With that data, it is difficult, sometimes even impossible, to track \nthe quality of care patients receive. We cannot reward good providers \nor work to improve those who provide inferior care.\n  Widening health care disparities really are a growing problem in our \nsociety. It is especially important because every moment that a doctor \nor a nurse spends with a patient is precious. For every hour that they \nspend with a patient, they spend one-half hour filling out those forms \nby hand. So we can save time, we can save money, and we can make it \nclear that this information will be easily electronically transportable \nwhere it is needed.\n  Mr. FRIST. The problem is enormous and the problem is real. So what \nare we going to do about it? Senator Clinton and I propose three \nconcrete steps to remedy these problems and establish a fully \ninteroperable information technology system. First, we must establish \nstandards for electronic medical records. Sharing data effectively \nrequires more than just that fiber optic\n\n[[Page S6753]]\n\ncable, more than those Internet connections. It requires standards and \nlaws that make it possible to exchange medical information in a \nprivacy-protected way throughout our Nation.\n  The Government should not impose these standards on the private \nsector, but it has a duty, and indeed it has an obligation, to lead the \nway. Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP, the Indian Health Service, and other \nFederal programs should lead the way and establish electronic health \nrecords for all of their clients.\n  The Veterans' Administration already leads the way with interoperable \nsystems, but we need to get the VA to be able to talk to the Department \nof Defense.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. That is absolutely the case, especially as we \ntragically know so many young people who have been injured in Iraq or \nAfghanistan move from the DOD to the VA. We have to have a better \nsystem so that they can know what needs to be done for these brave \nyoung men and women.\n  Secondly, we believe our legislation should work to reduce barriers \nand facilitate the electronic exchange of health information among \nproviders in a secure and private way to improve health care quality \nand meet community needs. When communities come together, as is \nbeginning to happen all over the country, the Federal Government should \nhelp them implement an interoperable health IT system.\n  Interoperable sounds like a confusing word, but it means they can \ntalk to each other, they can operate in the same overall system and do \nit in a way that complies with national standards. To speed up this \nprocess, we propose spending a total of $600 million--$125 million a \nyear, over 5 years--to begin the work of rolling out interoperable \nelectronic medical records systems around the Nation.\n  Finally, we must use the data we collect to focus intensely on \nimproving the quality of health care. Our medical system, which is, and \ndeserves to be, the envy of the world, still suffers from enormous and \nunpardonable disparities in the quality of care. Health IT will be a \ntool to help our dedicated health care professionals improve care, and \nefficiently, so that they spend more time at the bedside, more time at \nthe office visit, and less on paperwork.\n  Through this legislation, we will begin to collect consistent data on \nthe quality of health care delivered in America. As the largest health \ncare payer in the country, the Federal Government has a responsibility \nto begin that process of collecting data on its own health care \nprograms and share it with the public. Then, with this data, we can \nbegin to move to a health care system that actually rewards providers \nwho give their patients superior care.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as we talk about these systems and \nstandards and words such as interoperability, which, as the Senator \nfrom New York said, does mean being able to connect it all together, \npeople who are listening must ask: Well, how in the world do these \nelectronic health records and the appropriate use of that data bring \nconcrete benefits to them as individuals and to their families?\n  First, it will reduce waste and inefficiency in the system. It only \nmakes sense that fragmented systems, with no interconnectivity at all, \nhave inherent inefficiencies and waste. That is moved aside. That has a \nvery direct impact on lower costs, making health care more affordable \nand thus available for people broadly.\n  It improves quality. Right now we know that medical errors occur. Too \nmany medical errors occur in our health care system today. By the \napplication of technology, we can move those medical errors aside. They \nwill not occur and that improves quality.\n  They will empower patients. It gives that individual who is listening \nright now the knowledge and power to be able to participate in a \nconsumer-driven system where choices can be made, where the focus is on \nthe patient, that is provider friendly, that is driven by information \nand choice and empowerment to make that choice.\n  They will protect patient privacy and promote the secure exchange of \nlife-saving health information. It is spelled out in the legislation. \nIt is going to be privacy protected.\n  For the first time, they will seamlessly integrate this advancement \nin health information technology with quality measures, with quality \nadvancements, harmonizing and integrating them in a way that simply has \nnot been done in the past.\n  This proposal brings together people, as we can see, from across the \npolitical spectrum, and it will unlock the potential of medical \ninformation technology for all Americans.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I am delighted to be working on this very important \nnational initiative with the majority leader because we are at a \npivotal moment. Pockets of innovation and investment are developing all \nover the country. In my State, places like Rochester, NY, and in the \nmajority leader's State, the Tri-Cities region of Tennessee, health \ncare providers, employers and community groups are beginning the \nprocess of building a health information technology network. That is a \npositive first step, but it could be either a last step or a misstep \nbecause to truly achieve the promise of health information technology, \nwe must ensure that these efforts do not become silos. In other words, \nthere is one system for every hospital, one system for every clinical \npractice. They cannot talk to each other. So a person goes to one \ndoctor. Their doctor is in New York, but they travel to Tennessee to \nvisit friends, they are in an accident, and nobody knows how to get the \ninformation that will give them the best possible treatment.\n  So if we do this right, this comprehensive legislation will create a \nhealth information technology framework that improves quality, protects \npatient privacy and ensures interoperability through the adoption of \nhealth IT standards and quality measures.\n  We are marrying technology and quality to create a seamless, \nefficient health care system for the 21st century. I thank the majority \nleader, who has brought so much interest and expertise to this, for \nbeing a leader and making this happen in the next 18 months.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank my colleague in this endeavor. As mentioned \nearlier, we began working on the information technology aspects of \nhealth care about a year ago and published our first op-ed together \nabout July of last year.\n  In closing, this is not going to be an easy process. I look back at \nthe technology in my past in medicine for 20 years, but then also in my \ndad's practice; he practiced medicine for 55 years. I remember he had \none of the very earliest electrocardiogram, EKG, machines in the State \nof Tennessee. At that time--because there were so few machines and so \nfew cardiologists--he would take referrals from all over the State of \nTennessee. The machine itself was bigger than the desk before me, at \nthe time.\n  What would happen then is, if there was a machine in a little rural \ncommunity 100 miles away from Nashville, the machine there would take a \npiece of paper, they would run it through, they would send it by mail. \nIt would take 2 days to get to Nashville. Dad would read it and send it \nback. Four days later, that doctor would be able to read that EKG.\n  Then, when I was about 9 or 10 years of age--because their bedroom \nwas right around the corner from mine--I remember so well when he \ninstalled a telephone to put another big box there to have the first in \nTennessee again of a machine--and it was amazing at the time--one could \ntransmit these EKGs electronically over the telephone wire and have it \ninterpreted at the bedside. He would keep it there because people, of \ncourse, have heart attacks in the middle of the night. Then it would \ntake probably about 30 or 40 minutes to get the result back.\n  Of course, today we are at a point where with a little tiny machine, \nan EKG machine, we can get an instantaneous readout not just of the \npaper and of the EKG but the result actually read by the box.\n  I have been able to see huge progress in my own life and watching my \ndad's practice and my practice. Now we need to see all of that sort of \nprogress condensed, applied not just to the technology but to the \ncollection of information, the promotion of electronic health records, \nand the appropriate sharing of that information which is privacy \nprotected. That is the sort of progress we are going to see. We are \ngoing to see it come alive on the Senate floor and with the House and \nwork\n\n[[Page S6754]]\n\nin concert with the President of the United States to make sure that \nthe great advantages, in terms of lowering costs, getting rid of \ninefficiencies, and promoting quality will be realized.\n  The bill that we will shortly introduce does present a comprehensive \napproach of medical information and the use of medical information as \nwe address our health care challenges. It provides that important \nbackbone and critical building block for a better, a stronger, and a \nmore responsive health care system for all Americans.\n  Again, I thank my distinguished colleague from New York. We urge all \nof our colleagues to look at this bill and support this bill. With this \nlegislation, there is no doubt in my mind that we will, yes, help save \nmoney and help save time, but most importantly we will save lives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill we will shortly \nsend to the desk be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators Frist and \nClinton in introducing the Health Technology to Enhance Quality Act of \n2005.\n  Our national health care system is in crisis. Forty-five million \nAmericans are uninsured, and this number continues to rise. Health care \ncosts are increasing at almost double digit rates. Millions of \nAmericans are suffering, and dying, from diseases such as diabetes or \nAIDS that could have been prevented or delayed for many years. And the \nchance of Americans receiving the right care, at the right time and for \nthe right reason is no greater than the flip of a coin.\n  These health care issues are varied and complex, as are the \nsolutions. But, as one of my constituents advised, it is time for us in \nthe Congress to put on our hard hats, pick up our tool belts and get to \nwork fixing our broken health care system.\n  One place to start is by bringing the health care system into the \n21st century. In our lifetimes, we have seen some of the greatest \nadvances in the history of technology and the sharing of information. \nYet, in our health care system, too much care is still provided with a \npen and paper. Too much information about patients is not shared \nbetween doctors or readily available to them in the first place. And \nproviders too often do not have the information to know what care has \nworked most effectively and efficiently to make patients healthy.\n  Mistakes are easily made--medical errors alone kill up to 98,000 \npeople a year, more people than the number who die from AIDS each year.\n  But embracing 21st century technology is not just about reducing \nerrors and improving the quality of medical care. It is also about \ncost.\n  We spend nearly $1.5 trillion a year on health care in America. But a \nquarter of that money--one out of every four dollars--is spent on non-\nmedical costs--most of it on bills and paperwork. Every transaction you \nmake at a bank now costs them less than a penny. Yet, because we have \nnot updated technology in the rest of the health care industry, a \nsingle transaction still costs up to $25--not one dime of which goes \ntoward improving the quality of our health care.\n  The Health Technology to Enhance Quality Act of 2005 is going to help \nbring the health care system into the 21st century. This bill will lead \nto the development and implementation of health information technology \nstandards to ensure interoperability of health information systems. The \nlegislation codifies the Office of National Coordinator for Information \nTechnology and establishes standards for the electronic exchange of \nhealth information. The bill also provides grant funding to support \ndevelopment of health information technology infrastructure as well as \nmeasurement of the quality of care provided to patients.\n  This legislation will help our health care system take a huge step \nforward. A vote for the Health TEQ Act is a vote for health care that \nis safe, effective, and affordable. I urge my colleagues to join us in \npassing this bill quickly.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1262\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act to establish \neligibility requirements for business concerns to receive awards under \nthe Small Business Innovation Research Program; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the United States biotechnology industry is \nthe world leader in innovation. This is due, in large part, to the \nFederal Government's partnership with the private sector to foster \ngrowth and commercialization in the hope that one day we will uncover a \ncure for unmet medical needs such as cystic fibrosis, heart disease, \nvarious cancers, multiple sclerosis, and AIDS.\n  However, the industry was dealt a major setback last year when the \nSmall Business Administration--SBA--determined that venture-backed \nbiotechnology companies can no longer\n\n[[Page S6759]]\n\nparticipate in the Small Business Innovation Research--SBIR--program. \nPrior to the SBA's decision, the SBIR program was an example of a \nhighly successful Federal initiative to encourage economic growth and \ninnovation in the biotechnology industry by funding the critical \nstartup and development stages of a company.\n  Traditionally, to qualify for an SBIR grant a small business \napplicant had to meet two requirements: one, that the company have less \nthan 500 employees; and two, that the business be 51 percent owned by \none or more individuals. Now, according to the SBA, the term \n``individuals'' means natural persons only, whereas for the past 20 \nyears the term ``individual'' has included venture-capital companies. \nAs a result, biotech companies backed by venture-capital funding in \nMissouri and throughout our Nation, who are on the cutting edge of \nscience, can no longer participate in the program.\n  The biotech industry is like no other in the world because it takes \nsuch a long span of time and intense capital expenditures to bring a \nsuccessful product to market. In fact, according to a study completed \nby the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, it takes roughly \n10-15 years and $800 million for a company to bring just one product to \nmarket. As you can imagine, the industry's entrepreneurs are seeking \nfinancial assistance wherever they can find it.\n  For the past 20 years, the SBIR program has been a catalyst for \ndeveloping our Nation's most successful biotechnology companies. In \naddition to these important government grants, venture capital funding \nplays a vital role in the financial support of these same companies. \nThe strength of our biotechnology industry is a direct result of \ngovernment grants and venture capital working together.\n  However, some have argued that a biotech firm with a majority venture \ncapital backing is a large business. This is simply a bogus conclusion. \nVenture capital firms solely invest in biotech start-ups for the \npossibility of a future innovation and financial return and generally \ndo not seek to take control over the management functions or day-to-day \noperations of the company. Venture capital firms that seek to invest in \nsmall biotech businesses do not, simply by their investment, turn a \nsmall business into a large business. These are legitimate, small, \nstart-up businesses. Let's not punish them.\n  Instead, we must work together to avoid stifling innovation. Let me \nbe clear. Our impact today will foster cures and medicines tomorrow \nthat were once thought to be inconceivable. However, the industry \ncannot do it alone. We must nurture biotechnology and help the industry \ngrow for the future of our economy and for our well-being.\n  This bill that I am introducing today will do just that. It will \nensure that the biotechnology industry has access to SBIR grants, as it \nhas had for 20 years. It will level the playing field to ensure that \nSBIR grants are given to small businesses based on fruitful science and \nnothing else. This is still a young and fragile industry, and we are on \nthe cusp of great scientific advances.

A bill to provide for the provision by hospitals of \nemergency contraceptives to women, and post-exposure prophylaxis for \nsexually transmitted disease to individuals, who are survivors of \nsexual assault; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nCompassionate Assistance for Rape Emergencies Act. In the United \nStates, more than 300,000 women are raped each year and an estimated \n25,000 to 32,000 become pregnant as a result. That is why I am \nreintroducing the Compassionate Assistance\n\n[[Page S6760]]\n\nin Rape Emergencies Act, or CARE Act.\n  This bill will ensure that women who are survivors of sexual assault \nhave access to the medical care they need, including emergency \ncontraception. Emergency contraception reduces a woman's risk of \nbecoming pregnant by up to 89 percent when taken within 72 hours of the \nassault. I want to be clear: emergency contraception does not end a \npregnancy. Instead, emergency contraception works before a pregnancy \ncan occur.\n  There is widespread consensus in the medical community that emergency \ncontraception is safe and effective. Yet, New Jersey is one of only six \nStates that legally require all medical providers to offer this care to \nrape survivors. Before this law, one-third of New Jersey's hospitals \ndid not provide this vital medication. New Jersey's law should be the \nnational standard. The bill would require that all hospitals that \nreceive Federal funding offer information and access to emergency \ncontraception for victims of rape.\n  In January of this year I, along with 21 Senators, wrote a letter to \nthe Department of Justice asking that they include information about \nemergency contraception in their national protocol for sexual assault \nhospital examinations. But they did not. In all 141 pages, the protocol \nfails to provide sexual assault victims with access to this needed \ninformation and treatment. The protocol instead leaves the door open \nfor health care professionals to decide whether or not to discuss \ncertain treatment options. Today, I want to close that door.\n  In order to provide comprehensive medical care, hospitals must also \nprovide quick access to preventive medication that helps protect \nvictims of sexual assault from potentially fatal sexually transmitted \ndiseases, such as HIV and hepatitis B. We have an obligation to protect \nsexual assault victims from these life threatening infections.\n  We must not sit idly by while so many sexual assault survivors are \ndeprived the medical care they need and deserve. Once these survivors \nseek treatment we ought to make sure that they get the treatment they \nneed. Ideology should never stand between patients and the care they \ndeserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1264\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Compassionate Assistance for \n     Rape Emergencies Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) It is estimated that 25,000 to 32,000 women become \n     pregnant each year as a result of rape or incest. An \n     estimated 22,000 of these pregnancies could be prevented if \n     rape survivors had timely access to emergency contraception.\n       (2) A 1996 study of rape-related pregnancies (published in \n     the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology) found that \n     50 percent of the pregnancies described in paragraph (1) \n     ended in abortion.\n       (3) Surveys have shown that many hospitals do not routinely \n     provide emergency contraception to women seeking treatment \n     after being sexually assaulted.\n       (4) The risk of pregnancy after sexual assault has been \n     estimated to be 4.7 percent in survivors who were not \n     protected by some form of contraception at the time of the \n     attack.\n       (5) The Food and Drug Administration has declared emergency \n     contraception to be safe and effective in preventing \n     unintended pregnancy, reducing the risk by as much as 89 \n     percent if taken within days of unprotected intercourse and \n     up to 95 percent if taken in the first 24 hours.\n       (6) Medical research strongly indicates that the sooner \n     emergency contraception is administered, the greater the \n     likelihood of preventing unintended pregnancy.\n       (7) In light of the safety and effectiveness of emergency \n     contraceptive pills, both the American Medical Association \n     and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n     have endorsed more widespread availability of such pills.\n       (8) The American College of Emergency Physicians and the \n     American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists agree \n     that offering emergency contraception to female patients \n     after a sexual assault should be considered the standard of \n     care.\n       (9) Approximately 30 percent of American women of \n     reproductive age are unaware of the availability of emergency \n     contraception.\n       (10) New data from a survey of women having abortions \n     estimates that 51,000 abortions were prevented by use of \n     emergency contraception in 2000 and that increased use of \n     emergency contraception accounted for 43 percent of the \n     decrease in total abortions between 1994 and 2000.\n       (11) It is essential that all hospitals that provide \n     emergency medical treatment provide emergency contraception \n     as a treatment option to any woman who has been sexually \n     assaulted, so that she may prevent an unintended pregnancy.\n       (12) Victims of sexual assault are at increased risk of \n     contracting sexually transmitted diseases.\n       (13) Some sexually-transmitted infections cannot be \n     reliably cured if treatment is delayed, and may result in \n     high morbidity and mortality. HIV has killed over 520,000 \n     Americans, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     currently estimates that over 1,000,000 Americans are \n     infected with the virus. Even modern drug treatment has \n     failed to cure infected individuals. Nearly 80,000 Americans \n     are infected with hepatitis B each year, with some \n     individuals unable to fully recover. An estimated 1,250,000 \n     Americans remain chronically infected with the hepatitis B \n     virus and at present, one in five of these may expect to die \n     of liver failure.\n       (14) It is possible to prevent some sexually transmitted \n     diseases by treating an exposed individual promptly. The use \n     of post-exposure prophylaxis using antiretroviral drugs has \n     been demonstrated to effectively prevent the establishment of \n     HIV infection. Hepatitis B infection may also be eliminated \n     if an exposed individual receives prompt treatment.\n       (15) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \n     recommended risk evaluation and appropriate application of \n     post-exposure treatment for victims of sexual assault. For \n     such individuals, immediate treatment is the only means to \n     prevent a life threatening infection.\n       (16) It is essential that all hospitals that provide \n     emergency medical treatment provide assessment and treatment \n     of sexually-transmitted infections to minimize the harm to \n     victims of sexual assault.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to make grants and loans available to States and \nother organizations to strengthen the economy, public health, and \nenvironment of the United States by reducing emissions from diesel \nengines; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I speak as Chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate Change, and Nuclear \nSafety to introduce a landmark, bipartisan piece of legislation--the \nDiesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005.\n  This bill is cosponsored by Environment and Public Works Committee \nJim Inhofe and ranking member Jim Jeffords and Senators Tom Carper, \nJohnny Isakson, Hillary Clinton, Kay Bailey Hutchison, and Dianne \nFeinstein. Focused on improving air quality and protecting public \nhealth, it would establish voluntary national and state-level grant and \nloan programs to promote the reduction of diesel emissions. \nAdditionally, the bill would help areas come into attainment for the \nnew air quality standards.\n  Developed with environmental, industry, and public officials, the \nlegislation complements Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, \nregulations now being implemented that address diesel fuel and new \ndiesel engines. I am pleased to be joined by a strong and diverse group \nof organizations and officials: Environmental Defense; Clean Air Task \nForce; Union of Concerned Scientists; Ohio Environmental Council; \nCaterpillar Inc.; Cummins Inc.; Diesel Technology Forum; Emissions \nControl Technology Association; Associated General Contractors of \nAmerica; State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators/\nAssociation of Local Air Pollution Control Officials; Ohio \nEnvironmental Protection Agency; Regional Air Pollution Control Agency \nin Dayton, Ohio; Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission.\n  The cosponsors of this legislation and these groups do not agree on \nmany issues--which is why this bill is so special.\n  The process for developing this legislation began last year when \nseveral of these organizations came in to meet with me. They informed \nme of the harmful public health impact of diesel emissions. Onroad and \nnonroad diesel vehicles and engines account for roughly one-half of the \nnitrogen oxide and particulate matter mobile source emissions \nnationwide.\n  I was pleased to hear that the administration had taken strong action \nwith new diesel fuel and engine regulations, which were developed in a \ncollaborative effort to substantially reduce diesel emissions. However, \nI was told that the full health benefit would not be realized until \n2030 because these regulations address new engines and the estimated 11 \nmillion existing engines have a long life.\n  I was pleased that they had a constructive suggestion on how we could \naddress this problem. They informed me of successful grant and loan \nprograms at the State and local level throughout the Nation that were \nworking on a voluntary basis to retrofit diesel engines.\n  I was also cognizant that the new ozone and particulate matter air \nquality standards were going into effect and that a voluntary program \nwas needed to help the nation's 495 and Ohio's 38 nonattainment \ncounties--especially those that are in moderate nonattainment like \nNortheast Ohio.\n  Additionally, I have visited with University of Cincinnati Medical \nCenter doctors--as recently as this month--to discuss their Cincinnati \nChildhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study. Some of the early results \nindicate disturbing impacts on the development of children living near \nhighways.\n  It became clear to me that a national program was needed. We then \nformed a strong, diverse coalition comprised of environmental, \nindustry, and public officials. The culmination of this work is being \nrevealed today in the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005.\n  This legislation would establish voluntary national and State-level \ngrant and loan programs to promote the reduction of diesel emissions. \nIt would authorize $1 billion over 5 years--$200 million annually. Some \nwill claim that this is too much money and others will claim it is not \nenough--which is probably why it is just right.\n  We should first recognize that the need far outpaces what is \ncontained in the legislation. This funding is also fiscally responsible \nas diesel retrofits have proven to be one of the most cost-effective \nemissions reduction strategies. Furthermore, as a former Governor, I \nknow firsthand that the new air quality standards are an unfunded \nmandate on our states and localities--and they need the Federal \nGovernment's help.\n\n[[Page S6762]]\n\n  This legislation would help bring counties into attainment by \nencouraging the retrofitting or replacement of diesel engines, \nsubstantially reducing diesel emissions and the formation of ozone and \nparticulate matter.\n  The bill is efficient with the Federal Government's dollars in \nseveral ways. First, 20 percent of the funding would be distributed to \nStates that establish voluntary diesel retrofit programs. 10 percent of \nthe bill's overall funding would be set aside as an incentive for \nStates to match the Federal dollars being provided. The remaining 70 \npercent of the program would be administered by the EPA.\n  Second, the program would focus on nonattainment areas where help is \nneeded the most. Third, it would require at least 50 percent of the \nFederal program to be used on public fleets since we are talking about \npublic dollars. Fourth, it would place a high priority on the projects \nthat are the most cost effective and affect the most people.\n  Lastly, the bill would include provisions to help develop new \ntechnologies, encourage more action through non-financial incentives, \nand require EPA to outreach to stakeholders and report on the success \nof the program.\n  EPA estimates that this billion dollar program would leverage an \nadditional $500 million leading to a net benefit of almost $20 billion \nwith a reduction of about 70,000 tons of particulate matter. This is a \n13 to 1 benefit-cost ratio.\n  The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005 enjoys broad bipartisan \nsupport, and it is needed desperately. I plan to work with the bill's \ncosponsors and the coalition to use every avenue to get it signed into \nlaw as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1265\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \nto reauthorize the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for \nUndergraduate Programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, our country is facing a crisis. Too many \nof our young people leave high school without the skills necessary to \nmeet the demands of a global economy. According to a recent U.S. \nChamber of Commerce survey, 75 percent of employers report severe \ndifficulties when trying to hire qualified workers, with 40 percent of \njob applicants having poor skills. As many as 3.3 million jobs may be \nsent overseas in the next 15 years, causing American workers to lose \n$136 billion in wages. The strength of our economy, and the future of \nour nation, largely rests on our ability to improve educational \nopportunities for all of our citizens.\n  An educated, skilled, and flexible workforce is essential to building \na strong and dynamic economy, and, if we are going to maintain our \ncountry's ability to compete in a global economy, we must help prepare \nyoung people to meet the demands of the 21st century workforce. I \nintroduce legislation that will ensure more students graduate high \nschool ready for college and the workforce.\n  Only 68 percent of all students in the U.S. graduate high school on \ntime with a regular diploma. And, the numbers are worse if the student \nis Hispanic, African American, Native American, has a disability, or is \nmale. Sadly, a recent report indicates that students are dropping out \nat a younger age, resulting in an even less educated workforce.\n  For students who graduate with a high school diploma, too few go on \ndirectly to college. Astonishingly, only 38 percent of high school \nfreshmen will earn a high school diploma and make the immediate \ntransition to college directly after graduation. In New Mexico, the \nstatistics are pretty staggering. For every 50 ninth graders in New \nMexico, only 30 will graduate high school; 18 will enter college; 11 \nare still enrolled in their sophomore year; and 5.5 graduate from \ncollege within 6 years. We must do better.\n  We also know, unfortunately, that as many as 40 percent of this \ncountry's high school graduates are not prepared to meet the demands of \ncollege or a\n\n[[Page S6764]]\n\ncompetitive workforce. A survey of college professors reveals that half \nof all public school graduates are not adequately prepared to do \ncollege-level math or writing.\n  There is some good news, however; we know what works. Research \nconducted by the Department of Education shows that the single best \npredictor of college success is the quality and level of a student's \nhigh school classes. Students who take a solid college prep curriculum \nare less likely to need remedial classes, and are more likely to earn a \ncollege degree. In fact, evidence shows that the intensity and quality \nof high school curriculum is the greatest measure of completion of a \nbachelor's degree. Importantly, studies also show that not only do \ncollege-bound students benefit from rigorous courses, but that all \nstudents benefit from more rigorous coursework. Accordingly, it is \ncritical that all of our young people have access to rigorous \ncoursework in secondary school in order to meet the demands of \npostsecondary education and a competitive workforce.\n  Therefore, I introduce legislation that builds on this research and \nworks toward a goal of ensuring that all secondary school students are \nenrolled in classes that prepare them to excel in college and in the \nworkplace.\n  The GEAR UP program, Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for \nUndergraduate Programs, was first authorized in 1998 and was designed \nto promote student achievement and access to postsecondary education \namong low-income students. Since that time, GEAR UP grants have served \nover a million students per year. In my home State of New Mexico, there \nare six GEAR UP programs that serve thousands of students in many \ndifferent ways, including by instituting reading and math programs, \ntaking students to colleges so they can begin to imagine themselves on \na college campus, creating science fairs and technology training \nseminars, providing career and financial counseling, and many other \nvital services. And, the individuals who work with GEAR UP programs are \nsome of the most dedicated professionals I have met.\n\n  I believe we can build on the successes of GEAR UP to ensure more \nstudents leave high school prepared for the academic rigor of college \nand a competitive workforce. My legislation, called Gearing Up for \nAcademic Success, will support and strengthen GEAR UP so that it \npromotes lasting and systemic change in the schools served by the GEAR \nUP grant.\n  The legislation places a particular focus on encouraging more \nstudents to take college preparation courses, especially those who are \nat risk for dropping out of school. But, it also builds capacity within \nthe school so that activities funded with a GEAR UP grant benefit not \nonly the students who receive the services, but also future cohorts of \nstudents who enter GEAR UP schools after the initial grants have ended.\n  My legislation does not change the fundamental structure of GEAR UP; \nit maintains States and partnerships as eligible entities. The \nlegislation, however, changes the focus and the types of activities the \neligible entities must engage in. Eligible entities will now be \nrequired to provide activities that ensure more students participate in \ncollege preparation coursework. Further, my legislation requires the \nactivities to be designed so as to benefit both current students as \nwell as future cohorts of students.\n  As in current law, partnerships are comprised of school districts, \ninstitutions of higher education, and community organizations. The \nlegislation also retains the focus on cohorts of students that exists \nin current law by requiring grantees to serve one grade level of \nstudents, beginning not later than the 7th grade, through the 12th \ngrade. Unlike current law, however, partnerships will now be required \nto provide activities designed to ensure the secondary school \ncompletion and college enrollment of this cohort of students. The \nlegislation will also require the partnership to focus on developing a \nmore rigorous curriculum and on professional development opportunities \nfor teachers of college prep courses. Consequently, future cohorts of \nstudents would benefit from the more rigorous curriculum and the \nprofessional development available to the teachers.\n  Partnerships may also engage in a wide variety of other activities \npermissible under current law, including providing mentoring and \nadvising, creating summer programs at institutions of higher education, \nproviding skills assessment, personal and family counseling, financial \naid counseling, and activities designed to foster parent involvement in \nissues surrounding completion of high school and the attainment of a \ncollege education.\n  The State can play a more effective role in ensuring students \ngraduate high school prepared for college, and accordingly, my \nlegislation requires State grantees to focus on two types of \nactivities. First, the State would be required to provide policy \nleadership to promote college readiness of students in the State, \nparticularly those who are at risk of dropping out of school and those \nwho are economically disadvantaged. And, second, the State will be \nresponsible for promoting coordination and information sharing among \nall GEAR UP grantees in the state, providing technical assistance and \ntraining, disseminating information about best practices, and providing \nopportunities for eligible partnerships to coordinate their efforts.\n  This program is so worthwhile, and leadership at the State level is \nabsolutely critical, and accordingly, propose changing the formula to \nmake funds available to every State. When appropriations for GEAR UP \nexceed $400,000,000 per year, one third of the funds will be made \navailable to each State by formula. The remainder of the allocation \nwill go to eligible partnerships on a competitive basis.\n  We all can agree that it is in our national interest to ensure that \nall of our students leave high school prepared to meet the demands of \nthe 21st century workforce. This legislation provides an opportunity to \nsystemically change the way our secondary schools prepare all students \nfor college and a competitive workforce. I ask unanimous consent the \ntext of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1267\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Known as GOFEDS, this bill would amend the Federal tax code and \nallow the Federal Government's student loan repayment programs to be \noffered on a tax-free basis.\n  In recent years, many educational institutions have established \nprograms that repay a portion of the student loan debt their graduates \nowe. These programs are designed to encourage students to seek jobs \nwith government or non-profit organizations that cannot pay salaries \ncommensurate with the private sector upon graduation. Under current \nlaw, the amounts these institutions offer their graduates as student \nloan repayment are not taxed as income, provided the recipients choose \nto work for the government or non-profit organizations.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Tax Code does not treat the Federal \nGovernment's loan repayment programs in the same way, considering such \nloan repayment as taxable income to the employee. As a result, the net \nbenefit of any such program is reduced by the amount of tax that the \nindividual has to pay on the debt repaid. This bill would amend the tax \ncode so that the Government does not continue to undermine its own loan \nrepayment recruitment incentive. This change will help Federal agencies \nrecruit and retain well-qualified graduates.\n  This Congress, I have expanded GOFEDS to our military because recent \nreports indicate that all four services missed their recruiting goals \nlast year. Unfortunately, military recruiting levels are now at a 30-\nyear low. Under GOFEDS, military education loan programs, like the \nActive-Duty Loan Repayment Program will be offered on a tax free basis.\n  With more than half of the Federal workforce eligible for retirement \nin the next 5 years and surveys showing that fewer Americans find \ngovernment services attractive, the need for this legislation is even \nmore necessary. I believe the cost of this bill is minimal, but its \npotential impact is great. I urge all of my colleagues to support this \nlegislation and I am confident that it can be enacted this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1255\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Generating Opportunity by \n     Forgiving Educational Debt for Service Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXCLUSION FOR STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENTS BY THE FEDERAL \n                   GOVERNMENT.\n\n       (a) Exclusion From Gross Income.--Section 108(f) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to student loans) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) Student loan repayments by federal government.--In \n     the case of an individual, gross income does not include any \n     payments made by the Federal Government on behalf of such \n     individual under--\n       ``(A)(i) section 5379 of title 5, United States Code; or\n       ``(ii) any other similar Federal program for its employees; \n     or\n       ``(B) section 510(e)(2), chapter 109, or chapter 1609 of \n     title 10, United States Code.''.\n       (b) Exclusion From Wages.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 3121(a) of such Code (defining \n     wages) is amended--\n       (A) in paragraph (21), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (B) in paragraph (22), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; or''; and\n       (C) by inserting after paragraph (22) the following:\n       ``(23) any payment excluded from gross income under section \n     108(f)(5) (relating to student loan repayments by the Federal \n     Government).''.\n       (2) Social security act.--Section 209(a) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 409(a)) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(20) Any payment excluded from gross income under section \n     108(f)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     student loan repayments by Federal Government).''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to payments made on or after the date of \n     enactment of this Act in taxable years ending after such \n     date.\n\n[[Page S6743]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 256. A bill to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to \ndevelop regulations regarding the transportation of extremely hazardous \nmaterials, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Hazardous \nMaterials Vulnerability Reduction Act of 2005. It is regretful that I \nam introducing this legislation, as the Department of Homeland Security \nhas all of the legal authorities necessary to undertake the steps set \nout in this legislation. However, nearly 4 years after September 11, \nthe Department of Homeland Security is still not doing its job. Quite \nfrankly, officials at the Department of Homeland Security are either \nunaware, or even worse, they are purposely ignoring a grave threat to \nour cities. Hazardous materials being transported by 90-ton rail \ntankers has been described as a ``uniquely dangerous'' threat--\ncomparable only to a nuclear or biological attack. According to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Department of Transportation, \nthese materials pose special risks during transportation because their \nuncontrolled release can endanger significant numbers of people. In \naddition, there have been countless reports of lax security along the \nurban area rail routes they travel. Nevertheless, the administration \nhas done nothing to reduce this threat. The legislation that I am \nintroducing today will require the Department of Homeland Security to \ndevelop a comprehensive, risk-based strategy for reducing the threat of \na terrorist attack on extremely hazardous materials in our Nation's \nhigh-threat cities. The steps set out in this legislation should have \nbeen taken years ago, but it is clear that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity will not act. I hope that my colleagues will join me in \npassing this legislation to require them to act.\n  Within just a few miles of where we stand right now, rail tankers \ncarrying the world's most dangerous chemicals are being transported \nover tracks that are not sufficiently safeguarded or monitored. \nAccording to Richard A. Falkenrath, a former homeland security adviser \nto President Bush, this threat stands out ``as acutely vulnerable and \nalmost uniquely dangerous.'' He is not alone in this opinion. The \nHomeland Security Council released a report in July 2004 indicating \nthat an explosion, in an urban area, of a rail tanker carrying chlorine \ncould kill up to 17,500 individuals and could require the \nhospitalization of nearly 100,000. An analysis by the Naval Research \nLaboratory depicted a more troubling scenario when it studied the \npotential for damage if an attack occurred while an event was being \nheld on the National Mall, such as the annual Fourth of \nJuly celebration. According to this analysis, ``over 100,000 people \ncould be seriously harmed or even killed in the first half hour.'' Let \nme say that again, according to a study by the Naval Research \nLaboratory ``over 100,000 people could be seriously harmed or killed in \nthe first half hour.''\n\n  Terrorist groups already understand the potential impact of such an \nattack. The FBI and CIA have uncovered evidence that terrorists have \ntargeted chemical shipments, and just a few months ago during testimony \nbefore the Senate Intelligence Committee, FBI Director Mueller \nindicated that threats to rail remain a key concern. This should not be \na surprise. Rail systems are the most frequently attacked targets \nworldwide, and the wide open nature of their architecture makes them \nvulnerable at many points. In other words, rail systems present many \nsoft targets. Incidentally, I have introduced separate legislation in \nthe last three Congresses that would provide $1.2 billion to eliminate \nsome of the vulnerabilities in our rail system; however, this \nlegislation has not been supported by the Bush administration and it \nhas not passed Congress. In fact, the administration has not asked for \na single dime specifically for rail security. This is very troubling \nbecause we know that the modus operandi for many terrorist groups is to \ncause mass casualties and spectacular damage. According to the Chlorine \nInstitute, an attack on a 90-ton tanker could create a toxic cloud 40 \nmiles long and 10 miles wide. The Environmental Protection Agency \nestimates that in an urban area this toxic cloud could extend 14 miles. \nCan you imagine the psychological impact of a toxic cloud of poisonous \ngas expanding and moving slowly over one of our major metropolitan \nareas--leaving death and chaos in its path?\n  Given the potential damage and the direct threat against chemical \nrail tankers, you would think that the Bush administration has been \nbusy reducing or eliminating this threat. Unfortunately, as with so \nmany other areas involving our homeland security this does not appear \nto be the case. In January testimony before the Senate Homeland \nSecurity Committee, Mr. Falkenrath stated that ``to date, the Federal \nGovernment has not made a material reduction in the inherent \nvulnerability of hazardous chemical targets inside the United States.'' \nHe went on to say that this should be the highest priority for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. A Wall Street Journal article written \nlast year--``Graffiti Artists Put Their Mark on War Against \nTerrorism''--provides a chilling example of the exposure of these \nchemical tankers. The reporter followed a graffiti artist to a railroad \ntunnel along tracks that run near I-395 not far from where we stand. As \nhe was conducting the interview, a tanker carrying dangerous chemicals \nrolled by on an adjacent track. The graffiti artist noted that ``it \nwouldn't be hard at all for someone like Al Qaeda to wait right here \nfor the right poison and bang! Good-bye Washington.''\n\n  This threat and the lack of action by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity has led many city officials to consider local legislation to \nban shipments of hazardous materials. Right now, a dispute between the \nDistrict of Columbia and the transportation companies joined by the \nBush administration is being litigated in Federal courts. Other cities, \nsuch as Philadelphia and Boston are considering similar action. As a \nformer county executive, I am sympathetic to the plight of local \nofficials, and they should certainly be allowed to exercise their \npolice powers in appropriate situations. I believe, and I am sure most \nlocal officials would agree, that it would be better to have a \nnational, comprehensive policy on this issue. This is simply too \nimportant to have a patchwork strategy. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity should have already done this. Unfortunately, they have not, \nand this legislation will require the Department to take some basic, \nfundamental steps to enhance safety for the American people.\n  The legislation that I am introducing requires the Department of \nHomeland Security to issue regulations establishing a national policy \nfor dealing with the transport of the world's most dangerous chemicals \nby rail through our high threat cities. It will require the Department \nto develop protocols for the notification of State and local officials, \nand it will require the Department to study and report to Congress \nregarding security enhancing measures such as secondary containment \ntechnologies, GPS tracking of shipments, and the feasibility of \nsmaller, more secure tankers. The bill also includes a provision \nrequiring the Department of Homeland Security to work with State and \nlocal officials, the rail industry and other stakeholders to develop a \nstrategy for rerouting a small fraction of the most dangerous materials \naround our most threatened city. It is estimated that only 5 percent of \nall hazardous materials shipped by rail will be subjected to this \nregulation. Finally, the bill will provide $100 million to State and \nlocal governments and rail operators to purchase safety equipment and \nprovide training to first responders and rail workers who are likely to \ndiscover and respond to an incident involving hazardous materials. An \nadditional $10 million will be made available to the National Labor \nCollege to provide further training for rail workers.\n  I realize that the rail industry has invested considerable amounts of \nits own money to enhance security since September 11, and this \nlegislation is not an indictment of their efforts. I have been pushing \nto get more Federal funding for rail security for years, but this plea \nhas fallen on deaf ears within the administration. I realize that we \ncannot eliminate every conceivable risk, but at a time when we have \ntroops overseas fighting the war on terror and our Nation's law \nenforcement agencies are on high alert, the least that we should do\n\n[[Page S6744]]\n\nis ensure that we have a national strategy for handling a threat that \nis comparable in scope to a nuclear or biological attack. I will close \nby again referring to the grave warning set out in the study by the \nNaval Research Laboratory--``over 100,000 people could be seriously \nharmed or even killed in the first half hour'' of an attack. The danger \nis simply too great to ignore, and I ask my colleagues to join me in \npassing this critical legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1256\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Hazardous \n     Materials Vulnerability Reduction Act of 2005''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress has specifically given the Department of \n     Homeland Security, working in conjunction with the Department \n     of Transportation and other Federal agencies, the primary \n     authority for the security of the United States \n     transportation sector, including passenger and freight rail.\n       (2) This authority includes the responsibility to protect \n     American citizens from terrorist incidents related to the \n     transport by rail of extremely hazardous materials.\n       (3) Federal agencies have determined that hazardous \n     materials can be used as tools of destruction and terror and \n     that extremely hazardous materials are particularly \n     vulnerable to sabotage or misuse during transport.\n       (4) The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central \n     Intelligence Agency have found evidence suggesting that \n     chemical tankers used to transport and store extremely \n     hazardous chemicals have been targeted by terrorist groups.\n       (5) Rail shipments of extremely hazardous materials are \n     often routed through highly attractive targets and densely \n     populated areas, including within a few miles of the White \n     House and United States Capitol.\n       (6) According to security experts, certain extremely \n     hazardous materials present a mass casualty terrorist \n     potential rivaled only by improvised nuclear devices, certain \n     acts of bioterrorism, and the collapse of large occupied \n     buildings.\n       (7) A report by the Chlorine Institute found that a 90-ton \n     rail tanker, if successfully targeted by an explosive device, \n     could cause a catastrophic release of an extremely hazardous \n     material, creating a toxic cloud 40 miles long and 10 miles \n     wide.\n       (8) The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that in \n     an urban area a toxic cloud could extend for 14 miles.\n       (9) The United States Naval Research Laboratories concluded \n     that a toxic plume of this type, created while there was a \n     public event on the National Mall, could kill or injure up to \n     100,000 people in less than 30 minutes.\n       (10) According to security experts, rail shipments of \n     extremely hazardous materials are particularly vulnerable and \n     dangerous, however the Federal Government has made no \n     material reduction in the inherent vulnerability of hazardous \n     chemical targets inside the United States.\n       (11) While the safety record related to rail shipments of \n     hazardous materials is very good, recent accidental releases \n     of extremely hazardous materials in rural South Carolina and \n     San Antonio, Texas, demonstrate the fatal danger posed by \n     extremely hazardous materials.\n       (12) Security experts have determined that re-routing these \n     rail shipments is the only way to immediately eliminate this \n     danger in high threat areas, which currently puts hundreds of \n     thousands of people at risk.\n       (13) Security experts have determined that the primary \n     benefit of re-routing the shipment of extremely hazardous \n     materials is a reduction in the number of people that would \n     be exposed to the deadly impact of the release due to an \n     attack, and the principal cost would be the additional \n     operating expense associated with possible increase inhaul \n     for the shipment of extremely hazardous materials.\n       (14) Less than 5 percent of all hazardous materials shipped \n     by rail will meet the definition of extremely hazardous \n     materials under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to clarify \nthat persons may bring private rights of actions against foreign states \nfor certain terrorist acts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, along with my colleague, Senator \nLautenberg, I am introducing the Justice for Marine Corps Families--\nVictims of Terrorism Act. I am submitting this legislation on behalf of \nthe families of the brave servicemen who died when terrorists--with the \nsupport of the Government of Iran--sent a suicide bomber into the \nMarine Corps Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, on October 23, 1983, killing \n241 U.S. servicemen--18 sailors, 3 soldiers, and 220 marines.\n  This legislation clarifies a private right of action, in Federal \ncourts, for U.S. citizens against state sponsors of terrorism and will \nultimately make it easier for victims of such acts to collect court-\nordered damages against state-sponsors of terrorism. The specific \nprovisions of the legislation have been drafted to harmonize existing \nstatutory law with the recent decision by the District of Columbia \ncircuit in Cicippio-Puleo v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 353 F.3d 1024, \nD.C. Cir. 2004, which held that ``neither 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1605(a)(7) nor \nthe Flatow Amendment to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. . . ., \nnor the two considered in tandem, creates a private right of action \nagainst a foreign government.'' 353 F.3d 1024, 1032-33 (D.C. Cir. \n2004). This bill will permit the families of the brave servicemen who \ndied at the Marine Corps Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, to collect court-\nordered damages against state-sponsors of terrorism such as Iran.\n  The initial section of the bill clarifies that victims of a state-\nsponsored terrorist attack are permitted to bring a private suit \nagainst the sponsoring foreign terrorist government. Congress first \nallowed U.S. citizen victims of state sponsored terrorism to pursue \nprivate actions against a foreign terrorist government when we passed \nthe Flatow Amendment in 1996. Now, some 9 years and over 50 successful \ncases later, the Federal Appellate Court for the District of Columbia \nCircuit in Cicippio-Puleo v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 353 F.3d 1024 \nD.C., 2004, has held that the Flatow amendment did not create a private \nright of action against a foreign terrorist government. Accordingly, \nthe initial section of this bill will correct Cicippio-Puleo by \nexplicitly inserting language into the Flatow amendment enabling U.S. \ncitizens to once again bring private suits against foreign terrorist \ngovernments who have murdered or maimed their loved ones.\n  The second section of the bill eliminating many of the barriers which \nhave prevented U.S. citizens from collecting on court ordered damages \nagainst state sponsors of terrorism. The bill does this by changing the \nlegal standard of the Bancec doctrine from day to day-managerial \ncontrol to those under the beneficial ownership of the state. The \nSupreme Court enunciated the so-called Bancec doctrine in First Nat'l \nCity Bank v. Banco Para EI Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462 U.S. 611, \n626-27, 1983. In this case, the U.S. Supreme Court created a \npresumption against a party that seeks to satisfy an outstanding \njudgment against a foreign government by seizing the foreign \ngovernment's assets. This section of the bill will ease the burden on \nthe families of victims of terrorism by permitting them to attach the \nhidden assets of terrorist states held within the United States. \nFinally, the remaining portions of the bill would create a mechanism \nwhereby a lien could be filed in any jurisdiction in the United States \nwhere a state sponsor of terrorism directly or indirectly owns assets. \nThis would prevent foreign state sponsors of terrorism from removing \nthese assets from the country after the passage of this legislation.\n  On October 23, 2004, in Philadelphia, I was privileged to take part \nin a memorial service held in honor of the servicemen killed in the \n1983 Beirut attack. Some of the family members of those killed attended \nthe event. Their moving comments about how they had been denied the \nability to seek legal redress, despite clear findings implicating Iran \nin the attacks, were both poignant and persuasive. It is vitally \nimportant to victims' families that they have a private right of action \nagainst the state sponsor itself, not just against its officials, \nemployees, or agents acting in their official capacity. These victims \nand their families deserve not only a day in court but also the ability \nto recover damages from these terrorist states that commit, direct, or \nmaterially support terrorist acts against American citizens or \nnationals. This bill reaffirms that the United States will not tolerate \nstate-sponsored terrorism. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join us \nin support of this\n\n[[Page S6747]]\n\nbill. I yield the floor. I ask unaminous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1257\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the building located at 493 Auburn \nAvenue, N.E., in Atlanta, Georgia, as the ``John Lewis Civil Rights \nInstitute''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a man who has \nbeen at the front of our country's fight for civil rights. Born a son \nof sharecroppers in Troy, AL, John grew up to become one of the leading \nproponents fighting on the frontlines of the civil rights movement.\n  John grew up listening to speeches from the Reverend Martin Luther \nKing Jr., and observing many courageous acts, such as the Montgomery \nbus boycotts. Through those examples, Lewis could no longer stand idly \nby while others suffered for his sake. He was motivated to become an \nactive participant in these historical events. From organizing peaceful \ndemonstrations, to riding in the fronts of buses, Lewis was a key \nleader and played a dynamic role in the civil rights movement.\n  From 1963-1966 Lewis served as chairman of the Student Nonviolent \nCoordinating Committee. In 1963 Lewis was named one of the Big Six \nCivil Rights leaders along with Martin Luther King Jr., James Farmer, \nRoy Wilkins, Whitney Young, and A. Phillip Randolph.\n  In August 1963, John Lewis was a keynote speaker at the momentous \nMarch on Washington where Martin Luther King, Jr. gave his ``I Have a \nDream'' speech. On March 7, 1965, Lewis helped the now pivotal voting \nrights march from Selma to Montgomery, AL. Sustaining physical injuries \nfor the principles he believed in, John Lewis remained steadfast in his \ncommitment to promoting human rights in the United States. The violent \nreactions by Alabama state troopers that day sparked an outcry and\n\n[[Page S6748]]\n\neventually served to facilitate passage of the Voting Rights Act of \n1965.\n  Mr. President, as a congressman, statesman, humanitarian, the Nation \nhas benefited greatly from the lifelong contributions of John Lewis. I \nam proud to introduce legislation honoring John Lewis.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1258\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. JOHN LEWIS CIVIL RIGHTS INSTITUTE.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The building located at 493 Auburn \n     Avenue, N.E., in Atlanta, Georgia, shall be known and \n     designated as the ``John Lewis Civil Rights Institute''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     building referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be \n     a reference to the John Lewis Civil Rights Institute.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER:\n  S. 1261. A bill to simplify access to financial aid and access to \ninformation on college costs, to provide for more learning and less \nreporting, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in case the President may be wondering, \nand I asked consent about this, these are 7,000 regulations. We have \n6,000 autonomous institutions of higher education in the United States, \ncolleges and universities.\n  The Presiding Officer comes from the State that has some of the \nfinest colleges and universities anywhere in America. I will not begin \nto name them because there are so many of them I might leave one out. \nEvery single college or university, public or private, in North \nCarolina, Tennessee, or Colorado which has students with Federal grants \nor loans gets all of these boxes this year. These are the Federal \nregulations under title IV of the Higher Education Act that somebody at \nthe smallest college or the biggest university must wade through in \norder to help students have Federal grants and Federal loans. The \nFederal grant and Federal loans are one of the great success stories of \nthe United States of America. I will talk more about that.\n  Mr. President, 60 percent of our college students and university \nstudents at those 6,000 public and private and profit and nonprofit \ninstitutes of higher education, 60 percent of them have a Federal grant \nor loan to help pay for college. That has increased over the last 4 or \n5 years about 10 times faster--9 times faster--than State funding for \nhigher education.\n  But my goal today, in my remarks and in the bill I am introducing, is \nto make it easier for boys and girls and men and women who attend our \ncolleges and universities--and many of them are mature, older \nstudents--to make it easier for them to go through these documents. And \nthen, on the other hand, to make it easier for our colleges and \nuniversities to comply with all these rules and regulations. I would \nlike for them to be spending their time and their money helping our \nstudents learn instead of spending their time and their money reporting \nto us what they are doing.\n  That is the purpose of what I want to do today. I am introducing the \nHigher Education Simplification and Deregulation Act of 2005, a bill \nthat does what I just described. It will help students get access to \navailable financial resources. Second, it will reduce the burden on \ncolleges and universities imposed by Federal regulations so they can \ndevote more of their time doing what they are meant to do: provide the \nhighest quality postsecondary education in the world. And third, it \nwill ensure that the autonomy and independence of our 6,000 \ninstitutions of higher education are preserved.\n  I am delighted I am able to interrupt the energy debate to talk about \nhigher education because I think while it sounds like we are shifting \ngears, they really go together. If I am looking at our country today, \nand I had to take an exam this minute about the two greatest issues \nfacing the United States of America, I would say, No. 1, terrorism, \nand, No. 2, competitiveness. ``Competitiveness'' a big word, meaning: \nHow are we going to keep our jobs? How are we going to keep our \nstandard of living in this country when we have 5 or 6 percent of the \npeople in the world, and yet we produce a third of all the money, \nconsume 25 percent of all the energy? And China and India and Singapore \nand Malaysia, not to mention Japan and Europe, are saying: Wait a \nminute. Our brains are as good as those American brains. A lot of our \nstudents have been going to the United States, creating jobs for those \nAmericans. In fact, 572,000 foreign students are in this country today, \nbasically improving our standard of living by their work here.\n  So we are in a very competitive time. Just as we have been saying in \nenergy, here comes China, here comes Malaysia, here comes India buying \nup the oil reserves, driving up the price. Here comes Germany and other \nparts of the world with lower natural gas prices than we have. And our \njobs are going toward them.\n  The other thing we could do to ensure our good jobs and to keep our \nhigher standard of living is to focus on our brainpower. The great \nadvantages the United States of America has had since World War II have \nbeen our low cost, reliable supply and access to energy, our science \nand technology edge, and our educational institutions. There are so \nmany examples of that.\n  Mrs. Kay Bailey Hutchison, the senior Senator from Texas, and our \nmajority leader, Senator Bill Frist, had a little session in the \nleader's office last year. They invited the former Brazilian President \nFernando Henrique Cardoso. He was concluding his residency at the \nLibrary of Congress. I remember after he had said what he had to say, \nwe asked our questions.\n  Senator Hutchison asked of President Cardoso: Mr. President, what is \nthe one thing you are going to remember about the United States from \nyour stay here at the Library of Congress that you will take with you \nback to your country of Brazil? Without a moment's hesitation, he said: \nThe American university, the greatness and the autonomy of the American \nuniversity.\n  I will tell you another story. A few years ago, I was asked to be the \npresident of the University of Tennessee. It was 1988. I was glad to do \nit. I had been chairman of the board of the university for 8 years as \nGovernor, and I appointed a lot of the trustees, but I was not a \nskilled university president. So I sought out David Gardner, the \npresident of the University of California, which I regard, with all \nrespect to North Carolina, at least at that time, to be the outstanding \npublic university in America and perhaps one of the best in the world.\n  I said to David Gardner: Why is the University of California so good? \nWithout a moment's hesitation, he said: First, autonomy. When \nCalifornia created the university--they created four branches of \ngovernment, really: legislative, executive, judicial, and then the \nUniversity of California. He said: Fundamentally, they give us the \nmoney, and then our board and we decide how to spend it. Our autonomy \nhas permitted us to do the second thing, set very high standards. And \nthen he said the third thing was the large amount of Federal dollars \nthat follows students to the educational institution of their choice.\n  So autonomy, excellence, and choice--Federal dollars following \nstudents to the schools of their choice. That is how David Gardner \nexplained the California model for excellence in higher education.\n  That model has worked for our country since the GI bill for veterans \nwas enacted in 1944. I have wondered many times how we were fortunate \nenough to have decided to do it in the way they did it. This was for \nthe veterans. It was the end of World War II. There were college \npresidents who were very upset about the idea of giving the veterans \nmoney and just telling them to go wherever they wanted to go to \ncollege.\n  The president of the University of Chicago said it would make the \nUniversity of Chicago a hobo's jungle. But we know what it did. We had \nveterans coming back and taking their GI bill. Many of them took it to \nCatholic high schools and other high schools because they had not \nfinished high school. But they went wherever they wanted, to any \naccredited institution. They went to Yeshiva. They went to Vanderbilt. \nThey went to the historically Black colleges and universities across \nAmerica--Harvard. It did not matter. If it was accredited, they chose \nthe institution.\n\n[[Page S6749]]\n\n  The same formula was applied when the Pell grants were created by \nthis Congress in honor of Senator Pell, who was a former Member of this \nbody; as is true with Senator Stafford and the Stafford loans. Instead \nof giving those grants and loans to the University of North Carolina \nand the University of Tennessee, they went to the student. The student \nthen said: Well, I will decide where I want to go. I may want to go to \nRhodes College, or I may want to go to Lenore Rhyne or I may want to go \nto the University of Florida or Yeshiva or Howard. They go where they \nwant to go.\n\n  Because of that, we now have 6,000 autonomous institutions around the \ncountry. Many of them are nonprofit. Many of them are for profit. \nEighty percent of our students go to public institutions, but 20 \npercent go to private institutions. Because it is a marketplace of \n6,000 institutions, and some are, of course, better than others, \nbecause it is a marketplace, we have been able to adapt to a changing \nworld that now has different subjects, different standards, a more \nglobal environment, and students who are, by and large, much older and \nhave different needs than they did before.\n  If we had not had that kind of marketplace of colleges and \nuniversities, we would be stuck in the mud, and we would not have \nformer President Cardoso of Brazil talking so well about our colleges \nand universities.\n  We do not just have some of the best colleges and universities in the \nworld; we have almost all of them. And the rest of the world knows \nthat. We do not have 572,000 foreign students studying in our country \nthis year because we made them come, or even because we give them \nscholarships. They pay to come for the most part. They are the \nbrightest students in most of these countries. And 60 percent of our \npostdoctoral students are from overseas. Half our students in computer \nand engineering graduate programs are from overseas. They are here for \nthat reason. So we attract these students. The Federal Government has \ncontinued to be generous.\n  So there are two things I am introducing today with this bill. Number \none, this legislation would simplify the financial aid process and \nexpand access for students. We do it in these ways: (a) streamline the \nforms for Federal grants and loans, making access to student financial \naid easier; (b) provide students who want to expedite their education \nand study year-round the Federal support to do so; (c) provide students \nwith financial information about colleges and universities in a clear \nand concise manner that does not require additional reporting from \ninstitutions.\n  The second purpose of the bill is to protect that autonomy, that one \nword, that independence, that autonomy of these 6,000 institutions. \nThat is, in my view, a critical element of why we have the best \ncolleges and universities in the world.\n  What I mean by that is we did not order them to be good from \nWashington. That is not how they got to be great. They were autonomous \nand independent. We allowed them to be, and then we gave them students, \nfollowed by money, who created a competitive marketplace. And they \nbecame the best in the world.\n  So this legislation eliminates, streamlines, and evaluates \nregulations currently imposed on institutions of higher education with \nthe goal of lessening the burden on schools. That way, universities can \nfocus more on teaching and researching and less on maintaining \nreporting requirements for the Federal Government.\n  The bill, No. 1, appoints an expert panel to review Department of \nEducation regulations and to recommend how those regulations might be \nstreamlined or eliminated. Two, it accelerates the ``negotiated \nrulemaking process'' whereby universities negotiate new rules with the \nDepartment so that an end result can be reached without costly delays. \nAnd three, it develops a compliance calendar so that universities know \nwhat requirements they have to meet and when they to have meet them.\n  What I mean by that is, it will be up to us in the Federal Government \nto send to the University of North Carolina or Maryville College in \nTennessee a list of the rules they have to comply with so they don't \nhave to hire a whole team of people to try to wade through and read \neverything.\n  This is just one title of the Higher Education Act. It has several \ntitles. So a compliance calendar would help deregulate.\n  These changes build on the successful model for American higher \neducation. By making the financial aid process more user friendly and \nmore accessible, more students will have Federal funds following them \nto the college or university of their choice. And by relieving some of \nthe Federal regulatory burden, we are restoring university autonomy so \nthey can spend more time teaching and researching and less time filling \nout paperwork.\n  I have two major purposes. The first is to simplify and expand access \nto financial aid, to make it easier for the 60 percent of our college \nstudents who fill out a form to get a Federal grant or loan; and \nsecond, to reduce the burdensome paperwork on the colleges and \nuniversities.\n  In terms of simplifying access, we need to remember that the faces \nand needs of our college students have changed. More typically these \ndays, when I go to a graduation--this has been true for a number of \nyears--the cry you hear from the audience is: Way to go, mom. It is the \nmom who is getting her degree, or the dad, going back to school, \ncollege, community college, trade school, university to get the skills \nthey need to get a better job or another job in a rapidly changing \nworld.\n  In 1970, we had 7.4 million students, 28 percent of whom were \nenrolled part time and 38 percent at two-year colleges. Only 28 percent \nwere 25 or older. By 1999, enrollment had grown to 12.7 million, a 7.2-\npercent increase with 39 percent enrolled part time and 44 percent in \ntwo-year colleges. Nearly half our students in 1999 were in two-year \ncolleges. Our financial aid system needs to catch up.\n  The first thing we can do is to simplify what we call the Free \nApplication Federal Student Aid. As one might expect, it is known \naround here as FAFSA. Imagine that. You go out and try to talk to a \nfamily of someone who might be going to college for the first time and \nthat family says let me talk to you about FAFSA.\n  I think we ought to change the name. I think we ought to make it easy \nfor people to understand what we are talking about. I recently met a \nchief financial officer of a company who said she found the form \nchallenging when helping her high school daughter fill out a form for \nfinancial aid. I can only imagine the challenge to a high school \nstudent, or a working mother, when trying to answer over 100 confusing \nquestions, the vast majority of which are only applicable for the State \nof California.\n  So a second thing we can do is make sure students can use the Federal \naid for education they need year round. Flexibility for year-round Pell \ngrants is a part of this legislation so students can have the \nflexibility they need to go and continue their education in the summer. \nThere is a disincentive for that. Not only is that inconvenient for \nstudents and working students, it tends to encourage institutions to \nwaste the resources in the summertime, which they should be putting to \nbetter use.\n  The third thing we can do is make sure there is more information. \nThat is why I suggest the ``best buy'' list--a list of the 100 schools \nwith the lowest tuition and required fees, with the greatest \navailability of scholarships and grants. In other words, this would \nhelp parents and students decide where they could get the biggest bang \nfor their buck.\n  Many of the ideas that are in our legislation came from the Advisory \nCommittee on Student Financial Assistance. Senator Gregg, when he was \nchairman, and I invited them to work on this. They did a terrific job \nand they came up with 10 recommendations, 8 of which are in this bill, \nand I believe they have no cost to the budget.\n  The other area and my final comments have to do with the other side \nof the ledger. While we are making it easier for students to have \naccess to financial aid, we should work to relieve the regulatory \nburden on colleges and universities represented by these boxes of 7,000 \nregulations that contain all the forms any college or university in \nFlorida or Tennessee or North Carolina would receive this year to fill \nout. Thanks to the last two rounds of reauthorizing the Higher \nEducation Act,\n\n[[Page S6750]]\n\nthere are today more than 7,000 regulations associated with the title \nIV student aid program. With the exception of the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, every Federal \nagency is involved in regulating some aspect of higher education. That \nis incredible and it is absolutely ridiculous.\n  In 1997, Gerhard Casper, the president of Stanford University, said \nStanford spends 7 cents out of every tuition dollar on compliance with \nGovernment regulations. This has only gotten worse in the last 9 years. \nWe need to ease the burden. For example, under the Higher Education \nAct, universities are required to report how many full-time employees \nhave dental insurance, whether the university is a member of a national \nathletic association, and the number of meals that are in a ``board'' \ncharge. Colleges are required to hand every student a paper in-State \nvoter registration form and cannot use modern technology such as Web \nregistrations, which would actually reach more students. We are giving \nuniversity staff busy work to do when they ought to be helping \nstudents.\n  Here is another example. When a major chemical company such as DuPont \nproduces 55-gallon containers of a potentially hazardous waste, we \nrequire Dupont to report on how all that waste is disposed and ensure \nthat it is done in a certain manner. This is a good regulation and \nidea. Right now, we are applying the same regulation and paperwork to a \nchemistry class at a college that might produce half a test tube of the \nsame substance.\n  Mr. President, I don't know about the presiding officer, the Senator \nfrom Florida, and I now see the Senator from Virginia; I suspect that \nwhen we all go back to our States and speak to our Lincoln Day dinners, \nor when the Democrats go to the Jefferson Day dinners, we all say the \nthing we need to do once we pass these laws is to have more oversight \nand ease the burden of regulation. When I say that, I get a big round \nof applause, because at home people don't think we get any smarter when \nwe fly to Washington, DC, each week. They think it would be absurd to \nknow there are 7,000 regulations governing college grants and loans, \nand that Stanford University spends 7 cents out of--and this is a \nprivate university--every tuition dollar paying for the cost of \nGovernment regulations.\n\n  One reason we have an increased interest in regulating is because \nthere are a great many Members of Congress, as well as people in the \ncountry, who worry about rising tuition costs. I worry about those, \ntoo. When I was Governor of Tennessee, we used to have a deal with the \nstudents. The State will pay 70 percent of the cost, and you pay 30 \npercent, and if we raise your tuition, we will raise the State \ncontribution. That has changed, I am afraid, and I think it is \nimportant for us to know that. Tuition is not going up because the \nFederal Government is failing to do its job. Over the last 4 years, \nPell grants, work-study, scholarships all gone up about 30 percent. At \nthe same time, over the last 4 years, State spending for higher \neducation is up 3.6 percent. I will say that again. This is according \nto various educational institutions, including the Center for Study of \nEducation Policy, Illinois State University. In fiscal year 2001, there \nwas a 3.4 percent increase in State funding for higher education. In \n2002, there was a 1.2-percent decrease; in the next year, a 2.4-percent \ndecrease. This is State funding for higher education. Last year, there \nwas a 3.8-percent increase--3.6 over the 4 years.\n  So what our colleges and universities are feeling, and what our \nstudents are feeling, is decreased State support for higher education. \nOne reason they are feeling that is because we have not given States \nthe tools to control the growth in Medicaid spending. So in Tennessee, \nFlorida, Virginia, and North Carolina, our colleges and universities \nare hurting because the Governors and legislatures are spending the \ndollars that ought to be going for excellence in universities. They are \nspending it on huge increases in Medicaid costs. That is part of our \nresponsibility, too.\n  So I come to the floor today to introduce the Higher Education \nSimplification and Deregulation Act of 2005. I invite my colleagues to \njoin me in it. We will be marking up a Higher Education Authorization \nAct next month. It affects 60 percent of the college students in the \nUnited States. I am sure we are going to continue to fund those grants \nand loans, as we have from here, but we also need to do two other \nthings. One of them is in here, and that is not to get busy regulating \nmore colleges and universities. We should be deregulating. The other \nthing we should do, which is not a part of this bill, is to keep our \ncommitment to the Governors that, by about the fall of this year, we \nshould give them the legislative tools they need--and I believe also \nrelief from Federal court consent decrees, which are outdated--so they \ncan manage the growth of Medicaid spending, so that in turn we can \ncontinue to support higher education.\n  Our energy bill and our higher education bill are at the forefront of \nour policies to keep our jobs and our competitiveness.\n  Here's one more example: If you grab a pint bottle of rubbing alcohol \nfrom your bathroom and take it to a university laboratory, it will \nimmediately fall under the regulation and scrutiny of six different \nregulatory agencies:\n  (1) the air quality management district,\n  (2) the sewer district,\n  (3) OSHA,\n  (4) the local fire department,\n  (5) the county environmental health department, and\n  (6) the state hazardous waste agency.\n  While all of these are not directly governed by federal regulations, \nmany are responding to them, and we should do our part to reduce this \ntype of burden. In one instance, a prestigious institution in the \nMidwest was visited by the EPA and a bottle of dishwashing soap was \nfound in a lab near a sink. The institution was fined for improper \nmanagement of hazardous waste because the label was not still attached \nto the bottle. Even worse, the institution had to pay to have the soap \nanalyzed to document that it was not hazardous.\n  Colleges are in the business of teaching students, not sending \nmeaningless paperwork to the federal government. To fix this problem, \nmy legislation would establish an expert panel to review federal \nregulations applicable to colleges and universities and make \nrecommendations to the Secretary of Education and the Congress on how \nsome of these regulations could be streamlined or eliminated. The bill \nalso would assist institutions in complying with all these requirements \nby requiring the Department to develop a compliance calendar outlining \nspecific deadlines for paperwork submissions.\n  In those cases where there is already clarity about how to deal with \nregulations, the bill takes action. The bill will accelerate the \n``negotiated rulemaking process,'' a process whereby university \nrepresentatives negotiate new regulations with the Department. Today \nthis process can drag on for years, imposing unnecessary costs along \nthe way due to uncertainty over a final outcome for the rule. Under my \nbill, that process would have a one year deadline. To give schools a \nchance to adjust to newly agreed regulations, institutions of higher \neducation would be provided with a minimum of at least 270 days between \nthe publication of any final regulations or guidance and the initiation \nof data collection related to new disclosure requirements.\n  The bill also reinstates provisions to allow schools with a low \n``cohort default rate,'' meaning that less than 10 percent of their \nstudents fail to pay all their loans back on time, the option of \ndistributing loan money to students right at the beginning of the year \nrather than waiting a month or spacing the money out over the period of \na year. This is important since students incur many expenses up front \nduring their education and need the flexibility to pay for fees, books, \nand other costs.\n  Mr. President, since the end of World War II, our system of higher \neducation has been unmatched around the globe. According to the \nInstitute of Higher Education at Shanghai University, more than half \nthe world's top 100 universities are in the United States.\n  But our lead is slipping. During a trip to Europe, I discovered that \nChancellor Schroeder of Germany is putting a strong emphasis on \nreforming his country's university system to mirror--and perhaps even \neclipse--our own. British prime minister Tony Blair is overhauling his \nnation's system because he sees a growing gap between the quality\n\n[[Page S6751]]\n\nof American and British universities. Authorities in India and \nespecially China are working harder than ever to improve the quality of \neducation in their own countries and keep their brightest minds from \nleaving their countries. Australia and Canada are making strides as \nwell. And, for the first time, we have witnessed a decline in graduate \nstudent enrollment. The Council on Graduate Schools estimated that \nforeign applications to graduate programs in the U.S. were down this \nyear by five percent.\n  This greater competition means that not only do we find it harder \nthan ever to attract foreign students, but our graduates will find it \nharder to compete for top-paying jobs in the global economy since they \nwill be competing against talented, well-educated individuals from \naround the world.\n  Now is the time to fine-tune our own system of higher education and \nrestore its greatest strengths: generous financial assistance for \nstudents, autonomy, and high standards. Generous support is most \neffective when students can access it with a minimum of hassle and with \nmaximum flexibility to apply it to their accredited program. Freedom \nfrom over-regulation or control by government allows colleges and \nuniversities to quickly adjust to the needs of their students and focus \non teaching and research. High standards are the natural result of a \ncompetitive system where schools compete among each other for dollars \nand students.\n  My bill restores the pillars of our higher education system and gives \nus the ability to move forward with confidence in the twenty-first \ncentury. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a summary of the Higher Education Simplification and \nDeregulation Act of 2005.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Higher Education Simplification and Deregulation Act of 2005\n\n       There are 6,000 autonomous institutions of higher education \n     nationwide, and it is the autonomy and independence that our \n     universities possess that makes our system of higher \n     education the best in the world. While the federal government \n     partners with American students, families and institutions to \n     make a college education accessible, increased regulations on \n     these same entities threatens this remarkably successful \n     relationship. Countries around the world look to our higher \n     education system and are trying to emulate it. The Higher \n     Education Simplification and Deregulation Act of 2005 (the \n     Act) takes steps to reduce bureaucratic red tape, increase \n     autonomy and allow the U.S. to continue to be the best in the \n     world. As we reauthorize The Higher Education Act over the \n     next five years, our goal should be to make college more \n     accessible and not restrict that autonomy.\n\n\n   Simplify: Access to Financial Aid and Information on College Costs\n\n       (1) Simplify the Free Application for Federal Student Aid \n     (FAFSA)\n       Implement the majority of recommendations from the Advisory \n     Committee on Student Financial Assistance on simplification \n     of the FAFSA form including improved transparency, \n     verification of need and earlier notification of financial \n     aid eligibility. There is no cost associated with \n     implementing these recommendations.\n       (2) Year-Round Pell Grants and Flexible Loans for Year \n     Round Study\n       Authorize year-round Pell grants for both 2 and 4 year \n     institutions. This will help working students and older \n     adults who need increased flexibility and year round \n     financial aid.\n       Increase annual loan limits for greater funding flexibility \n     for students attending college for more than two academic \n     semesters.\n       (3) Secretary's list on College ``BEST BUYS''\n       Secretary will publish existing institutional data in a \n     user friendly way.\n       Best Buy List of ``the top 100'' will help students \n     decipher institutional expenses and financial aid.\n       Each year the Secretary shall publish a list of \n     institutions of higher education, by all nine sectors, that \n     identifies:\n       (a) The 100 schools with the lowest tuition and required \n     fees;\n       (b) The 100 schools with the lowest cost of attendance;\n       (c) The 100 schools with the largest percentage of incoming \n     full-time students who receive financial aid;\n       (d) The 100 schools with the largest average amount of \n     incoming full-time student financial aid on a per student \n     basis;\n       (e) The 100 schools with the largest percentage of students \n     who receive institutional grants and scholarships;\n       (f) The 100 schools with the slowest increase in tuition \n     and fees during the preceding 5 years; and\n       (g) The 100 schools with the slowest increase in total cost \n     of attendance during the preceding 5 years.\n       (4) Make the Department of Education's Graduate Programs' \n     Need Analysis consistent with other federal graduate \n     programs.\n       All graduate and professional students are, by definition, \n     independent students and therefore highly likely to have \n     financial need. The federal need analysis requirement in \n     Jacob K. Javits fellowship and Graduate Assistance in Areas \n     of National Need (GAANN) programs often causes lengthy delays \n     in processing grant applications. Instead of yielding helpful \n     distinctions among the applicant pool, the requisite \n     utilization of the federal needs analysis methodology creates \n     massive amounts of paperwork for students, institutions, and \n     the Department of Education. Comparable graduate fellowship \n     programs, such as the Title VI Foreign Language and Area \n     Studies program, and similar training and fellowship programs \n     at National Institutes of Health, National Science \n     Foundation, and the Department of Defense contain no such \n     requirement. Therefore, Javits and GAANN will not be subject \n     to federal needs analysis.\n\n\n                     More Learning, Less Reporting\n\n       Institutions of higher education are among the most \n     regulated entities in the United States.\n       With the exception of the Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, all federal \n     agencies are involved in regulating some aspect of higher \n     education.\n       In addition, there are more than 7,000 regulations \n     associated with Title IV student aid programs alone.\n       Seven cents of every tuition dollar is spent on government \n     regulations (Stanford University, 1997)\n       There are lots of regulators of higher education and even \n     more regulations issued by the Department.\n       (1) Appoint an Expert Panel to Review and Streamline \n     Department of Education Regulations\n       Panels, appointed by the Secretary, will review regulations \n     on financial aid, institutional eligibility, regulations \n     unrelated to the delivery of student aid and dissemination of \n     information requirements. The panel would then make \n     recommendations to the Secretary and the appropriate \n     Congressional committees on streamlining and eliminating \n     these regulations.\n       (2) One Size Does Not Fit All for Industry and Academic \n     Regulations\n       Fund a project by the National Research Council to develop \n     standards in environmental, health and safety areas to \n     provide for differential regulation of industrial facilities, \n     on the one hand, and research and teaching laboratories and \n     facilities on the other. The report will make specific \n     recommendations for statutory and regulatory changes that are \n     needed to develop such a differential approach.\n       (3) Accelerate Negotiated Rulemaking Process\n       The process, while somewhat successful, is costly, and \n     significantly delays implementation of regulations. This \n     process should be streamlined. This bill gives the Secretary \n     of Education the authority to engage in negotiated \n     rulemaking, but she is not required to do so if she decides \n     the process is too cumbersome or inefficient.\n       (4) Develop a Compliance Calendar\n       For financial aid programs alone, institutions must comply \n     with over 7,000 pages of regulations.\n       Each year, the Secretary will be required to provide \n     eligible institutions a list of the reporting and disclosure \n     requirements under the Higher Education Act to assist \n     institutions in complying with these requirements.\n       The list will include: (1) the date each report is required \n     to be completed and to be submitted, made available, or \n     disseminated; (2) the required recipients of each report, \n     including reports that must be kept on file for inspection \n     upon request; (3) any required method for transmittal or \n     dissemination; (4) a description of the content of each \n     report sufficient to allow the institution to identify the \n     appropriate individuals to be assigned the responsibility for \n     its preparation; (5) references to the statutory authority, \n     applicable regulations, and current guidance issued by the \n     Secretary regarding each report; and (6) any other \n     information which is pertinent to the content or distribution \n     of the report or disclosure.\n       (5) Reinstate two expiring provisions on disbursement of \n     student loans.\n       The first provision allows schools with cohort default \n     rates below 10 percent to disburse a loan in a single \n     installment rather than in multiple disbursements over the \n     year.\n       The second lets schools with low cohort default rates waive \n     the requirement that loan proceeds of a first-year, first-\n     time borrower loan be withheld for thirty days so that these \n     students can purchase books and supplies, pay housing costs, \n     and meet other expenses.\n       (6) Voter Registration Dissemination.\n       This bill clarifies that institutions can use electronic \n     means to meet the requirement to disseminate voter \n     registration forms to students. Electronic means will ensure \n     that dissemination to students occurs both effectively and \n     efficiently.\n\n\n   Eliminate or Alter the following Reporting Requirements in the HEA\n\n       (1) Application of Change of Ownership to non-profit \n     institutions\n\n[[Page S6752]]\n\n       The Department of Education applies provisions concerning \n     change of institutional ownership to nonprofit institutions, \n     despite clear expression of contrary congressional intent and \n     the common understanding that nonprofit institutions do not \n     have owners. This places unnecessary burdens on institutions, \n     and may act as a deterrent to governance changes intended to \n     make institutions more efficient and effective.\n       (2) Disclosure of Foreign Gifts\n       When an institution receives a foreign gift in excess of \n     $250,000 they must report it to the federal government. This \n     data is publicly available in the annual reports prepared by \n     every college and university and is carefully monitored for \n     public institutions by state governments. The Department of \n     Education reports that it never gets public requests for this \n     information. Institutions will no longer be required to \n     provide this information to the federal government, but make \n     it publicly available on an annual basis.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Martinez, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Talent, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Thune, and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 1262. A bill to reduce healthcare costs, improve efficiency, and \nimprove healthcare quality through the development of a nation-wide \ninteroperable health information technology system, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this morning I am pleased to be joined on \nthe floor by my distinguished colleague from the State of New York. \nTogether we share an important goal to improve health care quality and \nreduce costs through the use of health information technology tools.\n  I had the wonderful opportunity of spending 20 years as a physician \nand as a heart surgeon before coming to this body. Like most \nphysicians, I wanted to and, in fact, did use the very latest, most \nadvanced technology, anything that could possibly, in my practice, make \nmy patients live a healthier life, a better life, a more comfortable \nlife.\n  But amidst the artificial heart assist devices, the lasers that are \nused to remove lesions in the windpipe or the trachea, CT scan \nmachines, x-rays, digital x-rays, digital thermometers, doctors today, \nunfortunately, for the most part, keep patient records the very same \nway I did 10 years ago and, indeed, almost exactly as my dad did 60 \nyears ago as he practiced medicine, and that is handwritten on paper in \nmanila folders, typically stored in the basements of clinics or \ndoctors' offices or hospitals.\n  It is amazing because we design hospitals, structures on computers \ntoday, we conduct medical research with computers, we use computers in \nnearly every aspect of the clinical setting, the delivery of medicine. \nFrom very compact bedside monitors to these massive MRI scanners we \nhave today, computers power almost everything we use, everything we do \nin terms of diagnosis in medicine, in health care.\n  But--and this is what we have come to the floor to address--when it \ncomes to health information, when it comes to electronic medical \nrecords, we are in the stone age and not the information age.\n  Imagine a traveler far away from home who gets in an automobile \naccident and is taken unconscious or confused to a hospital. Paramedics \nrush them to a hospital, and at the very moment that individual arrives \nat the door of that emergency room, the emergency room physician meets \nthem, but emptyhanded, with no notification of allergies or past \nmedical history or preexisting illnesses, all of which is potentially \nlifesaving information. That is inexcusable in this day and age.\n  My colleague from New York knows this all too well.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to \nSenator Frist for his leadership on this issue because we certainly do \nneed to bring our health care system out of the information dark ages. \nI am pleased to be introducing this legislation today with the majority \nleader. It is a priority for both of us, and I look forward to \ncontinuing our partnership to move this legislation through the \nlegislative process.\n  For several years, I have been promoting the adoption of health \ninformation technology as a means to improve our health care system and \nbring it into the 21st century. I introduced health quality and \ninformation technology legislation in 2003 to jump-start the \nconversation on health IT. I am very pleased that I have had the \nopportunity now to work with the majority leader for more than a year \non realizing what we believe would work, that would enable patients, \nphysicians, nurses, hospitals--all--to have access electronically in a \nprivacy-protected way to health information.\n  We have a lot of challenges facing us in health care. We have a long \nway to go to achieve the goal of expanding access to quality, \naffordable health care for all Americans. But creating a health \ninformation technology infrastructure needs to be a key part of \nachieving our health care goals because we are facing an escalating \nhealth care crisis.\n  Information technology has radically changed business and other \naspects of our lives. It is time to use it to bring our health sector \ninto the information age.\n  Currently, the health industry spends 2 to 3 percent of its revenues \non information technology, compared to roughly 12 percent in industries \nsuch as finance or banking. That is why you can go to an ATM virtually \nanywhere in the world and access money from your bank account.\n  But despite evidence that greater investments could yield returns, we \nhave not put in place the necessary infrastructure to facilitate the \nnecessary investment in an interoperable health information technology \nand quality infrastructure.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this needs to change and it must change. We \nmust establish an interoperable privacy-protected electronic medical \nrecord for every American who wants one. Working together, our Nation \ncan confront these challenges, and we can build an interoperable \nnational health information technology system. We know it will save \nlives. We know it will save money. It will improve quality and it will \nlead to huge measurable progress in the medical field, in the health \nfield.\n  We face enormous problems as a result of the underinvestment in \nhealth information technology. No industry as important to our economy \nas health spends as little on information technology. Our Nation has \nnearly 900,000 doctors and over 2.8 million nurses. Americans visit a \ndoctor 900 million times per year. We have nearly 6,000 hospitals all \nover the country. Our health care system is enormous, yes, but it is \ndangerously fragmented. Even a small efficiency improvement can greatly \nreduce cost and improve quality, and there is plenty of room for \nimprovement.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I could not agree more. The majority \nleader comes to this debate with a lifetime of experience and \nexpertise. Researchers at Dartmouth University found that we waste as \nmuch as one-third of the $1.8 trillion we spend on health care on care \nthat is not necessary.\n  Doctors write over 2 billion prescriptions each year by hand. With \nall respect to my doctors, some are unclear or even illegible. \nHandwritten prescriptions filled incorrectly result in as many as 7,000 \ndeaths each year because we do not have access to a fail-safe system so \nthat providing the prescription electronically, which also would \ntrigger a response if it was interacting with another drug the patient \nwas taking, is not yet available.\n  With that data, it is difficult, sometimes even impossible, to track \nthe quality of care patients receive. We cannot reward good providers \nor work to improve those who provide inferior care.\n  Widening health care disparities really are a growing problem in our \nsociety. It is especially important because every moment that a doctor \nor a nurse spends with a patient is precious. For every hour that they \nspend with a patient, they spend one-half hour filling out those forms \nby hand. So we can save time, we can save money, and we can make it \nclear that this information will be easily electronically transportable \nwhere it is needed.\n  Mr. FRIST. The problem is enormous and the problem is real. So what \nare we going to do about it? Senator Clinton and I propose three \nconcrete steps to remedy these problems and establish a fully \ninteroperable information technology system. First, we must establish \nstandards for electronic medical records. Sharing data effectively \nrequires more than just that fiber optic\n\n[[Page S6753]]\n\ncable, more than those Internet connections. It requires standards and \nlaws that make it possible to exchange medical information in a \nprivacy-protected way throughout our Nation.\n  The Government should not impose these standards on the private \nsector, but it has a duty, and indeed it has an obligation, to lead the \nway. Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP, the Indian Health Service, and other \nFederal programs should lead the way and establish electronic health \nrecords for all of their clients.\n  The Veterans' Administration already leads the way with interoperable \nsystems, but we need to get the VA to be able to talk to the Department \nof Defense.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. That is absolutely the case, especially as we \ntragically know so many young people who have been injured in Iraq or \nAfghanistan move from the DOD to the VA. We have to have a better \nsystem so that they can know what needs to be done for these brave \nyoung men and women.\n  Secondly, we believe our legislation should work to reduce barriers \nand facilitate the electronic exchange of health information among \nproviders in a secure and private way to improve health care quality \nand meet community needs. When communities come together, as is \nbeginning to happen all over the country, the Federal Government should \nhelp them implement an interoperable health IT system.\n  Interoperable sounds like a confusing word, but it means they can \ntalk to each other, they can operate in the same overall system and do \nit in a way that complies with national standards. To speed up this \nprocess, we propose spending a total of $600 million--$125 million a \nyear, over 5 years--to begin the work of rolling out interoperable \nelectronic medical records systems around the Nation.\n  Finally, we must use the data we collect to focus intensely on \nimproving the quality of health care. Our medical system, which is, and \ndeserves to be, the envy of the world, still suffers from enormous and \nunpardonable disparities in the quality of care. Health IT will be a \ntool to help our dedicated health care professionals improve care, and \nefficiently, so that they spend more time at the bedside, more time at \nthe office visit, and less on paperwork.\n  Through this legislation, we will begin to collect consistent data on \nthe quality of health care delivered in America. As the largest health \ncare payer in the country, the Federal Government has a responsibility \nto begin that process of collecting data on its own health care \nprograms and share it with the public. Then, with this data, we can \nbegin to move to a health care system that actually rewards providers \nwho give their patients superior care.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as we talk about these systems and \nstandards and words such as interoperability, which, as the Senator \nfrom New York said, does mean being able to connect it all together, \npeople who are listening must ask: Well, how in the world do these \nelectronic health records and the appropriate use of that data bring \nconcrete benefits to them as individuals and to their families?\n  First, it will reduce waste and inefficiency in the system. It only \nmakes sense that fragmented systems, with no interconnectivity at all, \nhave inherent inefficiencies and waste. That is moved aside. That has a \nvery direct impact on lower costs, making health care more affordable \nand thus available for people broadly.\n  It improves quality. Right now we know that medical errors occur. Too \nmany medical errors occur in our health care system today. By the \napplication of technology, we can move those medical errors aside. They \nwill not occur and that improves quality.\n  They will empower patients. It gives that individual who is listening \nright now the knowledge and power to be able to participate in a \nconsumer-driven system where choices can be made, where the focus is on \nthe patient, that is provider friendly, that is driven by information \nand choice and empowerment to make that choice.\n  They will protect patient privacy and promote the secure exchange of \nlife-saving health information. It is spelled out in the legislation. \nIt is going to be privacy protected.\n  For the first time, they will seamlessly integrate this advancement \nin health information technology with quality measures, with quality \nadvancements, harmonizing and integrating them in a way that simply has \nnot been done in the past.\n  This proposal brings together people, as we can see, from across the \npolitical spectrum, and it will unlock the potential of medical \ninformation technology for all Americans.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I am delighted to be working on this very important \nnational initiative with the majority leader because we are at a \npivotal moment. Pockets of innovation and investment are developing all \nover the country. In my State, places like Rochester, NY, and in the \nmajority leader's State, the Tri-Cities region of Tennessee, health \ncare providers, employers and community groups are beginning the \nprocess of building a health information technology network. That is a \npositive first step, but it could be either a last step or a misstep \nbecause to truly achieve the promise of health information technology, \nwe must ensure that these efforts do not become silos. In other words, \nthere is one system for every hospital, one system for every clinical \npractice. They cannot talk to each other. So a person goes to one \ndoctor. Their doctor is in New York, but they travel to Tennessee to \nvisit friends, they are in an accident, and nobody knows how to get the \ninformation that will give them the best possible treatment.\n  So if we do this right, this comprehensive legislation will create a \nhealth information technology framework that improves quality, protects \npatient privacy and ensures interoperability through the adoption of \nhealth IT standards and quality measures.\n  We are marrying technology and quality to create a seamless, \nefficient health care system for the 21st century. I thank the majority \nleader, who has brought so much interest and expertise to this, for \nbeing a leader and making this happen in the next 18 months.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank my colleague in this endeavor. As mentioned \nearlier, we began working on the information technology aspects of \nhealth care about a year ago and published our first op-ed together \nabout July of last year.\n  In closing, this is not going to be an easy process. I look back at \nthe technology in my past in medicine for 20 years, but then also in my \ndad's practice; he practiced medicine for 55 years. I remember he had \none of the very earliest electrocardiogram, EKG, machines in the State \nof Tennessee. At that time--because there were so few machines and so \nfew cardiologists--he would take referrals from all over the State of \nTennessee. The machine itself was bigger than the desk before me, at \nthe time.\n  What would happen then is, if there was a machine in a little rural \ncommunity 100 miles away from Nashville, the machine there would take a \npiece of paper, they would run it through, they would send it by mail. \nIt would take 2 days to get to Nashville. Dad would read it and send it \nback. Four days later, that doctor would be able to read that EKG.\n  Then, when I was about 9 or 10 years of age--because their bedroom \nwas right around the corner from mine--I remember so well when he \ninstalled a telephone to put another big box there to have the first in \nTennessee again of a machine--and it was amazing at the time--one could \ntransmit these EKGs electronically over the telephone wire and have it \ninterpreted at the bedside. He would keep it there because people, of \ncourse, have heart attacks in the middle of the night. Then it would \ntake probably about 30 or 40 minutes to get the result back.\n  Of course, today we are at a point where with a little tiny machine, \nan EKG machine, we can get an instantaneous readout not just of the \npaper and of the EKG but the result actually read by the box.\n  I have been able to see huge progress in my own life and watching my \ndad's practice and my practice. Now we need to see all of that sort of \nprogress condensed, applied not just to the technology but to the \ncollection of information, the promotion of electronic health records, \nand the appropriate sharing of that information which is privacy \nprotected. That is the sort of progress we are going to see. We are \ngoing to see it come alive on the Senate floor and with the House and \nwork\n\n[[Page S6754]]\n\nin concert with the President of the United States to make sure that \nthe great advantages, in terms of lowering costs, getting rid of \ninefficiencies, and promoting quality will be realized.\n  The bill that we will shortly introduce does present a comprehensive \napproach of medical information and the use of medical information as \nwe address our health care challenges. It provides that important \nbackbone and critical building block for a better, a stronger, and a \nmore responsive health care system for all Americans.\n  Again, I thank my distinguished colleague from New York. We urge all \nof our colleagues to look at this bill and support this bill. With this \nlegislation, there is no doubt in my mind that we will, yes, help save \nmoney and help save time, but most importantly we will save lives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill we will shortly \nsend to the desk be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators Frist and \nClinton in introducing the Health Technology to Enhance Quality Act of \n2005.\n  Our national health care system is in crisis. Forty-five million \nAmericans are uninsured, and this number continues to rise. Health care \ncosts are increasing at almost double digit rates. Millions of \nAmericans are suffering, and dying, from diseases such as diabetes or \nAIDS that could have been prevented or delayed for many years. And the \nchance of Americans receiving the right care, at the right time and for \nthe right reason is no greater than the flip of a coin.\n  These health care issues are varied and complex, as are the \nsolutions. But, as one of my constituents advised, it is time for us in \nthe Congress to put on our hard hats, pick up our tool belts and get to \nwork fixing our broken health care system.\n  One place to start is by bringing the health care system into the \n21st century. In our lifetimes, we have seen some of the greatest \nadvances in the history of technology and the sharing of information. \nYet, in our health care system, too much care is still provided with a \npen and paper. Too much information about patients is not shared \nbetween doctors or readily available to them in the first place. And \nproviders too often do not have the information to know what care has \nworked most effectively and efficiently to make patients healthy.\n  Mistakes are easily made--medical errors alone kill up to 98,000 \npeople a year, more people than the number who die from AIDS each year.\n  But embracing 21st century technology is not just about reducing \nerrors and improving the quality of medical care. It is also about \ncost.\n  We spend nearly $1.5 trillion a year on health care in America. But a \nquarter of that money--one out of every four dollars--is spent on non-\nmedical costs--most of it on bills and paperwork. Every transaction you \nmake at a bank now costs them less than a penny. Yet, because we have \nnot updated technology in the rest of the health care industry, a \nsingle transaction still costs up to $25--not one dime of which goes \ntoward improving the quality of our health care.\n  The Health Technology to Enhance Quality Act of 2005 is going to help \nbring the health care system into the 21st century. This bill will lead \nto the development and implementation of health information technology \nstandards to ensure interoperability of health information systems. The \nlegislation codifies the Office of National Coordinator for Information \nTechnology and establishes standards for the electronic exchange of \nhealth information. The bill also provides grant funding to support \ndevelopment of health information technology infrastructure as well as \nmeasurement of the quality of care provided to patients.\n  This legislation will help our health care system take a huge step \nforward. A vote for the Health TEQ Act is a vote for health care that \nis safe, effective, and affordable. I urge my colleagues to join us in \npassing this bill quickly.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1262\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act to establish \neligibility requirements for business concerns to receive awards under \nthe Small Business Innovation Research Program; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the United States biotechnology industry is \nthe world leader in innovation. This is due, in large part, to the \nFederal Government's partnership with the private sector to foster \ngrowth and commercialization in the hope that one day we will uncover a \ncure for unmet medical needs such as cystic fibrosis, heart disease, \nvarious cancers, multiple sclerosis, and AIDS.\n  However, the industry was dealt a major setback last year when the \nSmall Business Administration--SBA--determined that venture-backed \nbiotechnology companies can no longer\n\n[[Page S6759]]\n\nparticipate in the Small Business Innovation Research--SBIR--program. \nPrior to the SBA's decision, the SBIR program was an example of a \nhighly successful Federal initiative to encourage economic growth and \ninnovation in the biotechnology industry by funding the critical \nstartup and development stages of a company.\n  Traditionally, to qualify for an SBIR grant a small business \napplicant had to meet two requirements: one, that the company have less \nthan 500 employees; and two, that the business be 51 percent owned by \none or more individuals. Now, according to the SBA, the term \n``individuals'' means natural persons only, whereas for the past 20 \nyears the term ``individual'' has included venture-capital companies. \nAs a result, biotech companies backed by venture-capital funding in \nMissouri and throughout our Nation, who are on the cutting edge of \nscience, can no longer participate in the program.\n  The biotech industry is like no other in the world because it takes \nsuch a long span of time and intense capital expenditures to bring a \nsuccessful product to market. In fact, according to a study completed \nby the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, it takes roughly \n10-15 years and $800 million for a company to bring just one product to \nmarket. As you can imagine, the industry's entrepreneurs are seeking \nfinancial assistance wherever they can find it.\n  For the past 20 years, the SBIR program has been a catalyst for \ndeveloping our Nation's most successful biotechnology companies. In \naddition to these important government grants, venture capital funding \nplays a vital role in the financial support of these same companies. \nThe strength of our biotechnology industry is a direct result of \ngovernment grants and venture capital working together.\n  However, some have argued that a biotech firm with a majority venture \ncapital backing is a large business. This is simply a bogus conclusion. \nVenture capital firms solely invest in biotech start-ups for the \npossibility of a future innovation and financial return and generally \ndo not seek to take control over the management functions or day-to-day \noperations of the company. Venture capital firms that seek to invest in \nsmall biotech businesses do not, simply by their investment, turn a \nsmall business into a large business. These are legitimate, small, \nstart-up businesses. Let's not punish them.\n  Instead, we must work together to avoid stifling innovation. Let me \nbe clear. Our impact today will foster cures and medicines tomorrow \nthat were once thought to be inconceivable. However, the industry \ncannot do it alone. We must nurture biotechnology and help the industry \ngrow for the future of our economy and for our well-being.\n  This bill that I am introducing today will do just that. It will \nensure that the biotechnology industry has access to SBIR grants, as it \nhas had for 20 years. It will level the playing field to ensure that \nSBIR grants are given to small businesses based on fruitful science and \nnothing else. This is still a young and fragile industry, and we are on \nthe cusp of great scientific advances. However, there will be profound \nconsequences if biotechnology companies continue to be excluded from \nthe SBIR program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that text of the bill be in \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1263\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the provision by hospitals of \nemergency contraceptives to women, and post-exposure prophylaxis for \nsexually transmitted disease to individuals, who are survivors of \nsexual assault; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nCompassionate Assistance for Rape Emergencies Act. In the United \nStates, more than 300,000 women are raped each year and an estimated \n25,000 to 32,000 become pregnant as a result. That is why I am \nreintroducing the Compassionate Assistance\n\n[[Page S6760]]\n\nin Rape Emergencies Act, or CARE Act.\n  This bill will ensure that women who are survivors of sexual assault \nhave access to the medical care they need, including emergency \ncontraception. Emergency contraception reduces a woman's risk of \nbecoming pregnant by up to 89 percent when taken within 72 hours of the \nassault. I want to be clear: emergency contraception does not end a \npregnancy. Instead, emergency contraception works before a pregnancy \ncan occur.\n  There is widespread consensus in the medical community that emergency \ncontraception is safe and effective. Yet, New Jersey is one of only six \nStates that legally require all medical providers to offer this care to \nrape survivors. Before this law, one-third of New Jersey's hospitals \ndid not provide this vital medication. New Jersey's law should be the \nnational standard. The bill would require that all hospitals that \nreceive Federal funding offer information and access to emergency \ncontraception for victims of rape.\n  In January of this year I, along with 21 Senators, wrote a letter to \nthe Department of Justice asking that they include information about \nemergency contraception in their national protocol for sexual assault \nhospital examinations. But they did not. In all 141 pages, the protocol \nfails to provide sexual assault victims with access to this needed \ninformation and treatment. The protocol instead leaves the door open \nfor health care professionals to decide whether or not to discuss \ncertain treatment options. Today, I want to close that door.\n  In order to provide comprehensive medical care, hospitals must also \nprovide quick access to preventive medication that helps protect \nvictims of sexual assault from potentially fatal sexually transmitted \ndiseases, such as HIV and hepatitis B. We have an obligation to protect \nsexual assault victims from these life threatening infections.\n  We must not sit idly by while so many sexual assault survivors are \ndeprived the medical care they need and deserve. Once these survivors \nseek treatment we ought to make sure that they get the treatment they \nneed. Ideology should never stand between patients and the care they \ndeserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1264\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Compassionate Assistance for \n     Rape Emergencies Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) It is estimated that 25,000 to 32,000 women become \n     pregnant each year as a result of rape or incest. An \n     estimated 22,000 of these pregnancies could be prevented if \n     rape survivors had timely access to emergency contraception.\n       (2) A 1996 study of rape-related pregnancies (published in \n     the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology) found that \n     50 percent of the pregnancies described in paragraph (1) \n     ended in abortion.\n       (3) Surveys have shown that many hospitals do not routinely \n     provide emergency contraception to women seeking treatment \n     after being sexually assaulted.\n       (4) The risk of pregnancy after sexual assault has been \n     estimated to be 4.7 percent in survivors who were not \n     protected by some form of contraception at the time of the \n     attack.\n       (5) The Food and Drug Administration has declared emergency \n     contraception to be safe and effective in preventing \n     unintended pregnancy, reducing the risk by as much as 89 \n     percent if taken within days of unprotected intercourse and \n     up to 95 percent if taken in the first 24 hours.\n       (6) Medical research strongly indicates that the sooner \n     emergency contraception is administered, the greater the \n     likelihood of preventing unintended pregnancy.\n       (7) In light of the safety and effectiveness of emergency \n     contraceptive pills, both the American Medical Association \n     and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n     have endorsed more widespread availability of such pills.\n       (8) The American College of Emergency Physicians and the \n     American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists agree \n     that offering emergency contraception to female patients \n     after a sexual assault should be considered the standard of \n     care.\n       (9) Approximately 30 percent of American women of \n     reproductive age are unaware of the availability of emergency \n     contraception.\n       (10) New data from a survey of women having abortions \n     estimates that 51,000 abortions were prevented by use of \n     emergency contraception in 2000 and that increased use of \n     emergency contraception accounted for 43 percent of the \n     decrease in total abortions between 1994 and 2000.\n       (11) It is essential that all hospitals that provide \n     emergency medical treatment provide emergency contraception \n     as a treatment option to any woman who has been sexually \n     assaulted, so that she may prevent an unintended pregnancy.\n       (12) Victims of sexual assault are at increased risk of \n     contracting sexually transmitted diseases.\n       (13) Some sexually-transmitted infections cannot be \n     reliably cured if treatment is delayed, and may result in \n     high morbidity and mortality. HIV has killed over 520,000 \n     Americans, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     currently estimates that over 1,000,000 Americans are \n     infected with the virus. Even modern drug treatment has \n     failed to cure infected individuals. Nearly 80,000 Americans \n     are infected with hepatitis B each year, with some \n     individuals unable to fully recover. An estimated 1,250,000 \n     Americans remain chronically infected with the hepatitis B \n     virus and at present, one in five of these may expect to die \n     of liver failure.\n       (14) It is possible to prevent some sexually transmitted \n     diseases by treating an exposed individual promptly. The use \n     of post-exposure prophylaxis using antiretroviral drugs has \n     been demonstrated to effectively prevent the establishment of \n     HIV infection. Hepatitis B infection may also be eliminated \n     if an exposed individual receives prompt treatment.\n       (15) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \n     recommended risk evaluation and appropriate application of \n     post-exposure treatment for victims of sexual assault. For \n     such individuals, immediate treatment is the only means to \n     prevent a life threatening infection.\n       (16) It is essential that all hospitals that provide \n     emergency medical treatment provide assessment and treatment \n     of sexually-transmitted infections to minimize the harm to \n     victims of sexual assault.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to make grants and loans available to States and \nother organizations to strengthen the economy, public health, and \nenvironment of the United States by reducing emissions from diesel \nengines; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I speak as Chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate Change, and Nuclear \nSafety to introduce a landmark, bipartisan piece of legislation--the \nDiesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005.\n  This bill is cosponsored by Environment and Public Works Committee \nJim Inhofe and ranking member Jim Jeffords and Senators Tom Carper, \nJohnny Isakson, Hillary Clinton, Kay Bailey Hutchison, and Dianne \nFeinstein. Focused on improving air quality and protecting public \nhealth, it would establish voluntary national and state-level grant and \nloan programs to promote the reduction of diesel emissions. \nAdditionally, the bill would help areas come into attainment for the \nnew air quality standards.\n  Developed with environmental, industry, and public officials, the \nlegislation complements Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, \nregulations now being implemented that address diesel fuel and new \ndiesel engines. I am pleased to be joined by a strong and diverse group \nof organizations and officials: Environmental Defense; Clean Air Task \nForce; Union of Concerned Scientists; Ohio Environmental Council; \nCaterpillar Inc.; Cummins Inc.; Diesel Technology Forum; Emissions \nControl Technology Association; Associated General Contractors of \nAmerica; State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators/\nAssociation of Local Air Pollution Control Officials; Ohio \nEnvironmental Protection Agency; Regional Air Pollution Control Agency \nin Dayton, Ohio; Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission.\n  The cosponsors of this legislation and these groups do not agree on \nmany issues--which is why this bill is so special.\n  The process for developing this legislation began last year when \nseveral of these organizations came in to meet with me. They informed \nme of the harmful public health impact of diesel emissions. Onroad and \nnonroad diesel vehicles and engines account for roughly one-half of the \nnitrogen oxide and particulate matter mobile source emissions \nnationwide.\n  I was pleased to hear that the administration had taken strong action \nwith new diesel fuel and engine regulations, which were developed in a \ncollaborative effort to substantially reduce diesel emissions. However, \nI was told that the full health benefit would not be realized until \n2030 because these regulations address new engines and the estimated 11 \nmillion existing engines have a long life.\n  I was pleased that they had a constructive suggestion on how we could \naddress this problem. They informed me of successful grant and loan \nprograms at the State and local level throughout the Nation that were \nworking on a voluntary basis to retrofit diesel engines.\n  I was also cognizant that the new ozone and particulate matter air \nquality standards were going into effect and that a voluntary program \nwas needed to help the nation's 495 and Ohio's 38 nonattainment \ncounties--especially those that are in moderate nonattainment like \nNortheast Ohio.\n  Additionally, I have visited with University of Cincinnati Medical \nCenter doctors--as recently as this month--to discuss their Cincinnati \nChildhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study. Some of the early results \nindicate disturbing impacts on the development of children living near \nhighways.\n  It became clear to me that a national program was needed. We then \nformed a strong, diverse coalition comprised of environmental, \nindustry, and public officials. The culmination of this work is being \nrevealed today in the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005.\n  This legislation would establish voluntary national and State-level \ngrant and loan programs to promote the reduction of diesel emissions. \nIt would authorize $1 billion over 5 years--$200 million annually. Some \nwill claim that this is too much money and others will claim it is not \nenough--which is probably why it is just right.\n  We should first recognize that the need far outpaces what is \ncontained in the legislation. This funding is also fiscally responsible \nas diesel retrofits have proven to be one of the most cost-effective \nemissions reduction strategies. Furthermore, as a former Governor, I \nknow firsthand that the new air quality standards are an unfunded \nmandate on our states and localities--and they need the Federal \nGovernment's help.\n\n[[Page S6762]]\n\n  This legislation would help bring counties into attainment by \nencouraging the retrofitting or replacement of diesel engines, \nsubstantially reducing diesel emissions and the formation of ozone and \nparticulate matter.\n  The bill is efficient with the Federal Government's dollars in \nseveral ways. First, 20 percent of the funding would be distributed to \nStates that establish voluntary diesel retrofit programs. 10 percent of \nthe bill's overall funding would be set aside as an incentive for \nStates to match the Federal dollars being provided. The remaining 70 \npercent of the program would be administered by the EPA.\n  Second, the program would focus on nonattainment areas where help is \nneeded the most. Third, it would require at least 50 percent of the \nFederal program to be used on public fleets since we are talking about \npublic dollars. Fourth, it would place a high priority on the projects \nthat are the most cost effective and affect the most people.\n  Lastly, the bill would include provisions to help develop new \ntechnologies, encourage more action through non-financial incentives, \nand require EPA to outreach to stakeholders and report on the success \nof the program.\n  EPA estimates that this billion dollar program would leverage an \nadditional $500 million leading to a net benefit of almost $20 billion \nwith a reduction of about 70,000 tons of particulate matter. This is a \n13 to 1 benefit-cost ratio.\n  The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005 enjoys broad bipartisan \nsupport, and it is needed desperately. I plan to work with the bill's \ncosponsors and the coalition to use every avenue to get it signed into \nlaw as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1265\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \nto reauthorize the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for \nUndergraduate Programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, our country is facing a crisis. Too many \nof our young people leave high school without the skills necessary to \nmeet the demands of a global economy. According to a recent U.S. \nChamber of Commerce survey, 75 percent of employers report severe \ndifficulties when trying to hire qualified workers, with 40 percent of \njob applicants having poor skills. As many as 3.3 million jobs may be \nsent overseas in the next 15 years, causing American workers to lose \n$136 billion in wages. The strength of our economy, and the future of \nour nation, largely rests on our ability to improve educational \nopportunities for all of our citizens.\n  An educated, skilled, and flexible workforce is essential to building \na strong and dynamic economy, and, if we are going to maintain our \ncountry's ability to compete in a global economy, we must help prepare \nyoung people to meet the demands of the 21st century workforce. I \nintroduce legislation that will ensure more students graduate high \nschool ready for college and the workforce.\n  Only 68 percent of all students in the U.S. graduate high school on \ntime with a regular diploma. And, the numbers are worse if the student \nis Hispanic, African American, Native American, has a disability, or is \nmale. Sadly, a recent report indicates that students are dropping out \nat a younger age, resulting in an even less educated workforce.\n  For students who graduate with a high school diploma, too few go on \ndirectly to college. Astonishingly, only 38 percent of high school \nfreshmen will earn a high school diploma and make the immediate \ntransition to college directly after graduation. In New Mexico, the \nstatistics are pretty staggering. For every 50 ninth graders in New \nMexico, only 30 will graduate high school; 18 will enter college; 11 \nare still enrolled in their sophomore year; and 5.5 graduate from \ncollege within 6 years. We must do better.\n  We also know, unfortunately, that as many as 40 percent of this \ncountry's high school graduates are not prepared to meet the demands of \ncollege or a\n\n[[Page S6764]]\n\ncompetitive workforce. A survey of college professors reveals that half \nof all public school graduates are not adequately prepared to do \ncollege-level math or writing.\n  There is some good news, however; we know what works. Research \nconducted by the Department of Education shows that the single best \npredictor of college success is the quality and level of a student's \nhigh school classes. Students who take a solid college prep curriculum \nare less likely to need remedial classes, and are more likely to earn a \ncollege degree. In fact, evidence shows that the intensity and quality \nof high school curriculum is the greatest measure of completion of a \nbachelor's degree. Importantly, studies also show that not only do \ncollege-bound students benefit from rigorous courses, but that all \nstudents benefit from more rigorous coursework. Accordingly, it is \ncritical that all of our young people have access to rigorous \ncoursework in secondary school in order to meet the demands of \npostsecondary education and a competitive workforce.\n  Therefore, I introduce legislation that builds on this research and \nworks toward a goal of ensuring that all secondary school students are \nenrolled in classes that prepare them to excel in college and in the \nworkplace.\n  The GEAR UP program, Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for \nUndergraduate Programs, was first authorized in 1998 and was designed \nto promote student achievement and access to postsecondary education \namong low-income students. Since that time, GEAR UP grants have served \nover a million students per year. In my home State of New Mexico, there \nare six GEAR UP programs that serve thousands of students in many \ndifferent ways, including by instituting reading and math programs, \ntaking students to colleges so they can begin to imagine themselves on \na college campus, creating science fairs and technology training \nseminars, providing career and financial counseling, and many other \nvital services. And, the individuals who work with GEAR UP programs are \nsome of the most dedicated professionals I have met.\n\n  I believe we can build on the successes of GEAR UP to ensure more \nstudents leave high school prepared for the academic rigor of college \nand a competitive workforce. My legislation, called Gearing Up for \nAcademic Success, will support and strengthen GEAR UP so that it \npromotes lasting and systemic change in the schools served by the GEAR \nUP grant.\n  The legislation places a particular focus on encouraging more \nstudents to take college preparation courses, especially those who are \nat risk for dropping out of school. But, it also builds capacity within \nthe school so that activities funded with a GEAR UP grant benefit not \nonly the students who receive the services, but also future cohorts of \nstudents who enter GEAR UP schools after the initial grants have ended.\n  My legislation does not change the fundamental structure of GEAR UP; \nit maintains States and partnerships as eligible entities. The \nlegislation, however, changes the focus and the types of activities the \neligible entities must engage in. Eligible entities will now be \nrequired to provide activities that ensure more students participate in \ncollege preparation coursework. Further, my legislation requires the \nactivities to be designed so as to benefit both current students as \nwell as future cohorts of students.\n  As in current law, partnerships are comprised of school districts, \ninstitutions of higher education, and community organizations. The \nlegislation also retains the focus on cohorts of students that exists \nin current law by requiring grantees to serve one grade level of \nstudents, beginning not later than the 7th grade, through the 12th \ngrade. Unlike current law, however, partnerships will now be required \nto provide activities designed to ensure the secondary school \ncompletion and college enrollment of this cohort of students. The \nlegislation will also require the partnership to focus on developing a \nmore rigorous curriculum and on professional development opportunities \nfor teachers of college prep courses. Consequently, future cohorts of \nstudents would benefit from the more rigorous curriculum and the \nprofessional development available to the teachers.\n  Partnerships may also engage in a wide variety of other activities \npermissible under current law, including providing mentoring and \nadvising, creating summer programs at institutions of higher education, \nproviding skills assessment, personal and family counseling, financial \naid counseling, and activities designed to foster parent involvement in \nissues surrounding completion of high school and the attainment of a \ncollege education.\n  The State can play a more effective role in ensuring students \ngraduate high school prepared for college, and accordingly, my \nlegislation requires State grantees to focus on two types of \nactivities. First, the State would be required to provide policy \nleadership to promote college readiness of students in the State, \nparticularly those who are at risk of dropping out of school and those \nwho are economically disadvantaged. And, second, the State will be \nresponsible for promoting coordination and information sharing among \nall GEAR UP grantees in the state, providing technical assistance and \ntraining, disseminating information about best practices, and providing \nopportunities for eligible partnerships to coordinate their efforts.\n  This program is so worthwhile, and leadership at the State level is \nabsolutely critical, and accordingly, propose changing the formula to \nmake funds available to every State. When appropriations for GEAR UP \nexceed $400,000,000 per year, one third of the funds will be made \navailable to each State by formula. The remainder of the allocation \nwill go to eligible partnerships on a competitive basis.\n  We all can agree that it is in our national interest to ensure that \nall of our students leave high school prepared to meet the demands of \nthe 21st century workforce. This legislation provides an opportunity to \nsystemically change the way our secondary schools prepare all students \nfor college and a competitive workforce. I ask unanimous consent the \ntext of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1267\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, Senators Collins, Dodd, McCain, Biden, \nLeahy and I are submitting a resolution expressing support for the 1998 \nGood Friday Agreement as the blueprint for lasting peace in Northern \nIreland. All of us are hopeful that a constructive way forward will be \nfound, and the way to do so is by continuing to implement the Good \nFriday Agreement.\n  The 1998 agreement was endorsed in a referendum by the overwhelming \nmajority of people in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland. \nThe parties to the Good Friday Agreement made a clear commitment to \n``partnership, equality, and mutual respect'' as the basis for moving \nforward to end the long-standing conflict and achieve lasting peace for \nall the people of Northern Ireland. The parties to the agreement \naffirmed their ``total and absolute commitment to exclusively \ndemocratic and peaceful means'' to achieve the goal of peace.\n  Our resolution reiterates the support for the agreement as the way \nforward in Northern Ireland. It rejects the statement of Democratic \nUnionist leader Ian Paisley, who said in May that the Good Friday \nAgreement ``should be given a reasonable burial.'' Inclusive power \nsharing based on the defining qualities of the agreement is essential \nto the viability and success of the peace process.\n  The resolution calls on the Irish Republican Army to immediately \ncomplete the process of decommissioning, cease to exist as a \nparamilitary organization, and end its involvement in any way in \nparamilitary and criminal activity. We know that discussion of the \nissue is underway within the IRA, and we all await a final, positive, \nand decisive action.\n  In addition, the resolution calls on the Democratic Unionist Party in \nNorthern Ireland to share power with all the other parties, according \nto the democratic mandate of the Good Friday Agreement, and commit to \nwork in good faith with all the institutions established under the \nagreement, including the Executive and the North-South Ministerial \nCouncil, to benefit all the people of Northern Ireland.\n  It calls on Sinn Fein to work in good faith with the Police Service \nof Northern Ireland.\n  It also calls for justice in the case of Robert McCartney, the \nBelfast citizen who was brutally murdered there in January.\n  Finally, the resolution calls on the British Government to \npermanently restore the democratic institutions of Northern Ireland and \ncomplete the process of demilitarization in Northern Ireland and \nadvance equality and human rights in Northern Ireland.\n  The U.S. Government continues to strongly support the peace process \nin Northern Ireland. The Government of the United Kingdom and the \nGovernment of Ireland continue to strongly support the Good Friday \nAgreement as the way forward.\n  The Good Friday Agreement is the only way forward in Northern \nIreland, and it deserves our strong support.

RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF MTBE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) since 1979, methyl tertiary butyl ether (referred to in \n     this section as ``MTBE'') has been used nationwide at low \n     levels in gasoline to replace lead as an octane booster or \n     anti-knocking agent;\n       (2) Public Law 101-549 (commonly known as the ``Clean Air \n     Act Amendments of 1990'') (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) \n     established a fuel oxygenate standard under which \n     reformulated gasoline must contain at least 2 percent oxygen \n     by weight;\n       (3) at the time of the adoption of the fuel oxygenate \n     standard, Congress was aware that--\n       (A) increased use of MTBE could result from the adoption of \n     that standard; and\n\n[[Page S6774]]\n\n       (B) the use of MTBE would likely be needed to implement \n     that standard;\n       (4) Congress is aware that gasoline and its component \n     additives have leaked from storage tanks, with consequences \n     for water quality;\n       (5) the fuel industry responded to the fuel oxygenate \n     standard established by Public Law 101-549 by making \n     substantial investments in--\n       (A) MTBE production capacity; and\n       (B) systems to deliver MTBE-containing gasoline to the \n     marketplace;\n       (6) when leaked or spilled into the environment, MTBE may \n     cause serious problems of drinking water quality;\n       (7) in recent years, MTBE has been detected in water \n     sources throughout the United States;\n       (8) MTBE can be detected by smell and taste at low \n     concentrations;\n       (9) while small quantities of MTBE can render water \n     supplies unpalatable, the precise human health effects of \n     MTBE consumption at low levels are yet unknown as of the date \n     of enactment of this Act;\n       (10) in the report entitled ``Achieving Clean Air and Clean \n     Water: The Report of the Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in \n     Gasoline'' and dated September 1999, Congress was urged--\n       (A) to eliminate the fuel oxygenate standard;\n       (B) to greatly reduce use of MTBE; and\n       (C) to maintain the environmental performance of \n     reformulated gasoline;\n       (11) Congress has--\n       (A) reconsidered the relative value of MTBE in gasoline; \n     and\n       (B) decided to eliminate use of MTBE as a fuel additive;\n       (12) the timeline for elimination of use of MTBE as a fuel \n     additive must be established in a manner that achieves an \n     appropriate balance among the goals of--\n       (A) environmental protection;\n       (B) adequate energy supply; and\n       (C) reasonable fuel prices; and\n       (13) it is appropriate for Congress to provide some limited \n     transition assistance--\n       (A) to merchant producers of MTBE who produced MTBE in \n     response to a market created by the oxygenate requirement \n     contained in the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.); and\n       (B) for the purpose of mitigating any fuel supply problems \n     that may result from elimination of a widely-used fuel \n     additive.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (1) to eliminate use of MTBE as a fuel oxygenate; and\n       (2) to provide assistance to merchant producers of MTBE in \n     making the transition from producing MTBE to producing other \n     fuel additives.\n       (c) Authority for Water Quality Protection From Fuels.--\n     Section 211(c) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(c)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)(A)--\n       (A) by inserting ``fuel or fuel additive or'' after \n     ``Administrator any'';

I would like to congratulate Skip and his family \nand wish them the best in this new endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6779-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the \nconsideration of S. Res. 174, which was submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 174) recognizing Burmese democracy \n     activist and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi as a \n     symbol of the struggle for freedom in Burma.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I would just like to add a real note of \nappreciation to an individual, Jackson Cox, who has spent much time \nfocusing on this issue of Burmese democracy.\n  The resolution sponsored by Senators McConnell and Feinstein is a \nresolution celebrating the tremendous struggle for freedom in Burma. \nJackson Cox is someone for whom I have tremendous respect, who has \nfocused on that initiative. I do want to recognize his tremendous work.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, along with my colleagues from \nCalifornia, Arizona, Tennessee and Indiana, I support this resolution \nrecognizing Burmese democracy activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate \nAung San Suu Kyi as a symbol of the struggle for freedom in Burma.\n  While many may know of the horrors committed in Burma by the \nillegitimate State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, and the \ncourage, dignity and determination of Suu Kyi and her compatriots in \nthe face of this repression, some people may be unaware that June 19 \nmarks Suu Kyi's 60th birthday.\n  I would like nothing more than to pick up the telephone and call her \nin Rangoon to give her best wishes on her birthday. However, I cannot. \nNor can anyone else. Suu Kyi remains under house arrest by the SPDC.\n  In addition to my colleagues in the Unofficial Burma Caucus in the \nSenate--Senators Feinstein, McCain, Frist and Lugar to name but a few--\nit is important to recognize the expressions of support for Suu Kyi and \ndemocracy in Burma by other stalwarts of freedom, including Georgian \nPresident Mikheil Saakashvili, Mongolian Prime Minister Elbegdorj \nTskahiagiin, former Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel, former \nMalaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, and a litany of fellow \nNobel Peace Prize recipients. I ask that statements by President \nSaakashvili and Prime Minister Elbegdorj be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me close by reiterating the call for the immediate \nand unconditional release of Suu Kyi and all prisoners of conscience in \nBurma. I urge Secretary of State Rice to encourage regional neighbors \nand allies to redouble their efforts to support freedom in Burma when \nshe attends the 12th Association of Southeast Asian Nations regional \nforum, and post-ministerial meetings in Laos.\n  Happy birthday, Suu Kyi. You continue to be in our thoughts and \nprayers.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     Statement in Support of Aung San Suu Kyi and Freedom in Burma\n\n       I want to extend my warm greetings to those attending this \n     important ceremony and most of all to offer my heartfelt \n     support to Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. It is \n     a tragedy that she could not be celebrating her birthday \n     among her family, friends and the Burmese people. Her \n     continued jailing is a powerful symbol of the strength of \n     Burma's democracy movement and the weakness of those trying \n     to block this country's path to freedom.\n       There are those who try to argue that democracy and \n     individual rights are Western ideals. How wrong they are. In \n     Mongolia, our constitution guarantees the right to life, \n     religious tolerance, the right to own property, the right to \n     a free press and free expression, and for the public to bring \n     grievances before their democratically elected \n     representatives. These are not Western ideals, these are \n     rights that each of us inherit at birth from our Supreme \n     Creator.\n       Today, Burma is ruled by a military regime that inflicts \n     death, terror and fear on the people in their struggle to \n     maintain power. History as written by the Czechs, Poles, \n     Hungarians, Serbs, Georgians, Ukrainians, Romanians, \n     Indonesians, we Mongolians and many others has proven that \n     freedom in the face of tyranny will triumph. Burma's generals \n     should take this history to heart.\n       Friends, it is up to each of us living in free societies to \n     reach out and help those living under oppression to find \n     their freedom. I can assure the Burmese people of one thing: \n     No dictatorship, no military regime, no authoritarian \n     government can stand against the collective will of a people \n     determined to be tree.\n       Tonight, as darkness settles across Mongolia, I will light \n     a candle and place it in the front window of my residence as \n     a symbol of hope and support for the Burmese people and Aung \n     San Suu Kyi--Prime Minister Elbegdorj Tskahiagiin.\n                                  ____\n\n\nStatement by President Mikheil Saakashvili in Commemoration of Aung San \n                     Suu Kyi and Democracy in Burma\n\n       On behalf of the Georgian people I want to extend our \n     collective greetings to the Senators, Congressmen, and \n     freedom activists gathered here in support of Nobel Peace \n     Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. Her continued arrest by \n     Burma's military junta is an outrage, her courage in the face \n     of terror and intimidation serves as an inspiration to those \n     throughout the world who cherish freedom and democracy.\n       In 1990 the Burmese people voted overwhelmingly in \n     parliamentary elections for Aung San Suu Kyi and her National \n     League for Democracy (NLD) to lead them into a new era based \n     on democratic governance. The junta has refused to recognize \n     the results of this election. Each day they must wage war on \n     the Burmese people, using murder, terror and intimidation, to \n     keep their hold on power. This is a war they are destined to \n     lose.\n       We in Georgia understand first-hand what it is like to live \n     under tyranny and the sacrifices necessary to gain liberty. \n     Following\n\n[[Page S6780]]\n\n     the collapse of Soviet rule, Georgians embraced democracy and \n     set about building a new society dedicated to human rights \n     and the rule of law. When our democracy was hijacked by \n     corruption, the Georgian people went to the streets and took \n     it back in what is now known as the Rose Revolution. Today, \n     individual freedoms are guaranteed, religious and ethnic \n     groups celebrated, and we are working out at the peace table \n     differences that once threatened our territorial integrity. I \n     am proud to say that democracy is alive and well in Georgia, \n     but our work is far from finished.\n       It is up to those who are free to join the fight of the \n     oppressed. I know that the winds of freedom that have blown \n     across Georgia, touched off an Orange Revolution in Ukraine, \n     spawned a Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan, and shook the \n     cedars of Lebanon will someday soon reach Burma. To the \n     millions of Burmese who are imprisoned with Aung San Suu Kyi \n     in their own country, I say this: Doi Yea (Our Cause)! \n     Because your cause is our cause. Wherever freedom-loving \n     people rise up to carry on the legacy of the Rose Revolution, \n     the spirit and support of the Georgian people stand with you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6780-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam. President, I rise today to take a moment to \nrecognize a woman on the occasion of her 60 birthday, a woman whose \nleadership and courage in her home country of Burma inspires the people \nof that country and the world to continue to fight for democracy and \nhuman rights.\n  Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has devoted her life to fighting for peace in a \ncountry whose people live under an oppressive one-party socialist \ngovernment known as the State Law and Restoration Council, SLORC. This \ngovernment is responsible for the deaths of thousands of its own people \nand the unjust imprisonment of untold more. Suu Kyi remains the only \ndetained Nobel Peace Laureate in the world.\n  Suu Kyi was born in Burma in 1945 to General Aung San, the leader of \nthe Burmese movement for independence from Great Britain. After his \ngroup achieved Burmese independence and took control of the government, \nhe was assassinated for his democratic beliefs and practices. Suu Kyi \nleft Burma and moved to India with her mother after she became the \nBurmese Ambassador to India in 1960. Although Suu Kyi was only 2 when \nher father was killed, it was his legacy that inspired her to head the \nNational League for Democracy, NLD when she returned to Myanmar after \ngraduating from Oxford University many years later.\n  Under her leadership, the NLD won the general election in 1990 with a \nlandslide victory. However, the SLORC refused to acknowledge their win \nand put the elected pro-democracy leaders under house arrest, including \nSuu Kyi.\n  Although no longer in prison, Suu Kyi is not allowed to travel freely \ndue to restrictions by the Burmese Government. As a result, she will \nnot leave the country out of fear of being permanently exiled from her \nhomeland. Her commitment to her people is so enduring that she is \nwilling to forsake seeing her children who live abroad ever again.\n  Suu Kyi has inspired countless other Burmese supporters and the world \nto focus global attention on this conflict. In my State of Colorado, \nfor example, many people from that country have relocated to Boulder. \nOne such person is former Burmese princess Inge Sargent who founded the \nBurma Lifeline. This organization funds refugee camps along the Thai \nborder and works in conjunction with other groups such as the Shan \nWomen Action Network. Inge Sargent was awarded the United Nations \nInternational Human Rights Award in 2000.\n  In an effort to lend my voice to the efforts of Senator McConnell and \nInge Sargent, I am happy have joined with 42 other Senators as a \ncosponsor of a joint resolution approving the renewal of import \nrestrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n2003.\n  It is because of brave women like Suu Kyi and the hundreds of people \nfrom Burma who have made Colorado their home that Burma has a bright \nfuture. Yet the struggle is far from over; these brave leaders will not \nbe free until Suu Kyi's call for democracy is answered.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 174) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 175 submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 175) commending the University of \n     Michigan's softball team for winning the National Collegiate \n     Athletic Association Division I Championship on June 8, 2005.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, it is with great pride that I \ncongratulate the University of Michigan Softball Team on winning the \n2005 National Championship. The Wolverines completed an impressive \nseason by defeating the two-time defending champion University of \nCalifornia-Los Angeles Bruins two games to one in thrilling fashion \ncapped by a three run home run in the tenth inning of the final game of \nthe 2005 College World Series. This victory marks the first time a team \neast of the Mississippi River has won this title and cements the \nUniversity of Michigan program as a true national powerhouse in college \nsoftball. The Wolverines played with superb skill and dogged \ndetermination throughout the season and in the World Series to clinch \ntheir first championship, the second National Championship ever for a \nwomen's athletic program at the University of Michigan.\n  The top ranked Wolverines entered Wednesday night's game hungry for \nthe final win that would secure their first National Championship \ntrophy. The Wolverines and Bruins split the first two games of the best \nof three series and were locked in a fierce battle in the third and \nfinal game to determine the ultimate victor. The Wolverines and Bruins \nended regulation with the score tied at one run each. The tenth inning \nwould prove pivotal as Samantha Findlay seized this opportunity and hit \na three run homer to provide the boost necessary to secure this extra \ninnings win. This grand display of athleticism, coupled with her play \nthroughout the postseason, helped earn Findlay the Women's College \nWorld Series Most Valuable Player Award.\n  That victory provided the perfect ending to a remarkable season for \nthe\n\n[[Page S6781]]\n\nUniversity of Michigan Softball Team. After a 32 game winning streak at \nthe beginning of the season, the Wolverines became the Nation's top-\nranked college softball program for the first time in school history, \nand they were able to maintain the top ranking for the rest of the \nseason. The Wolverines ended the season with 65 wins and 7 losses, the \nbest record in school history and was one of three schools in NCAA \nhistory to hit 100 home runs in a season.\n  Many members of the Wolverine team have been honored for their \nefforts both on and off of the field. Eight of the team's 19 members \nwere named to the Big Ten all-conference team, including five on the \nBig Ten first team. Perhaps even more impressive is that six Wolverine \nplayers were named to the spring 2005 Academic All-Big Ten Conference \nteam. The Wolverines' pitcher, Jennie Ritter, was honored with the Big \nTen Pitcher of the Year title and was a finalist for the Amateur \nSoftball Association's USA Softball Collegiate Player of the Year. A \nmember of the Big Ten second team, Samantha Findlay, earned an award as \nthe Big Ten Freshman of the Year. The 2005 University of Michigan \nSoftball team included Stephanie Bercaw, Angie Danis, Samantha Findlay, \nAlessandra Giampaolo, Tiffany Haas, Lauren Holland, Jennifer \nKreinbrink, Grace Leutele, Becky Marx, Jessica Merchant, Rebekah \nMilian, Nicole Motycka, Jennie Ritter, Lauren Talbot, Michelle \nTeschler, Michelle Weatherdon, Lorilyn Wilson, Stephanie Winter, and \nTiffany Worthy.\n  This season proved to be an especially memorable one for Head Coach \nCarol Hutchins for several reasons. Coach Hutchins eclipsed the 900 \ncareer win mark during the season, and her 940th win resulted in a \nchampionship for the Wolverines. She currently enjoys the distinction \nof being the most victorious coach in University of Michigan history \nand currently ranks among the top ten Division I active coaches in \ncareer wins and winning percentage.\n  As we honor this impressive triumph, I am reminded of the many times \nI have had the pleasure of congratulating a strong Wolverine team. \nMichigan can be proud of this most recent success, their fifty-second \nNational Championship in school history. I am proud to join Senator \nStabenow in congratulating the University of Michigan Softball Team on \nwinning the 2005 Softball National Championship. I know my Senate \ncolleagues share my admiration of the poise, skill and hard work \nnecessary to achieve this milestone.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise today to congratualte the \nUniversity of Michigan softball team on winning the National Collegiate \nAthletic Association championship on June 8, 2005.\n  Coach Carol Hutchins's team completed a remarkable season last \nWednesday on national television when Michigan took a 4-1 lead after \nfreshman first baseman Samantha Findlay hit a three run homer in the \n10th inning.\n  The 2005 University of Michigan softball team had a remarkable and \nhistoric season. They were recognized mid-season as the top ranked \ncollegiate softball team in America. They went on to win both the Big \nTen regular season championship and Big Ten Tournament title and then \nadvanced to their eighth Women's College World Series to defeat the \ntwo-time defending champion UCLA Bruins in the three-game series \nfinals.\n  I am very proud of the women on this University of Michigan team \nwhich finished with a school record of 65 wins and 7 losses. Several of \nMichigan's players received honors during the season for their \nspectacular play and at the end of the year for their consistent \nexcellence during the season. In fact, the Women's College World Series \nMost Outstanding Player honors went to Samantha Findlay, the first \nfreshman position player to be so recognized. In addition, three \nMichigan players were nominated for the USA Softball Collegiate Player \nof the Year, two of which are finalists for the award.\n  The 2005 University of Michigan softball team was also very exciting \nto watch because they hit a home run in 57 of 65 games during the 2005 \nseason. They are just one of three schools in NCAA history to hit 100 \nhome runs in a season. Michigan's fans recognized this and came out in \nsupport of their team all year, setting a single-season home attendance \nrecord and bringing in the top five crowds in program history.\n  Most importantly may be the honor given to six University of Michigan \nsoftball players that were named to the spring 2005 Academic All-Big \nTen Conference team. I am a strong supporter of women's athletics and \nbelieve that through their participation and accomplishments the women \nof University of Michigan's 2005 national championship softball team, \nand all the other women involved in collegiate athletics, provide \npowerful and very positive message to girls and young women in our \ncountry.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and preamble \nbe agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating thereto be printed in the Record, \nwithout intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 175) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 175\n\n       Whereas the top-ranked University of Michigan softball team \n     defeated the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) \n     Bruins in the Women's College World Series 2 games to 1, \n     becoming only the eighth team to win the National Collegiate \n     Athletic Association (NCAA) Softball Championship and the \n     first Big Ten Conference team to claim a national title in \n     softball or baseball since 1966;\n       Whereas the University of Michigan softball team clinched \n     the 2005 Women's College World Series in an exciting extra-\n     innings game with a 3-run homer in the 10th inning to win 4 \n     to 1;\n       Whereas the University of Michigan softball team hit a home \n     run in 57 of 65 games during the 2005 season and is just 1 of \n     3 schools in NCAA history to hit 100 home runs in a season;\n       Whereas in 2005, the University of Michigan softball team \n     earned its first Number 1 ranking in school history and won \n     its tenth Big Ten Conference championship and seventh Big Ten \n     Tournament title en route to advancing to its eighth Women's \n     College World Series;\n       Whereas the NCAA championship title marks the 52nd national \n     championship for a sports program at the University of \n     Michigan, the second for a women's athletic program at \n     Michigan, and the first for a softball program east of the \n     Mississippi River;\n       Whereas the University of Michigan softball team mounted an \n     impressive season record of 65 wins and 7 losses;\n       Whereas Coach Carol Hutchins eclipsed the 900 win mark, \n     capping a stellar 21 year career at Michigan that has seen \n     her become the most victorious coach in University of \n     Michigan history, currently ranking among the top 10 Division \n     I active coaches, with 940 career wins and a .729 winning \n     percentage;\n       Whereas 2 University of Michigan softball players, \n     shortstop Jessica Merchant and pitcher Jennie Ritter, were \n     finalists for the USA Softball Collegiate Player of the Year \n     Award;\n       Whereas a record-tying 8 players from the University of \n     Michigan softball team were named to the Big Ten All-\n     Conference Team, and 6 players were named to the Spring 2005 \n     Academic All-Big Ten Conference Team;\n       Whereas the University of Michigan softball team was led by \n     the solid coaching of Carol Hutchins, Bonnie Tholl, Jennifer \n     Brundage, and Jennifer Teague;\n       Whereas players on the University of Michigan softball team \n     included Stephanie Bercaw, Angie Danis, Samantha Findlay, \n     Alessandra Giampaolo, Tiffany Haas, Lauren Holland, Jennifer \n     Kreinbrink, Grace Leutele, Becky Marx, Jessica Merchant, \n     Rebekah Milian, Nicole Motycka, Jennie Ritter, Lauren Talbot, \n     Michelle Teschler, Michelle Weatherdon, Lorilyn Wilson, \n     Stephanie Winter, and Tiffany Worthy; and\n       Whereas Michigan had tremendous support from its hometown \n     fans during their season, setting a home attendance record in \n     2005, and bringing in the 5 largest crowds in program \n     history: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the University of Michigan softball team for \n     winning the 2005 National Collegiate Athletic Association \n     Division I Championship on June 8, 2005;\n       (2) recognizes all of the players and coaches who were \n     instrumental in this achievement; and\n       (3) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to the University of \n     Michigan athletic department for appropriate display.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6781-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6781-S6782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDER TO PRINT AS A SENATE DOCUMENT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I heard a good deal of the remarks of \nthe distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, as he discussed the \nissues surrounding the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo and the \nactions of our military. I could not agree with him more. He is one of \nthe Senate's finest lawyers. He is on the Judiciary Committee, where we \njust had hearings, and has been involved in these issues for some time. \nIn fact, I serve with him on the Judiciary Committee and am also a \nMember of the Armed Services Committee.\n  I would have to say to this body that our Congress has had a total of \n29-plus hearings involving the handling of prisoners since the war on \nterrorism began. I think I have been at most of them. Most of them have \nbeen before the Armed Services Committee and Judiciary Committee. We \nhave had a host of these hearings. We have had witnesses and \ncomplainants and issues brought up to us time and time again.\n  Yesterday, at our hearing in Judiciary, I really reached a point \nwhere I just felt I had to speak out. It was in the morning before \nSenator Durbin made his remarks. But it was something I felt deeply, \nand it became more and more clear to me: that is, we in this Senate are \ncreating an impression around the world that wholesale violations of \nhuman rights are occurring in our prisons, and this is absolutely not \ntrue.\n  Members of our own Congress have suggested and even stated that it is \nthe policy of our country to abuse and violate prisoners' rights. This \nis completely misstating the true facts that are occurring. Anyone who \nvisits the Guantanamo prison--and I believe that some 60-odd \nCongressmen and Senators have been there, including my own visit to the \ntemporary facility several years ago--would find a new $150-million \nprison right on the top of the island overlooking the water. It is a \nbeautiful site where they built this prison. It is a shame really that \na prison was built there, but it is part of the military base where it \nis located. These prisoners are being given tremendous medical care. \nThey are being treated for their diseases, for the parasites with which \nmany of them have become infested. They have been cared for \neffectively. They have gained weight. They are provided food at a \nfinancial cost substantially exceeding that of other prisoners in \nAmerica and soldiers in the U.S. military. We have treated the Koran \nwith respect and the highest esteem and tried to handle these prisoners \nin a way that is appropriate.\n\n  I will say a couple of things. It is important we treat these \nprisoners humanely, because we have high ideals as Americans. There are \nthousands of prisoners and we have thousands of soldiers involved in \nthis area. That someone would overstep their bounds is not something we \nwould not expect. It happens in American prisons every day. Prison \nguards are fined, they are removed, they are fired, they are prosecuted \nfor abuse. We do not like to admit that, but it happens. We take care \nof it in America. We do not allow this to continue.\n  The facts are these detainees at Guantanamo are detainees who are \nbeing held consistent with the general principles of the Geneva \nConventions but are not covered by that convention. As Senator Kyl \nnoted, they are not lawful combatants, they are unlawful combatants. \nThey are people who sneak into a country. They do not wear a uniform. \nThey are not part of any state army. Their goal is to kill innocent \ncivilians, men and women and children not involved in a war effort at \nall. The purpose of the Geneva Conventions is to help one army identify \nthe members of the other army and to encourage those armies not to \nendanger civilians, but to focus their attention on their enemy and to \ndeal with them. These prisoners are entirely different. They do not \nqualify for those conventions. But we provide them great protections, \nanyway.\n  We have spent $109 million on the prison there at Guantanamo. We are \ngoing to spend another $50 million making it even better. I don't see \nthat there is any basis to move those prisoners, to alter what we are \ndoing there and to create a new prison. How would that make us any \nsafer if that were to occur?\n  Let me share this about the 500 or so prisoners who are there. In the \ncourse of this war on terrorism, our country has apprehended 10,000 \ndetainees, individuals who have been captured. Each one has been \nscreened carefully. As a result, some 750 have been identified for \nincarceration at Guantanamo, the worst of the worst. Since that time, \nwe have continued to monitor them. Each one of them has had a full \nreview. As that has occurred, another 200 have been released and we are \ndown now to a little more than 500 at Guantanamo. I note of the 200 \nreleased, some 12 have already been rearrested as they go about their \nefforts to kill Americans and American soldiers. They have been \nrearrested, because they returned to battle. This clearly suggest that \nof those other 500 detainees remaining, many of those are dedicated \ntotally to killing American citizens. They believe in what they are \ndoing. They are sold on this effort. They are implacable in their goal \nand intentions and should not be confused with the normal prisoners of \nwar where you have a soldier who was drafted into an army and they go \nout and get captured and they dutifully stay in their prison until the \nwar is over.\n  What do you do with prisoners of war or these kind of prisoners? \nPrisoners of\n\n[[Page S6783]]\n\nwar are held until the war is over. You do not turn them loose so they \ncan then re-engage in killing your soldiers. That is the crisis.\n  When will the war end? I am not sure. So we have people say, they \nhave to all be released. You cannot hold them because this war might go \non forever.\n  Might, might, might. We are talking about now. It has not been going \non that long. Most have only been held 1, 2, 3 years. This is not the \ntime to be wholesale releasing these people. This battle is tough and \nhot right now. If you do not believe it, look at what is happening in \nIraq and how many are killed by these attacks, surreptitious sneak \nattacks by roadside bombs in that country. This war is not over. It is \nongoing.\n  We are lucky and have been fortunate that because we were aggressive, \nwe as a nation have not had another attack on our homeland since \nSeptember 11. But we know they would like to do that. We know they are \nattacking places all over the globe.\n  A number of Supreme Court decisions has impacted how these prisoners \nare to be held. The Department of Defense created, therefore, as a \nresult of the court rulings what is called the combatant status review \ntribunal. Every prisoner in Guantanamo has been reviewed by the \ncombatant status review tribunal. Annually, each prisoner there goes \nbefore the ARB, which is an annual review board, sort of like a parole \nboard. If they can justify letting these prisoners go on that annual \nreview, they let them go because the last thing we need is to be \nhousing a bunch of prisoners that do not amount to a threat to our \npeople.\n  I will share this. I will not continue too long tonight. I want to \nshare a few facts that are important. We are committed as a nation to \nhigh standards of duty in handling those we capture. Since this war has \nbegun, there have been 10 major commissions and investigations \nempaneled to review allegations of misconduct. We have had commission \nafter commission, review after review and, as I said, 29 plus \ncongressional hearings. We have been alert to ensuring that prisoners \nare not abused in any systematic way and that those who violate the law \nare prosecuted for it.\n  Let me carry on. There have been 1,700 interviews as a part of these \ninvestigations; 16,000 pages of documents delivered to Congress. \nDetention operation enhancements to improve our detention operations \nrange from increased oversight to expanded training of the guards to \nimproved facilities and new doctrines.\n  When we have had a problem, we have dealt with it, we have confronted \nit, and we have improved the situation.\n  Mr. President, 390-plus criminal investigations of American soldiers \nand Guards have been completed or are ongoing. More than 40 staff \nbriefings have been given to the staff members of the Congress. People \nare being held accountable. They are really being held accountable. One \ngeneral officer has been removed from command, received a general \nofficer memorandum of reprimand. Thirty-five soldiers have been \nreferred to trial by court-martial--35. Sixty-eight soldiers have \nreceived nonjudicial punishment, which is a career ender. Twenty-two \nmemoranda of reprimand have been issued. Eighteen soldiers have been \nadministratively separated from the Army. The Navy has had nine receive \nnonjudicial punishment. Fifteen marines have been convicted by court-\nmartial. Seven received nonjudicial punishment, and four have been \nreprimanded.\n  We know in Abu Ghraib there was this uproar. This story had been \nbroken by the media, one Senator said yesterday at our hearing. But if \nyou remember, it was the general who made the briefing every day to the \nnews media who announced, days before the media had any report of these \nabuses in Abu Ghraib, he had reports of abuses in Abu Ghraib prison and \ninvestigations were being commenced. And they commenced immediately. \nPeople were removed from command immediately and no more abuses took \nplace in that prison from that date onward.\n  We know since then, because we have had hearings and newspaper \narticles and investigative reports on TV, that these people who \nviolated the rights of those prisoners were tried and convicted and are \nbeing sent to jail for long periods of time.\n  Although none were seriously physically injured, as I recall, they \nwere humiliated and handled in a way unbecoming of an American soldier. \nThose soldiers have been disciplined severely for their errors, and \nrightly so. I think it is something we should be proud of.\n  Do you remember the colonel whose soldiers were under attack? He \nneeded information from an Iraqi, and to get it, he fired a gun near \nthe Iraqi's head. He did not hurt him in any way. And this terrorist \ngave information that helped save soldiers' lives. And they cashiered \nhim out of the Army because he was not allowed to use that kind of \naction. We had a marine officer--who after 9/11 gave up his stock \nbrokerage job to go and serve his country--be prosecuted, it now \nappears falsely, by a lower ranking soldier who made complaints against \nhim, a soldier he had referred for disciplinary action. After full \nreview, they dismissed all charges.\n  This record is clear. This Government, our Nation, does not tolerate \nabuse. We have taken strong actions to see that it is not allowed and \ndoes not continue. But we have a duty to protect the people of our \nNation. These detainees, these terrorists, who are being held, these \nunlawful combatants present a risk to us.\n  Some say, well, somehow we have made this all happen by being \naggressive militarily. But I would remind my colleagues that for almost \n20 years al-Qaida, and groups like that, have been attacking our \nembassies, our marines, our soldiers--our warships, the USS Cole--\naround the globe. We had been in a constant state of combat with Saddam \nHussein truthfully since the gulf war in 1991. Up until the actual \ncommencement of these hostilities, we were flying missions to enforce \nthe no-fly zone under the U.N. resolutions. He was firing missiles at \nour aircraft, and we were dropping bombs on him.\n  This is a dangerous part of the globe. That is why the Congress, when \nPresident Clinton was President, passed a resolution setting the policy \nof this Government to effect a regime change in Iraq.\n  So this is what it is all about. It is a dangerous world out there. I \nwant to call on my colleagues, with the greatest sincerity, to be \ncareful what we say. Do not be telling the media, the world, speaking \nout in ways that suggest it is a policy in the actions of our military \nroutinely to abuse prisoners. If prisoners are unlawfully treated, the \nguards are prosecuted. And the people who did it are prosecuted. It is \nnot our policy to abuse prisoners. It does not happen on a regular \nbasis. We do not tolerate it. We will not tolerate it. We will comply \nwith the law and treat people appropriately.\n  But when Senators come in hearings and to this floor and make \nstatements in the news media--and when the news media writes reports, \nas was done about the Koran, saying it was flushed down the toilet--\nthey had to retract that story, bad things happen. After the false \nKoran incident a riot occurred because people in the Middle East \nbelieved that was true. They believed what they read in our national \nnews, that we were unfairly or disrespectfully treating the Koran. \nWhereas in Guantanamo, our guards use gloves. They hold the Koran with \nboth hands, in every way try to treat it in a respectful manner and \nmake sure that every prisoner there is provided a copy, if they desire.\n  So this is bad when we create a climate in this body that falsely \ncharacterizes our people. Yes, we make mistakes. Yes, if we do, they \nneed to be fixed, and people ought to be punished. And I have shown we \nare punishing them. But it is wrong and irresponsible, and it places \nour soldiers whom we have sent in harm's way at greater risk when we \nsuggest to that entire region of the world that we do not respect the \nfaith of Islamic peoples, that we do not treat respectfully the \nprisoners who we apprehend, and that we are irresponsible, maybe even \ncarrying on activities that are so bad as to be compared with Hitler, \nPol Pot, or the Soviet Union. Those irresponsible comments can cost \nsoldiers' lives. We need to be careful about it. If someone has proof \nof an individual act that amounts to a crime, let's see them bring it \nforward. Let's have an investigation. If somebody deserves to be \nprosecuted, let's prosecute them. But if not, quit making these \nstatements. I think we\n\n[[Page S6784]]\n\nhave had enough hearings. As far as I am concerned, 29-plus is enough.\n\n  The military has demonstrated, with all clarity, that they are \nprepared and willing to honestly and aggressively prosecute wrongdoers. \nThey are also committed to protecting our citizens. They have given \ntheir lives, many of them, in that effort. They volunteered to serve in \nour military. They are the finest military this world has ever known. \nIn the heat of combat they have shown restraint. They have not used \nheavy weapons, and they have held back in order to be sure innocent \ncivilians are not injured. They do everything they can on a daily basis \nto reach out to the people of Iraq and Afghanistan, to appeal to their \nhearts and minds, to encourage them on the road to building a new and \nbetter life for themselves and their families. They do the things that \nAmericans have no idea of on a daily basis to try to reach out and \nreconcile and improve our relationship with the people in that area of \nthe globe.\n  It is positively damaging to that effort when Members of Congress \nmake the kinds of statements that have been made, when news media \noutlets, great organs of information, make mistakes, twist, exaggerate, \nmisrepresent things that have occurred. It is not right. We need to \nshow more responsibility. We need to show more discipline. It is not \njustified. No matter how strongly one feels politically and wants to \ntry to blame the President for all these things, it is not just being \nheard in this body, it is not just the American people who are hearing \ncriticisms of the President. These comments are being heard throughout \nthe globe. It is not helpful to our efforts to build a better and more \npeaceful world.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to say these words, late at \nnight though it is. I believe we are at a point where our Congress \nneeds to improve its behavior. We need to show more restraint. If we do \nso, this will allow our soldiers to have a better chance to succeed at \nthe difficult mission they have and the one they are working at so ably \nand so courageously.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/16/senate-section/article/S6784-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 2 P.M.
