Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n4297, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference of the disagreeing votes on the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the House to the bill (H.R. \n     4297), to provide for reconciliation pursuant to section \n     201(b) of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 2006, having met, have agreed that the House recede from \n     its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate and agree to \n     the same with an amendment and the Senate agree to the same, \n     signed by a majority of the conferees on the part of both \n     Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will proceed to the \nconsideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of May 9, 2006.)\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there are 8 \nhours of debate equally divided on the conference report.\n\n\n                   recognition of the majority leader\n\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                schedule\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a moment, we will begin consideration of \nthe conference report to accompany the Tax Relief Act. Our order from \nlast night provides for up to 8 hours of debate from the statutory \nlimit. The chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee will be \non the floor throughout the day to yield some of that time to Senators \nto speak. I hope we will not need the entire 8 hours and that we could \nyield back some of that time and vote a little earlier today. We will \nsee how we are progressing in the early afternoon and alert Members if \nthat is possible and, indeed, I hope that it will be.\n  Following the vote on the adoption of the Tax Relief conference \nreport, we will have up to 1 hour of debate before the vote on invoking \ncloture on the small business health plans bill. If cloture is invoked \non the small business health plans bill, then we would stay on that \nbill until we complete it. I hope the Senate will invoke cloture on the \nbill and will not miss the opportunity to help our small businesses \nprovide more affordable health care benefits to their employees and \nfamilies.\n  We have two important votes this afternoon. We will alert Senators as \nto the timing when we get a better idea of the amount of debate that is \nneeded.\n\n\n                  unanimous consent agreement--S. 2611\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that unless cloture \nis invoked on the pending substitute to S. 1955, on Monday, May 15, at \na time to be determined by the majority leader after consultation with \nthe Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. \n2611, the immigration bill. I further ask that when the Senate agrees \nto a request for a conference or the Senate requests a conference on \nthis bill and the Chair is authorized to appoint conferees on the part \nof the Senate, the ratio of conferees be 14 to 12; provided further \nthat from that ratio, the first 7 Republican Senators from the \nJudiciary Committee and the first 5 Democratic Senators from the \nJudiciary Committee be conferees; finally, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe majority leader select the final 7 from the majority side and the \nDemocratic leader select the final 7 for the minority side.\n  Before the Chair rules, I wish to be clear that the two leaders \nanticipate full session days on this bill, with a considerable number \nof amendments debated and voted on each day. We intend to allow \namendments to come forward and to be voted on in an efficient way. This \nis a comprehensive immigration bill, and therefore it is important for \nSenators to have adequate time to have their amendments considered.\n\n[[Page S4386]]\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n\n                   recognition of the minority leader\n\n  The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                              immigration\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is one of the rare times that we have \nbeen able to move forward on a bipartisan basis. The procedural aspects \nof this immigration debate are over with. The two leaders want a \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill. What is going to be in it? I \ndon't know and the Republican leader doesn't know. But, Mr. President, \nthis is going to take a lot of hard work.\n  I want to extend to the majority leader my appreciation and my \nacknowledgment of the difficulty of arriving at this point. It has been \nvery hard for both of us. And as the time went on after the Easter \nrecess, it didn't get easier, it got harder. But I do believe that this \nis what the Senate is about, and we can move forward in a way that I \nthink the country will acknowledge. There is a lot of hard work to be \ndone, but we can do it well.\n  I receive my fair share of criticism, as does the Republican leader. \nBut I want everyone to know we try very hard to move things along. It \nis not easy with the political atmosphere we find in the country today, \nbut we have done this on this bill, and it has been extremely \ndifficult. I don't want to sound like poor me, but that has been pretty \nhard to do. I will always remember the difficulties we have had, but \nalso things such as this, as we know, in life bring people closer \ntogether. I think the majority leader and I have had--if we have talked \nabout this bill once, we have talked about it 25 times. I have nothing \nbut admiration for the Republican leader for arranging things so we can \nbe at this spot today.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, what the Democratic leader and I have laid \nout is a way to get onto this bill, and as you can tell, both of us \nhave been working in good faith on various issues that have been raised \non the floor. We both appreciate our colleagues' patience in arriving \nat this point. We both anticipate a lot of challenging times over the \nperiod which will begin, in all likelihood, on Monday on what we all \nknow is a very difficult bill.\n  The process that has been laid out is one that we both feel is very \nfair and will give the opportunity for the will of the Senate to \nexpress itself on a difficult issue to which there are not very many \nclear-cut answers. So I look forward to beginning that debate in the \nvery near future, and I look forward to having dignified debate, debate \nthat under the leadership of the two managers will need to be \nefficient, effective, and fair, but we will need to keep moving through \nthat debate in order to allow the Senate's will, through amendment and \nvoting on those amendments, to be reflected.\n\n\n          modification to unanimous consent agreement--s. 2611\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I modify the unanimous consent request so \nthat it is clear that it is applicable to S. 2611 or a House bill in \nwhich we conference using the language of S. 2611.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n\n                              immigration\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I also want the Record to be spread with the \nfact that this is not a time for anyone to claim victory. Certainly, in \nthis process, I didn't get everything I wanted. I think the majority \nleader didn't get everything he wanted. But in the legislative process, \nbuilding consensus is the art of compromise.\n  I look back to the days when I tried cases. I found some of the best \nsettlements were those where basically both sides were kind of unhappy \nabout it, and I think that is what we have gotten. I certainly feel \nthat this is a fair compromise procedurally with these intricate rules \nwe have in the Senate. This is going to work well.\n  I also want to repeat what the majority leader said. This is going to \ntake a lot of work. We have a lot of amendments. This is not a two- or \nthree-amendment bill. There are a lot of amendments. People on both \nsides of the aisle have been waiting for weeks to offer amendments. We \nare going to have to work our way through these. It is going to take a \nlot of cooperation.\n  There may come a time during this debate that the managers are going \nto have to move to table some of these amendments. I hope we can \narrange for time on these amendments. If we can't, we will do what has \nto be done in the Senate and move forward as expeditiously as we can. \nPeople have strong feelings about this bill on both sides of the aisle. \nBut I feel very good that we have a road forward, and I believe we will \ncomplete this legislation and have, for the American people, \ncomprehensive immigration reform that deals with security, deals with \nthe guest worker program, deals with the people who are undocumented, \nand also will deal with a better way of enforcing employer sanctions.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will close by saying it is important we \nfinish this bill before the Memorial Day recess. I have said that \nseveral times in my statements over the last couple of weeks, and I \nthink in my discussions with the Democratic leader, we both agree that \nonce we start this bill, we will stay on the bill until we complete it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, am I right that we are prepared to \nproceed to the text of the conference reconciliation report?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct. That is the \npending business. There are 8 hours equally divided.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I explain what is in the \nconference report, I want to make clear what the tax policy is we are \ntalking about. For 90 percent of the legislation that is before us, we \nare talking about maintaining existing tax policy as it has been, \neither from the 2001 Tax Reduction Act or the 2003 Tax Reduction Act. \nThe reason I want to take some time to explain that--and that is not \npart of my explanation of the conference report--is because the public \nlistening in and/or my colleagues are going to be confused over the \nwords ``tax cuts.'' For 90 percent of this legislation, we are not \ncutting anybody's tax bill. What we are trying to do because of sunset \nis we are maintaining for the next year, or in some cases the next 5 \nyears, existing tax policy. So I don't want anybody to come over and \nsay we are cutting taxes.\n  If we don't pass this legislation in the year 2006, or in some cases \nin the years 2009 and 2010, people are going to get an automatic \nincrease of taxes without a vote of Congress. So we are talking about \nmaintaining existing tax policy. The reason we are talking about \nmaintaining tax policy would be for two reasons. In the case of \ndividend and capital gains tax policy, the tax policy we adopted in \n2003 is the reason we have created 5.2 million jobs.\n  That is why the economy is rolling. I know the public is listening. \nWhen they pay $3 for gas, the $3 for gas blinds them to the fact that \nwe had 4.8 percent growth last quarter. It blinds them to the fact that \nwe have 4.7 percent unemployment, which is practically full employment, \nand some economists would tell you it is full employment, or that we \nhave a low inflation rate.\n  It seems that when my constituents, and probably constituents in \nevery State, see high gasoline prices, that is all that is on their \nmind. I don't blame them because I put gasoline in my car--I don't have \nsome driver do it, I put it in myself--and I know what the price of \ngasoline is. I know a lot of my constituents go out of the same \nconvenience stores I do with a bottle of water. Bottled water, if you \nbuy it in these small containers, you are paying about $8 a gallon for \nwater and never complaining about the cost for water but complaining \nabout $2.63 gas that you can buy in Des Moines, IA, this very weekend.\n  We are talking with regard to capital gains as maintaining existing \ntax policy. Just so everybody understands, we are not cutting anybody's \ntaxes below what they are today. We are maintaining existing tax \npolicy. But if we didn't take the action we are taking today, taxes \nwould automatically go up in these areas by 33 percent, and for low-\nincome people, who have zero capital tax gains, they go up--what would \nthat be? One hundred percent. If they are not paying taxes today and \nthey start paying taxes at the rate everybody else pays, it is a 100-\npercent increase in taxes.\n\n[[Page S4387]]\n\n  I don't know why people would argue with us, when we have a zero \ncapital gains for lower income people, that you would want to tax lower \nincome people. But if we do not continue this tax policy, that is the \ncase.\n  I wish to emphasize again what Chairman Greenspan has said about the \n2003 tax policy we are continuing today, and that is that it is \nresponsible for the economic recovery we have had of 18 quarters of \neconomic growth and 5.2 million jobs being created.\n  The other part of the bill is to continue tax policy existing since \n2001. That existing tax policy is that 22 million Americans--well, no, \nI better say it this way. That tax policy since 2001 has been that when \nwe reduce people's taxes here on the one hand, we are not going to take \nit away from them on the other hand by having them hit by the \nalternative minimum tax. I am going to explain this in greater detail, \nbut up front, a good part of this bill is to maintain the policy \nSenator Baucus and I have had in place since 2001 of holding people \nharmless from the alternative minimum tax. In other words, if you get a \ntax decrease here, we are not going to have the same people pay a tax \nover here on the alternative minimum tax.\n  As far as the alternative minimum tax is concerned, I think the best \npolicy is what we did in the late 1990s when this body sent to \nPresident Clinton a bill to repeal the alternative minimum tax, and he \nvetoed it. I don't know how many Democrats we are going to have \ncondemning us for not doing more on the alternative minimum tax. What \nmore could you do than what we did in 1999 and repeal a very bad tax \npolicy, the alternative minimum tax? And a Democratic President vetoed \nit. But they will probably be the ones complaining and crying the most \nbecause we are not doing more.\n  What we are talking about here today is maintaining present tax \npolicy through this reconciliation bill for roughly 90 percent of it. \nTen percent of it would be some change in tax policy. If people want \ndetails on that, I will be glad to go into that.\n  Maybe another thing I ought to explain--and it is more personal \nbecause I am going to be the chief negotiator for the Senate on this \nbill because I am chairman of the Senate Finance Committee--I have \nnegotiated for a long period of time with Chairman Thomas, and \neverything has worked out fine as compromises have to work out fine, \nand I think I have done a very good job of protecting the Senate's \nposition.\n  Let me remind everybody, all of my colleagues, particularly \nRepublicans, particularly about a telephone call from the President on \nthe Thursday before we began our Easter break--the exact date I don't \nhave in mind--and in meetings with the leader and the Speaker and all \nthis, we were just very anxious to get something done before Easter. At \nthat point, the position of the House was that we were not going to \nhave hold harmless on AMT. Consequently, I didn't agree to this \nagreement. I believe I probably disappointed a lot of my colleagues and \nthe leader and the Speaker and the President of the United States \nbecause I just didn't, how would you say, surrender to a House position \nthat we were doing too much on AMT.\n  Our policy since 2001 has been hold harmless, and I believe that is \nwhat we passed three times on the floor of the Senate: in November last \nyear, January this year, February of this year, as the Democrats made \nus go through three periods of 3 days of debate on the same tax bill \nthat ended up passing by a bipartisan majority of somewhere between 64 \nand 67. So it has been the policy of the Senate since 2001, reaffirmed \nby three votes of this body in the last 6 months, to hold harmless.\n  I didn't believe I was doing 66 Senators a favor by agreeing to \nsomething which would have 3.5 million--let's say more accurately 2.5 \nto 3 million taxpayers being hit by the alternative minimum tax out of \nthe 22 million to whom I have already referred. So it took a little \nlonger, and here we are--what, May 11, 1 month later than when it \noriginally happened. But we have hold harmless in this bill. Hold \nharmless is in this bill.\n  Everything is going smoothly between Chairman Thomas and me. Nobody \nis going to believe that because if you read the papers, we are always \nat each other's throat. You know, those characterizations are entirely \nwrong. He has strong convictions about tax policy, and he is the \nnegotiator for the U.S. House of Representatives. He has a right to \nstand firmly for their positions, but I have a responsibility to stand \nfirmly for the Senate position, with the understanding that someplace \nthere are some compromises. I guess enough said on that point.\n  I have mentioned, in summation, before I go into explanation about \nthe conference report, and this is the third time, but it cannot be \nsaid too many times because I don't know how many times you are going \nto hear today--in fact, we ought to count how many times we are going \nto say we are cutting taxes, we are cutting taxes, we are cutting \ntaxes. Would you keep track of that for me? I want to hear how many \ntimes that is used. We are not cutting anybody's tax. Maybe we ought be \ncutting people's taxes, but we are not. We are maintaining existing tax \npolicy as expressed by this body in the 2001 and 2003 tax bill so 22 \nmillion Americans don't get hit by the alternative minimum tax and so \nthat we have incentives for investment and taxes don't go up, and \ncapital gains and dividends, without a vote of the people in 2009 and \n2010; so that we keep the incentives Chairman Greenspan said are the \nreason we are having the economic recovery we have had for 18 quarters, \ncreating 5.2 million jobs, 4.8 percent economic growth, 4.7 percent \nunemployment, et cetera.\n\n  We have moved to the final step in the tax reconciliation process to \nwhich I have already referred that we dealt with three times and \nprobably 3 days each time during November, January, and February. We \nhave an agreement of the conferees from the House and Senate on a \nconference report. The basic objective of this conference was to \nproduce a conference report that will pass both the Senate and the \nHouse and be sent to the President.\n  To achieve that objective, we needed to focus our efforts on a true \nbipartisan, bicameral compromise. As I said and will probably say again \ntoday--but you have heard me say it over the last 3 months to my \ncolleague and friend, Senator Baucus--a compromise must be bicameral. \nLikewise, I said to Chairman Thomas of the House and to House conferees \nthat the compromise should be bipartisan.\n  In the Senate, we passed a reconciliation bill for the second time \nbut the contents of the bill for a third time, on February 2, with a \nbipartisan vote that included 66 Senators. So that obviously includes a \nvast number of Democrats.\n  My preference was to continue working in conference to produce a \nbipartisan compromise that could pass in the Senate. Unfortunately, I \ndoubt if we will get 66 votes for this conference report. But I am very \nhopeful that we will pick up some Democratic votes.\n  Going into conference, everybody knew that the House bill and the \nSenate bill were significantly different. The centerpiece of the House \nbill was a 2-year extension of the 15-percent maximum tax rate on \ndividends and capital gains and the zero percent tax rate that will \napply to taxpayers in the lowest two tax brackets. Such an extension \nwould continue the bipartisan tax policy enacted in 2003, a policy \nwhich has been vital to our economy's recovery and continued growth.\n  The centerpiece of the Senate bill was a 1-year extension and \nmodification of the alternative minimum tax hold-harmless provisions. \nThis provision would keep 15 million American families from being hit \nby the stealth tax. The AMT is a stealth tax because you really never \nknow when you are going to be hit by it. Hitting Americans with such a \nstealth tax, the alternative minimum tax, is wrong. So, as I said \nbefore, the AMT should be abolished. It is not abolished. We did vote \nto abolish it in the late 1990s, but President Clinton vetoed that. So \nhere we are, since 2001, working in a bipartisan way to do what we call \nhold harmless.\n  As I said at that particular time, my highest priority was to make \nsure we kept our promise to make certain that no additional taxpayers \nare brought into the AMT system on an annual basis, and that is the \npurpose of the Senate's hold-harmless provision on alternative minimum \ntax.\n  I will expand on that notion for a moment and be somewhat repeating \nmyself from my extemporaneous remarks,\n\n[[Page S4388]]\n\nbut exactly 5 years ago today, May 11, 2001, Senator Baucus and I \nannounced the bipartisan deal that became the basis for historic 2001 \nbipartisan tax relief legislation. I say historic because taxes were as \nhigh as they had ever been in the history of the country as a \npercentage of the gross national product.\n  When newly elected President Bush released his budget for that first \nyear in 2001, his tax relief plan did not contain a general hold \nharmless on the alternative minimum tax, and the House passed a bill \nthat did not have hold harmless provisions for the alternative minimum \ntax. When Senator Baucus and I were negotiating the bipartisan plan, we \nagreed on that bedrock principle of hold harmless--hold harmless on AMT \nso no new people would get hit with it. Because they got a tax decrease \nover here, we should not take their taxes away over here.\n  We agreed to make sure the AMT would not take the tax relief we were \nproviding. This is how we came up with the concept we refer to as hold \nharmless. To me, it goes to a fundamental principle of transparency in \ngovernment: Don't promise taxpayers relief that you know they are not \ngoing to really get.\n  Some of my friends on this side of the aisle--meaning Republicans--\nrightly complain about doubletalk on alternative minimum tax that we \nhear from Members on the other side, Democratic Members, the Senators \nfrom so-called blue States. You remember the blue-red map in \nPresidential elections of 2000 and 2004? Blue States generally go for \nDemocratic candidates for President, red States go for Republican \ncandidates for President.\n  I am going to refer to the blue States which are those that generally \nvote Democratic. Senators from these States are generally hostile to \nthe tax relief we have provided in 2001 and provided again in 2003, and \nseem to be sympathetic to tax hikes. They take this position despite \nthe fact that their constituents in these blue States, and represented \nfor the most part by Democratic Senators, tend to bear the highest per \ncapita Federal tax burden. The hostility of these Members seems to grow \nto a white-hot intensity when anybody above, say, $100,000 in income \nbenefits from any tax relief package.\n  It has always been a strange disconnect to those of us on this \nRepublican side of the aisle because that intensity--and at times what \nappears to be outright anger--seems to grow as the States' shade of \nblue grows much darker. Ironically, the per capita income, living \ncosts, and Federal tax burdens tend to rise as the shade of the State \ntends to get a darker blue. The implication appears to be that \nconstituents in these blue States should be happy to bear this high tax \nburden as their Senators fight against tax relief for them. In fact, \nMembers from blue States seem to have no limit to the level of Federal \ntaxes they believe folks in their States should bear. Taxes can never \nbe too high, goes the rationale, as long as we keep growing the \npublic's dependence on more Federal programs.\n  When Members on the Republican side hear demagoguery on taxes \nemanating from Members from blue States on a daily basis that we \nshouldn't have tax cuts for high-income people, they ask, Why do these \nfolks then seem to change their mind when we are talking about the \nalternative minimum tax? As you tend to get intense debate that we \nought to do something about the alternative minimum tax from the same \nSenators who are complaining because we are giving too much tax relief \nto high-income people in their various States, and the AMT happens to \nmost dramatically impact taxpayers between $100,000 and $500,000. How \nis this any different from other forms of tax relief? They are hot and \nheavy to have the AMT which helps their taxpayers in blue States, but \nthey are not hot and heavy to have tax relief in the first instance \nwhen you vote to reduce tax rates.\n  If I go to some extent talking about this contradiction, it is a \ncontradiction that affects and bothers a lot of people on the \nRepublican side of the aisle. It is an argument we do not understand. \nFrankly, it is a sentiment I have to overcome in my caucuses as I argue \nfor the AMT and for tax relief; and I have had to argue this \ncontradiction particularly with my House counterparts as we go to \nconference to negotiate differences between the House and Senate and \ntry to explain to them why we need to do a hold-harmless provision on \nAMT.\n  I had people from the other body who would say, What is wrong with \nhaving an alternative minimum tax hit people in blue States who are in \nthe high bracket because their Senators are arguing we shouldn't reduce \nthe tax rates in the first place? It is a very difficult thing to argue \nthat sort of contradiction. I think it would help me a lot if they \nwould get off this kick.\n  I want to take a chart on the AMT and explain some of what we are \ntalking about. This chart will show the alternative minimum tax hold-\nharmless benefits that have always been the bedrock of our tax bill \nsince 2001 because it is something Senator Baucus and I agreed on to be \nour tax policy, how the hold harmless benefits taxpayers everywhere but \nis especially important in the blue States.\n  We don't have a map with blue States versus red States. But the chart \nyou are looking at, and which I need to explain, is based upon 2003 \nreturn data because it is the most up-to-date data we have. But \nprojecting out the numbers, we think it would be entirely possible and \nintellectually honest to double the 2003 figures. As a rule of thumb, I \nam going to do that as I explain California being a blue State with 2 \nmillion taxpayers; Texas, not a blue State, a red State, but 1.2 \nmillion; Florida, a blue State, 900,000 taxpayers affected if we don't \ndo something about the alternative minimum tax as we have it in this \nlegislation; Illinois, a blue State, 848,000; New York, a blue State, \n822,000; Pennsylvania, 694,000; Michigan, 640,000; New Jersey, 632,000; \nVirginia, 568,000; and Massachusetts, 490,000.\n  I go to this length because Senators, particularly on the Democratic \nside of the aisle, might think about voting against this bill; that in \nall these States so many hundreds of thousands of people are going to \nbe hit by the alternative minimum tax if you do not help us get this \nbill passed. Those are people who were not hit in 2005 but who will be \nhit when they file on 2006 income.\n  The bottom line is in blue States versus red States implications \nshouldn't decide this issue. As you can see, there are plenty of red \nStates affected as well as blue States. Again, that shouldn't matter. \nWe ought to do the right thing--and the right thing would be to pass \nthis bill and continue the hold-harmless policy Senator Baucus and I \nhave led the Senate through in the 2001 and 2003 tax bills, and also on \nthe Senate consideration of hold harmless in this conference report.\n\n  Senator Baucus and I understood that when we took resources in the \nFinance Committee package to make sure that for at least 5 years this \nbroad-based tax relief we promised will not be undermined by the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  Moving on, this conference agreement also contains some loophole \nclosures and tax-shelter-fighting provisions that raise revenue. There \nare two reasons to raise revenue. The most important one is when we \nhave tax shelters that allow people to cheat on their income tax and \nwhen we have loopholes that don't make sense, they ought to be closed \nas a matter of fairness to all taxpayers. But they also raise some \nrevenue. We need some revenue in this bill to offset some provisions of \nthis bill so we didn't exceed the $70 billion reconciliation \ninstructions of Congress for us in the Finance Committee.\n  The House bill, however, didn't contain any revenue raisers. Although \nwe didn't come back with all the loophole closures, especially \nclarification of something that needs to be done with the economic \nsubstance doctrine defined, and the House conferees very much oppose \nany change in that, we did make some headway on loophole closings and \nclosing tax shelter abuse.\n  Let me go back to economic substance. My argument for it: It raises a \nlot of revenue. But we have had several courts that have instructed \nCongress--and courts cannot make Congress do anything we don't want to \ndo--to define economic substance. By defining it, it brings in some \nrevenue.\n  I don't understand why it shouldn't be defined. My feeling is there \nare a lot of K Street lobbyists and maybe a lot of lobbyists who aren't \non K Street who benefit from the loopholes that can\n\n[[Page S4389]]\n\nstretch economic substance in the Tax Code.\n  The Senate bill and the House bill that went to conference also \nshared some similarities. Both bills sought to extend and extend and in \nsome cases modify certain provisions that expire at the end of 2005--\nprovisions such as the research and development credit, increase small \nbusiness expense, cost recovery for leasehold improvements, the savers \ncredit, or better said, the small savers credit; the deduction for \nState and local sales tax in those States that is not particularly \nvaluable to those States that don't have a State income tax; the \nqualified tuition deduction for college; and teachers' classroom \nexpense deductions. Local teachers who spend money out of their own \npockets to bring tools to the classroom can deduct that from their \nincome tax.\n  A true bicameral compromise would merge both bills in a way that \ntakes care of these common extenders which I mentioned, and many more I \ndid not mention.\n  Second, it accommodates the centerpieces of each bill which, as I \nhave explained this morning, are the AMT hold-harmless provisions on \nthe one hand and the extension of the dividends and capital gains tax \nprovisions as they now exist, not cutting capital gains and dividend \ntaxes below what they are presently, and providing as much tax relief \nas possible by using appropriate revenue-raising measures.\n  We ended up with cornerstones of each bill in this conference report \nand made progress on some of the revenue raisers, meaning loophole \nclosings, and tax shelter abuse closings. The extenders for the most \npart--I guess almost entirely--will be addressed in another vehicle. \nThey are not part of this conference report. We have compromised and \nagreed on that point. We also agreed to resolve key Senate priorities \nin the extender vehicle.\n  Can I tell Members exactly what is going to be in that vehicle? I \ncan't because we are still negotiating. What I can tell Members is we \nhad good preliminary negotiations and I feel we have a solid foundation \nto come to a fair compromise on these issues. The final determination \nof those key Senate priorities will depend upon the vehicle that we \nwill go with and other parts of the agreement when it is finalized.\n  After laying out the basic structure of the conference agreement and \nthe Senate's key provision, AMT hold harmless, I want to talk about the \nparts of the agreement the House needed.\n  The dividend and capital gains provisions in the House bill were met \nby strong opposition from the other side.\n  A principal argument against this policy made over and over again by \nthe Democrats is that it is simply a tax cut for high-income people. I \nuse the words ``tax cut,'' and that brings me to emphasize once again \nthat if anybody says we are cutting taxes, we are maintaining existing \ntax policy for an additional number of years. Without doing that, then, \nwe would get an automatic increase in taxes basically undercutting what \nChairman Greenspan has said about the goose that laid the golden egg--\nthe tax policy we adopted in 2003 being responsible for the 18 quarters \nof economic growth which we have had.\n  In support of their claim, Democrats cite distorted statistics that \ninclude taxpayers who don't receive dividends or capital gains. They \nfail to take into account the zero percent rate for lower income \ntaxpayers in 2008 and ignore the size of the overall income tax \nliability that taxpayers bear.\n  My analysis of 2005 data that I received from the Joint Committee on \nTaxation shows that lower income taxpayers actually have more at stake \nthan higher income taxpayers. The Joint Committee on Taxation is not a \nRepublican or Democratic operation. These are professional people who \nspend whatever time they are in public service on this committee \nbecoming experts on the Tax Code, the economic implications of tax \npolicy, and whether it is good or bad for the economy, whether it \nbrings in more or less money to the Federal Treasury. These are not \npeople wearing a Republican hat or a Democratic hat. My quoting of \ntheir statistics ought to have a great deal of credibility because they \nare professional people.\n  This is 2005 data received from the Joint Committee on Taxation \nshowing lower income taxpayers actually have more at stake than higher \nincome taxpayers. Of course, I don't mean to speak in absolute dollar \namounts because I cannot say that, but I can say in percentage \nadvantage to various income classes that lower income taxpayers have \nmore at stake than higher income taxpayers. It is common sense for me \nto say that because higher income taxpayers receive higher tax cuts \nmeasured in dollar terms, quite simply, because they pay more taxes to \nbegin with. But the extension of the lower rates on dividends and \ncapital gains will give lower income taxpayers greater tax savings as a \npercentage of their total tax liability.\n  I will refer to a couple of charts that summarize tax savings as a \npercentage of total income tax liability of average gross income \nlevels. The chart illustrates the dividend tax savings as a percentage \nof the total tax liability for those who benefit from the reduced \nrates. The savings percentages include 2008 savings, when the tax rate \nfor lower income taxpayers drops to zero percent. That we will \ncontinue, then, for an additional period of time. That is the rate we \nare talking about extending.\n  Based on my staff's analysis of the Joint Committee on Taxation data, \ntaxpayers with adjusted gross income of less than $50,000 will save 7.6 \npercent of their total income tax bills and seniors will save 17.1 \npercent. Those making more than $200,000 will save a lot less as a \npercentage of their taxes paid, at 2.2 percent.\n  Opponents of this policy want to persecute these taxpayers--I point \nto those earning $200,000 and over--by taking back their 2.2 percent \nsavings.\n  At the same time, they would punish these taxpayers, those under \n$50,000 at the lower income level, by taking away their 7.6 percent \nsavings and punish the seniors in the same tax bracket by taking away \ntheir 17.1 percent savings.\n  One cannot help but wonder, as we are all concerned about senior \ncitizens having a decent opportunity to have a greater retirement, one \nthat is comfortable as when they worked, with a chance to keep their \ntax savings at what they are right now, and not raise them or lower \nthem anymore--but raise their taxes by 17.1 percent?\n  This chart illustrates the relative savings from reduced capital \ngains taxes across the alternative minimum tax levels. Now, here again, \nextending the lower tax rates will give a bigger percentage reduction \nin their tax bill for taxpayers making less than $50,000. Opponents of \nthis policy want to persecute these taxpayers earning $200,000 and over \nby taking back their 7.6 percent savings. But that also has a negative \nimpact, then, upon lower income people, people making $50,000 and \nunder, by taking away their 10.2 percent savings. And they would punish \nsenior citizens in that same tax bracket of $50,000 and under, by \ntaking away their 13.2 percent savings.\n  Extending this tax policy, not cutting taxes but extending existing \ntax policy, will provide meaningful tax savings to taxpayers across the \nincome spectrum. Lower income taxpayers will save more than higher \nincome taxpayers when measured as a percentage of total tax liability.\n  Extending the lower rates will allow millions of Americans to keep \nmore of their money to spend or add to their savings through \nreinvestment in the economy rather than give it to those in Government \nto spend for them.\n  Those on the other side describe the capital gains and the dividends \nprovisions as applying to only a few high-income taxpayers. The reality \nis reflected in the following chart. Take a look at capital gains. I \nwill not go through every State, but in the State of California, \n839,616 families and individual taxpayers report capital gains. If you \ntake a look at the dividend statistic in California, 2,053,398 families \nand individual taxpayers report dividends.\n  I will not take time to go through all of these, but if you think the \neconomy growing at 4.8 percent, as Chairman Greenspan says, is because \nof the tax policies of 2003, and we have the economy growing, why would \nyou want to hit these families with a big tax increase on capital gains \nand dividends? Two million more families in California is only one \nState. Why would you want to hit them again? It seems\n\n[[Page S4390]]\n\nto me in California you would want to keep the economy growing, as we \nwant to keep the economy growing in Iowa.\n\n  We know that 7.5 million families and individuals across the country \nwith capital gains are not all millionaires, obviously. We know that 19 \nmillion families and individuals across the country with dividends are \nnot millionaires. These numbers are based on 2003 IRS data.\n  The Joint Tax Committee estimates for 2005 over 21 million returns \nwill report dividends savings and 6 million of the returns will be \nfiled by senior citizens. Nearly 12 million returns will report capital \ngains tax savings with almost 4 million people who are senior citizens. \nThese families and individuals are not millionaires.\n  Yet to listen to some on the other side, all of these people are \nwealthy. That false assertion is going to be repeated time and time and \ntime again. That false assertion in itself is their justification for \nopposing this conference report, putting in jeopardy what Chairman \nGreenspan said is a reason for economic recovery, therefore putting in \njeopardy economic recovery and taxing all of these people when this \nsunsets by taxes going up automatically, because there will not be a \nvote of Congress, by an increase of 33 percent. It does not make sense.\n  To sum up, my goal for this conference was to produce a true \nbipartisan bicameral compromise with both bills. A compromise should \naccommodate the centerpiece of each bill, meaning the House bill and \nthe Senate bill. That includes the AMT relief in the Senate bill and \nthe dividends and capital gains relief in the House bill, take care of \ncommon extenders and maximize tax relief by using appropriate revenue-\nraising measures. This bill contains the cornerstone of each body's \nbill. It is conditioned upon an agreement between the Ways and Means \nand Committee and Finance to process the extenders and other issues on \nlater vehicles. I believe the conference agreement and collateral \nagreement on extenders is a fair outcome of the House and Senate.\n  To make everything relatively clear, I did not make up my mind to \nsign this conference report until we had 6 hours of negotiations with \nthe House of Representatives last Friday. Even though we had an \nagreement on reconciliation, I wanted to make sure there was some \nunderstanding on what we were going to have in the follow-on bill, \neverything that could not be included in the conference report. As I \nsaid, it is somewhat under negotiation, but I am satisfied we have \nenough of an agreement that I can come back and say the things that the \nSenate, for the most part, is concerned about, that are very basic to \nour economic growth, will be included in a bill that will come before \nthe Senate shortly.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. 1955\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, in consultation with the chairman of the \ncommittee, I ask consent that the filing deadline for the second-degree \namendments to S. 1955 occur at 3 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I begin by commending my good friend, \nthe chairman of the Committee on Finance. He is a great American. \nPeople in Iowa are very lucky to have him representing them. I know of \nno finer man in the Senate.\n  I know Senator Grassley sought to defend the Senate's position in the \nconference committee. He is a proud man, too. He wanted to do what is \nright in defending the Senate's position, but I regret the conference \ncommittee could not end up more like the Senate product because the \nconference before the Senate today is much different than the bill that \npassed the Senate. It is so different that I am raising questions as to \nhow much of the Senate bill we have in the conference.\n  This past Saturday, Lillian Asplund died. Ms. Asplund was the last \nAmerican survivor of the 1912 sinking of the Titanic. She was the last \nsurvivor with actual memories of the event. Ms. Asplund's life reminds \nus that people make choices, and those choices can have significant \nconsequences. Just as much, the bill before the Senate today reflects \nchoices. Those choices will have significant consequences.\n  Shortly after midnight on that cold morning of April 15, 1912, \npassengers started evacuating that doomed ship. At the beginning, women \nand children went first. But it was not long before that rule gave way. \nSoon it became clear that the privileged went into the rescue boats \nfirst.\n\n  About that time, the most extraordinary thing happened: Some of those \nprivileged and wealthy passengers decided to give up their place in \nline. They decided to let others go first. Benjamin Guggenheim, the son \nof the colossally wealthy mining magnet, sipped brandy and smoked \ncigars in a deck chair while the ship went down.\n  Today, on this bill, we see no such valor, we see no such sacrifice. \nRather, in this bill, ideological wants push their way to the front of \nthe line, ahead of America's needs.\n  At the end of last year, 16,000 American businesses lost their tax \nincentive to create high-paying research jobs for American-based \nworkers. But relief for them did not make it into this bill.\n  At the end of last year, millions of school teachers lost a small but \nsignificant tax break for classroom supplies they purchase out of \npocket. But relief for them did not make it into this bill.\n  At the end of last year, millions of middle-income American families \nwith kids in college lost the ability to deduct tuition costs. But \nrelief for them did not make it into this bill.\n  These provisions--what some people call the popular ``tax \nextenders''--were given second-class status. They did not make it into \nthe lifeboat. And to what did these popular, already-expired tax \nprovisions have to give way? Well, the first-class passenger on this \nship is a tax break for investors, where not one dollar will be used \nuntil January 1, 2009.\n  I think it is important to remind ourselves of that. Not one dollar \nof cap gains and dividend tax breaks will be utilized by anyone until \nJanuary 1, 2009. That is several years from now.\n  But some will say this tax break for 2009 is desperately needed \ntoday--Why? they say--to provide certainty. You might as well just call \nthis tax bill, the 2009 Tax Increase Prevention Act, because it does \njust that: it prevents tax increases for the most well-off in the \nfuture, in 2009. This bill chose to prevent a tax increase in 2009, \nrather than prevent tax increases in 2006.\n  For the millions of families, teachers, businesses, and workers out \nthere who lost their tax benefits on January 1 of this year, there is \nno tax increase prevention in this act. There is no ``tax increase \nprevention act'' for the so-called second-class citizens.\n  I do not call them second class at all. They are Americans. They are \nteachers. They are people working in research and development. They are \nfamilies and kids trying to pay tuition costs. There is no relief for \nthem. All of those provisions expired at the end of last year. Here we \nare, well into 2006, and they are not in this bill. Middle-American \nprovisions are not in this bill. No. Rather, what is in this bill is \nfor 2009, a tax break for 2009 for investors.\n  Well, some will also say: Oh, don't worry. Other tax legislation may \nbe, might be, should be coming soon. Yes, and the check is in the mail.\n  Some will say these 2009 cuts on capital gains and dividend income \nwill benefit all Americans, and you will see a blizzard of statistics \nand quotes to try to substantiate that point, including the chart you \nrecently saw from my good friend from Iowa. Actually, that is not a \nJoint Tax Committee chart. That is a chart based upon the Finance \nCommittee staff with Joint Tax Committee statistics. And that chart, \nfrankly, does not accurately portray the facts. Many commentators who \nhave commented on that chart have pointed out the discrepancies in it.\n  I am not going to get into this tit for tat, back and forth as to \nwhose statistics are better. But I will say this, it defies common \nsense to argue that a tax break that takes effect in 2009 for the high-\nincome Americans somehow benefits middle-income and lower income \nAmericans more than the most wealthy. That totally defies logic. \nSomeone can come up with a set of statistics to try to make that point \nbut it is patently absurd.\n  Some will say these 2009 tax cuts, as I say, will benefit all \nAmericans, and you will see statistics, but that is not the fact.\n\n[[Page S4391]]\n\n  I decided to go to the source. I represent Montana. The more than \n900,000 residents of Montana are my employers, so I asked the Montana \nDepartment of Revenue where the benefit of these tax cuts would go. \nWell, of course, not everyone in Montana has this type of investment \nincome.\n  So the Montana Department of Revenue told me that just 400 households \nin Montana would receive an average benefit of $14,000 from the capital \ngains tax cut in 2009. Roughly, 90 percent of the households in Montana \nwould get almost zero benefit from the capital gains cut. Ninety \npercent: almost zero benefit.\n  With these numbers, it is very hard for me to understand why this \n2009 tax break is urgent, while Montana teachers and families with kids \nin college who lost their tax break last December must wait for the \nnext rescue boat, whenever it may or may not occur.\n  Of course, I am very pleased that protection is in the bill from the \nalternative minimum tax. I am pleased that conferees included the full \nSenate-passed version.\n  Some may recall, it was a struggle to get that in the Senate-passed \nversion last November. The original version, and the version that came \nout of committee, did not include a full hold harmless from the \nalternative minimum tax. Those versions would have left 600,000 more \nfamilies paying that tax. We fought to improve the Senate bill to be a \ntrue hold harmless. And we succeeded in doing so before the bill \nfinally left the Senate. That version is retained today. This \nprotection from the alternative minimum tax will protect almost 17 \nmillion families across our country, including about 45,000 in Montana. \nThe Montana tax collector tells me that AMT protection will help about \na quarter of all households in Montana with incomes between $45,000 and \n$80,000. That group might have otherwise seen an average tax increase \nof $1,700.\n\n  Unfortunately, there is little else in this bill to be proud of. \nWorking families have been left behind. Congress has chosen ideological \nwants over America's needs.\n  The Senate-passed bill did the tax business the Congress needed to do \nthis year. I am proud of that bill. In contrast, the bill before us \nleaves much work undone. As a result, the deficit will probably be \nlarger because the conferees made the choices they did.\n  I will have more to say about the fiscal effects of this bill. In the \nend, those effects may be the real iceberg. The fiscal effects of this \npolicy may be the real disaster. Madam President, I urge my colleagues \nto reject the choice made by this conference. I urge my colleagues to \nvote against leaving those families and teachers and workers behind. I \nurge my colleagues to reject this disastrous bill.\n  One other point, Madam President, is this: The conferees had a \nchoice. Basically, we did one thing we had to do. I should not say \n``we'' because I was not on the conference. I was not allowed to be a \nmember of the conference. But while the conferees did do something that \nwas good--that is, make sure the taxpayers do not have to pay the \nalternative minimum tax--they had another choice, and the choice \nbasically is this: Do they enact a tax break that does not take effect \nuntil 2009, for investors, or do they include provisions such as the \nresearch and development tax credit, the WOTC, the work opportunity tax \ncredit, the tuition tax deduction, and the teachers deduction, which \nexpired last year? Do they enact those and extend those for this year \nso people will still know research and development is important this \nyear?\n  Again, the choice is: On the one hand, enact a provision that does \nnot take effect until 2009 for investors or, instead of doing that, \nbecause that can be postponed for a couple years--we are not yet in \n2009--extend the provisions which expired last year. These are \nprovisions that American business and industry and innovators are \ndesperately depending on--that is, the research and experimentation tax \ncredit--to help America be competitive in the world. Or they could have \nincluded provisions that parents paying for college tuition can count \non, teachers can count on for the supplies and so forth. All of these \nexpired last year.\n  So again, the choice is: a 2009 tax break or help maintain those \nprovisions which expired last year. That is basically what all this \ncomes down to. That is the choice that was before the conferees. And \nthe conferees chose the former, the 2009 extension--it does not take \neffect for a few more years--for the most well-off, at the expense of \nAmerican businesses, their companies, and universities that are so \ndepending on the research and experimentation tax credit. And, at the \nexpense of teachers who so clearly today depend upon that little extra \nhelp for classroom supplies, at the expense of kids and families who so \nneed that tuition deduction.\n  That was the choice that was made. And the choice, as I said, was \nideological wants of a few at the expense of America's needs. That is \nbasically what is before us today. That is why I think it makes sense \nnot to adopt this conference report.\n  Madam President, our country is in a battle. It is a competitive \nbattle with the rest of the world--China, India, Eastern European \ncountries. There are so many countries that are so excited about their \nfuture, and they are trying to increase their economic position. I take \nmy hat off to them. They are trying very hard, and they are doing a \ngreat job. Certainly, businesses in China and India are.\n  We have to meet that challenge. And it is a great opportunity for us. \nBut to meet that challenge, we have to start today thinking \nstrategically, thinking longer term. What does that mean? That means \nmuch more attention on education, a lot more attention on education, so \nwe have the best and the brightest in America who can design the \nproducts we can utilize here, with high-paying jobs here, and export \nthose products overseas.\n  Also, there is so much we have to do. We have to stop thinking short \nterm in this country, in this Congress, in this administration and \nstart laying the foundation for the long term.\n  Now, some will say: Well, we need, in 2009, to extend, for 2 more \nyears, the dividend and capital gains tax cut because that is good for \nAmerica. I have to say, I have lots of arguments and statements by very \nreputable people who say that is not the case. Let me refer to a couple \nof them.\n  Let's take the Federal Reserve. Let's talk about the stock market. \nFederal Reserve economists recently compared key U.S. stocks, which \nwould benefit from the 2003 tax cuts, to other investments, which would \nnot. What did they conclude? What did Federal Reserve economists \nconclude:\n\n       We fail to find much, if any, imprint of the dividend tax \n     cut news on the value of the aggregate stock market.\n\n  That is the conclusion of Federal Reserve economists. The \nCongressional Research Service agrees. What do they say?\n\n       Any stock market effects represent temporary windfalls to \n     holders of current stocks and are simply a manifestation of \n     the income effects of the tax cuts; these wealth effects \n     should not be considered as an additional stimulus. . . . \n     Recent studies finding that dividends had increased \n     substantially have been used to argue that the tax cut \n     induced private savings. This evidence does not appear \n     robust. . . .\n\n  There are lots of comments--lots. And I might say: Why is the economy \ndoing pretty well today? The proponents of this conference report would \nlike to say: Oh, it is because of the other tax cuts. The stock market \nwent up dramatically more before those tax cuts went into effect. And \nsince those tax cuts went into effect, the stock market has not done so \nwell.\n  I might also point out that the economy is doing well now. Why? Read \nthis morning's paper. There was a big, long article asking: Why is the \neconomy doing so well? And what does this morning's paper say? What are \nthe conclusions, basically? It is because of strong, aggregate demand--\nwhere? China, India--for commodities, for oil, for gas, for coal, for \nuranium. That is what I think has kept basically demand strong. It is, \nalso, frankly, a major propellant for the economy today. It is not the \ndividends and capital gains tax cut. That is a ruse. I am not going to \ngo into it any more than that because I know subsequent speakers will \nhave a blizzard of statistics to argue the opposite.\n\n  It kind of gets me to another point. When the rooster crows, does \nthat cause the Sun to come up? Does it? I don't think so. Did the \ndividend and capital gains tax cuts cause the great economy we have? \nNot necessarily.\n\n[[Page S4392]]\n\nYou have to ask yourself what is the real cause. The real cause is the \nunderlying demand from other countries which are buying so many \ncommodities. That is one reason why the price of oil is so high today, \nand that is what is causing the market to go up. That is what is \ncausing the economy to be strong.\n  We have to ask ourselves: That is today; what about tomorrow? What \nabout next year, 2 or 3 years from now? These tax breaks are also going \nto make the deficit and debt much worse. We want to be strong tomorrow. \nBy tomorrow, I mean the next few months, the next, couple 3 years. We \nwant the stock market to be high during that period. We want demand and \nwages to be high.\n  That will happen the more we focus on the basics today. The basics \nagain are education, research, and development so that we start \nstrategically to plan for our kids and grandkids. The conference report \nbefore us decides against that. This report says: No, forget the \nbasics. Forget teachers, forget research and development. Even though \nthose provisions expired last year, we won't do anything about them. \nRather, we are going to pass this provision which costs so much money \nin this budget and doesn't take effect for 3 more years. That is not a \nchoice most Americans would want us to make.\n  I notice Senators Bingaman and Dodd have been waiting to address the \nSenate. I would like to inquire through the Chair whether the \nRepublican side has a speaker who wishes to speak. If not, I yield 10 \nminutes to Senator Bingaman, to be followed by 15 minutes to Senator \nDodd. I ask unanimous consent for that. That is 10 minutes to Senator \nBingaman and 15 minutes to Senator Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I thank my colleague, Senator Baucus, \nfor his leadership and for yielding me time to make a few points. I \nknow my colleague from Connecticut is here, ready to make some \nadditional points. I will try to be brief.\n  I wanted to point out some of the reasons why I am strongly opposed \nto this reconciliation bill. I don't think it is responsible for us go \nforward with debt financing of another tax cut for the wealthiest \nwhile, as I see it, we are ignoring the need to reduce the deficit. We \nare ignoring many of the country's other needs. We are not following \nthrough on earlier efforts we made to create an energy plan for the \ncountry. I want to focus on that since I have been involved in some of \nthe legislation that put that plan in place.\n  A few weeks ago, the majority held a press conference announcing a \nvariety of initiatives to deal with our energy problems. One of them, \nof course, was to have a $100 check that would be sent to each \ntaxpayer. The public reaction was pretty swift. It was pretty clear \nthat the public thought this was a gimmick. They thought this was \nirresponsible, particularly given the size of the deficit. The majority \nessentially decided, then, that that was not a part of their energy \nplan with which they wanted to proceed.\n  Now they are bringing to the floor a tax bill which does virtually \nnothing for most of these people who previously were in line to get the \n$100 tax rebate. The question is probably coming back to some of these \npeople now that if we can afford to give the kind of tax relief that is \nprovided for in this bill to those who are better off, those who are \nwealthier, maybe we should go ahead and send $100 to everyone, sort of \nas a consolation prize, so that they, too, can participate in this tax-\ncutting effort. We ought to think of this in the context of what we \nhave been doing in the last few weeks around here.\n  It is estimated that in my State of New Mexico, there are about 18 \npercent who will, in fact, receive any benefit at all from the \nreconciliation bill before the Senate. If we look specifically at the \nbottom 60 percent of working New Mexico families, their average tax cut \nis $15. In contrast, the top 5 percent in my State would get 64 percent \nof the tax cut. This is at a time when the price of gasoline is very \nhigh, the price of educating a family's children is very high, and when \nthe price of health care is extremely high. Obviously, there is a ring \nof unfairness about the allocation of these tax benefits which strikes \neverybody.\n  I wanted to talk a minute about the provisions related to energy. An \nimportant part of the Energy bill we passed last year was to provide \ntax incentives that would move us away from dependence on foreign oil. \nWe passed a variety of those. Let me put up a chart that lists a few. \nOf course, there was an R tax credit which has already expired. There \nwas an electricity from alternative fuels tax credit. There was a home \nenergy efficiency tax credit, where you would get a credit if you \nwanted to put a solar heating system on your house, for example. There \nwas a credit for fuel cells for microturbines, an electric car tax \ncredit, clean renewable energy bonds, a hybrid vehicle credit. We put a \nlot of those in the law. Unfortunately, because of the fiscal situation \nof the country, we said: They are going to expire at the end of 2007.\n\n  That date is approaching. Frankly, the way we wrote it, we said: You \ncannot get the tax credit we are writing into law unless you have put \nyour project, you have built it and put it into service prior to the \nexpiration of the tax credit. Well, the expiration of the tax credit is \nabout 18 to 19 months away. A lot of people are beginning to say: Wait \na minute. Let's hold off on any additional investment in alternative \nenergy. We can't proceed with the wind farm, the solar power \ninstallation because these tax credits are going away.\n  We ought to be addressing that. Instead, we are saying: Let's add a \ncouple years, out to 2011, to the tax provisions that assist the most \nwealthy. That is misplaced priorities.\n  It is important that the Congress try to follow through on what we \ndid last year. We have a very short attention span in the Congress. Two \nweeks ago, everyone was holding press conferences about how we are \ngoing to solve our energy problems. Here we are now, using up any \nability we have to extend the tax credits that were part of the \nsolution to our energy problem down the road. We need to think about \nthat, and I hope we will.\n  Let me talk about one other issue that I believe is so egregious, it \nneeds to be focused on before the vote on this conference report. This \ncame to my attention, quite frankly, when I was getting a cup of coffee \nthis morning. I said good morning to one of the people who works in one \nof our offices here, a friend of mine. And she said: Good morning. \nAnother beautiful day in the land of make believe.\n  I thought, that sounds right. And I started questioning, as I was \ngoing back to my office, exactly why we all agree that this is the land \nof make believe, this Congress, this Capitol Hill is the land of make \nbelieve. Then it became clear to me when I focused on this provision. \nUnder current rules in the Senate, we can't consider this bill as a \nreconciliation bill under special procedures, if it, in fact, would \nmake the deficit worse outside the budget window. That means after \n2010, outside the 5-year period. It is clear to everyone who is willing \nto look at it that this bill does add to the deficit after 2010. But \nthe folks who put this bill together have found a very ingenious offset \nwhich they claim will allow them to extend these tax cuts for the \nwealthiest without, in fact, adding to that deficit outside the budget \nwindow.\n  You ask: What is that ingenious offset? The ingenious offset is a \nprovision that allows couples with incomes over $160,000 to convert \ntheir individual retirement accounts from regular conventional accounts \ninto Roth IRAs and pay whatever tax is due in accomplishing that which \nwould be some tax. Of course, once they have made that conversion from \nthe IRA to the Roth IRA, then they have paid any tax that is due, and \nany future earnings on those funds is protected from any future \nobligation. That is why, when we wrote the Roth IRA into law, we made \nprovision and said: We are only going to give this kind of a tax \nbenefit to people whose incomes are not too high. If a couple has over \n$160,000 in income, they are not eligible for a Roth IRA. That was what \nwe determined. We said: Of course, you can't convert a regular IRA into \na Roth IRA if your income is too high.\n  In this bill we are saying that is no longer the case. In this bill \nwe are saying: If you are Bill Gates or Warren Buffett or whoever you \nare, if you have\n\n[[Page S4393]]\n\na regular IRA, you are welcome to and encouraged to convert it into a \nRoth IRA, pay whatever tax is due. And then, of course, from then on \nthere is no tax due. Why would we stick this in? This is another tax \nbreak for the wealthiest. Why would we stick this in? We stick it in \nbecause it results in some additional revenue coming into the Federal \ntreasury over the first 3 years that it is in effect. So while people \nare making these conversions and paying the tax they have to to make \nthose conversions, the Treasury is earning money. And we can use that \nmoney to offset the large deficit increase that otherwise would be \noccurring after this budgetary window, so to speak.\n  Of course, after the Federal Treasury receives that revenue for 3 \nyears, it starts losing revenue because of this very provision. As our \nVice President would say: It loses revenue big time after that. So we \nwill lose $4.5 billion in revenue over the 10-year period and \nsubstantially more in the future after that. So who benefits from this \noffset provision that was put into this conference report? I will tell \nyou who benefits from it: 99.4 percent of the benefit goes to the top \nquintile of income.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator has used the 10 \nminutes that was yielded to him.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me conclude by saying that there are many reasons \nwhy people should vote against this reconciliation bill. It is bad \nfiscal policy. It is bad priorities as far as what extensions we ought \nto be focused on at this time, if we can afford extensions. It also has \nin it some of these provisions that are bad policy and egregious in the \neffect they have. I hope my colleagues will reject the bill when it \ndoes come to final vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I begin by thanking my friend and colleague \nfrom Iowa, chairman of the Finance Committee, and the Senator from \nMontana for the hard work they and their staffs put in on this \nlegislation. These are not easy bills to deal with, either in this \nChamber or the other. And getting through conference always poses a \ntrying time for everyone. Regardless of what positions we take on the \nfinal product they present to us, we have a great deal of respect for \nthe work they do. I commend my colleague from New Mexico, as well, for \nhis fine comments this morning regarding this legislation.\n  It is sort of a nasty day in Washington weather-wise. I was noticing \nthis morning a lot of our constituents from around the country are in \nthe building to see their Nation's Capitol. We have a lot of students, \na lot of people with families, and graduating classes that have come to \nWashington. I was trying to think how I might explain to these younger \npeople, if asked--and I will be meeting with various student groups \nfrom my State of Connecticut later today--the $8.4 trillion in our \nNation's debt.\n  What is $8.4 trillion? That is a big number. That is the size of our \nnational debt as we gather here this day in May of 2006. The way I \nthought I could possibly explain it would be like this: Since they are \nin this building today, if these students would stand on the steps of \nthe Capitol and hand out one-hundred-dollar bills, a one-hundred-dollar \nbill every single second, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for the next \n2,635 years, you would equal $8.4 trillion--a one-hundred-dollar bill \nevery second, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for the next 2,600 years. \nThat is the level the debt has reached in the last 5 years under this \nadministration and in this Congress. That is a staggering amount of \nmoney.\n  So when somebody says to you: What is $8.4 trillion, explain it to \nthem in simple terms. I will hand out a one-hundred-dollar-bill every \nsecond for the next 2,600 years, every single day of the week, every \nminute of the day, and that is the national debt.\n  Now we are about to add $70 billion to that without paying for it. \nAnd the benefits don't even go to the average citizen. Quite frankly, \nvery few of them get much at all. In fact, the middle 20 percent of \nincome earners will get an average tax benefit of only $20. That \ndoesn't even fill a car's gas tank today. Go to your local gas station \nand try to put $20 worth of gas in your car and find out how much you \nget. That is your tax break.\n  If you fall into the $35,000-to-$65,000 range of income, that is what \nyou get out of this bill. So the benefits are very small and we're not \npaying for the bill, so it adds to the deficit and the national debt--\nwhich is already staggeringly high. Frankly, we are disregarding very \nimportant priorities that we ought to be considering. With all due \nrespect--and I know the managers tried their darnedest to get a better \nbill, and I know both of the gentlemen--this bill should be rejected. I \ndon't know how we go back to our constituencies and explain that the \nfiscal irresponsibility of this Congress and this administration should \ndictate that we ought to allow our national debt to grow to the extent \nthat it is growing.\n  So my hope is that when the vote occurs, our colleagues, Democrats \nand Republicans, would say no to this; that we should go back and try \nagain. This is not a good bill, and it will do a great disservice to \nour country.\n  What are we going to use the money for? Where is it going? We intend \nto use this money--this $70 billion that we are going to put on a \ncredit card--by the way, of that $8.4 trillion, who do you think holds \nabout a quarter of that mortgage? It is not held in America; $2 \ntrillion of that debt is being held offshore in some countries that \ndon't necessarily have the best interests of our country at heart. They \nare holding that mortgage, and we are going to give them $70 billion \nmore, more than likely, or a good part of it, to be held offshore.\n  We have young men and women serving in uniform in Iraq and \nAfghanistan who are putting their lives on the line. Are we going to \npay for that? Of course not. Are we providing for the veterans who have \ncome home who we know need significant help in health care? No. Are we \ngoing to invest in education? How many times do you have to read that \nwe need to do a better job in education in our country if America is \ngoing to be able to compete in the 21st century? But no. Research and \ndevelopment? No. How about alternative fuels so that we are less \ndependent on foreign sources of energy? No. Or infrastructure? There is \nnot a person anywhere who won't warn you that our roads, highways, \nsewage systems, and water systems are collapsing in many places, and we \nare doing nothing about replacing or maintaining them. None of this \nbill goes for that at all.\n  Under this bill, mainstream Americans--the middle 20 percent of \nincome earners--will get an average tax cut of $20. I suspect that a \nlot of the people we saw arriving in our Nation's Capitol, walking the \nhalls, would fall into that category. They are going to get about a $20 \nbreak in this bill. I won't go down this complete chart. But if you \nmake less than $10,000, of course, you get no tax break. If you make \n$10,000 to $20,000, you get $2. If you are in the $20,000 to $30,000 \ncategory, you get $9. If you make $30,000 to $40,000, you get $16 in a \ntax break in this bill. If you make $40,000 to $50,000, you get $46. If \nyou are in the $50,000 to $75,000 range, it is $110. I will jump ahead. \nIf you are in the two-tenths of 1 percent of the population of this \ncountry that makes more than $1 million, you get a $41,977 tax break.\n  I don't agree with some of my colleagues and others who talk about a \nsort of class warfare, pitting those in the middle against those who \nmake a lot of the money. I represent one of the most affluent States in \nthe country on a per capita income basis. Connecticut is always listed \nnear the top on per capita income. I have a sizable part of my \nconstituency that do well financially and would benefit under this \nbill. As I stand here today, I will tell you that the majority of those \npeople who do well in my State think this bill is a bad idea. They are \nnot calling and writing and e-mailing and demanding that this bill be \nsigned into law. They understand fiscal responsibility. They think it \nis a mistake for us to go deeper and deeper into debt, and to deliver \nlittle or no benefit for anyone other than those with incomes of over \n$1 million.\n  There are 146,000 people in this country in the top one-tenth of one \npercent\n\n[[Page S4394]]\n\nof income earners, who make more than $5 million a year on average. \nThey get an $82,000 tax break under this bill; 146,000 people get an \n$82,000 tax break. How many of those people do you think actually need \nthat tax break to make the kind of investments that the supporters of \nthe bill envision? A tiny fraction, if any, would admit that this bill \nhas any merit when it comes to growing our economy. I do know that a \nsmall percentage of our population gets a windfall here. The average \ncitizen gets little or nothing.\n  We are not making the kinds of investments in our country that we \nought to be making, and we are going deeper and deeper into debt. We in \nthis generation are going to have an awful lot of explaining to do to \ncoming generations, as to why we left such a mess on their doorstep as \nwe go off into retirement and they are left trying to figure out how to \npay these bills.\n  My colleague from North Dakota, and others, when we considered the \nbill on the floor, offered amendments to pay for these provisions. We \nlost them on party-line votes, pretty much. If you want to have a $70 \nbillion tax break, pay for it, we said, but we lost. Pay-as-you-go \nproposals were made on this side of the aisle. They were rejected by \nthe other side. Of course, we come back from the conference report with \nthe House and the bill gets even worse.\n\n  Let me you show what happened. Senator Bingaman of New Mexico did \nthis eloquently. Let me explain it again because it shows you the sort \nof fantasy world in which people are living. We have all kinds of \npriorities we need to address in the tax code, some of which were part \nof this bill when it went over from the Senate--provisions that \nprovided for research and development tax incentives, electricity from \ncleaner fuels, energy-efficient home tax credits, solar investment, \nelectric car credits, and so forth--reflecting what we are hearing from \nconstituents: Do something about the dependency on foreign oil and the \nrising price of gasoline. That is what our constituents are asking us \nto do for the future. But we go to a conference and come back and we \ndump provisions like the R tax credit from the bill and fail to \naddress the pressing energy issues. This bill addresses none of those \npriorities. Under previous legislation, we've taken care of estate tax \nrelief and top marginal tax relief up until 2010. And now in this bill, \nwe have, of course, capital gains and dividend tax relief in this bill, \nwhich have 2 more years on them. They are not going out of date in the \nnext few months, or even the next year. Why not wait and see whether \nyou really think you need to extend them further? Instead, we dump the \nvery provisions to which the American people think we ought to pay \nattention, not to mention putting non-pressing capital gains and \ndividends tax benefits ahead of all these other items I talked about \nthat the American people think are important.\n  So the R tax credit is gone. A chance to address the Alternative \nMinimum Tax for a more meaningful length of time is gone. How about the \nprovisions for kids in college that allow their parents a deduction for \ntuition expenses? That got dropped from the bill. How many Americans \nwould like tax relief when they are looking at the rising cost of a \ncollege education? It is very important to us as a country that those \nof you in the middle-income category in this country can afford to send \nyour kids to college. We provided for that in the bill, and it got \ndumped in order to take care of the top two-tenths of 1 percent of \nincome earners. Those were some of the ideas that we thought were \nimportant to send over to the other body.\n  As I mentioned, my colleague from North Dakota offered the amendment \nthat would have paid for these tax cuts, but it was rejected.\n  Mr. President, I find this terribly disappointing. I wonder if anyone \nis listening at all. I am not suggesting that all of the wisdom in the \nworld resides in one corner of this Chamber or the other. But I don't \nknow how, when the debt is mounting at the rate it is, with debt being \nheld offshore by countries who don't necessarily have our interests at \nheart, we are not investing in things that we ought to be investing in \nto make our country better prepared for the 21st century; how we are \nsquandering our ability to prepare for the great challenges we will \nface economically in the 21st century. In the midst of all of that, we \nturn around and take up a tax bill costing $70 billion, which is unpaid \nfor, the overwhelming majority of which goes to those who, frankly, \ndon't need it or want it. And we do this at the expense of everything \nelse we should be doing in our country.\n  Again, we are adding to that $8.4 trillion in debt. When you want to \nexplain it back home, just say if you give away a one-hundred-dollar \nbill every second of every day for 2,600 years, you will get that \nnumber. How do you explain that in 5 years we have accumulated so large \na portion of that debt, yet we are adding to it today with this \nirresponsible piece of legislation?\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this conference report when we have a \nvote later today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first, I will respond to some of the \nthings that Senator Baucus brought up in his opening statement. He \ncomplimented me in our working through this, and I always have a good \nworking relationship with Senator Baucus. And 90 percent of the time, \nor maybe more, he and I are on the same side of the fence. I remind \npeople in the Senate that on three occasions, in November and January \nand February, we were on the same side of the fence on this issue.\n  The difference between us now is related to the extension of the \ncapital gains and dividend tax credit that was not in the Senate bill \nat that particular time. And since it is not in the conference report, \nthat is one of the reasons he and I are on separate sides of the fence.\n  I will respond to some of the points he made on extenders because \nthey are not in the conference report. Senator Baucus's criticism is \nright that they are not in this bill. They are, however, covered in a \ncollateral agreement between tax-writing committees and congressional \nleadership. And on a document basis for my saying that we will be \ndealing with those, even though they are not in the conference report, \nI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a joint statement \non a collateral extenders agreement, that they will be in a follow-on \npiece of legislation that ought to be before the Senate very quickly. \nThese are not in dispute between the House and Senate. This is a \nproduct under negotiation, but these issues are no longer under \nnegotiation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     Chairman,\n     Committee on Finance.\n       Today a majority of conferees signed the conference report \n     on H.R. 4297, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation \n     Act of 2005, and filed it with the House floor. Sen. Chuck \n     Grassley, chairman of the Committee on Finance, and chairman \n     of the conference committee, made the following comment on \n     the conference report. A detailed summary of the conference \n     agreement follows.\n\n   Statement of Chairman Chuck Grassley, Senate Committee on Finance\n\n\n    conference report on h.r. 4297, the Tax Increase Prevention and \n            Reconciliation Act of 2005, Tuesday, May 9, 2006\n\n       The tax relief laws extended in this conference report are \n     working to strengthen the economy and protect millions of \n     families from footing a higher tax bill because of the \n     Alternative Minimum Tax. Rolling back these widely-applicable \n     tax relief measurea would hurt the economy and mean less \n     take-home pay for hard-working taxpayers. By acting on this \n     tax reconciliation conference report, Congress will assist \n     small businesses, encourage the kind of investment that \n     creates jobs and makes our economy grow, and ensure more fair \n     tax treatment for middle-income families who would otherwise \n     be left to pay a tax intended for wealthy individuals. \n     Ultimately, these temporary fixes need to become permanent \n     law if Congress is serious about promoting economic growth \n     and tax fairness.\n       In addition to the tax reconciliation conference report, \n     Chairman Thomas and I have an understanding about how other \n     expiring tax provisions will be extended in a second tax \n     bill, including relief for college students paying tuition, \n     teachers buying supplies for their classrooms, and the \n     research and development of innovative ideas that benefit our \n     society. The items in this second tax relief bill reflect \n     additional tax policy priorities for both Republicans and \n     Democrats in Congress, and I look forward to congressional \n     action on the legislation as soon as possible.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on Senator Baucus's criticism of the \ncharts that I used, let me say that the\n\n[[Page S4395]]\n\ncharts reflect the data of the Committee on Joint Taxation. I explained \nhow the Committee on Joint Taxation is a professional group, not a \nRepublican group or a Democrat group. They are paid by the taxpayers of \nthis country to be experts on tax policy. I challenge many of my \ncritics, and the sympathetic ears that these critics have in the east \ncoast media, to also use the joint tax data because in a lot of the \npresentations already, and today, we are going to hear statistics that \ndon't come from the green eyeshade people who have no political ax to \ngrind in the Joint Tax Committee but, quite frankly, come from liberal \nthink tanks who do have a political ax to grind.\n  I ask Democrats to use Joint Tax Committee data. I think my friends \non the other side have an issue with the perspective of the charts. The \ncharts I used earlier take into account the tax savings taxpayers enjoy \nrelative to their tax burden. Democrats tend to look only at the tax \nbenefit. They ignore the taxes people pay. That is where there is a \nvery real difference. It is philosophical. The charts I used are \naccurate.\n  On the number of taxpayers by State, the source is the Internal \nRevenue Service, not a conservative or liberal think tank.\n  Finally, on the need to do an extension now, just ask folks in the \nmarket whether this decision to extend the capital gains and dividend \ntax provisions ought to be done now or in the year 2008. We hear that \nit is very important to have a long-term tax policy if you are going to \nencourage investment, and that is why we are extending this now at this \nparticular time.\n  I would also like to refer to some comments that were made by the \nSenator from New Mexico. He spoke about the impact of one of our \noffsets for policy long term, speaking about the Roth IRA being the \nwrong kind of policy to put in this bill.\n  It is interesting to hear my friends on the other side criticize the \nRoth IRA conversion provisions in the conference report. One would be \nled to believe that this protaxpayer provision is somehow an evil \nRepublican idea that the Democrats have never seen before. But I am \nafraid that my friends on the other side of the aisle have a short-term \nmemory. They are giving this Finance Committee chairman and my \nRepublican colleagues too much credit.\n  I wish I could take credit for what is called the Roth IRA. Maybe it \ncould be called the Grassley IRA. But I can't. There is another Finance \nCommittee chairman, not a Republican, who first laid out the exact IRA \nconversion proposal that is in the conference report we are going to \nvote on today.\n  Way back in 1991, there was a chairman of the Finance Committee, a \nfamous Senator from Texas, by the name of Lloyd Bentsen. He introduced \nthe identical provision as part of what they called the Tax Fairness \nand Savings Incentive Act of 1991. If the Roth IRA--later named the \nRoth IRA--was tax fairness in 1991 when the Democrats wrote it, it is \ntax fairness in 2006 as it comes back in a conference report.\n  Chairman Bentsen's bill would have allowed all taxpayers, regardless \nof income, to convert amounts from traditional IRAs into the new Roth-\nstyled IRA account that he also proposed. In fact, the only difference \nbetween Democratic Chairman Bentsen's original proposal and the \nprovision in the conference report is Chairman Bentsen's bill would \nhave given taxpayers 4 years to pay tax on converted amounts compared \nto the shorter 2-year period under the provisions in this conference \nreport.\n  But some may ask: Was Chairman Bentsen just a lone Democratic voice \nin the wilderness on this issue without support from fellow Democrats \nat that time in 1991? Not surprising to those of us who had the honor \nof serving with Senator Bentsen, it wasn't just his idea. His bill was \nintroduced with 13 Democrats as original cosponsors, and it has a \nprominent list of Democratic cosponsors, many of whom are still serving \nwith us in the Senate today. In fact, I can point to my good friend \nfrom Montana, Senator Baucus, as one of the original cosponsors of \nChairman Bentsen's bill. Let me name some others: Akaka, Dodd, Inouye, \nLieberman, Mikulski, and Senator Pryor's father was also an original \ncosponsor. So this is not a new idea, nor is it a Republican idea. It \nis an idea which has had bipartisan support in the Finance Committee \nand the Senate for the past 15 years, ever since Chairman Bentsen first \nproposed it. Indeed, the Bentsen bill was just the beginning of a long \nbipartisan history of this provision. So why today is there not \nbipartisanship on this issue?\n  In the next Congress, after Senator Bentsen became Treasury Secretary \nunder President Clinton, the bill was introduced. Senator Roth--who \nwould, of course, later become Finance Committee chairman--introduced \nSenator Bentsen's former bill, including the proposal that would become \nknown as the Roth IRA conversion proposal. Senator Roth introduced this \nbill with a bipartisan list of 57 original cosponsors, 24 of whom were \nDemocrats.\n  In the next Congress, Senator Roth reintroduced his bipartisan \nlegislation with 52 cosponsors, and 18 Democrats were cosponsors of \nthat bill, including Minority Leader Reid and Senator Kerry. It was a \ngood proposal for the Democrats then. So why is it not a good proposal \ntoday?\n  Democrats say they are concerned about the budget deficit, but we all \nknow our deficit was much larger as a percentage of GDP in the early \n1990s than it is today. The real question is, Do my Democratic friends \nreally oppose this protaxpayer provision that merely creates a level \nplaying field when it comes to access to retirement plans or do they \nonly have this objection because the provision is part of a progrowth \ntax relief bill that the Democratic leadership has decided to oppose \ntoday?\n\n  The bipartisan history of this concept didn't stop when Democratic \nChairman Bentsen became Secretary of the Treasury. Roth IRAs became law \nin the Tax Relief Act of 1997. The Senate version of that legislation \nallowed all taxpayers to convert traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs, the \nsame as the conference report before us this very day.\n  That bill passed the Senate--now listen, that bill passed the Senate. \nThe exact thing we are doing today passed the Senate by an overwhelming \n80-to-18 bipartisan vote.\n  When an income limit was placed on Roth IRA conversions during the \nconference negotiations in the 1997 act, the Senate came back the very \nnext year in the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act and again showed \nbipartisan support for expanding the eligibility for Roth IRA \nconversions. Expanded Roth IRA conversion eligibility was part of the \nSenate bill which passed unanimously 97 to 0. So obviously Democrats \nvoted for it then. It was also included in the final conference report \nwhich passed the Senate 96 to 2.\n  I hope this makes it very clear that this isn't a provision which \ncame out of thin air. This isn't a Republican proposal. This isn't a \nbudget gimmick. This is a provision which Democrats have long \nsupported. This is a provision which was proposed by a Democratic \nchairman of this committee. This is a bipartisan provision. And most \nimportantly, it is a good provision. Good policy makes good politics. \nIt is a protaxpayer provision. This is a provision which means all \nAmericans have access to the same retirement plans. This is a provision \nwhich brings in real revenue to the Federal Government. This is a \nprovision which will increase tax compliance in an area in which there \nis much room for improvement. This is a provision which rewards those \nwho work hard, pay their taxes, and do what we need to do more of: save \nfor retirement. That is why it has such a long history of bipartisan \nsupport. It also is why it is a very good part of this conference \nreport.\n  I would think people on the other side of the aisle would be ashamed \nof damaging the very good image Senator Bentsen had as a U.S. Senator, \nas a Democrat, as chairman of the Finance Committee. Why don't they \nhonor his reputation as a Senator and vote for provisions he had that \nare in this conference report rather than being so partisan?\n  Mr. President, my friend from Montana referred to a report published \nby Federal Reserve staff, and I would like to make a few comments on \nthat.\n  The report compares U.S. and European stock values during brief \nperiods of time before and after the lower rates were announced in late \n2002 and enacted in 2003. Since U.S. and European stock values moved \ntogether, the report concludes that the lower rates had\n\n[[Page S4396]]\n\nno effect on the aggregate market value of U.S. stocks.\n  The report was written by members of the Federal Reserve staff. It \ndoes not represent the views of the Federal Reserve itself. In fact, \nChairman Alan Greenspan has repeatedly testified before the Congress \nthat lower rates on dividends and capital gains represents good tax \npolicy, and Ben Bernanke has cautioned that not extending the rates \nsoon could negatively impact the economy.\n  I am not an economist, but it seems to me that the analysis of these \nFed staffers is overly simplistic for at least four reasons:\n  First, the analysis covers a very short period of time--2 months \nsurrounding the President's proposal in January 2003 and 4 months \nsurrounding enactment of the reduced rates in May 2003. Looking at such \na short period of time, the Fed staffers only tried to determine if the \nnews of the tax cut had an effect on the U.S. market. Now, I am a \nbeliever in the efficient capital markets theory to some degree, but it \ncan't be that simple. Surely, the broader, longer term benefits of \nthese lower rates on the economy should be considered more than simply \nthe news of their enactment.\n  Second, the analysis essentially assumes away all other factors \nduring that short period of time could affect U.S. markets and European \nmarkets differently. It is hard for me to understand how this \nassumption could be valid. If that was true, then why would anyone \nconsider investing in European stocks as a diversification strategy?\n  There is a multitude of factors that would seem to affect the U.S. \nand European markets differently, given how complex the U.S. and \nEuropean economies are. The Wall Street Journal article that described \nthis report noted a few things that ``might have contributed to a rise \nin European stocks or a drop in the U.S. market during the review \nperiods'':\n  In the U.S., some companies reported weaker than expected earnings, \nwhile some European firms reported strong earnings;\n  There was a terrorist bombing in Saudi Arabia that ``rattled'' the \nU.S. market;\n  There were concerns about the weak dollar.\n  Third, the analysis assumes that the impending war in Iraq would \naffect U.S. and European stocks equally. Again, I am not an economist, \nbut I find this assumption hard to believe.\n  Fourth, the Fed staffers' analysis does nothing to convince me that \ntaxing something less doesn't make it worth more. It is common sense \nthat people value assets based on how much those assets put in their \npockets on an after-tax basis. So if the Government taxes certain \ninvestments less, it makes those investments worth more, relative to \nother investments. Of course, there are many other factors besides tax \npolicy that affect investment value. But we should do what we can in \nterms of tax policy to promote economic growth.\n  The Wall Street article concludes with a quote from Michael Thompson, \ndirector of research at Thomson Financial, that ``attributing stock \nmarket gains to one isolated factor risks being `intellectually \ndishonest' ''. It would be just as intellectually dishonest to point at \nthis simplistic study as a reason to raise taxes on dividends and \ncapital gains.\n  Mr. President, my friend from Montana criticized the charts I showed \nearlier that showed how lower income taxpayers, relative to their tax \nburden, have more at risk than higher income taxpayers. In light of \nSenator Baucus' criticism of those charts, I want to go into detail \nregarding how the statistics were calculated by my Finance Committee \nstaff.\n  To get a clear picture of the relative benefits of this tax policy, I \nhave taken another step in the distributional analysis.\n  I looked at the size of the tax benefits in relation to the total tax \nliabilities that these taxpayers bear.\n  The results of this analysis show that, among taxpayers who benefit \nfrom this tax policy, those with less than $50,000 of AGI benefit more \nfrom this tax policy, especially when the lower income tax rate drops \nfrom 5 percent to zero percent.\n  According to the JCT data, 6.3 million tax returns with adjusted \ngross income of less than $50,000 benefited from the reduced tax rates \non dividends.\n  The aggregate total income tax liability of these taxpayers was $12.4 \nbillion, which is an average of $1,968 per tax return.\n  In 2005, the lower tax rates on dividends saved these taxpayers $600 \nmillion in the aggregate at an average of $95 per return.\n  In 2008, if we assume the same data, the elimination of dividend \ntaxes for lower income families will save them an additional $350 \nmillion, which is an average of $56 per return.\n  In total, this tax policy will save $950 million, or an average of \n$151 per tax return.\n  That produces a savings of 7.6 percent for these taxpayers.\n  Tax returns with more than $200,000 in adjusted gross income would \nsave $6.5 billion in the aggregate, or an average of $2,964.\n  These numbers, of course, are much bigger than the savings numbers \nfor the less than $50,000 of AGI category. But these numbers represent \nonly 2.2 percent of this group's total tax liability.\n  The estimates for capital gains show that 3.6 million tax returns \nwith under $50,000 of AGI will report a savings of $680 million from \nlower tax rates on capital gains, or an average of $189 each, producing \na 10.2-percent tax savings.\n  Those with $200,000 or more in AGI will save $13.7 billion in the \naggregate or $11,421 each on average. To be sure, these dollar numbers \nare much higher than the less than $50,000 group, but as a percentage \nof total tax liability, it is only 7.6 percent, lower than the savings \nof the less than $50,000 group.\n  And what about seniors?\n  2.4 million tax returns filed by seniors with adjusted gross income \nof less than $50,000 benefited from the reduced tax rates on dividends.\n  The aggregate total income tax liability of these taxpayers was $4.4 \nbillion, which is an average of $1,833 per tax return.\n  In 2005, the lower tax rates on dividends saved these seniors $500 \nmillion in the aggregate at an average of $208 per return.\n  In 2008, if we assume the same data, the elimination of dividend \ntaxes for lower income seniors will save them an additional $250 \nmillion, which is an average of $104 per return.\n  In total, this tax policy will save seniors $750 million or an \naverage of $312 per tax return.\n  That produces a savings of 17.1 percent for these taxpayers.\n  Four hundred thousand tax returns for seniors with more than $200,000 \nin adjusted gross income would save\n  $2.7 billion in the aggregate, or an average of $6,775 each, \nrepresenting a 5.7-percent savings.\n  The estimates for capital gains show that 1.5 million tax returns \nwill be filed by seniors with under $50,000 of AGI, reporting a savings \nof $305 million from lower tax rates on capital gains or an average of \n$204, producing a 13.2-percent tax saving.\n  Seniors with $200,000 or more in AGI will save almost 3.8 billion in \nthe aggregate or $12,633 on average representing a 10-percent savings.\n  Now, I have a couple charts that summarize the tax savings as a \npercentage of total income tax liability across AGI levels.\n  This chart illustrates the relative savings from reduced dividend \ntaxes across AGI levels.\n  Opponents of this policy want to persecute these taxpayers by taking \nback their 2.2 percent savings.\n  But at the same time they will punish these taxpayers by taking away \ntheir 7.6 percent savings.\n  And they will punish these seniors by taking away their 17.1 percent \nsavings.\n  This chart illustrates the relative savings from reduced capital \ngains taxes across AGI levels.\n  Opponents of this policy want to persecute these taxpayers by taking \nback their 7.6 percent savings.\n  But at the same time they will punish these taxpayers by taking away \ntheir 10.2 percent savings.\n  And they will punish these seniors by taking away their 13.2 percent \nsavings.\n  As this data shows, the tax policy enacted by Congress in 2003 to \nlower taxes on dividends and capital gains has provided meaningful \nbenefits to taxpayers across the income spectrum, not just the rich.\n\n[[Page S4397]]\n\n  In fact, lower income taxpayers will save more than higher income \ntaxpayers when measured as a percentage of total tax liability.\n  These lower rates have allowed millions of taxpayers to keep more \nmoney in their pockets to spend or add to their savings through \nreinvestment in the economy, rather than give it to the Federal \nGovernment to spend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I am so appreciative of Senator Grassley \ncoming to the floor to set the record straight. It is so difficult to \nsit back in our offices and watch the debate and hear our Democratic \ncolleagues distort so many facts. I would like to straighten out a \nlittle bit of the record myself. Unfortunately, the Wall Street Journal \nthis week, along with a lot of other publications, has also tried to \nset the record straight.\n  I hear my Democratic colleagues saying the President and the tax \npackage has been a great benefit to the wealthy and hurt the poor. But \nsince the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, the tax burden has actually \nshifted more to the wealthy. The percentage of Federal taxes paid by \nthose with incomes of $200,000 and above has risen 40.5 percent to 46.6 \npercent. In fact, today, out of 100 Americans, the wealthiest 3 are now \npaying close to the same amount, about half of the total taxes as the \nother 97 Americans.\n  We have shifted the tax burden more to the wealthy. The richest \nincome group pays the largest share of tax burden than at any time in \nthe last 30 years, with the exception of the late 1990s. The record is \nclear.\n  The record is also clear that this tax package and economic growth \npackage is not for the rich. It is for the people who need jobs in this \ncountry. It is for the little guys, the 5 million people who have \ngotten jobs because of our economic growth.\n  Those who say this tax cut is increasing the deficit need to look at \nthe expanded tax revenues last month alone, the second highest tax \nrevenue in history because of this economic boom.\n  Those who are focusing on this tax rescission package and saying we \nshould not be keeping the tax rate the same low rate for capital gains \nand dividends need to know that half of Americans now own stocks. They \nare savers and investors. Our goal as a nation should be to try to make \nevery American a saver and investor. In fact, if some of the Democrats \nhad voted with us just a few weeks ago, we could have stopped spending \nthe Social Security retirement funds of Americans and made every \nAmerican a saver and investor. The number of people owning stocks in \nAmerica has risen, more than doubled since 1983 when it was about 40 \nmillion, and now it is over 90 million, and we have seen incredible \ngrowth.\n  My colleagues also need to know the statistics of those who do own \nstock. They are not just rich Americans; they are retired \nAmericans. They are people with incomes below $50,000, about a third of \nthem below $50,000. So the facts just need to be straightened out.\n\n  I think we also need to take our Democratic colleagues to task on \nthings they have said about this economic package and what the real \nfacts are.\n  This chart shows a Democratic contention here that the Republican \nbudget will undermine potential GDP and hurt economic growth. You can \ngo back to 2001 when the first package passed and see the GDP growth \nconsistent over the years. We can also go to a quote Democrats had on \nthis floor which said: ``The President has put us on a fiscal course \nthat means lower employment.'' Here we see from this chart that \nemployment continues to go up in this country.\n  Let's put up a couple more charts quickly. The Democrats said the \nRepublican budget will crowd out private sector investment. But since \nthese tax cuts took effect, private sector investment has grown at one \nof the fastest rates in recent years.\n  Another quote from the Democrats: ``The Republican budget will raise \nequilibrium real estate rates.'' The interest rates have continued to \nfall with the housing boom across the country. Ownership has grown.\n  The facts are, frankly, indisputable. I agree with Senator Grassley. \nIt is a shame for folks to come down and distort the reality of what is \nhappening and what we are doing to help the American people at every \nlevel. One out of every two households in America is earning stock, and \nallowing them to keep more of what they are earning through those \nstocks only makes common sense.\n  Mr. President, I yield to Senator Lott, who I think would like to \ncontinue to set the record straight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to get an agreement \nfor the lineup of speakers over the next several minutes. It has been \ncleared by both managers here in the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the next speakers come up in this order: \nSince Senator DeMint has finished, next would be 5 minutes for Senator \nHutchison, to be followed by 15 minutes for Senator Schumer, to be \nfollowed by 10 minutes for myself, followed by 15 minutes for Senator \nWyden after I finish speaking, and then Senator Enzi would come next, \nto be followed by Senator Boxer for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. We did not indicate a time amount for Senator Enzi. We were \nnot able to confirm exactly how much time he would need. I think part \nof it would depend on how the rest of the time goes.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of hard-working American people, I am \npleased to rise today in support of picking up this very important Tax \nIncrease Prevention Act. I have been looking forward to this for almost \na year now, and finally we have reached the magic moment. I believe we \nare waiting for Senator Hutchison to arrive. While she is on her way, \nlet me just put in the Record at this point the timeline of what has \ntranspired.\n  First of all, the tax reconciliation legislation passed the Senate \nFinance Committee on November 15, 2005. The Senate then passed the tax \nreconciliation bill 64 to 33, a very strong bipartisan vote. On \nDecember 8, 2005, the House passed the bill 234 to 197.\n  Along the way, there were many hurdles thrown up, delays, and \nobstruction. In fact, instead of going to conference, because of the \nfact that the Senate had acted first, we actually had to bring it back \nto the floor of the Senate and go through the process again.\n  On February 2 of this year, 2006, the Senate repassed the tax \nreconciliation bill by a vote of 66 to 31, again bipartisan, actually \nan increased number. Then on February 14, the Senate completed action \non the debate, 10 hours of motions to instruct conferees with a mini \nvote-arama. But we completed our work, and conferees were appointed on \nFebruary 18. Now here we are with a conference report and a bill that \nclearly is needed to prevent a tax increase on working Americans.\n  I just wanted to get the timeline in the Record, and then I will have \nsome further comments, following the next two speakers, about the \nsubstance. At this time, I believe we are lined up for Senator \nHutchison for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak \non this very important legislation. I thank Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus for bringing us this bill. It was hard-fought. Tax cuts \nalways are. There are always those who will say: Oh, this only helps \nthe rich. There are always those who will say: This is going to \nincrease the deficit. Let's talk about what this bill in fact does.\n  This is a bill which will continue the tax cuts we passed in 2001 and \n2003, the tax cuts that have spurred the growth in our economy, that \nhave created jobs, the tax cuts that caused the stock market to \nimmediately turn from being stagnant or worse to being on the brink of \nrecord highs for the history of the stock market. If we don't pass the \nextensions that are in the bill before us today, it would be like \ntelling Wall Street and telling the investors: We are going to increase \nyour taxes; we are reserving that right. That would immediately put a \nfreeze on this economy, and it would stop the incredible prosperity we \nare seeing in our economy today.\n  We can look at what has happened to our economy since September 11, \n2001, when our tourism industry was severely impacted and our entire \nairline\n\n[[Page S4398]]\n\nindustry was shut down. Commerce was affected. We had a huge hit to our \neconomy in 2001. Then we have had the war on terror, trying to keep \nterrorists who attacked our country in 2001 from being able to come \nback and hurt Americans again, and that has caused us to have to spend \nbillions of dollars more. Then we were hit with Katrina, the worst \nhurricane in dollar damage in the history of our country, and Rita \nfollowing that. We have had huge hits on our economy. Now we have \ngasoline prices and energy prices that are going through the roof. But \nour economy is strong. Our economy is strong for several reasons, one \nof which is that we have kept taxes low, particularly on dividends and \ncapital gains.\n\n  So when someone says these are tax cuts for the rich, the fact is \nthese are tax cuts for small business. These are tax cuts which have \nallowed them to start hiring people again and have spurred our economy \nto new highs. With this bill, we will prevent the egregious reach of \nthe alternative minimum tax on our middle class by extending the higher \nexemption levels we approved last year. We also make an incredible \ninvestment incentive for the younger people in our country with the \nability to convert Traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs.\n  If I were only 35 years old, I would be so excited because I would \nknow that under the provisions of this bill I could provide for my own \nretirement security through the use of the Roth IRA. The Roth IRA has \nbeen limited in use with a salary cap of $100,000 for conversions. If \nyou make more than that, you can not convert from a Traditional IRA to \na Roth IRA, which allows you to put money in and then earn interest tax \nfree until your retirement, and you can take it out tax free. That is a \nnest egg which could make every American self-sufficient because you \ncan just put in the $3,000 or $4,000 every year, and once it is in \nthere it is tax free, expanding its scope, interest rates going back \ninto the pot, and then you can take it out without paying taxes. The \ntraditional IRAs are not that way; you do have to pay taxes. This bill \nallows people who have started a Traditional IRA to convert it to a \nRoth IRA without income limitations. That is going to help the young \npeople of our country because any of them, if they are working or if \nthey are married, will be able to do this.\n  Tax cuts have created 5 million new jobs since they were last passed \nin 2003.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will pass this bill. It is a good bill for \nour country, a good bill for our economy, and it is going to put money \nin the pockets of the people who are earning it instead of sending it \nto the Federal Government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be ceded \n15 minutes from our side's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is already recognized under the \nprevious unanimous consent agreement for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, everyone here knows we are going to vote \non a $70 billion reconciliation bill later today, and it is far \ndifferent from the bipartisan bill that originally passed the Senate. I \nwould like all of America to please pay attention to this bill because \nif anything ever showed the differences between the two parties, this \nis it. We want to help the middle class; they want to help the richest \npeople in America who are doing very well already. That is the \nfundamental difference between the bill that left the Senate with \nbipartisan support and the new bill that is coming back.\n  My good friend from Texas said: Help the people who earn it. Far too \nmuch of this bill goes to the people who make over $1 million a year; \nfar too much. If there were no harm to the middle class, that would be \ngreat. But too many provisions that affect the middle class are hurt, \nand the one that I am going to focus on is one of the best provisions \nwe have passed under this new President, and that is making tuition tax \ndeductible for people whose incomes go up to about $150,000. That is \ngone. That is not extended for 1 new year or 2 new years; it is gone. \nAnd in its place are tax benefits for the wealthy and, worst of all, \nthe removal of $5.1 billion of tax increases on the oil companies which \nare making record profits. No one likes to tax anybody, but I ask \nAmerica: Oil companies or middle-class students? Whom do you pick? The \nleadership, the Republicans, and the President chose the oil companies. \nDemocrats choose middle-class students struggling for college.\n  It is not just this issue. That is a metaphor for why Americans are \nlooking for change. That is a metaphor for what they finally \nunderstand--that the trickle-down economics, which gives the \noverwhelming benefit of the tax cuts to the wealthy with a few crumbs \nfor the middle class, doesn't work anymore.\n  Politics is a tough and tricky business, but sometimes you get handed \nan issue that is so crystal-clear, you want to make sure everybody \nknows about it. And this tax bill so perfectly shows the Republican \nmajority's misplaced priorities that I think the American people are \ngoing to see it the way most of my colleagues and I see it. This bill \nshows the true colors of the Republican Party, which is far more \ninterested in helping the very wealthy--God bless them--than hard-\nworking middle-class Americans.\n  Make no mistake about it. There is a choice. There is a choice. You \ncan't do both. And when people on the other side of the aisle, whether \nthey are up for reelection this year or not, vote against our proposals \nand vote for this tax bill, they will be taking away from the middle \nclass one of the best benefits we have given the middle class in recent \nyears.\n  Let me talk a little bit about this issue. Several months ago, the \nSenate passed its version of the tax bill with 66 votes, 17 Democrats, \nmyself among them. Our bill contained AMT relief, which this bill does, \nbut it also contained college tuition. The extender package, including \na 4-year extension of college tuition deductibility, which I was proud \nto author, was in the Senate bill, but because, again, the White House, \nthe House leadership, and Senate leadership said: No, no, no, big oil \ncomes above middle class students, it is gone. To refresh everyone's \nmemory, since our Republican conferees seem to have forgotten, the 2001 \ntax cut contained a provision that made college tuition deductible for \nthe first time. The deduction, modeled on a bill I championed with \nSenators Snowe, Biden, Smith, Bayh, and Durbin--bipartisan--allowed \nmiddle-class families to deduct $3,000 from their tax return and that \ndeduction was raised to $4,000 a year in 2004.\n\n  Last year, single filers who made up to $65,000 and joint filers with \nincome up to $130,000 qualified for the full deduction, and there was \nalso a smaller $2,000 deduction for those with higher incomes.\n  For the first time, the middle class would get some relief. You know, \nwe help the poor go to college. We help the working poor go to college \nwith Federal grants. That is a great thing. But in every one of our \nStates, middle-class people came to us and said: What about us? I may \nmake $70,000 or $80,000 or $90,000 a year, but I can't afford tuition. \nWe finally came to their aid. It is gone. It is gone because the other \nside wanted to extend tax cuts that are already there in the outyears \nfor capital gains and dividends.\n  I am all for reducing the tax on capital gains and dividends, but it \nis there already. And the cavalier attitude--do something for 2009 and \n2010 and take away something from the middle class this year--again, \nbespeaks volumes as to why the American people are turning away from \nthe majority and the President and turning to us. I have consistently \nworked with my colleagues to try to expand the deduction. But as I \nsaid, this deduction is not in the report.\n  The conference report is also interesting for what it includes that \nwas not in the Senate version, as I mentioned: the 2003 tax cuts on \ndividends and capital gains for those earning $1 million a year. We did \nnot include those in the Senate version because the Senate believed \nthat those tax cuts that have already expired, such as the tuition \ndeduction, should take priority over tax cuts that are not scheduled to \nexpire for 3 more years.\n  I offered a resolution with Senator Menendez, a sense of the Senate, \nand got 73 votes. There will probably be 20 people who voted for that \nresolution saying support college tuition, not extend dividend and \ninterest income deductions which go to the very wealthy, that are \nalready on the books, and they are going to flip-flop when they vote \nfor this bill.\n\n[[Page S4399]]\n\n  Some of my other colleagues are going to speak of the distributional \ninequities, but I want to speak of the real choices we have with \ntuition, even assuming that it was a good idea to extend the capital \ngains and dividends tax cut. As I said, I believe that those taxes \nshould be reduced. I do believe they create growth. But there was \nanother alternative, because in the Senate bill was $5.1 billion which \nchanged the accounting and created revenues from big oil. Again, that \nwas taken out. If it had been kept in, we could have had the dividend \ncut, we could have had the capital gains cut, we could have had the AMT \ncut, and we could have saved the tuition deductibility for middle-class \nstudents.\n  So the choice was clear: Big oil or middle-class students. The other \nparty couldn't help itself. They had to side with big oil. That they \nare going to live with, certainly, through the 2006 elections.\n  Do you think half of America would choose big oil over college \nstudent tax deductions? Do you think a quarter of America would choose \nthat? Do you think 5 percent of America would choose that? Absolutely \nnot. But as in the past, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nthink they are insulated from the argument. They think by saying ``tax \ncuts,'' no one can show which tax cuts they have chosen over others. It \nis not true anymore. The tuition deductibility is a tax cut just like \nthe other tax cuts in this bill, and it is not there anymore.\n  The oil provisions should have stayed in. The first related to an \naccounting method that the oil companies use. Along with Senator Snowe, \nI added a provision that disallowed the oil companies from using LIFO, \nwhich means when the costs of your inputs are rising--in other words, \nthe price of oil--using LIFO allows the oil companies to make their \nincome appear lower than it is so they pay less tax; and oil costs are \nrising. So this would have simply restored some equity and made sure \nthey paid a fair amount of tax. But the President and the Republican \nleadership hated this one because they have to protect big oil above \nthe interests of middle-class students.\n  The Senate passed our provisions with 66 votes, and I suppose the \nconferees thought that in the dark of night they could put them back.\n  There was a third provision added by my colleague from Oregon, \nSenator Wyden, in addition to the two that I offered--one with LIFO and \none with profits they make overseas. They didn't put that one back \neither. President Bush actually spoke out against it a few weeks ago.\n  So the bottom line is simple, and there is an amazing coincidence. \nWhat was the cost of the oil tax breaks? It was $5.1 billion. What \nwould be the cost of extending tuition deductibility for 3 years to \nmiddle-class people? It would be $5.1 billion.\n  America, whom do you choose? If you choose big oil, continue to vote \nfor the other side. If you choose students, vote for us. This bill \ncould have had the exact same provisions in it with all of the \narguments made by others about needing the capital gains and dividends \ntax cuts, if simply the other side had the guts to tell big oil you are \nstill going to make record profits, but we are not going to allow you \nthis extra $5.1 billion. Instead, they are telling hard-working, \nmiddle-class families who are struggling to pay tuition: Tough luck. \nThe oil companies come first.\n  This is a sad day for the middle class. It is a sad day for those of \nus who know that a college education is crucial for the future for \nAmerica to stay No. 1. It is a sad day when this Senate turns its back \non the interests of others. The Republican majority will try to spin \nthis bill as a boon to the middle class. The facts show it is not true, \nand we are not going to let them get away with it anymore. Democrats \nare not afraid to face these issues because we know there are choices. \nWhen we convey the choices to the American people, we are confident \nthey will decide we need new leadership in Congress and the White \nHouse. We need change. Because a party that once heralded itself as \nfriends of the middle class has turned its back on that middle class \nfor the special interests.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am delighted to be here and be able to \nrespond to some of the comments we heard from the Senator from New \nYork. I do agree with him--up to a point. I agree that this bill shows \nthe stark differences between the two parties. One is for tax \nincreases, that is the Democrats, and one is for preventing tax \nincreases and supporting tax relief for all Americans--working \nAmericans, middle-class Americans, and seniors who depend on dividends \nand capital gains to be able to support themselves in their retirement.\n  My colleagues on the other side often say: Oh, yes, we are for \nmiddle-class tax cuts. But, in fact, when they get a chance to vote on \nthem, they almost always vote against them, or at least the majority of \nthem. Yes, this is a good example of the difference in the two parties. \nAs a matter of fact, the Senator from New York knows quite well that we \nare going to have a follow-on tax bill that is very close to being \ncompleted, and it has already been announced by the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee that it will include the relief for \ncollege students paying tuition. We are going to have that. It is \nalmost as if he thinks that because it is not in this reconciliation \ntax increase prevention bill, it is gone, it will not happen. I will \ntell you right here and now, it will happen. It will happen soon. I \nhave the press release from Senator Grassley, announcing that has \nalready been agreed to.\n  I do find it interesting, too, that Senator Schumer, while he talks \nabout how wonderful this tuition tax deduction is, when it was first \npassed in the bipartisan 2001 tax bill, he voted no. He voted no on the \nbill that had it in there. Now it is the most wonderful thing he has \never seen.\n  You know, there is a little positioning going on, on both sides. I \nunderstand that. But I think we need to look at the substance of what \nwe are dealing with and what the impact is going to be. I do want to \nemphasize this point again, too. Our senior citizens are very dependent \non the income they get from capital gains and also from dividends. If \nwe allow the tax on that to go way up, back to where it was, they will \nfeel it as much or more than anybody. So we need to be sure that we \nknow what the true impact is going to be if we do not stop these tax \nincreases from occurring.\n  With regard to the oil provisions, no final decision has been made on \nthat. That will be considered and will be a part of the next bill, \nfrankly. I think some of those provisions that were in the earlier bill \nshould stay in there, personally, but we are going to work through \nthat. But I want to go over some questions and some details of what is \nin the bill. I wonder, do the Democrats oppose the centerpiece of the \nbill, which is a $34 billion provision to ensure that the alternative \nminimum tax does not hit more than 15 million middle-income families \nthis year? I thought this was something they felt passionately about. \nYou know, we have to take action to stop the unintended consequences of \nthe alternative minimum tax, AMT--$34 billion. This is only a $70 \nbillion bill, and about half of it would go, clearly, to these middle-\nincome people.\n  Do they oppose exempting Americans with incomes up to $62,550 from \nthe onerous AMT? Do they oppose quadrupling small business expensing, \nwhich allows small businesses to write off up to $100,000 a year in the \ncost of new equipment?\n  There are two provisions there that, combined, take over half the \nbill, that clearly help middle-income taxpayers avoid the AMT and help \nsmall businesses that keep creating the jobs and moving the economy.\n  It prevents a tax increase for small businesses of over $7 billion \nfrom being foisted on this very important part of our economy.\n  What do they oppose? Do they oppose the progrowth policy of taxing \ncapital gains and dividends at 15 percent? Or at 5 percent--get this \nnow--5 percent for individuals in the 10- or 15-percent tax brackets? \nIf we don't stop these tax increases, you are going to see a \nsignificant tax increase for individuals in the 10- and 15-percent tax \nbrackets. Do they oppose that?\n  Contrary to the Democratic mantra, these tax cuts affect individuals \nat every income level. If anybody accuses my State, after being \ndevastated by Hurricane Katrina, of being a wealthy State--we are \ntrying to join the Union\n\n[[Page S4400]]\n\nand move up in our economic status. Yet, in my home State, over 150,000 \ntaxpayers will see a tax increase if we don't extend the 15-percent tax \nrate on dividends. Nearly 120,000 taxpayers will face a tax increase if \nwe don't extend the rate on capital gains.\n  That is IRS data. That is not something I put together with a pencil \nand a piece of paper.\n  The average tax increase will be nearly $200 per person per year. \nThat is significant.\n  I was explaining to my own daughter this very morning about how this \nbill is important to her. She doesn't have a lot of capital gains. She \nhas some dividends--not much but she is in that category which is \nsignificantly impacted by the AMT if we don't pass this bill.\n  I understand. I guess it is a political season and taking positions.\n  I don't believe Democrats oppose anything in this bill. In fact, the \nSenator from New York said: Well, yes, many people I guess in New York \nare concerned about the impact of a tax increase on capital gains and \ndividends. It is just that he doesn't like this one. If not this, what? \nIf not now, when? This needs to be done. What has been the impact of \nthese tax cuts? The economy has continued to grow astronomically in \nspite of all the major cataclysmic events we have been dealing with; \ncreating jobs; the American dream at the highest it has ever been; and \nthe number of American people who own their homes. Almost 70 percent of \nAmericans own their homes. Yet we clearly show from the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office that we have had a greatly higher \nunanticipated increase in the revenue from capital gains than we would \nhave had otherwise.\n  Do we want to kill the goose that laid the golden egg?\n  I don't understand why the American people are still not aware that \nthere are so many goods things happening in the economy. Unemployment \nis at 4.7 percent, which is caused by 5 million new jobs being created \nsince 2003. The gross domestic product is 4.8 percent--I was astounded \nby that growth--in the last quarter. Overall, household wealth is at an \nall-time high, reaching $51.1 trillion. Income is rising, and inflation \nremains in check. Lastly, but perhaps most critically, Federal revenues \ngrew by 14 percent in 2005, reaching a record $2.15 trillion.\n  The problem with the deficit is not insufficient revenue. It is \ncoming in. It is coming in because Presidents and Members of Congress--\nPresidents such as Kennedy and Reagan--knew that if you cut taxes in \nthe right way, you get important revenue. There are those who still \nwant to deny that, but history and the statistics speak for themselves.\n  I think this is a good bill. It is a relatively narrow bill in terms \nof portions included in it. We only have about five major things, and a \nfew little smaller points included in this bill. We are not finished. \nWe are going to have the follow-on bill. I want to keep the economy \ngrowing. I want to do the right thing. This is the right thing to do.\n  I am delighted to be here to speak in behalf of this legislation and \nto explain what is in it and to question some of the allegations that \nare being made about what is in it or what is not in it. This is good \nfor the American people because it will be good for the American \neconomy.\n  I don't understand this class warfare stuff that is always going on. \nIf you cut taxes for people who actually pay taxes, you automatically \nget less. When are we ever going to grow up and get over that?\n  I think it is good legislation. I am pleased to be here and support \nit. I urge my colleagues to vote for it. It will pass, and we will go \nto the follow-on bill which will have a number of other very important \nprovisions, and perhaps it will be part of what we do with regard to \nguaranteeing people's security and their pensions for the future, also.\n  I do not know if I have any time remaining. If I don't, I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I wish to say \nto the distinguished Senator from Mississippi that I am certainly not \ninterested in class warfare. But what I am interested in is giving all \nAmericans a fair chance to accumulate wealth. This legislation doesn't \ndo that, and that is why I am opposed to it.\n  My sense is that everybody in our country wants to do well. Everybody \naspires to be well off. Everybody wants to be able to get ahead. Yet \nthat is not possible in many respects because of our Tax Code.\n  The American people just finished the annual ordeal of doing their \ntaxes. This spring, Warren Buffet, the second wealthiest person in the \nUnited States, paid a lower tax rate than his receptionist. But under \nthis bill, that receptionist isn't going to get much of anything.\n  Senator Lott made a point with respect to the next tax bill. We are \ngoing to have another bill, Senator Lott said. But the bottom line is \nthe oil companies get their boost in this bill today. What Senator Lott \nand others have said is maybe sometime down the road we will start \ntalking about middle-class folks.\n  I think we have to give everybody in this country the chance to \naccumulate wealth. We have to do more than hand out gusher giveaways to \na fortunate few.\n  That is why I have introduced the Fair Flat Tax Act that gives \neverybody in our country the opportunity to accumulate wealth.\n  So we are clear on this oil issue, I want the Senate to understand \nsome of the history of it.\n  On November 9, 2005, the CEOs of the major oil companies came to a \njoint Senate hearing of the Energy and Commerce Committees. I asked \nthem then--it had never been asked in a public forum--whether they \nagreed with the President's statement that ``with $55 oil we don't need \nincentives for oil and gas companies to explore.'' The CEOs of \nExxonMobil, Chevron, Conoco, Phillips, and BP-Shell for the first time \nagreed that the tax breaks which had been provided in the Energy bill \nweren't necessary.\n  Having heard that statement, I said I want to begin, on a bipartisan \nbasis, to start working with colleagues in the Finance Committee to \nscale back these tax breaks that, to his credit, the President of the \nUnited States said aren't even necessary. I began to work with the \ndistinguished Senator from Montana, Senator Baucus, and the Chair of \nour committee, Senator Grassley, to try to start rolling back those tax \nbreaks. It was a very modest step that was taken. Our committee \nrepealed one of the tax breaks that dealt with what are called \ngeological and geophysical drilling expenses. But we got it passed, and \nfor the first time in 20 years, the Senate Finance Committee--I think \nSenator Lott was even there that day--a tax break that the oil \ncompanies had gotten was taken away. Repealing that tax break would \nhave saved about $1 billion. It certainly is not everything that is \nneeded to deal with these exploding deficits but a solid step in the \nright direction.\n\n  You then have a conference between the Senate and the House. At a \ntime of record profits, at a time of record prices, this bipartisan \namendment to make a modest reduction in the kind of tax breaks that the \nPresident said are not needed when oil is over $55 a barrel pretty much \ndisappeared. It was cut by more than 50 percent.\n  I say to my good friend from Mississippi that I can't accept a double \nstandard where the oil companies get their tax breaks today--they get \nthem right now--and yet, the Senate will come back and maybe sometime \ndown the road start talking about relief for the middle class.\n  I want to work with the Senator from Mississippi. He and I have \nworked together on many occasions. That was why I felt that the \nbipartisan agreement I got in the original Senate bill was so \nimportant. But what I can't accept is a double standard, where you have \nthe gusher giveaways today on the oil side and then we hear--as we \nheard on the floor of the Senate--we will come back with another bill \nat a another time and maybe at that point we can talk about tax relief \nfor middle-class folks.\n  Another comment was made that I want to highlight about former \nPresident Ronald Reagan who, of course, is revered and respected by \nall. The last thing President Reagan did, to his credit, in the tax \narea is he worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, with \nformer Senator from New Jersey, Bill Bradley; the former chair\n\n[[Page S4401]]\n\nof the Ways and Mean Committee in the House, Dan Rostenkowski, on \noverhauling the Tax Code.\n  One of the steps that they agreed on is we were not going to hit the \ncops who walk the beat with a higher tax rate than somebody who is out \ninvesting, say, in Google stock.\n  We had a bipartisan agreement back in 1986 that we weren't going to \ndiscriminate against wages. We weren't in this country going to say \nthat the people who work hard and play by the rules and make their \nmoney from wages are going to get hammered.\n  What the Senator from Mississippi said I found very interesting with \nrespect to Ronald Reagan because what Ronald Reagan embraced in 1986 is \nexactly what I am calling for in my Fair Flat Tax Act. That is an \napproach that says we are in it together. We are all going to be able \nto accumulate wealth. Everybody is going to have a chance to get ahead. \nEverybody who aspires for a better life for themselves and their \nfamilies would have an opportunity to do it under the Fair Flat Tax \nAct.\n  They sure don't under this bill with those oil gusher giveaways right \nnow.\n  We have been told that sometime in the future, we will come back to \ntalk about middle-class folks, and we will have a discussion about \ntheir needs and what they hope for their families sometime. This is one \nother area where, again, I have a little bit of a difference of opinion \nwith my friend from Mississippi. He has talked about the fact that \ncorporate profits are up, revenue is coming in. Of course, we are glad \nto see all of that. But the reality today is this is the first time in \ndecades when corporate profits are up and productivity is up--both \ntrends we like to see--that middle-class people are seeing their wages \nstagnant. The middle-class folks are not enjoying the fruits of these \nbenefits of additional revenue. Again, I want our corporations to do \nwell. I want to see the incredible improvements in productivity. What I \nthink every Member of the Senate ought to be talking about is that not \nall Americans are in a position to enjoy these developments. That is \nwhy any time when I go home and have a community meeting, almost all of \nthe issues raised by my constituents have the second word ``bill.'' \nThey ask about their gas bill or medical bill or mortgage bill or tax \nbill.\n  That is why I want to work with Senator Lott on a bipartisan basis so \nthat when we have an expansion of corporate profits, when we see an \nincrease in productivity, the middle-class person can get ahead as \nwell. We are not seeing that today.\n  In fact, the Federal Reserve said the other day that, for all \npractical purposes, over the last 5 years, the net worth of middle-\nclass folks has hardly moved. What I want to do is what Ronald Reagan \nand Bill Bradley and others did back in 1986--make changes in the Tax \nCode so that everybody has the opportunity to accumulate wealth.\n  I wrote a bill, the Fair Flat Tax Act, which does that.\n  In fact, I am saying this to Senator Lott because I would love having \na chance to work with him.\n  I took the same brackets that Ronald Reagan did. I chose the exact \nsame tax brackets that Ronald Reagan did for my Fair Flat Tax Act. It \nis an indication that if we can have a bipartisan effort, as we saw two \ndecades ago before the 14,000 changes in the Tax Code since 1986, we \ncould see once again Democrats and Republicans coming together to \ncontinue the trend toward expanded corporate profits and corporate \nproductivity, but we would not be leaving the middle-class person \nbehind.\n\n  That is what is so unfortunate about what has happened. My proposal \nallows us to save about $100 billion over the next 5 years. By \ncontrast, the tax legislation before the Senate increases the deficit \nwith more tax cuts that aren't paid for.\n  In terms of tax compliance, you can go to my web site, \nwyden.senate.com to see my simplified 1040. People at Money Magazine \nwere able to complete this form in just 15 minutes. But this year, \nAmericans spent more complying with the Tax Code than the government \nhas spent on higher education. Is that what we want? Is that our vision \nof tax reform? I don't think so.\n  I think we want to build on the kind of bipartisan effort we had in \n1986. We had a revered Republican President, Ronald Reagan, who has \nbeen cited on the floor today, coming together with Democrats in both \nthe Senate and the House. We were able to do something that allowed us \nto grow the economy and also let middle-class folks get ahead.\n  Is it right that the cops who guard this wonderful institution pay a \nhigher tax rate on their wages than Warren Buffett does as the second \nwealthiest person in our country? I don't want to soak anyone. I want \neveryone to be able to get ahead. I want everyone to be able to \naccumulate wealth.\n  What we have been told under this tax bill is that the oil companies \nget theirs today, but we will have some other day, some other time, \nsome other opportunity to talk about the interests of the middle class. \nThat is not fair to the people of this country. We have said we are all \nin it together. We should not have a double standard with the powerful \ngetting theirs today and working families having to wait for another \ntime. That is not right.\n  While we are, for example, putting a little patch on the alternative \nminimum tax in this legislation, and I am glad to see that--the \ncrushing costs of this tax are not being addressed. My fair flat tax \nlegislation abolishes the alternative minimum tax altogether. That is \nwhat we ought to do before we see this thing ramp up and up and up, \nengulfing millions of middle-class folks who end up having to pay their \ntaxes twice.\n  I will wrap up with one last point. In this legislation, as we look \nat the tax cuts being offered in the bill to a fortunate few, we are \nseeing in the legislation that those who have crafted the bill are \ntaking the very money Senator Baucus and I have sought in order to keep \nrural schools open, something Senator Lott and a number of colleagues \non the other side have been with us on a bipartisan basis. Senator \nBaucus and I asked, are we going to sell off hundreds of thousands of \nacres of our public lands in order to pay for the rural schools? We did \nnot think that made any sense. So we said we are going to go to the \ndrawing board. We are going to come up with an alternative. We did \nthat. We said we were going to keep money from going to tax dodgers, \nmake sure they paid what was owed, and to make sure the federal \ngovernment honors our commitments to rural schools, rural schools in \nOregon, in Mississippi, and all across the country.\n  It is possible, as Ronald Reagan and Democrats did in 1986, to make \nthe Tax Code simpler, flatter, and fairer, and allow us to grow our \neconomy and do right by the middle class. The legislation I have \nintroduced, the Fair Flat Tax Act, is a starting point for the debate. \nWe ought to understand, certainly on the Committee on Finance where I \nhave the honor to serve with Senator Lott, that there is a lot of give \nand take in a tax debate.\n  What I do know is the bill that the Senate will be voting on before \ntoo long does not give all Americans the opportunity to accumulate \nwealth. That is why I must oppose it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we had an order lined up. Senator Enzi \ncannot be here at this time so we have agreed to go with Senator Boxer, \nwho is here. She is ready to proceed at this time. We have some other \nspeakers who will be here momentarily and we will get this lined up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Do I have a specific time associated with my remarks?\n  Mr. LOTT. We locked in 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Could I make it 8 minutes?\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask consent the Senator from California will be allowed \nto speak for 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, when I look at the distribution chart \nshowing who benefits from the bill before the Senate, my question is, \nwhose side are we on, anyway? I hope the answer to that question is, \nthe majority of the American people.\n  When we look at this chart, what we find is we are on the side of not \neven 1 percent of the American people. We are on the side of those \nearning over $1 million a year. That is who gets the benefits of this \nbill.\n\n[[Page S4402]]\n\n  According to The Urban Institute-Brookings Tax Policy Center, we see \nthat the average tax cut of those over $1 million is $41,977 a year in \nthis bill. The benefit of this tax break is essentially more than what \nsome middle class Americans earn all year.\n  Then we have an additional number from the Center for Budget and \nPolicy Priorities. Their chart shows if you earn over $1.6 million, \nthis Republican tax bill will get you back $82,000 each and every year. \nWell, what is someone who earns, say, $40,000 getting back? Forty-six \ndollars--not even enough in some cases to fill up a gas tank.\n  Whose side is this Republican Senate on? If this were a time when we \ndid not have deficits and we did not have debt, it would be one thing. \nI still would oppose this bill. I would rather give the benefits to \nthose in the middle. I would rather give the benefits to those who were \nstruggling with the high cost of gas. I would rather give the benefits \nto those who are struggling to send their children to college.\n\n  By the way, in this particular bill, the college tuition tax \ndeduction, so popular with middle-class families, was not included. The \nRepublicans took it out in order to help the wealthiest Americans and, \nby the way, big oil. Big oil gets big tax breaks in this bill, $5 \nbillion strong.\n  Here we have a circumstance where the millionaires and the oil \ncompanies win and middle-class America and working-class America, 99 \npercent plus, lose.\n  No wonder there is change in the air. People are saying, Enough is \nenough. Colleagues, we can say enough is enough today by voting down \nthis ill-conceived, unfair bill that punishes most Americans, except \nfor big oil and the very wealthiest few.\n  Yes, there is a one-year fix to the alternative minimum tax in here. \nFor that, I am grateful. Yet, still, that good fix is far outweighed \nwhen you look at the distribution tables. You can see who gets the \nbenefits. Twenty dollars for regular working and middle-class American \nfamilies is the average tax cut; $20 a year, while people making over \n$1.6 million get up to $82,000 a year.\n  This is America. This country is great because we believe in our \nmiddle class. We know our working people are the engine of our economy \nand the pride of our Nation, yet we have a table that shows that the \nmiddle class is not only forgotten, they are made fools of in this \nbill.\n  Yes, there is a fix to the AMT. Good. Outside of that, we have a \nsituation where those who have, get more; those who have a lot, get \neven more; and the oil companies that have been manipulating supply and \nhurting the American people get a tremendous amount.\n  That is how the tax break for big oil works.\n  See if you can follow me. They set the rules governing oil company \nprofits so that if an oil company buys a lot of oil at a low price, \nsay, $40 a barrel, and then they sell that oil at $70 a barrel, they \nget to pretend that they bought the oil at $70 too. You would think the \ndifference between $40 and $70 would be their profit and what they \nwould owe taxes on.\n  But under this bill, no, no, no. Their profits, and tax liabilities, \nare calculated on the price of oil on the day they sell the oil. So if \nthey buy oil at $40 a barrel and sell it at $70, they do not pay any \ntaxes on it because they are allowed to claim their costs are the same \nas their revenues--$70 a barrel. It is a giveaway to big oil, which is \nhaving the most unbelievable record profits, which we believe are \nmanipulating supply, and which gives their CEOs a $400 million bonus \npackage. This is what this Republican bill does. How they can even \nbring it to the Senate with a straight face is beyond me. But they have \nbrought it to the Senate. I ask those moderate Republicans to join us \nand send a message that it is time to change. It is time to look at our \nmiddle-class families in California and all across this country and \nstand on their side--those struggling with the gas crisis, those \nstruggling with health care, those struggling with college tuition.\n  This is a day when we ask the question, Whose side are we on? I hope \nthe answer is, we are not on the side of the winners in this chart. The \nwinners are the wealthiest among us and the oil companies.\n  Again, if this were a different time, if we did not have raging \ndeficits, which we have had since this President took office, if we did \nnot have a debt that is going so high that this Senate has to vote in \nthe dead of night to raise the debt ceiling, if we were not in a \nterrible war that is killing our soldiers, with no end in sight and no \nplan in sight, that would be a different story, and we could say a \nrising tide lifts all boats, and we will give everyone a break. But \nthose are not the times in which we live.\n  At the end of the day, the gimmicks that are used to pay for the tax \nbreaks are just so many gimmicks because we know by putting the \nwealthiest in the Roth IRAs, there is an initial flush of money coming \nin, but at the end of the day the earnings in the Roth accounts are not \ntaxable and will cost us billions of dollars in lost revenues. This \nbill will drive up our debt and deficits.\n  In closing, a recent NBC-Wall Street Journal poll asked Americans \ntheir top concerns. Do you think that Americans said, I want to give \ntax breaks to the oil companies? I want to give tax breaks to those \nearning $1.6 million a year? No, they said their top concerns were \nrising gas prices, Iran's nuclear ambitions, immigration, civil \ndisorder in Iraq, the Bush administration leaking national security \ninformation, and Enron-style corruption.\n  What do we give them today, the American people? We give them \neverything they do not want, rewarding big oil and rewarding those who \nhave not asked to be helped. They are doing fine. The people earning \nover $1.6 million a year are doing just fine.\n  We are giving the American people more deficits. We are giving them \nmore debt. We are not helping middle-class families solve the problems \nof the raging costs of college tuition and the raging costs of gas \nprices. I hope we vote no on this bill. It is a bad bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as acting manager, let me get some agreement \non time so Senators can plan accordingly. I ask unanimous consent the \nfollowing Senators be able to speak in this order: Senator Gregg for 15 \nminutes; Senator Feinstein to follow Senator Gregg for 15 minutes; \nSenator Thomas is next, for 15 minutes; and Senator Reed for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, could I \nask a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Could the Senator repeat that?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I apologize for not having my microphone on \nearlier. We are trying to lock in the next three speakers. Senator \nGregg will have the next 15 minutes, to be followed by the Senator from \nCalifornia for 15 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Mississippi \ngranting me this time on this very important piece of legislation.\n  I want to pick up on the statement made by the junior Senator from \nCalifornia. What are we giving the American people? We are giving them \njobs. We are giving them the opportunity to get good jobs in a \nthriving, growing economy as a result of good policy in the area of tax \nlaw.\n  We came out of an extraordinarily serious recession, the largest \nbubble in the history of the world, the Internet bubble--bigger than \nthe tulip bubble, bigger than the South Seas bubble--which occurred at \nthe beginning of 2000. It collapsed, which should have thrown us into a \ndeep recession.\n  We followed that bubble with a huge disruption of our lives, the loss \nof human life, which was unbelievable and horrific, as a result of 9/\n11, but also it had a dramatic impact on our economy.\n  Those two factors alone should have led to a fairly significant, deep \nand painful recession. Why didn't they? They did not because this \nPresident and this Republican Congress put in place tax policy which \nallowed Americans who wanted to be entrepreneurial to go out and \ninvest, take risk--which is the American way--and, as a result, create \njobs.\n  The facts are incontrovertible. This chart shows it. This is the \nperiod during which we had the Internet bubble\n\n[[Page S4403]]\n\nand the 9/11 attacks. In 2003, we reduced the taxes on productivity in \nthis country and gave people an incentive to go out and earn more, take \nrisk, and create jobs. As a result, we are seeing a dramatic increase \nin economic activity and in jobs.\n  Mr. President, 5.3 million jobs have been created since these tax \ncuts were put in place--5.3 million jobs in those 32 months. Look at \nthis green line on the chart. Those are all new jobs coming into the \neconomy as a result of the tax cuts. There has been a massive explosion \nin economic activity as a result of these tax cuts.\n  Now, the other side of the aisle will have you believe that the only \npeople who benefited from these tax cuts were the wealthy. Well, all \nthese people who got jobs benefited from these tax cuts. More \nimportantly, the American Government benefitted from these tax cuts \nbecause our revenues have climbed dramatically as a result of these tax \ncuts.\n  The reason that has happened is because assets which had been locked \nup for years are now being used to create better investments and more \nproductivity. In fact, revenues from income taxes have gone up by 10 \npercent. They have grown by 10 percent in the last 6 months. Revenues \nfrom corporate activity have gone up by 26 percent. This is all a \nfunction of putting in place tax rates which essentially said to \nAmericans: You go out and invest. You go out and take risk. You go out \nand create jobs. And we will say we will benefit your efforts by giving \nyou an incentive to do that.\n  Now, the essence of this whole effort is embedded in this tax bill, \nand that is the setting of a reasonable tax rate on capital gains and \ndividends. There is a psychology which is out there, which is human \nnature: If you say to a person: We are going to take 70 percent of your \nincome, they are not going to have a lot of reason to go out and make \nan extra dollar because the Government is going to take their money. \nBut if you say to someone: We are going to take 30 percent of your \nincome, then that person has a bigger incentive to go out and work.\n  The same is true for capital investment. If you say to somebody, if \nyou sell that asset you have, we are going to tax you at 30 percent, \nthat person has very little incentive to go out and sell that asset. \nBut if you say to that person, if you sell that asset, we are going to \ntax you at 15 percent, then that person has a reason to go out and sell \nthat asset, and take that money and do two things. First, they reinvest \nit so it is being used more productively and generates more economic \nactivity and probably creates more jobs, but, secondly, by selling that \nasset, they actually end up paying taxes, taxes which they did not \notherwise and would not have otherwise paid.\n  If you own some stock or a piece of land or a farm or any asset which \nis a capital asset, you do not have to sell it, you do not have to \ngenerate tax revenue to the Federal Government. That is what was \nhappening. A lot of people were sitting on those assets. But by cutting \nthe capital gains rate, we essentially created an atmosphere out there \nwhere people started to turn over those assets. As a result of turning \nover those assets, they created more productivity in our economy.\n\n  In fact, we are now at the highest level of productivity that our \neconomy has experienced in the post-World War II period. That \nadditional productivity has created more jobs so that more Americans \nare working. Mr. President, 5.3 million more Americans are working than \nwere working back in 2003 when these tax cuts began. Equally important, \nthe revenues to the Federal Government have jumped dramatically.\n  In fact, they have jumped so dramatically in capital gains that they \nhave outstripped the estimates by $30 billion each year over the last 2 \nyears. The CBO had originally estimated that we would have about $49 \nbillion of capital gains income in 2005. Well, we got $75 billion. They \nestimated, in 2006, we would have about $54 billion. We have gotten \nabout $81 billion. That is $60 billion of new revenue that was \ngenerated by cutting the capital gains rate to something that was \nreasonable and caused people to go out an convert capital assets--\nwhether it is stocks or land or businesses--convert those assets, sell \nthem, pay taxes, and reinvest in a way which would actually create more \njobs and more economic activity in the economy.\n  So this concept that cutting capital gains rates somehow benefits the \nrich cannot be defended on the facts. What it benefits is the American \nTreasury, the Government's Treasury. What it benefits are the people \nwho have gotten all these jobs, these 5 million new jobs.\n  Now, another chart over there that was used by the other side said: \nWell, the tax benefit flows to the top 10 percent of the income \nbrackets. Well, that is because the top 10 percent of the income \nbrackets pay most of the taxes. In fact, if you have income over \n$185,000, that is where 65 percent of the taxes come from. Those are \nthe folks with the highest income, those are the folks paying the most \ntaxes. That is the way it should be. And now they are actually paying a \nlot more taxes than they were before this tax cut because they are \ngenerating activity which is taxable.\n  Before the tax cut, when capital gains was so high, they sat on it. \nBut now, because there is an incentive for them to go out and convert \nthose assets, they are actually paying more in taxes than they were \npaying before. So the argument that the high-end taxpayer, the high-end \nincome individual is benefiting disproportionately from this simply \nflies in the face of the facts. They are paying more in taxes. More \nrevenue is coming in from those people than ever before. And a higher \npercentage, in fact, of Federal revenues now comes from those \nindividuals than ever before. And they are, most importantly--and this \nis the point that the other side seems to miss completely because they \nsubscribe to the 1930s ``old left'' theory of economic policy--these \npeople create jobs, and the bottom line is, good jobs.\n  That is what they are creating in our economy by going out and taking \nassets, which were locked down, which were in a less-productive \natmosphere, and moving them over to assets which are more productive \nand creating more opportunity for people to generate jobs.\n  It always amazes me that this concept completely escapes our friends \non the other side of the aisle. But this also translates into \ninvestment growth. It is ironic that both of these two charts show the \nexact same thing. And business investment has expanded dramatically. \nWhen did it begin to expand? In 2003, when we made these tax cuts. Job \ncreation has expanded dramatically. When did it begin to expand? In \n2003, when we made these tax cuts. These are not chance events. These \nincreases in jobs and business activity are a direct function of the \nfact that we have created a fairer tax climate, where people are \nwilling to be more aggressive, take more risk, be more entrepreneurial, \nand, as a result, create more jobs.\n  And to at this point take the position we should go back to the old \ntax rates, which would essentially double--double--we are not talking \nabout a little bit. We are talking about doubling. The position of the \nother side of the aisle is, they want to double the tax rate on capital \ninvestment, on risk takers, on entrepreneurs, the people who create the \njobs in our society.\n  To take that position now, in the middle of this recovery, which has \nbeen historic in nature, in that we are now at historic levels of \nproductivity--we have had 32 months of expansion. We have more people \nworking today in America than at any time in our history. To take the \nposition we would put this huge, damp cloth on top of this economic \nexpansion in the name of populous tax policy, which has been proved \nwrong over and over again, ever since it was conceived in the 1930s, as \nthe way to generate revenues--back in the 1930s and 1940s, the policies \nof the left were that you generated more revenues by raising taxes \ndramatically. And we had a 90-percent tax rate at one point in this \ncountry. Then, we had a 70-percent tax rate in this country.\n  Then, along came a gentleman who, ironically, understood this did not \nwork but, also ironically, came from the other side of the aisle. His \nname was John F. Kennedy. And he, as President, cut the tax rates \nbecause he believed the high tax rates were disincentivizing the \nAmerican spirit to be productive. He cut rates. And what happened? \nRevenues went up. And all the people from the left said: Oh, my God, \nthis can't be happening. This\n\n[[Page S4404]]\n\nmust be an aberration. It was not an aberration. It should have put a \nstake through the policies of the old left, but it did not.\n  So then along came Ronald Reagan, who said: Hey, it worked for John \nKennedy. I will try it. He cut rates. And what happened? Revenues did \nnot go down. They went up.\n  And then along came President Bush, and he said: John Kennedy and \nRonald Reagan were right. The way you generate revenues is you create \nan incentive for economic activity, you create an incentive for people \nto go out and invest, and you create more jobs. More jobs translate \ninto more taxpayers. As a result, you generate more revenues to the \nFederal Government. So he put in place his tax cuts in 2003.\n  The facts are incontrovertible. The numbers are coming in at a \ndramatic rate. We are seeing a 14-percent increase in revenues to the \nFederal Treasury. Last year, it was the largest single increase in our \nhistory in dollar terms; with 11 percent through the first 6 months of \nthis year. It is probably going to be even higher before we finish the \nyear.\n  The practical effect of this is these new revenues, these additional \nrevenues have been generated by a lower tax rate, a fairer tax rate. \nAnd they are assisting us in reducing the deficit. In fact, the deficit \nis coming down precipitously as a result of these additional revenues. \nAnd people are getting more jobs because this economy is vibrant and \nstrong as a result of these tax rates.\n  You would think after this approach to tax policy has been proven by \nthree major initiatives by three Presidents, being from both parties, \nin three different decades, the other side of the aisle would look in \nthe mirror in the morning and say: Listen, the policies of the 1930s \nand 1940s--which were taught to us as a result of the outgrowth of the \ntheory that if you constantly raise taxes, you generate more revenues--\nthose policies have been proven wrong. They have been proven wrong by \nPresident John Kennedy. They have been proven wrong by President Ronald \nReagan. And they have been proven wrong by President George W. Bush.\n  Human nature tells you they are wrong. If you give a person a reason \nto go out and be productive by putting a lower tax burden on them, a \nfair tax burden--we are not saying no taxes, we are talking about a \nfair tax burden. It is obviously not a tax burden that is at zero \nbecause we actually have high-income individuals in this country \nactually paying more in taxes today than they did prior to the tax \ncuts, significantly more, and also they are bearing a larger percentage \nof the burden of taxes today than they did before the tax cuts. It is a \nfairer way to approach tax policy. As a result of that fairer way, you \ngenerate more income, more economic growth, and that leads to more \njobs, which is the purpose of our efforts.\n  This bill is a critical piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator has used 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is a critical piece of legislation that we should \nendorse, embrace, and recognize that by its passage, we will continue \nto give the American people the opportunity to be in a vibrant, growing \neconomy where jobs will be created, not lost.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I believe I am recognized for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I don't think any single bill or issue more \ndelineates the difference between the Democratic and Republican Parties \ntoday than this bill and the issues it contains.\n  I would like to respond to the Senator from New Hampshire. He talked \nabout how good this was for job creation. Under the Clinton \nadministration, 23 million new jobs were created. So far, 2.6 million \njobs have been created under President Bush. Take a look at the \ndifference between the two in jobs and also in debt. These are the \nearly years of Clinton, up to 1997. Look at the blue. That is all \nsurplus: $69 billion, $126 billion, $236 billion, $128 billion. These \nare the years under George Bush, the deficit: $158 billion, $378 \nbillion, $412 billion, $318 billion, and $350 billion. So far, the tax \ncuts have cost $1.9 trillion.\n  I believe this conference report reflects misplaced priorities. It \nexacerbates an already serious deficit. It certainly exacerbates the \nnational debt. And most importantly, it is certainly not equitable.\n  At a time when most American families are struggling to meet the \nrising cost of living, we should be taking constructive steps to \nprovide targeted tax relief to those who need it most. We are not doing \nthat. You would think this package of tax cuts might take steps to \nalleviate some of the financial strain. Instead, the bill offers no \nbenefit to middle-class and low-income households. These provisions \nhave been removed in favor of billions of dollars of additional tax \ncuts for the wealthiest Americans. Unfortunately, this conference \nreport does not resemble the bill that left the Senate earlier.\n  Today, Americans deal with record gas prices. It is $3.40 a gallon in \nsome areas in California. The conference committee chose not to require \nmore from big oil companies, even as corporate profits hit a record \n$1.35 trillion last year, now accounting for the largest share of \nnational income in 40 years. The conferees decided not to do anything \nto affect the oil companies, the special incentives and tax breaks they \nget. Instead, middle-class families were left to bear the brunt of \nthese decisions.\n  Rather than providing millions of Americans with the necessary \nextended relief, the lion's share of this bill--$50 billion over the \nnext 10 years--is devoted to extending reduced rates for capital gains \nand dividend tax breaks. I have never had anyone in the business \ncommunity come up to me and say: You have to lower capital gains. What \nthey have said to me is that it doesn't make much difference, certainly \nnot dividend tax breaks. Unlike the AMT fix, these rates were not \nscheduled to expire this year or even the next. Why are we doing it \nnow? We are doing it now only to make the future bleaker. More than 75 \npercent of the capital gains and dividend tax breaks have served \nAmericans earning more than $200,000.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire says how great these are for the \naverage person. No, they aren't. They are good for the very wealthy, \nfor the individual who makes more than $200,000 a year. That is 75 \npercent of the benefit. The average millionaire will receive a $42,000 \ntax cut from capital gains and dividends alone in 2005. Meanwhile, the \naverage taxpayer, earning less than $75,000--that is three quarters of \nthe taxpayers--receives only $13. So three quarters of the tax-paying \npopulation of America receives only $13, while the individual earning \nover $200,000 has a huge tax break. This is unfair. It is \nirresponsible. It is not without consequences.\n  The Federal budget deficit will be at least $300 billion this year. \nThe national debt is soaring. We have fewer resources available for \ncritical domestic priorities.\n\n  Under President Clinton, we had 4 years of budget surplus. When he \nleft office, we had a projected 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion. What \nis interesting to me is, the two parties have switched. The Republicans \nare not the deficit hawks; the Democrats have become the deficit hawks. \nThe Republicans have become the big spenders, and this bill clearly \nidentifies that.\n  The economic policies of the last 5 years have produced a \ncatastrophic turnaround. Record budget surpluses have given way to \nrecord deficits projected at $1.6 trillion over the next decade. The \nfull impact of this administration's fiscal policies remains clouded. \nThis President has broken with his predecessors by submitting only 5-\nyear budgets. Why? Think about it, especially after we were presented \nwith the traditional 10-year numbers during the President's first year \nin office. I will tell you why I think he is doing it, and that is to \nhide the fact that these tax cuts explode in the out years. They create \nenormous problems for the future. The result is a wall of debt.\n  Over the next 10 years, the debt is projected to reach $12 trillion. \nIn this year alone, our national debt is slated to increase by $654 \nbillion. More startling is the fact that the national debt is currently \nat 66 percent of our gross domestic product. I heard someone make a \nspeech the other day and say it was 2 percent of GDP, ``don't worry\n\n[[Page S4405]]\n\nabout it.'' So we went and got the CBO figures. It is 66 percent of \nGDP; worry about it.\n  The total debt equates to roughly $30,000 owned by every man, woman, \nand child in America. This is really troubling to anyone who runs a \nhousehold or runs a business. You would have your house repossessed if \nyou ran your books this way. You would lose your business if you ran \nyour books this way.\n  When all costs are included, the tax breaks for the wealthiest \nAmericans will cost almost $2 trillion over the next decade. When you \ncombine the cost of the tax cuts with spending on the war in Iraq--\ncurrently totaling $370 billion--the inevitable result is the programs \nthat matter most are squeezed.\n  Let me explain that. This chart takes 2 years, 2005 and 2015. It \nlooks at everything the Federal Government spends. It is deceptive to \nlook just at the budget. The budget does not reflect what we spend in \nentirety. The fact is, entitlements--Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid, veterans' benefits--are 53.5 percent of what the Federal \nGovernment spent in 2005. Interest on the debt alone was $184 billion. \nThat is 7.4 percent. So 60.4 percent of everything the Federal \nGovernment spent in 2005 was not budgeted and cannot be controlled. \nWhat is left? Forty percent of total spending. There is 20.1 percent \nfor defense--not likely to be cut much in view of the circumstances of \nthe war on terror--and non-defense discretionary, which is everything \nelse, at 18.9 percent of what the Federal Government spent in 2005. \nThat is a fact.\n  So because the only thing you can cut is discretionary defense and \nother discretionary spending, these tax policies mean the only thing \nyou can do is cut every program that matters to the American people. \nFewer cops on the street, down 15,000. Every nutrition and supplemental \naid to seniors is cut. Less for highways, interior, and agriculture. \nThat is what you have to cut. That is it. And that is what these tax \ncuts, when they explode exponentially at the end of the 10-year period, \nwill do. They will create an enormous problem for the future.\n  If you add interest on the debt and go to the year 2015, 70 percent \nof everything the Federal Government spends will not be controllable--\nit will increase 10 percent from 2005 to 70 percent in 2015. Defense \ndiscretionary will be reduced to 15 percent and non-defense \ndiscretionary to 13.7 percent. That is the projected inevitable trend \nof what we are doing here today.\n  Let me talk about some of the cuts: Food stamps for poor people, $272 \nmillion; COPS Program, $407 billion or 15,000 fewer officers \nnationwide; job training, $55 million. Education, the President's \nsignature program, No Child Left Behind, will be underfunded this year \nby more than $12 billion, and $39 billion since it was enacted. That is \nthe impact forced by passing a bill like this. No wonder people look at \nNo Child Left Behind and say: ``Yes, we like the standards, yes, we \nwant to strive for excellence, but you have to provide the money that \nwas assured when the bill was signed.'' The fact is, it is $39 billion \nunderfunded since that bill was signed.\n  So we are shortchanging our Nation, and it isn't worth the tax cut \nfor millionaires. I have never had a millionaire--and I would defy any \nMember of this body to identify one--come before me and say: ``You \nknow, I really need a tax cut. I really need that additional $140,000 a \nyear these tax cuts provide for me.'' I challenge anyone to bring a \nname forward of someone who said that because I don't believe they need \nit at all.\n  I have supported tax cuts in the proper context. Let me tell what you \nthat context is. It is a balanced budget and a projected surplus. That \nis the time to cut taxes for people, when you can say: ``We have \nbalanced the budget and we are in surplus.'' That was true when the \nfirst tax cut went through. The budget was in surplus. The projected \nsurplus was $5.6 trillion over 10 years. That is when the first tax cut \nwas made. This is the difference between the two parties. The \nRepublicans cut taxes even when the red ink is great.\n  Cut out the revenues, force the squeezing of Government. That means \nyou have to cut transportation, and agriculture, and cops, and aid to \nseniors and virtually every other program, because you cannot cut \nentitlements. You cannot cut interest on the debt. We are in a war and \nunlikely to cut defense. So you have to cut everything else.\n  That is where we are going and it is only going to get worse in the \nfuture. The fact of the matter is that we don't have to make these tax \ncuts permanent at this time. There is only one reason they are in this \nbill. I don't believe it is for jobs. Clinton balanced the budget and \nproduced 23 million jobs. This administration produced 2.6 million \njobs. That is a pittance in comparison, and it is tax cut after tax \ncut. And when we finish here, we will be faced with an estate tax cut \nthat will take hundreds of billions of dollars out of this revenue \nstream. So if there are any cops left, you can be sure they will be \ngone. If there are any food stamps left, they will have to be cut.\n  Those are the choices this forces. It is wrong, it is immoral and, I \nthink, long term, it is a disaster for this Nation.\n  Bottom line: I urge my colleagues to vote no on this conference bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, we had speakers lined up under the \nunanimous consent agreement, but they have not been able to reach the \nfloor yet. If Senator Thomas shows up or Senator Reed of Rhode Island, \nI will yield. I understand that perhaps Senator Akaka is on the way.\n  While we are waiting, I found the remarks of the Senator from \nCalifornia very interesting, as they always are. I found her chart \nparticularly interesting. When you talk about the situation of the \nFederal budget and the deficits, I think the chart showed where the \nproblem is. I appreciate being able to refer to it.\n  The problem is that entitlement spending will go from 53 percent to \n63 percent of the entire Federal budget over the next 10 years. \nEntitlements are going to eat the entire Federal budget, yes. We are \ngetting squeezed in the nondefense discretionary area, but it is \nbecause of the entitlements. We all say that these are untouchable. Are \nthey? We need reform in these programs--in Medicaid, Medicare, Social \nSecurity--so we can control the spiraling costs they are putting on the \nFederal budget.\n  There are those who say let's just raise taxes and we will have more \nmoney for all of these programs. No. I think that is going the wrong \nway. Certainly, we don't want to raise taxes on middle-class Americans. \nThis bill would give relief, through the alternative minimum tax \nchanges, of $38 billion to people in that middle-income area. Don't we \nwant to help them?\n  Small business expensing. We want to help small businesses. We heard \nthe Senator from New Hampshire talk about the growth in jobs creation. \nSo we want to encourage that. That is why this bill would provide some \nadditional tax relief, or at least prevent tax increases on small \nbusiness men and women. That is why we want the alternative minimum tax \nto be dealt with because so many people are going to be hit with AMT, \nwhen nobody wanted that or anticipated that.\n  If we don't pass this bill, then middle-income America is going to be \nhit with this very unfair alternative minimum tax. We can deal with \nentitlements, but we have not been able to get the political courage to \ndo so. Then, of course, the idea I have heard two or three times today \nis that President Clinton had a balanced budget during the latter part \nof his administration. Well, I was there. I remember what happened on \nthe balanced budget. I remember the very difficult negotiations. I \nremember that we did have reform which he eventually signed. He didn't \nwant to. We had welfare reform and he signed it. We had tax cuts to \nencourage growth in the economy, coupled with a reduction in Federal \nbudget spending. He signed it. The Congress had a lot to do with that. \nI think he deserves credit. He was on the seat and he signed the bills. \nBut I remember it was the Congress that drove that debate, and I am \nvery proud of that period because I was in the leadership at that time \nand for 4 years, we had balanced budgets and a surplus, proving that it \ncan be done. But you have to have both. You have to control spending, \nreform entitlements, and you have to cut taxes in a way that will \ncreate jobs.\n\n[[Page S4406]]\n\n  I still have a novel idea. I think that people who should get tax \ncuts are the people who pay taxes, and to have some percentage that \nreflects that makes a big difference. Some people say, well, we won't \ngive but $100 to somebody who makes $30,000 or $40,000 a year. It is \nnot nearly as important to somebody who makes $200,000 who gets a \n$1,000 tax cut. But the fact is that you get tax cuts proportionate to \nwhat you pay. The people at the lower levels will get a tax cut; it \nwon't be as big dollarwise as somebody who makes more because \npercentagewise, of what they do in terms of creating jobs, there is no \ncomparison. It is part of the old class warfare that we always go \nthrough here.\n  If you tax the people who are producing jobs and paying the bulk of \nthe taxes, they will change their behavior and they will quit creating \njobs and paying taxes, and we will have less revenue. We are trying to \nencourage continued growth in the economy.\n  With that, I see Senator Reed from Rhode Island has arrived. I yield \nthe floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise in opposition to this tax \nreconciliation conference report. At a time when we are all already \nshouldering a large budget deficit and fighting a war, this is an \nirresponsible fiscal policy. At a time when economic growth is mainly \nshowing up in the bottom lines of companies, ordinary Americans are \nstruggling with stagnating real wages and incomes. This is not the \napproach to take. Yet, we are debating a tax cut whose benefits go \noverwhelmingly to those who are so well off that they don't have to \nworry, as ordinary people do, about what they will have to give up to \npay for the next tank of gas or to heat their homes.\n  Supporters of the tax cut in this reconciliation package, including \nthe President, argue that those tax cuts have produced a robust \neconomic recovery and extending them is necessary to keep the economy \ngrowing. Some of them even claim that the tax revenues bring in enough \nrevenue to pay for themselves. These arguments are self-contradictory, \nwhere they are not downright wrong.\n  At the time the tax cuts in this package were originally passed, the \neconomy was mired in an economic slump and they were sold as a means to \njump-start the economy. If the administration is right that the economy \nis now growing strongly, extending them is unnecessary. If those of us \nwho believe there are still problems with this economic recovery are \nright, we would be throwing good money after bad to extend tax cuts \nthat have been ineffective.\n  Responsible economists, at the time of these original tax cuts, \npointed out that these particular tax cuts were very poorly designed to \nproduce the job-creating stimulus the economy needed in the short run, \nand that they would be harmful in the long run by adding to the budget \ndeficit. They were right.\n  Economic growth, job creation, and investment have been weak by the \nstandards of past recoveries. At this point in the recovery from the \n1990-1991 recession, the economy had created 4.8 million more jobs than \nhave been created in this recovery.\n  Make no mistake, this tax cut will be paid for by borrowing and \nadding to the long-run structural budget deficit, and it will depress \nthe growth in the American standard of living.\n  If the tax cuts pay for themselves, where are the revenues? Federal \ntax revenues as a share of the economy declined in each of the first 4 \nyears of this administration, reaching a 45-year low in 2004. As the \neconomy recovered, it was natural for revenues to rise. But despite \nthat growth, Federal revenues were still below their historical average \nlevel last year.\n  Some have pointed to the higher than expected capital gains \nrealization as evidence that the tax cuts pay for themselves. Yet, in a \nrecent letter to Finance Committee Chairman Grassley, the CBO \nconcluded: ``After examining the historical record, including that for \n2004, we cannot conclude that the unexplained increase (in capital \ngains realizations) is attributable to the change in the capital gains \ntax rates. Volatility in gains can stem from other factors, such as \nchanges in asset values, investor decisions, or broader economic \ntrends.''\n  Past history suggests that the timing of capital gains realization \ndoes respond to tax rates. We saw this in 1986 when realizations \ndoubled from the previous year as investors took advantage of lower tax \nrates. Today, many investors are choosing to realize gains now while \ntax rates are low. This increases revenues today, but this is just tax \nrevenue borrowed from the future. In recent testimony before the Joint \nEconomic Committee, Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke noted:\n\n       There are a lot of factors affecting both the increase in \n     the stock market and realizations. And one of the issues here \n     is the question as to whether or not some realizations are \n     taking place today which otherwise might have taken place in \n     the future. And so, in that sense, the increase in tax \n     revenue is reflecting a one-time gain, as opposed to a \n     permanent gain.\n\n  It is clear that over the long term tax cuts do not pay for \nthemselves. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan said in testimony \nbefore the House Budget Committee:\n\n       It is very rare and few economists believe that you can cut \n     taxes and you will get the same amount of revenue. . . . When \n     you cut taxes, you gain some revenue back. We don't know \n     exactly what this is, but it's not small, but it's also not \n     70 percent or anything like that.\n\n  Former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Gregory Mankiw, \nwrote in his macroeconomic textbook that there is ``no credible \nevidence'' that tax cuts pay for themselves, and that an economist who \nmakes such a claim is a ``snake oil salesman who is trying to sell a \nmiracle cure.''\n  I believe he was an adviser to the Republican President. The \nreconciliation bill is full of one-time gimmicks that take money from \nthe future and leave major issues unaddressed. The one-year AMT fix \ncosts $33 billion, but we will be back here next year to pass another \nfix that could cost an additional $40 billion for another 1-year \nsolution. The AMT is a trillion dollar problem that the administration \nrefuses to permanently correct.\n  The IRA provision is another gimmick that raises revenues now at the \ncost of greater revenue losses in the future. Why provide another tax-\nfavored saving opportunity to the well off who are already able to save \non their own? With all the gimmicks and front loading of future \nrevenues, we should rename this bill ``the future tax increase for \nworking Americans reconciliation act,'' because that is what we will \nneed to happen to pay for these tax cuts for the wealthy.\n  Reconciliation was designed to enforce fiscal responsibility. It was \ndesigned to force us to make tough choices that emphasize our national \npriorities. Instead, what we now have is an unprecedented bifurcation \nof the reconciliation process that is full of gimmicks to pay for \nunwise tax cuts for those who need it the least, and poor decisions \nthat ignore our needs to invest more in hard-working families.\n  The bill before us today has made an utter mockery out of the budget \nprocess and has turned it on its head. Once again, the legislation \nbefore us is about choices and missed opportunities. We have real \ncrises and issues that we must confront as a nation, and we are again \nmissing the opportunity of addressing them by squandering millions of \ndollars on cuts that are unnecessary. It is critical that we deal with \nenergy, and it should be at the top of our agenda.\n  The fiscal strains caused by record high gas prices hurt workers and \nthe economy. The average household will spend 75 percent more in \ngasoline costs this year than in 2001 and yet this tax reconciliation \nbill continues to give more tax breaks to large oil companies that have \nreported record profits in the past year, at the expense of Americans \neverywhere.\n  In March of this year, Lee Raymond, CEO of Exxon, testified before \nthe Judiciary Committee that they didn't need the recent tax cuts \nprovided in the Energy Policy Act of the 2005. When the most profitable \ncompanies in the world tell you they don't need tax cuts and you have \nmore than a dozen tax cuts that have expired for millions of teachers, \nworking families, and students, I believe the right decision is to help \nthose who are in need and not these huge companies.\n  Last November, the Senate passed a tax reconciliation bill which \nscaled\n\n[[Page S4407]]\n\nback some of the tax incentives for the major oil and gas companies. \nMany in the industry noted that these provisions would have little, if \nany, impact on supply and demand. In essence, the bill took back some \nrevenue from unnecessary tax cuts for the most profitable companies. \nHowever, these reasonable proposals were eliminated from the conference \nreport before us today.\n  Why was that done? Because, of all the provisions in this bill, \nPresident Bush threatened to veto this entire bill if it included the \nLIFO revenue raiser, which is a provision that would have eliminated \nfor one year a favorable method of accounting for the big oil \ncompanies. When it comes to making the most profitable companies pay \ntheir fair share, the administration threatens to veto the legislation.\n  These specific oil and gas provisions which were included in the \nSenate-passed tax reconciliation would have raised $5 billion. This \nmoney could have been invested in fully funding energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy programs in the Energy Policy Act. The money could \nhave also been better invested in programs such as LIHEAP and the \nWeatherization Assistance Program to help reduce the energy burden of \nworking families who are disproportionately impacted by these rising \nprices. These are the first steps in reducing our demand for fossil \nfuels and are currently our Nation's best means of addressing a secure \nenergy future.\n  Ultimately, this bill will be a drain on national savings, and our \nchildren and grandchildren will pay the price. These tax cuts have not \ncontributed to raising national savings. The personal savings rate \nwhich these tax cuts were presumably designed to stimulate has been \ngoing down and is now negative. On average, people are spending more \nthan their current income. To be sure, soaring corporate profits and \nretained earnings have boosted the business part of private savings, \nbut this is offset by budget deficits which these tax cuts will only \nincrease.\n  We no longer have the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s which \nallowed for a monetary policy that encouraged investment and long-term \ngrowth. The President's large and persistent budget deficits have led \nto an ever-widening trade deficit that forces us to borrow vast amounts \nfrom abroad and puts us at risk of a major financial collapse if \nforeign lenders suddenly stop accepting our IOUs.\n  Even assuming we can avoid an international financial crisis, \ncontinued budget and trade deficits will be a drag on the growth of our \nstandard of living and leave us ill-prepared to deal with the effects \nof the retirement of the baby boom generation. Strong investment, \nfinanced by our own national savings, not foreign borrowing, is the \nfoundation for strong and sustained economic growth and rising living \nstandards.\n  We desperately need to bring our fiscal house in order, and today's \nbill only takes us further away from meeting that goal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is very unfortunate that when it \ncomes to issues of taxes that we see hand-wringing and we read \neditorials about who is receiving the benefits of a reduction in taxes \nor, in this case, who is going to have to face an increase in taxes \nbecause that is what this is all about, preventing an automatic \nincrease in taxes if we don't do anything.\n  With the AMT, the alternative minimum tax, it is going to hit \nmillions of families next year if we don't do something. We are going \nto have an increase in capital gains and dividends in a couple years if \nwe don't take action today on this bill.\n  We should think of this as a question of who is going to see an \nincrease in taxes. That is why the title of this bill is so on point. \nThe title of the bill is the ``Tax Increase Prevention and \nReconciliation Act,'' and the key part of those many words is ``tax \nincrease prevention.'' That is the key part of the title. That is what \nthis bill is all about. This is not about cutting taxes further. How \nmany times have we heard the words ``cutting taxes'' used on the floor \nof this body?\n  What we are doing in this bill is making sure that people don't get \nan automatic tax increase because of sunset, and because Congress \ndoesn't have guts enough to vote for a tax increase, they can stop \nlegislation like this and have a tax increase and never have to be on \nrecord in favor of the tax increase. But we are not cutting taxes. We \nare keeping the same tax policy that we had in the 2003 tax bill, in \nthe case of dividends, and we are keeping the same tax policy in the \ncase of the alternative minimum tax that we had in the tax bill since \nSenator Baucus and I negotiated that tax bill in 2001--in other words, \nto hold harmless 22 million more people who are not going to be paying \nthat tax on 2006 income who didn't have to pay it on 2005 income.\n  I would like to discuss some of the points on this matter that I hope \nwill help keep the feet of people on the other side of the aisle, and \nmaybe a couple on our side of the aisle, on the ground.\n  Let's start with the basic fact that thanks to the tax cuts we have \nenacted during the Bush administration, we have now removed millions of \npeople from the Federal income tax rolls. Millions of hard-working \nfamilies now do not have to pay any Federal income tax and, as my \ncolleagues know, many of these families can get benefits from what is \ncalled the earned-income tax credit which serves the purpose of \noffsetting some payroll taxes low-income people pay.\n  Let me make it very clear. If you are bad-mouthing the tax policies \nof 2001 and 2003 in this administration, are you saying that it was \nwrong to take millions of low-income people who previously had to pay \nsome income tax off the rolls? They probably couldn't afford to pay a \nlittle amount of income tax, and they are no longer paying income tax. \nIt just shocks me that I would hear people bad-mouthing that tax policy \nthat was adopted in 2001 which, quite frankly, is a continuation of \nsome tax policy that was adopted in other tax bills in previous years.\n  That is a fact of life. Thanks to our tax cuts, millions of low-\nincome families and individuals no longer pay Federal income tax. Yet \npeople love to pull their hair about the fact that we are not giving \ntax cuts to these same low-income people. It is a fact of life that we \nall looked at. This kind of talk stops me right in my tracks. It \nreminds me of city folk who start to farm, plant soybeans, and wonder \nwhy they are not going to get a corn crop.\n\n  It is this way: If you don't pay Federal income tax--and remember, we \njust took lots of people, millions of people, off the Federal income \ntax rolls who don't pay Federal income tax--if you don't pay it, it is \npretty hard to cut your income taxes. If you don't plant corn, you are \nnot going to get a corn crop.\n  Again, this bill is focused on preventing tax increases, not cutting \ntaxes. So anybody on the other side of the aisle who says we are \ncutting taxes for this group or that group doesn't know what they are \ntalking about because what we are doing is continuing existing tax \npolicy. If they want to go back and argue that tax policy adopted in \n2001 and 2003 is wrong, that we cut taxes way back then, that is an \nintellectually honest argument. But don't say we are cutting taxes in \nthis tax bill because we are not cutting taxes anymore. We are keeping \nthe tax policy where it has been.\n  I find it particularly interesting that we hear from the other side \nof the aisle that we should have done just the alternative minimum tax \nin this bill and not done provisions for capital gains and dividends. \nOften, these folks arguing this way are the same folks who are wearing \ntheir hair shirt ragged on this issue of who is going to get tax \nbenefits.\n  Interestingly, the Tax Policy Center, which is so often cited by \nnewspapers and Members, shows that if we had just done capital gains \nand dividends and not done the alternative minimum tax, that would have \nprovided more tax relief for low-income families and individuals. Let \nme make sure my colleagues understand that point. By including capital \ngains and dividends, this bill provides more tax benefits to low-income \nfamilies and individuals than if we had just done the alternative \nminimum tax.\n  So I suggest to those who think they should only do the alternative \nminimum tax, they should hang up their hair shirt. We all know the \nreality is that capital gains and dividends are encouraging investors, \nnew businesses,\n\n[[Page S4408]]\n\nand as a result we get 5.2 million new jobs. We get 4.8 percent \neconomic growth in the last quarter--18 quarters in a row of growth. I \ndon't say that; Chairman Greenspan says that the tax cuts are \nresponsible for turning the economy around and having this growth.\n  Let me further say that Chairman Greenspan has always had a great \ndeal of credibility, and he still does. If he says it is better, then I \nsay it. But if we can both say it, we are both right.\n  You create new jobs, new businesses. It is absolutely wrong to state \nthat low-income families are not seeing benefits. They are seeing the \nbenefits of these tax policies previously enacted by these 5.3 million \nnew jobs created, and they will see these benefits in the future with \nmore new jobs being created.\n  This has helped Americans at all levels. It is reported that the \npercentage of Americans earning more than $50,000 a year rose from 40.8 \npercent of the population to 44.2 percent of the population in just 2 \nyears. While inflation is a factor--it is a very low inflation rate--\nthat still reflects real gain.\n  To reduce all of this to a spreadsheet of who benefits directly from \ntaxes is an easy game, and it is a good tool of demagoguery. The truth \nis that all Americans will benefit from a strong, growing, robust \neconomy that will continue when we pass this bill because these \npolicies are working today, and if we continue these tax policies, they \nare going to continue to grow the economy, producing new jobs and, more \nimportantly, better jobs.\n  I would like to focus on this issue of who is paying the taxes in \nthis country because that argument vexes me when I hear it demagoged. I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial from \nthe Wall Street Journal last week that says: ``How to Soak the Rich \n(the George Bush Way).''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               How To Soak the Rich (the George Bush Way)\n\n                           (By Stephen Moore)\n\n       With the House and Senate preparing to vote on extending \n     George W. Bush's investment tax cuts, it's no surprise the \n     cries against ``tax giveaways to the rich'' grow increasingly \n     shrill. Just yesterday Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid \n     charged that the Bush tax plan ``offers next to nothing to \n     average Americans while giving away the store to multi-\n     millionaires'' and then fumed that it will ``do much more for \n     ExxonMobil board members than it will do for ExxonMobil \n     customers.''\n       Oh really. New IRS data released last month tell a very \n     different story: In the aftermath of the Bush investment tax \n     cuts, the federal income tax burden has substantially shifted \n     onto the backs of the wealthy. Between 2002 and 2004, tax \n     payments by those with adjusted gross incomes (AGI) of more \n     than $200,000 a year, which is roughly 3% of taxpayers, \n     increased by 19.4%--more than double the 9.3% increase for \n     all other taxpayers.\n       Betwen 2001 and 2004 (the most recent data), the percentage \n     of federal income taxes paid by those with $200,000 incomes \n     and above has risen to 46.6% from 40.5%. In other words, out \n     of every 100 Americans, the wealthiest three are now paying \n     close to the same amount in taxes as the other 97 combined. \n     The richest income group pays a larger share of the tax \n     burden than at anytime in the last 30 years with the \n     exception of the late 1990s--right before the artificially \n     inflated high tech bubble burst.\n       Millionaires paid more, too. The tax share paid by \n     Americans with an income above $1 million a year rose to \n     17.8% in 2003 from 16.9% in 2002, the year before the capital \n     gains and dividend tax cuts.\n       The most astounding result from the IRS data is the deluge \n     of revenues from the very taxes that were cuts in 2003: \n     capital gains and dividends. As shown in the nearby chart, \n     capital gains receipts from 2002-04 have climbed by 79% after \n     the reduction in the tax rate from 20% to 15%. Dividend tax \n     receipts are up 35% from 2002 to 2004, even though the \n     taxable rate fell from 39.6% to 15%. This is as clear \n     evidence of a Laffer Curve effect as one will find: Lower \n     rates produced increased revenues.\n       What explains this surge in tax revenue, especially at the \n     high end of the income scale? The main factor at play here is \n     the robust economic expansion, which has led to real income \n     gains for most tax filers. Higher incomes mean higher tax \n     payments. Between 2001 and 2004, the percentage of Americans \n     with an income of more than $200,000 rose from 12.0% to \n     14.2%. The percentage of Americans earning more than $50,000 \n     a year rose from 40.8% to 44.2%--and that's just in two \n     years. While these statistics are not inflation-adjusted by \n     the IRS, price rises were relatively modest during these \n     years, so adjusting wouldn't alter much.\n       We can already hear the left objecting that the rich are \n     paying more taxes simply because they have hoarded all the \n     income gains, while the middle class and poor wallow in \n     economic quicksand. But, again, the IRS data tell a more \n     upbeat story of widespread financial gains for American \n     families. The slice of the total income pie captured by the \n     richest 1%, 5% and 10% of Americans is lower today than in \n     the last years of the Clinton administration.\n       So how can the media contort these statistics to conclude \n     that the Bush tax cuts only benefited the affluent? The New \n     York Times claims that the richest 0.1% got 5,000 times the \n     tax benefit than those with less than $50,000 of income. That \n     figure can only be true if one assumes that there were no \n     economic benefits from the tax cuts whatsoever; and that \n     lower taxes on income, capital gains and dividends resulted \n     in no changes in the real economy--not the value of stocks, \n     not business spending, not employment, not capital flows into \n     the U.S., not corporate dividend payments, not venture \n     capital funding--nothing. The underlying assumption of this \n     static analysis is that tax cuts don't work and that \n     incentives don't matter.\n       Of course, in the real world, financial incentives through \n     tax policy changes matter a great deal in altering economic \n     behavior. And we now have the evidence to confirm that the \n     latest round of tax cuts worked--five million new jobs, a 25% \n     increase in business spending, 4% real economic growth for \n     three years and a $4 trillion gain in net wealth. So now the \n     very class-warfare groups who, three years ago, swore that \n     the tax cuts would tank the economy rather than revive it, \n     pretend that this robust expansion would have happened \n     without the investment tax cuts. Many Democrats on Capitol \n     Hill recite this fairy tale over and over.\n       One final footnote to this story: Just last week, the \n     Department of the Treasury released its tax receipt data for \n     March 2006. Tax collections for the past 12 months have \n     exploded by 14.4%. We are now on course for a two-year \n     increase in tax revenues of at least $500 billion, the \n     largest two-year increase in tax revenue collections after \n     adjusting for inflation ever recorded. So why are the \n     leftists complaining so much? George Bush's tax rate cuts \n     have been among the most successful policies to soak the rich \n     in American history.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will highlight a few points from this \neditorial that is based on Internal Revenue Service data. After the tax \ncuts passed by Congress and signed by President Bush, the Federal \nincome tax burden substantially shifts as a greater burden to the \nwealthy. Well, that must be a shock to people on the other side of the \naisle. It says that after the tax cuts passed by Congress and signed by \nPresident Bush, the Federal income tax burden substantially shifted as \na greater burden to the wealthy. It cites these statistics: Between \n2001 and 2004, the percentage of Federal income taxes paid by those \nwith incomes of over $200,000 a year and above has risen from 40.5 \npercent to 46.5 percent. The tax share paid by millionaires has risen, \nwith Americans with incomes over $1 million going from 16.9 percent to \n17.8 percent in 1 year, from 2002 to 2003.\n  And what have we gotten from the tax cuts in capital gains and \ndividends? Not only has it sparked the economy, as Chairman Greenspan \ngives it credit for doing, but in response to the cuts in capital gains \nand dividends, we haven't seen revenues from capital gains and \ndividends go down as part of our overall revenues. But the Wall Street \nJournal editorial states that capital gains receipts have increased 79 \npercent after the cut in capital gains and dividend tax receipts have \ngone up 35 percent.\n  We are seeing all this with the bottom line being that tax revenues \nhave been increasing at an incredible rate. The Secretary of the \nTreasury noted in a press conference with me that we have seen double-\ndigit increases in tax receipts in the last 2 years--hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of taxes coming in. And I think I remember the \nfigures that the Secretary of the Treasury gave. But first of all, \nbefore I give those figures, let me say there may be some people \nlistening who think if you increase tax rates, you increase revenue \ncoming into the Federal Treasury. Then there are people who believe \nthat if you cut tax rates, you are going to cut revenue coming into the \nFederal Treasury. We are in an era where we are cutting tax rates, 2001 \nthrough 2003, and the surprise is--and this is probably a shock to some \npeople--we had $274 billion more coming into the Federal Treasury in \n2005 than in 2004. And with the continuation of that policy, right now, \nwe have $137 billion more coming into the Federal Treasury than we \nanticipated in a 6-month estimate at this point in this fiscal year.\n  So it is working. That is why the title of this article that I am \nsubmitting is: ``How to Soak the Rich (the George Bush Way).''\n\n[[Page S4409]]\n\n  Mr. President, there are studies that go around that say you can get \nmarginal tax rates too high; that people that have some means are going \nto decide they are only going to pay so much money into the Federal \nTreasury. Then you know what they do? Instead of choosing productive \nactivity to make money and pay more taxes, they decide: I am not going \nto pay any more. They choose leisure and do nothing, or do less. But \nwhen you reduce marginal tax rates, there is something about the \nwealthy: They are greedy. They are going to take advantage of the \nopportunity, and they are going to invest, make more money, pay more \ntaxes and, in the process, create more jobs. That is what is happening \nin this economy today.\n  My hope is that my colleagues will see past the editorials and the \nrhetoric that make fun of what we are trying to do because they are too \nstupid to read the studies which show that you can lower taxes and have \nmore revenue come in and recognize the reality that the wealthy are \npaying the greater tax, which happens when you reduce taxes, you \nincrease revenue, because they are done choosing leisure and then they \nhave incentives for productivity. Also, I hope my colleagues realize \nthat low-income families have seen their Federal income taxes reduced \nas well, as best evidenced by those who are no longer on the rolls, or \nadditionally what Senator Baucus and I got in the 2001 tax bill: The \n10-percent rate. And people over here are bad-mouthing the 2001 tax \ncut. Do you want to do away with the 10-percent rate? Do you want to \nlet that sunset in 2010 because you don't have guts enough to vote for \na tax increase? Do you want it to go into place automatically and have \na 50-percent increase in the tax rate of low-income people? It doesn't \nsound to me like you are very populace when you say things such as \nthat.\n  The tax cuts have benefited all Americans by giving us a strong and \ngrowing economy, creating new jobs, 18 quarters of economic growth, 5.2 \nmillion jobs. We need to keep this economy going, and the way to help \nthat along is not to increase taxes on middle-income people by voting \nagainst this bill that prevents 22 million middle-income people from \nbeing hit with the alternative minimum tax and to not increase taxes on \nthose who invest in new or growing businesses that create new jobs. \nThis bill is about preventing a major tax increase. A tax increase will \nhurt the economy. Don't take my word for it, take Chairman Greenspan's \nword for it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the chairman of the Finance Committee is a \nvery good friend, and I know him as a good friend and a very passionate \nperson who takes his work very seriously and is a hard worker in this \nbody. I want him and the body to know that I do appreciate his good \nwork. In this body we know that many of the bills offered are not \nperfect. We know there are many bills that are of concern to Members of \nthis body and for those they represent.\n  Mr. President, once again, we are faced with a tax package that \nrepresents misplaced priorities, and that is not in line with the views \nof a majority of Americans, including taxpayers in my State of Hawaii. \nMy constituents are calling for fairness in tax treatment, and they are \nnot getting it in this tax package.\n  The $70 billion tax reconciliation conference report before us puts \ntax cuts for the richest in this country above tax relief for the \nmiddle class. It leaves out real solutions for real pocketbook issues \nfor middle America, like the gas price crunch that has many families in \na bind. It is outright fiscally irresponsible in an era when annual \nfederal deficits exceed $300 billion, and uses budget gimmicks and \ntiming shifts to mask its true costs. There are other choices that my \ncolleagues and I would have made, and did make when we passed the \nSenate version of this bill, such as extending the Research and \nDevelopment and Work Opportunity Tax Credit, but, once again, we were \nsimply shut out of meaningful input into the conference committee \nprocess.\n  My constituents will not appreciate the inequities in this conference \nreport. The measure provides an estimated annual tax cut of $42,000 for \nthose making more than $1 million. For the top one-tenth of one percent \nof households in this country whose incomes exceed $1.6 million, tax \ncuts will average more than $82,000. Roth IRA changes would benefit \nthose taxpayers who make $100,000 or more, meaning that more than 99 \npercent of the benefit would go to the top 20 percent income group. In \ncontrast, Mr. President, the average tax reduction for middle-income \nfamilies would be $20. Only five percent of benefits would go to those \nearning annual incomes of $75,000 or less.\n  What does this mean for those who are left out of this package? Not a \nsingle taxpayer can deduct state or local sales taxes from their 2006 \nfederal taxes. School teachers who purchase classroom supplies out of \ntheir own funds--and I remember doing this when I was a teacher, and my \nteachers doing this often when I was a principal--will pay higher taxes \nthis year. Families paying college tuition will be unable to deduct \nthat tuition from their taxes this year. Employers will not receive a \ntax credit for people hired from welfare to work, so fewer will be \nhired. The research and development tax credit will not be available \nthis year to businesses working hard on innovations to allow America to \nremain competitive in global markets. And, as the Ranking Member for \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee with \njurisdiction over D.C., I must protest the non-inclusion of certain tax \nincentives for the District of Columbia.\n  Large oil corporations are taken care of in this package, while \npeople in Hawaii and many others across the country continue to see \ntheir household budgets squeezed by high gas prices. This week, \naccording to the AAA Daily Fuel Gauge, the average price for the nation \nis $2.88 a gallon for regular unleaded. The average price in my state \nof Hawaii where most supplies are imported is a whopping $3.40 per \ngallon for regular unleaded, and this number is steeper on the neighbor \nislands. I really feel for my constituents who have long commutes, such \nas those going from Wahiawa or Nanakuli to downtown Honolulu, Kona to \nHilo on the Big Island, or Lahaina to Kihei on Maui, whose household \nbudgets leave little room for excess costs. Hawaii's average price a \nyear ago was almost a dollar lower per gallon, at $2.51 for regular \nunleaded. You can see what this has done to household expenses in my \nstate and across the country. This tax package presented an opportunity \nto send a message to big oil. Instead, it fails to adequately curtail \nexisting tax benefits for big oil--benefits that business leaders in \nthe industry say they do not need--and includes pared back provisions \nsuch as a measure that eliminates exploration expensing. In the \nmeantime, protections for those buying hybrid vehicles were weakened. \nThe conference report does not respond to the current crisis at the gas \npumps in a meaningful way.\n  For all of these reasons, Mr. President, I oppose this tax \nreconciliation conference report. We are once again burning the candle \nat both ends--shrinking revenues while absorbing tremendous ongoing \ncosts for our military operations, efforts to combat terrorism, and \nrelief for hurricane victims. This package comes at the wrong time and \nfails to deliver on promises of fairness to the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. I believe under a unanimous consent agreement the Senator \nfrom North Dakota is to be recognized next, and as soon as he is \nprepared to take control of the floor, I will be happy to yield to him. \nBut until then, if I could have a moment or two, I would appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no unanimous consent agreement \ncurrently in operation, so the Senator has been recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. I appreciate the Senator from North Carolina giving me a \nminute or two.\n  Mr. President, earlier this year I had an opportunity to vote on a \ntax bill. The tax legislation I voted for, not once but twice, provided \nfor renewing--extending the investment tax credit. We needed to do \nthat. It expired. It called for extending for a 2-year period of time \nthe fix to the alternative minimum tax. We needed to do that. It has \nexpired. It called for renewing and extending the college tuition \ndeduction.\n\n[[Page S4410]]\n\nWe need to do that. It has expired. We paid for doing all of those \nthings in ways that would not make the budget deficit grow larger.\n  Today, as we take up this legislation and consider its passage, it \nincludes nothing about relief for those people who are now paying the \nalternative minimum tax who should not be; there is nothing to extend \nthe research and development tax credit, and we should be; and, \nfrankly, it doesn't do anything about restoring the college tuition \ndeduction, and we ought to be doing that as well.\n  What we do is go down the road a couple of years and say that the 15 \npercent tax on capital gains and on dividend income, we are going to \nextend it for 2 years beyond December 31, 2008. Yet we are not \naddressing the stuff that needs to be addressed, the tax provisions \nthat need to be addressed right now.\n  What makes today's proposal all the more galling is, in order to pay \nfor this tax bill we use a gimmick. I thought I had seen everything. I \nhave never seen anything quite as cynical as this, where we actually \npay for a tax cut with a tax cut. Some of us have heard the old saying, \n``no pain, no gain.'' Around here, in this Congress, and, frankly, with \nthis administration, instead of our slogan being ``no pain, no gain,'' \nit really ought to be ``short-term gain and long-term pain'' because \nwhat we are doing is stealing revenues beyond the year 2015 in order to \npay for a tax cut that will largely help people who honestly don't need \na huge tax cut.\n  I don't know that this makes a whole lot of sense. It doesn't pass \nwhat I call the commonsense test back in Delaware. ``Short-term gain, \nlong-term pain'' is not as catchy, I suppose, as ``no pain, no gain,'' \nbut I tell you that is what the watchword of the day is around here. It \nis wrong. We ought not to do it. I will be voting against this tax bill \nas a result.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for sharing this time. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to thank my very able colleague \nfrom Delaware, Senator Carper. I always enjoy listening to him and his \nperspective on these issues. I think he is somebody who is rock solid \non this issue of fiscal responsibility. I am hopeful at some point very \nsoon we will get serious about restoring fiscal discipline to this \ncountry. We are headed for the cliff, and we are headed at a very rapid \nrate. So I again thank my colleague from Delaware, Senator Carper.\n  I have said publicly before, and I believe it, that I have never seen \nthis city, this institution, the White House, more disconnected from \nreality than we are at the current time. Let me just put in perspective \nwhere I see that we are and where we are headed.\n  This chart shows the fiscal failures of this administration. He \ninherited a surplus of $128 billion in 2001, and by his second year in \noffice he had us in the ditch, right back in the deficit ditch that we \ndug out of: $158 billion of red ink in 2002.\n  Then the deficits really exploded to almost $400 billion in 2003, \nover $400 billion in 2004. We saw somewhat of an improvement in 2005 to \nabout $320 billion. Now it is going back the other way. We now estimate \nthe deficit will be in the range of $325 billion this year.\n  Far more serious is what is happening to the growth of the debt \nbecause the deficit, while it is projected to go up $325 billion this \nyear, here is the projection on the debt. The debt is now estimated to \nbe increasing by over $600 billion this year.\n  Put that in perspective. At the end of the first year of this \nPresidency we had a gross debt of the country of $5.8 trillion. In 1 \nyear under the President's plan--this year we are going to add another \n$600 billion to the debt. That is an absolutely unsustainable course.\n  Now the President comes to us and says what we need to do is make all \nthe tax cuts permanent. Let's dig the hole deeper. Here is what the \nPresident's proposal would do. In the first 5 years--see, this is a \nlittle like hitting the iceberg. You know, most of the iceberg is \nunderwater. Most of the President's tax cut is hidden from view because \nit is outside the 5-year budget window. The President only shows 5 \nyears. Why? Maybe it is because he doesn't want to show where all this \nis headed. But here is the revenue loss as you go forward. The cost of \nthese tax cuts absolutely explode.\n  This is at a time when the debt is exploding. Remember what the \nPresident told us when we adopted this fiscal course? He told the \ncountry he was going to have maximum paydown of the debt. Do you \nremember that? He was going to pay off all the debt that was available \nto be paid off. Now we can go back and check the record and see what \nactually happened, and here is what actually happened. This is what has \nhappened to the national debt under this President's watch. There is no \npay down of debt. The debt is exploding.\n  As I indicated, it was $5.8 trillion after his first year in office. \nWe don't hold him responsible for the first year because we were \noperating under another fiscal plan. But look at what has happened \nsince. The debt has skyrocketed. At the end of this year it will be \n$8.6 trillion. This President has already added $3 trillion to the \nnational debt.\n  Under the budget plan that is over in the House of Representatives \nand here, it is going to go up another $3 trillion. They will have more \nthan doubled the debt of this country.\n  Perhaps most stunning is how much of this debt is being financed by \nforeigners. This chart shows it took all these Presidents, 42 \nPresidents, 224 years, to run up $1 trillion of debt held by \nforeigners. This President has more than doubled that amount in just 5 \nyears. This President has trumped all these Presidents combined, in \nterms of running up foreign debt, U.S. debt held by foreigners. That is \ntruly a stunning achievement.\n  This morning in the Budget Committee we were interviewing Mr. \nPortman, who has been nominated to head the Office of Management and \nBudget. One of my colleagues said: The performance of this \nadministration on fiscal affairs has been extraordinary. And I agree. \nIt has been--extraordinarily bad. No other President has come close \nto this record of running up debt, debt on top of debt. He will have \ndoubled the debt of this country, and he has already more than doubled \nU.S. debt held by foreign countries.\n\n  Our Republican colleagues say: Don't worry. If you cut taxes you get \nmore money. The only problem with that is we are now able to examine \nthe record. We are now able to go back and look at what happened since \nthey started down this policy road, and here it is. The numbers do not \nlie.\n  In the year 2000, we had over $2 trillion of revenue. The President \ncame into office and said he had an idea, he was going to cut, and cut \nmassively, taxes, and we would get more revenue. Let's look. Did we get \nmore revenue? In 2001, the revenue went down to under $2 trillion. The \nnext year it went down some more. It went down to $1.85 trillion. How \nabout the next year, did it go up then? No. It went down some more. In \n2003, we went down to $1.78 trillion.\n  In 2004--how about this, now, 4 years later, was the revenue up to \nwhere it had been in 2000? No, not even close.\n  What is this talk, you cut taxes and you raise more revenue? The only \nproblem with that is it hasn't worked. It didn't work. We didn't get \nback to the 2000 level of revenue until 2005.\n  It is even more clear for revenue as a share of gross domestic \nproduct, which is what economists say we should use so that we are \ntaking out the effects of inflation and growth. What do we see? The \nPresident came into office in 2000, revenue was 20.9 percent of GDP. \nLook what happened. This is what happened on the revenue side of the \nequation. It absolutely collapsed, most of this because of the tax \ncuts. So in 2004 we were down to 16.3 percent of GDP, revenue of the \nFederal Government. That was the lowest it has been since 1959.\n  Now we have had an uptick, but we are still way below where we were. \nWe are also well below where they said we would be back in 2001. If you \ngo back to 2001 and see what their estimates were of what revenue would \nbe in 2006, this is what they said. In January of 2001, they said: When \nwe get to 2006, we will have $2.7 trillion of revenue.\n  Here is what we see--not $2.7 trillion but far short of that, $2.3 \ntrillion. Maybe we are going to have something a little bit better than \nthat, maybe even 10 percent better, but still way short of what they \nprojected.\n\n[[Page S4411]]\n\n  Now our Republican colleagues come out with this plan. It's \nbreathtaking that, when already we can't pay our bills, we are adding \ndramatically to the debt. Their answer? Spend more money. We just \napproved more than $100 billion of additional spending that was off-\nbudget--and cut the revenue some more, cut the revenue $70 billion, and \nthat is just step 1. They are going to come out here with some more tax \nbills and cut it even more. So their answer is dig the hole deeper. \nThey are saying: America, you are going to get a big tax cut. It is \nyour money.\n  Let's examine that statement: It is your money. I agree with that. \nAll of this is the people's money. That is exactly right. But, you \nknow, to give this tax cut--because we are running deficits, there is \nno money to give back. This money is all being borrowed. It is being \nborrowed largely from the Japanese and the Chinese. So let's think \nabout what we are doing. We can't pay our bills so the President says \nlet's have a big tax cut, reduce our revenue even more, and we have to \nborrow it.\n  Increasingly, we borrow the money from the Chinese and the Japanese. \nSo we are going to borrow the money from the Chinese and the Japanese \nto give people a tax cut and here, who is going to get it? Those who \nearn from $10,000 to $20,000 are going to get an average tax savings of \nhow much? Two dollars. That will certainly be helpful to them. Those \nearning $20,000 to $30,000 are going to get $9. Those earning from \n$30,000 to $40,000 are going to get $16. Those earning between $40,000 \nand $50,000 are going to get $46. Those earning from $50,000 to $75,000 \nare going to get $110.\n  Let's go to the other end, those earning more than $1 million. They \nare going to get $42,000. And where are they going to get it from? They \nare going to get it from borrowing from the Chinese and the Japanese--\nand the British and the Caribbean banking centers and the South Koreans \nand every other country in the world that we can borrow money from. \nDoes this make any sense?\n  Let's see. We can't pay our bills now, so what is the answer? The \nadministration says: Spend a bunch more money. They wanted $92 billion \noff-budget additional spending, and by the way, cut the revenue some \nmore so that the hole gets deeper.\n  Where are you going to get the money? We don't have the money. So we \nare going to have to borrow the money. Who are we going to borrow the \nmoney from? From the Chinese and the Japanese so we can give those \nearning more than $1 million a year a $42,000 tax cut, so we can give \nthose earning $10,000 to $20,000 a year $2. That way they can say \neverybody is getting something. As amusing as it might be, it is also \nserious and it is leading us down a path that is, in my judgment, a \ncomplete disaster.\n  The tax bill that is before us also leaves out things that we \ntypically extend year to year that would normally be included in this \nlegislation. But our friends on the other side said, No, it is much \nmore important to give these big breaks to those who are at the very \nhighest part of the income level in our country. We are going to leave \nout the R tax cut, which might actually help strengthen our country \nfor the future. We are going to leave out tuition deduction, which will \nhelp families afford tuition so we can better educate them. That is \nleft out. The sales tax deduction is left out for States that have \nsales tax and people deduct what they pay in sales tax. The work \nopportunity and welfare-to-work credit is left out. The savers credit--\nand we have negative individual savings in our country--they leave out \nthat credit. That is an interesting idea. Leasehold and restaurant \nimprovements is left out. Teacher classroom expenses is left out. The \nnew market tax credit is left out. Our friends last year labeled this \nwhole plan the deficit reduction plan.\n  Let us look at what they have done. They reduce spending $39 billion \nover 5 years. They did not actually reduce spending. Spending, of \ncourse, is going up dramatically; it is not going down.\n  They reduced the rate of growth theoretically over 5 years by $39 \nbillion. But then they turned right around and in this bill cut the \ntaxes $70 billion.\n  When you put the two together, there is no deficit reduction. The \ndeficit increases. Instead of labeling it the ``deficit reduction \nbill,'' they should have called it the ``deficit increase bill.''\n  They are not done yet because we all know they are going to come with \na second tax package outside of reconciliation and add another $30 \nbillion or $40 billion of revenue reduction.\n  On top of it all, they have used the series of budget gimmicks to \nmake room for these additional tax cuts. They count short-term savings \nfrom the revenue-losing Roth IRA provision. That gains about $6 billion \nin the near term but loses $36 billion over a longer period. They \nconcocted this as a way to make the numbers work at least for a moment.\n  They sunset small business expensing provision, they have a 5-year \ndelay on the implementation of withholding on Government contracts, and \nthey have a timing shift for corporate estimated payments--gimmicks on \ntop of gimmicks to make something look like something it is not. That \nis an old Washington tradition.\n  Perhaps the most egregious is the Roth gimmick, counting short-term \nsavings for something that is a long-term loser.\n  There is a quote from the Washington Post:\n\n       One measure would allow upper-income savers with a \n     traditional Individual Retirement Account to pay taxes on the \n     account's investment gains and then roll over some of the \n     balance into a Roth IRA, where the money can be withdrawn tax \n     free upon retirement. The provision would raise about $6.4 \n     billion over 10 years, seemingly keeping the size of the tax-\n     cutting package down. But over the next 5 years, it would \n     cost the Government $36 billion, according to the Urban \n     Institute Tax Policy Center. This is the kind of shell game \n     that gets us deeper into trouble.\n\n  If you look at it, just visually, what they are doing with business \nexpensing, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009, it is $100,000. What do they do? \nThey drop it dramatically by 75 percent to make it look as though \nsomehow this whole package fits within the $70 billion. It is, frankly, \na giant fraud.\n  Here is what our Comptroller General said about the current fiscal \npath. He says:\n\n       Continuing on this unsustainable fiscal path will gradually \n     erode, if not suddenly, damage our economy, our standard of \n     living, and ultimately, our national security.\n\n  That is what is at stake here. Ultimately, that is what is at stake \nhere--the economic security of our Nation, the national security of our \ncountry. And our friends are playing fast and loose with the long-term \nsecurity of America--doubling the national debt over a very short \nperiod of time, doubling the amount of money that we will owe foreign \ninvestors, utterly unsustainable. None of it adds up.\n  What are the consequences? Here are the consequences. Here is what \nthe Federal Reserve has been doing to interest rates. Interest rates--\nup, up, up, up, up, and up--16 rate increases. Why? Because they are \ndesperately afraid of the inflation that comes when you borrow massive \namounts of money and you spend more than you take in. They are very \nworried about a country that is going add $600 billion to the national \ndebt this year and run a trade deficit of another $700 billion--\nunprecedented in our Nation's history.\n  Our friends on the other side say the economy is doing well. Is it \ndoing well? Here is what has happened to real median household income. \nIt has declined 4 straight years. Real median income is down, down. \nThat is not success. When we compare this economic recovery with the \nprevious nine economic recoveries since World War II, here is what we \nfind. This dotted red line is what has happened in the nine previous \nrecoveries on business investment. The black line is the recovery. What \nyou see is we are 45 percent lower than the average of the nine \nprevious recoveries since World War II. That is not economic strength. \nThat is an economic plan that is not working.\n  It is not just true in business investment; it is also true in job \ncreation. Again, the dotted red line shows what has happened in the \naverage of nine recessions since World War II. The black line is the \nrecovery. You can see that we are 6.5 million private sector jobs short \nof the average recovery since World War II.\n  Something is wrong. I submit that one of the things wrong with this \nmassive debt is we are loading on this economy the biggest increase in \ndebt in the history of our country--and it just keeps on coming.\n  Our colleagues on the other side have abandoned fiscal responsibility \ncompletely. They have decided to put it on\n\n[[Page S4412]]\n\nthe charge card, send a bill to our kids and our grandkids, and they \nhave done it at the worst possible time. They have done it before the \nbaby boomers retire.\n  This is the sweet spot in the budget cycle. These are the good times. \nWhat is going to happen when the baby boomers start to retire? The baby \nboomers are not a projection; they are a reality. They are going \nretire, and they are going to be eligible for Social Security and \nMedicare, and we can't pay our bills now. What is going to happen when \nthey begin to retire?\n  Let me tell you that the logic of what our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are doing is to force this country into a situation \nin which they have to shred Social Security and Medicare in order to \nkeep this country from bankruptcy. That is the logic of where they are \ntaking our country. It is a disastrous fiscal direction.\n  I hope very much that our colleagues will say no to this, say no and \nget us back on the course of fiscal responsibility.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a description of a provision, which is \nextraneous pursuant to the Byrd rule, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   PROVISIONS OF CONFERENCE REPORT TO ACCOMPANY H.R. 4297, TAX RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2005 WHICH ARE EXTRANEOUS\n                                            PURSUANT TO THE BYRD RULE\n                                   [Senate Budget Committee Democratic Staff]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    Violation(s) of Sec.\n            Provision                  313(b)(1)(A-F)                     Description of Provision\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSec. 512........................

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Washington Post printed on its front \npage yesterday a chart that was intended to show that the tax benefits \nin this tax bill go disproportionately to the super rich. The \ninformation was based on a study by the Tax Policy Center, along with \nthe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that has made no secret of \nits opposition to the tax relief included in this conference agreement. \nSo there is a biased view.\n  I have had an opportunity to dig into the details of how that \nparticular study was conducted. But if it is like similar analyses, the \nreported dollar savings statistics don't tell the whole story, and for \nthree reasons:\n  First, it includes all households, even those that do not file tax \nreturns or don't owe any tax liability, and even those that have a \nnegative tax liability because they receive refundable credits.\n  In analyzing the distribution of the tax cut, it makes more sense to \nlook at who actually receives the benefits as opposed to what they do. \nIn other words, why include people who don't pay any taxes in the first \nplace?\n  Second, the statistics in that study did not take into account the \nfact that the tax rates on dividends and capital gains for those in the \nbottom two income tax brackets drop to zero percent in 2008. That is \nthat rate we are extending.\n  Third, and most importantly, the statistics are not shown in the \ncontext of the total income tax burden that these taxpayers bear. It is \ncommon sense that income tax cuts can only go to people who pay income \ntax.\n  Let me repeat that because I think the other side wants to ignore \nthat:\n  Income tax cuts can only go to people who pay income taxes.\n  The value of the tax cut should be measured then not only in absolute \ndollar terms but also in relationship to the total income tax \nliability.\n  This conference agreement before us has two centerpieces, the \nalternative minimum tax hold harmless, which passed the Senate with 66 \nvotes. The extension of lower tax rates on dividends and capital gains \nis the second provision.\n  If we applied the logic of including all tax returns in the various \nincome groups and compare the AMT and dividend and capital gains tax \nsavings to the total income liability borne by those groups in the \naggregate, we can see that all of these groups receive meaningful \nbenefits.\n  That is what the chart before us says. This chart was prepared by my \nFinance Committee staff, but it is based upon analysis of data provided \nby the Joint Committee on Taxation, not some liberal think tank that \nhas its own ax to grind. The Joint Committee on Taxation is not \nRepublican or Democratic--they are professional tax people who just \nstudy taxes up and down, and their economic impact.\n  As the statistics from the Joint Committee on Taxation show, all of \nthese income groups receive meaningful benefits from this conference \nagreement.\n  In fact, the biggest beneficiaries are those in the $100,000 to \n$200,000 and $200,000 to the $500,000 AGI categories. The $100,000 to \n$200,000 and the $200,000 to $500,000 category.\n\n  The reason that shows up on the chart that way is not because of the \nreduced rates on dividends and capital gains that the other side is \ncomplaining about; it is because of the alternative minimum tax, the \nhold-harmless provisions that I fought to get completely the way the \nSenate had included them in this conference report.\n  Of course, it is strongly supported by the same folks who strongly \noppose this conference agreement because of the extension of lower \nrates on dividends and capital gains, which I point out benefits low-\nincome taxpayers more than the AMT relief--as we can see on the chart, \n$50,000 and under and the $50,000 to $100,000 category.\n  The core of this conference agreement is the alternative minimum tax \nhold harmless, which is the Senate position I fought hard for in \nconference. The other main provision is the extension of the lower \nrates on dividends and capital gains in combination with two provisions \nproviding meaningful income tax savings to Americans across the income \nspectrum, not just the rich. These savings will prevent over 15 million \nAmericans from being hit by the stealth AMT tax and allow those \ntaxpayers and millions more to keep more money in their pockets to \nspend in the economy, adding to savings rather than sending money here \nfor Members of Congress to spend.\n  Let me remind people of something brought home to me when I held a \ntown meeting in Iowa. I never have anyone come in and say they are \nundertaxed, but I sure have plenty of people come in and say that \nCongress is wasting a lot of money. So every time we have a tax bill, \npeople are complaining because we are not taxing more to reduce the \ndeficit, and higher tax rates do not bring in more revenue. The people \ncrying about that are the very same ones who are voting all the time to \nincrease expenditures whenever they get an opportunity.\n  I also address one of the important measures in this bill, the tax \ngap. Last January, 2005, the Joint Committee on Taxation provided a \nreport on possible options to improve tax compliance. This report \nsuggested that one of the key ways to deal with the tax gap is to \nimpose withholding on certain payments made by government entities. The \njoint committee report stated:\n\n       The lack of a withholding mechanism on nonwage payments \n     leads to substantial underpayment of tax each year and has \n     long been identified as contributing to the tax gap.\n\n  And a further quote:\n\n       Payments made by the Federal government and State and local \n     governments represent a significant amount of those annual \n     payments that are not subject to withholding. Imposing \n     withholding on nonwage payments made by the Federal \n     government and State and local governments would improve \n     taxpayer compliance, reduce the tax gap, and promote \n     fairness.\n\n  The problems of government contractors not paying tax has been a \nsubject of very good oversight of the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs, particularly led by Senators Coleman and Levin, as well as the \nGovernment Accountability Office. The findings of the Government \nAccountability Office report in June of 2005 show that over 33,000 \ncontractors owed over $3 billion\n\n[[Page S4413]]\n\nin unpaid Federal taxes as of September 30, 2004. Clearly, there is a \nserious problem. Fortunately, there is broad bipartisan support for a \nsolution proposed by Joint Tax of a 3-percent withholding on government \npayments.\n  I think it important that my colleagues recall that this basic, same \nreform was included in an amendment offered by the ranking member of \nthe Budget Committee on November 17, 2005. That was vote No. 330. This \namendment, which included this provision, was supported by all but two \nof the Members of the other side of the aisle.\n  I am pleased that there is wide recognition of the need for this \nreform and that this is not a partisan question. However, I do \nanticipate that some Senators will want to make an argument that we \nshould have implemented this reform much earlier.\n  Several points on that issue. This is a real break from previous \npractice and will require changes in business as usual by Federal, \nState, and local governments. It is for these reasons that the Joint \nTax Committee recommended at a minimum there should be a 6- to 18-month \ndelay before implementation.\n  It was unfortunate that the amendment from the ranking member of the \nCommittee on the Budget did not allow for this time period for \ngovernments to prepare for this new requirement. In fact, rather than \ngiving the time allowed as recommended by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, the provision was actually retrospective. However, I \nunderstand firsthand the difficulties of trying to deal with revenue \nissues in a specific year, so the author of the amendment has my \nsympathy.\n  We chose to go beyond the period recommended by the Joint Tax \nCommittee and give governments and contractors additional time to \nprepare for this new withholding requirement. Allowing for additional \ntime was a point that brought greater comfort to conferees in \nconsidering this new legislation. Additional time would give Congress \nan opportunity to hear from parties. It may be possible that after the \ndialog, we will be able to move up the effective year to begin this \nimportant provision dealing with the tax gap.\n\n  Let me be clear. This is a measure which has bipartisan support. That \nis very positive. We need to work on a bipartisan basis to deal with \nthe tax gap. This is a good first step. The only question, then, is \npossibly one of timing. I have erred on allowing government and the \ncontractors to fully prepare for this new requirement and for the \nTreasury to issue regulations that will give guidance allowing for a \nsmooth start.\n  I also take a moment to respond to something that was said this \nmorning by my friend from Oregon, Senator Wyden, a member of the Senate \nCommittee on Finance. He is up on tax legislation most of the time. His \nearlier comments about his provision to eliminate energy bill tax \nincentives for major oil companies needs an explanation that I don't \nthink he is aware of.\n  In November of 2005, he offered an amendment in the Committee on \nFinance to eliminate the tax break known as G for geological and \ngeophysical costs that major oil companies received in the Energy bill. \nHis provision is in this conference report. I went to the conference \nwith his provision, and I came out of conference with his provision \nintact.\n  In addition, we actually improved the original Senate amendment and \nincreased the amount of tax revenue that is going to be raised over the \n5-year period. The provision of my friend from Oregon resulted in a \n$101 million Federal tax benefits savings for the 5-year budget window \nthis bill covers. Through conference negotiations, we managed to find a \nway to actually increase the revenue raised over 5 years from that $101 \nmillion up to $160 million, and we still respected the concerns in the \noriginal Senate bill.\n  Another point I make is that the original proposal filed by my friend \nfrom Oregon actually lost $88 million in Government taxes the first \nyear. In other words, the way the original amendment worked, it \nactually gave major oil companies an $88 million tax benefit, and under \nthe reconciliation rules, that would not work. We had to change the \nformula so that the provision raised tax revenue of $160 million over \nall 5 years of the budget resolution.\n  I want the record to reflect that I upheld my part of that bargain. \nThis conference report holds up its part of the bargain on that \nprovision. The major oil companies only received one tax benefit in the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005. This conference report removes the tax \nbenefit the major oil companies received from the G tax incentive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I like my colleague from Iowa. We work \ntogether on a lot of things. But I know he will give me room to \ndisagree today.\n  I disagree very strongly about the philosophy, the approach, and the \nlegislative initiative that is in the Senate. I was thinking about \nlegislating. We do not have legislative reviews, like movies do. In \nmovie reviews, you can get a sense of what is going to happen, and \nmaybe someone will have made a judgment about it.\n  I have a review from ``Groundhog Day.'' I don't know if anyone here \nhas seen ``Groundhog Day,'' but it is about a weatherman who goes to \ncover Groundhog Day to determine how much additional winter will exist, \nand then he goes back to his hotel room. Every morning, the alarm rings \nat 6 o'clock and the same day starts over again. He simply cannot get \nout of it. That was the movie ``Groundhog Day.'' The review for it said \nthat Phil Conners is an egocentric weatherman who annually covers a \nGroundhog Day celebration in a small Pennsylvania town. Phil finds \nhimself reliving Groundhog Day over and over, which makes him realize \nhe has to change his ways.\n  So this is like Groundhog Day in the Senate. We are reliving over and \nover and over the ability of the majority party to cure whatever ails \nAmerica with another big tax cut that goes largely to upper-income \nAmericans.\n  We have a big deficit that is out of control. We are deep in debt, \nchoking on debt. What is the solution? Cut the revenue. What kind of \nsolution? How do you cut the revenue? Cut the revenue for the top \nfolks. The big guys. The big shots. Because the little folks do not pay \ntaxes, we are told. Oh really?\n  Well, there are lots of taxes people pay. There are payroll taxes. \nThat is a proportional tax. The person at the lowest end of the \neconomic ladder pays the same percentage in payroll taxes as the person \nat the very top. Yet we are told, somehow, that these people at the \nbottom do not pay taxes. Therefore, when we construct an income tax \nrebate or an income tax cut, sure, most of it has to go to the upper \nincome folks.\n  Here is a description of where most of the tax cuts have gone in this \nbill. This is from the Tax Policy Center. It says that if you are \nsomewhere between zero and $20,000 in income, you are going to get a $3 \ntax cut--not $2, not $4, but $3. So just get ready, that is one gallon \nof gasoline you will get. But if you have over $1 million in income, \nyou in this conference report which is brought to the Senate today, \nboy, you ought to get ready to celebrate. You will get a $42,766 tax \ncut on average. Someone says here is a check for $42,000. All we know \nis that you have a lot of money, you are at the top of the scale, but \nyou will get $42,000 and the person over here is going to get $3.\n  Let me read something that comes from a fellow whom I like. He is one \nof the wealthiest people in our country. His name is Warren Buffett. \nWarren Buffett wrote a piece for the Washington Post a few years ago. \nHere is the op-ed piece by the second richest man in the world. Here is \nwhat he says about the tax cuts in the Congress. He talks about himself \nand the receptionist in his office. He wrote this op-ed piece when the \nmajority party was proposing that there be a zero tax rate on \ninvestment income, dividends, and the like.\n  He said:\n\n       Now, the Senate says dividends should be tax free to \n     recipients.\n\n  I admit this bill does not make them tax free. It takes dividends to \nthe low tax rate of 15 percent and keeps them there.\n\n       Now the Senate says dividends should be tax free to \n     recipients. Suppose this measure goes through and the \n     directors of my company therefore decide to pay $1 billion in\n\n[[Page S4414]]\n\n     dividends next year. Since I own 31 percent of my company, I \n     would receive $131 million in additional income. I wouldn't \n     owe another penny in Federal tax. My tax rate would plunge to \n     3 percent--\n\n  He is talking about his income----\n\n     while my receptionist would still be paying 30 percent.\n\n  So here are comments from the world's second richest man who is \ntaking a look at the strategy for tax cutting by the majority party, \nsaying--and he said it in another venue--if this is class war, my side \nis winning, and I don't need these tax cuts.\n  But that is exactly what is happening because there is a belief here \nthat somehow our economy works when you put something in at the top and \nit filters down. We have heard of this ``trickle down'' for a long \ntime. But that is what is at root here, the ``trickle-down'' economics. \nI had a guy once tell me: I have heard of this trickle down for 10 \nyears now, and I ain't even damp yet. But that is because he did not \nearn a lot of money and he was not getting big tax cuts.\n  Well, let me describe what is not in this legislation. At a time when \nwe have very significant budget deficits--everybody here should \nunderstand the country is off track. We are seriously off track. We are \ngoing to load up and burden our kids and grandkids with all this debt \nat a time when we just passed a $109 billion emergency supplemental \nbill that was not paid for, to fund military operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, to pay for Hurricane Katrina relief, and so on.\n  Just following that, we bring to the floor of the Senate another \nmassive tax cut. Groundhog Day: Do it again and again and again. It \nwill cure every ill, we are told.\n  What doesn't this legislation have? Let me give you an example of \nwhat it does not have. It does not have any provisions that should have \nbeen in the bill that would attempt to get the taxes owed by U.S. \nmultinational companies that park their earnings offshore or use tax-\nhaven countries to avoid paying their taxes on income they earned in \nthis country.\n  Let me give you an example of that. I have used this many times on \nthe floor of the Senate. This is compliments of David Evans, an \nenterprising reporter for Bloomberg. This is a picture of a five-story \nbuilding on Church Street in the Cayman Islands. This is home to 12,748 \ncompanies.\n  Let me say that again because it is important. This little white \nbuilding called the Ugland House in the Cayman Islands--a tax haven \ncountry--is home to 12,748 companies.\n  Now, do they live there? No. No. That is just their mailing address \nset up by a lawyer. For what purpose? So they can run income through it \nto avoid paying taxes. It is a sham. In the nature of an old spaghetti \nwestern, you would think the sheriff would get on his horse and ride \nright into the canyon after these folks. It is unbelievable what is \ngoing on. Now we believe the proposal that would shut this down would \nraise about $15 billion over 10 years. It is not in here.\n  I will give you another example. In addition to the Ugland House, \nwhere companies run the income--incidentally, in many cases, these are \nthe same companies that moved their jobs to China, sell their product \nin America, and run the income through the Cayman Islands so they do \nnot have to pay taxes; and the same companies that next week will be \nhere saying: Yes, I moved my jobs over to China. And I also want to, \nthrough the back door, bring cheap labor in through a different source. \nThat is another story for another debate next week, perhaps.\n  But in addition to the Ugland House and 12,000 companies perpetrating \na myth that this is home for tax purposes, we see U.S. companies moving \ntheir jobs overseas and the Joint Committee on Taxation says we are \nlosing $1.2 billion a year subsidizing and providing tax breaks to \nthese very companies that are closing their American manufacturing \nplants and moving their jobs to China or Indonesia or Sri Lanka or \nBangladesh or elsewhere.\n  People will say: I don't believe that. That can't possibly be \nhappening. Yes, it is happening. We actually have this pernicious tax \nbreak in tax law that says to a company: This is a global world, a \nglobal economy. Shut your American plant, fire your American workers, \nmove your jobs to China, sell your product back into the United States, \nand we will give you a big, fat tax break.\n  Should that tax loophole be closed and maybe raise a little money? I \nhave tried four times on the floor of the Senate to close it. Four \ntimes I have lost that vote. It is nearly unbelievable.\n  In the broader case of fiscal policy, there is no philosophy that I \ncan understand--economic philosophy or political philosophy--that would \njustify at this moment deciding what America needs most is to reduce \nits revenues, especially by benefiting the highest income earners at a \ntime when we are choking on debt.\n  I have said before, and I say it with some amount of jest, I guess, \nthat there was a time when the majority party here in this Congress--\nthe party that controls the White House, controls the House and the \nSenate--could be relied upon for a couple of things. Conservatives were \nconservative.\n  In my little town of 300 people, I knew what a conservative was. I \ncould see them. I could see it operate day to day. I could see the way \nthey behaved in our town. You could count on them for something, \nalways. I always kidded, they wore gray suits like bankers, they wore \nwire-rimmed glass, and they looked as though they had just eaten a \nlemon--very serious. The one thing you could count on was, they would \nstand up for fiscal policy that says: We demand balance. Balance your \nbudgets. Save for the future. Conservative values. That is what they \nalways gave to our country, always gave to our communities, State \nlegislatures: the philosophy of staying on track, balancing your \nbudget, decent fiscal policy.\n  It is gone. It is absolutely gone. Proposed increases in the Federal \ndebt of gigantic proportions, tax cuts coming to the floor when we \nare choking on debt, bills coming to the floor saying: Let's spend $109 \nbillion more. And, by the way, don't worry, we don't have to pay for \nit. Just declare it an emergency. Where on Earth is the conservatism \nthat used to be involved in fiscal policy construct? It does not exist.\n\n  Some of us understand, I think, that this is off track, and we have a \nresponsibility to put it on track. Ronald Reagan used to ask the \nquestion: If not us, who? If not now, when? If not us, who is going to \ndo this? We are elected to do this. It is our responsibility to look \ntruth in the eye and decide: This is unsustainable. We can't continue \non this track. If we don't do it now, when will we do it? Next month? \nNext year? I don't think so.\n  This is the kind of Groundhog Day of fiscal policy; every time we \ncome to the floor and turn to another chapter in this book, the next \nchapter says: It does not matter what is wrong with us, what we need is \nto cut taxes, and we need to cut them for the top folks. If you earn $1 \nmillion or more a year, you get a $42,000 refund check. If you earn \n$10,000 or $20,000 a year, you get $2 or $3.\n  I am saying that is not what I think is going to cure what ails \nAmerica. We need a strong fiscal policy that recognizes our \nresponsibilities, one that is fair, and one that stares truth in the \neye and says: This cannot continue. This current fiscal policy is off \ntrack. We have a responsibility--yes, we do; Republicans and Democrats, \nconservatives and liberals, this President and this Congress--now. It \nis us, and it is now. That is the answer.\n  We have this responsibility, and I hope we act sooner rather than \nlater. For that reason, I will not vote for this legislation. This \nlegislation is, in my judgment, poorly constructed, provides all the \nbenefits in the wrong direction. But, secondly, and even more \nimportantly, it seems to me the worst step you could make at this point \nis to send a signal to the folks who are watching this country's \neconomy, saying: Yes, we are way off base. We are about $1.4 trillion, \njust in the last 12 months, off track--about $650 billion in additional \nborrowing on the fiscal policy side, and a $700 billion deficit on the \ntrade side, added together is almost $1.4 trillion in the red--and the \nsignal we are going to send to people is: We are not serious about \nthat. What we want to do is cut revenues.\n  I am telling you, people watching this--the bond markets, the \ninvestors--worldwide will say: This is not a Congress that is serious \nabout addressing this country's problems.\n\n[[Page S4415]]\n\n  America deserves better than that, in my judgment. That is why I \ncannot vote for this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n    Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today the Senate debates S. 1955, the Health \nInsurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act. Now, health \ncare is a very complicated subject. The issue of health care involves \nlife-or-death decisions for millions upon millions of Americans who \nlack even the basic access to affordable health care.\n  The reality is that health care costs are skyrocketing, and the \nnumber of individuals with access to medical insurance is diminishing. \nThat is unacceptable. The harsh reality is that 45 million Americans \nhave no health care coverage, including 275,000 West Virginians.\n  That is 275,000 West Virginians who cannot take even the most basic \nsteps to ensure that their health and their lives are not in jeopardy. \nThat is 275,000 West Virginians who may be unaware that an illness or a \ndisease is preparing to spread unabated throughout their bodies.\n  Today, technology enables doctors to discover and treat diseases \nfaster than ever before, and, in many cases, cure these diseases before \ntheir effects are irreversible. It is unacceptable--unacceptable--that \nmore and more Americans cannot take advantage of new technological \ntools to discover problems early. It is past time to do something for \nthese citizens.\n  The current health care crisis hits small businesses especially hard. \nSmall businesses often pay the highest rates for health care benefits \nbecause they lack the power to negotiate with big insurance companies. \nOne innovative solution is for small businesses to be able to join \ntogether--join together--to ensure that their employees have access to \naffordable health care.\n  That is why Senator Olympia Snowe and I have introduced the Small \nBusiness Health Fairness Act of 2005. The purpose of this bill is to \nenable small businesses in West Virginia and around the country, like \ncorner grocery stores, like the little store my wife and I had once \nupon a time, restaurants, and hardware stores, to offer health care \ncoverage for their workers.\n  Hard-working Americans employed by these businesses deserve \naffordable health care. A waitress working the night shift to provide \nfor her child is every bit as deserving of health care benefits as the \nCEO of the largest corporation. A clerk in a family store should not be \npriced out of basic health care coverage simply because he works for a \nsmall business. There are 275,000 stories like this in West Virginia, \nand the Federal Government should be taking actions to help these \npeople.\n\n  While I agree in part with the goals of the bill before us, there are \nimportant differences between the bill offered by Senator Snowe and \nmyself and the Enzi bill. The Snowe-Byrd bill, unlike the bill proposed \nby the very distinguished Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, does not \npreempt State law by erasing all preventative health tests and \ntreatments. These mandates are the core medical services which are \nalready part of many existing health plans.\n  The amendment I am cosponsoring, with the very able Senator from \nMaine, proposes to simply put some of the safeguards back that were \neliminated by the Enzi bill. Our amendment provides small business \nworkers with guaranteed access to the most important health care \nscreening and services. It is imperative to include procedures \nguaranteed to catch diseases before the damage can be done. Our \namendment guarantees patient access to procedures such as mammography \nscreenings and screenings for prostate and cervical cancers. It is \nnecessary in my State of West Virginia to make sure that diabetics have \naccess to the supplies they need to regulate their blood sugar levels \nand to allow for maternity stays to assure the well-being of both \nmother and child after childbirth. Basic requirements such as these are \nessential keys to the health of all Americans, including those who work \nfor small businesses. That is why Senator Olympia Snowe and I want to \noffer this amendment. Why prohibit such lifesaving tests? These are \nbasic questions I am asking. Why offer half a loaf to small business \nemployees?\n  I never ceased to be amazed by the medical advancements that have \noccurred during my lifetime. It is absolutely amazing, unbelievable, \nthese advances that have occurred--penicillin, modern X-ray machines, \nlaser surgery, CAT scans, PET scans. Each day, every day doctors and \nresearchers make critical discoveries and develop new technologies that \nhelp people to enjoy longer and healthier lives. And still, too many of \nour people are unable to take advantage of such advancements. They \ncannot afford to do so because they lack insurance. We have a moral \nobligation to find ways to help families gain access to lifesaving \nmedical care. Millions without health care insurance go through life \nhoping, praying that they will not get sick or will not face a \ncatastrophic medical complication. Living a life free from worries \nabout health care coverage should not be a privilege. It ought to be a \nguarantee in this country.\n  While Senator Snowe's and my amendment could vastly improve vital \ncoverage currently left out of the Enzi proposal, unfortunately, it \nlooks as though the Senate will not have the opportunity to even vote \non the amendment. Our bipartisan amendment, offered to better the bill \nbefore us, will never be allowed--ever--a vote in this Chamber. This is \nnot the way the Senate should conduct its business. Purposefully \nblocking and disregarding amendments on an issue as vital as affordable \nhealth care does a disservice--I say again, a disservice--to our people \nand to this institution. The Snowe-Byrd amendment would make an \nimportant improvement to the bill before us.\n  Why employ a legislative maneuver that blocks attempts to improve \nhealth care options for small businesses and for their employees? Why? \nWhy? Instead of blocking important amendments, the Senate ought to get \nto work on improving health care for the 45 million Americans, \nincluding 275,000 West Virginians, without health insurance. The lack \nof affordable health care in this country has reached crisis \nproportions. Why is that? Why is the Senate cutting off debate?\n  We should be working together in this Senate to find ways to help our \npeople afford health care insurance. We should be discussing the May 15 \nenrollment deadline in the new Medicare Part D Program. Why can we not \nhave a vote on extending this deadline? Why, I ask, and I ask and I ask \nagain, why, after hearing from millions of the Nation's senior citizens \nand their worries about the deadline, are we not even talking about \ntheir concerns? My office has received hundreds of calls from concerned \nsenior citizens. This is a pressing issue that requires our attention. \nYet due to the actions of the leadership, the Senate is being held \nhostage. To what? To a deadline. Our senior citizens, whose sweat and \nblood helped to make our Nation great, are now being told that time is \nup for them. They must choose a health plan immediately or face \nfinancial penalties.\n  Because of the complexity of the new Medicare Part D Program, it is \nonly right that our senior citizens be given time to understand their \noptions and make informed decisions when selecting drug coverage. But \ninstead, our elderly citizens are being told to hurry up or face \npenalties. That is just not good enough for the greatest country on \nEarth. Where is the compassion that our country is so known for? What \nis so almighty sacred about Monday, May 15?\n  It is unbelievable that important improvements to the Enzi bill will \nprobably never receive a vote. It is a disservice to the small business \nemployees and owners who deserve relief from the health care crunch. It \nis absolutely ridiculous that the Senate will not be permitted to \nconsider pressing health issues for our senior citizens, the people who \nhave worked so hard for so many years to build this great country.\n  I urge Senators to reject this process by which we are being gagged \nand denied a vote on these critical health care issues.\n  I yield the floor. I thank all Senators.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4416]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I have been watching the interesting \ndebate for some time. Of course, it is interesting and there is a great \ndeal involved. Fortunately, we are having a debate. However, it seems \nto me that much of it has been very complicated. Some have had charts \nand details. It occurs to me that basically it is a broader issue than \nthat, one that frankly divides the two sides of the aisle. We have had \ndeficits that are larger than they ought to be. They were brought about \nby events such as September 11 and Katrina and those kinds of things. \nJust like in your family and your business, you have to go back and do \nsomething about it. However, this is one of those decisions that \ndefines the direction we want to take in this country.\n  Choices are before us all the time. From time to time, we have hard \ndecisions to make that are quite broad. I think those of us on this \nside of the aisle are interested in trying to have a strong economy, \none that provides jobs and growth in the economy, and we are doing \nthat. That is a good thing. I think at the same time we are looking for \na Government that is smaller and less expensive and that spends less. \nTo do that, of course, we want to have less taxes so the money can be \ninvested in the economy and jobs can be created. That is precisely what \nwe are seeking to do.\n  The other point of view--I understand it, but I don't agree with it--\nis that we need to basically spend more and, therefore, you need more \ntaxes. You would have more Government involved in more and more things. \nYou get down to a broad decision, and that is where we are. I know \nevery detail is a little different; on this issue it is here and that \nissue it is there, but you have to kind of put them together in the \noverall picture and see where we are going.\n  I guess I have tried to kind of avoid some of the details but to look \nat what I think the broad directions are in the votes we are having \ntoday. Do you want less Government, with more emphasis on the private \nsector, more emphasis on job development, more emphasis on less taxes, \nand more involvement with the growth of the economy or do you want more \nGovernment, with more spending and more taxes? That is the issue. I \nthink it is fairly simple.\n  I know there are a lot of details and arguments and I know people \nhave different ideas about it. But the fact is that the other side of \nthe aisle has been for more taxes and spending. We have tried to reduce \ntaxes on this side and, hopefully, we will be able to reduce the size \nof Government and do something about the deficits, not by more taxes \nbut by less spending. That is our decision. I think it is fairly \nsimple. I certainly encourage our effort. This is not to reduce taxes; \nit is continuing reductions that we have had in place that have \nsupplemented and strengthened the economy. It is pretty clear.\n  The deficit talk that we have heard and seen on the charts--that has \ngone on for several years. Yes, we need to do something about that and \nreduce spending. I am for that. I am encouraged that we can hold down \ntaxes rather than letting them go back up again, so that we have more \njobs, a better economy, and we can operate in that fashion. I hope that \nwe are able to continue this reduction.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, a few days ago, at Lincoln Center in New \nYork City, illusionist David Blaine completed a week in a water-filled \nbubble. He then got himself chained up, got rid of his air hose, and \ntried to escape from the chains, while setting a world record for \nholding one's breath underwater. His goal was to hold his breath for 9 \nminutes.\n  His feat was impressive. But he failed. After 7 minutes, he had to be \nlet out of the remaining chains. He had to be rescued.\n  This bill also contains an illusion. This bill's illusion is paying \nfor tax cuts with further tax cuts. Like Mr. Blaine's illusion, this \nbill's illusion also fails.\n  I give Mr. Blaine a lot of credit. He does his illusions in full view \nof the public--an open water bubble in the middle of New York City.\n  The tax bill does its illusions in the dark--outside the budget \nwindow.\n  Some of those viewing Mr. Blaine in New York City thought he had a \nlot of chutzpah to try his feat. The sponsors of this tax bill also \nhave a lot of chutzpah if they think they can balance one set of tax \ncuts with another set of tax cuts--and call that fiscal responsibility.\n  Mr. Blaine called his stunt ``Drowned Alive.'' That also a fitting \nname for what this bill would do to the American taxpayer.\n  I am talking about section 512 of this bill. That section would \nremove the income limits on conversions from traditional IRAs to Roth \nIRAs, effective in 2010. Under this provision, all who convert their \nIRA accounts in 2010 get a tax break--2-year averaging of the taxable \namount of the conversion, with payments to be made in 2011 and 2012.\n  Why does the bill contort these changes into 2010 through 2012? There \nis an easy explanation. The conferees wanted to raise money in 2011 \nthrough 2013. They needed money on those years to help cover the cost \nof extending capital gains and dividends cuts. And they needed to cover \nthose costs to avoid a point of order under the Byrd Rule. So a 2010 \neffective date and the funneling of transfers into 2010 serve a clear \npurpose.\n  The sleight of hand is that a provision that loses money--billions of \ndollars a year--in years beyond the budget window are made to pass \nmuster as a revenue offset provision. The illusion is to call this \nprovision a revenue raiser.\n  How does this provision raise revenue? It encourages taxpayers who \nearn more than $100,000 a year to transfer traditional IRA balances \ninto a Roth account. These taxpayers would pay taxes in the short run \non traditional IRA balances and get tax-free investment income later.\n  Take for example a taxpayer with an IRA holder who makes $120,000 and \nis covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Say that this \ntaxpayer contributes to a traditional IRA. Under current law, the \ncontributions would not be deductible. At retirement, the taxpayer \nwould pay ordinary income taxes on the invstment earnings--what tax \nadvisers call ``the inside buildup.'' But the original contributions \nwould be returned tax-free. They would be what tax advisers call \n``basis'' in the account.\n  In 2010, say that the taxpayer takes advantage of the new law we \ncreate today and converted the traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. In 2011 \nand 2012, the taxpayer would pay taxes on 50 percent of the investment \nearnings that were in the account. At retirement, the taxpayer could \nwithdraw any additional buildup in the account tax free.\n  So the provision would raise revenue by taxing the conversion in 2011 \nand 2012. Then the provision would lose revenue when withdrawals were \nmade from the account in the future.\n  The provision would thus borrow from our children. The conferees felt \na need for revenue in 2011 and 2012 to pay for a 2-year extension of \nthe capital gains and dividends cuts. So this bill would take the \nrevenues from the future and claim them now.\n  The philosophy of this bill is: Let's just spend it now. Let our \nchildren figure out how to replace the revenue that would have been \ncollected 10 or 20 or 30 years from now.\n  How much revenue would this provision take from our children? The \nJoint Tax Committee's revenue estimates show losses of more than $1 \nbillion in 2014, 1.2 billion in 2015. To get a good idea of the longer-\nterm losses, we asked the Joint Tax Committee to provide us with an \nestimate for the same provision, but effective in 2006 instead of 2010, \nso we could confirm that there will be revenue losses further down the \nroad.\n  Under the joint tax rules, you have to ask them for it beginning this \nyear because they can provide the estimates.\n\n[[Page S4417]]\n\nIf you ask them beginning in later years, under their rules, they will \nnot do the math. We asked them to do the math and we asked if it went \ninto effect this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Joint Tax Committee's \nresponse appear at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Congress of the United States, Joint Committee on \n           Taxation, Longworth House Office Building,\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 2006.\n\n\n                               MEMORANDUM\n\n     To: Pat Heck, Judy Miller, and Ryan Abraham\n     From: Thomas A.

Under your proposal, any amount otherwise \n     required to be includible in income as a result of a \n     conversion that occurs in 2006 may be included in income in \n     equal installments in 2007 and 2008.

The Joint Tax Committee estimated that the pattern of \nincreasing revenue losses continues, growing about $200 million a year. \nSo by 2020, the loss would be over $2 billion a year. That extrapolates \nto $3 billion a year by 2030. In other words, this bill would take $2 \nto $3 billion from our children, every year, to pay for a 2-year \nextension of capital gains and dividends rate tax cuts, which we know \nwould not go into effect until January 1, 2009.\n  That troubles me, and it should trouble all my colleagues.\n  The conferees made bad choices in putting this conference report \ntogether. American workers need an extension of the Saver's Credit that \nexpires after 2006, but get an extension of a capital gains and \ndividends cut that does not expire until 2009. And the bill purports to \npay for those tax cuts for with a Roth IRA conversion provision that \nstarts losing revenue by 2014 and has losses that balloon outside the \nbudget window.\n  There are so many reasons to vote against this report. The use of a \ntax cut to allegedly pay for another tax cut is just one symptom of a \nseemingly irresistible urge to put wants before needs. I encourage my \nColleagues to join me in voting for setting the right priorities. I \nurge them to vote against this conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I spoke this morning about the \nbipartisanship and the origination of the idea behind the Roth IRA \nconversions, and how Senator Bentsen was the inventor of that idea, and \nhow it had such broad bipartisan support. I supported it. It also had \nbipartisan support when Senator Roth introduced the bill. It had passed \nthe Senate so many times by big, bipartisan margins.\n  We hear people on the other side of the aisle badmouthing an idea of \none of the most esteemed Members of their party in the history of the \nSenate, Senator Bentsen of Texas, who was chairman of this committee in \n1991, 1992, and was going to be chairman in 1993 and 1994, but he \nbecame Secretary of the Treasury. Now all of a sudden it becomes \npartisan that we are including that idea in this legislation. I don't \nunderstand it.\n  I have this response to what was said. I heard my friend on the other \nside try to argue that the provisions in the conference report that \nwill allow taxpayers to make Roth IRA conversions is a budget gimmick. \nWas it a gimmick when Senator Bentsen introduced it? It is not a \ngimmick. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  The Roth IRA conversion provision generates real Federal revenue. In \nfact, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the \nprovision will generate $6.4 billion in Federal revenues over the next \n10 years. This is a provision with longstanding bipartisan support in \nthe Senate.\n  The Democrats have also tried to argue that the Roth IRA conversion \nprovision will actually make the Federal deficit worse in the long \nterm. That, too, is not true. Roth IRA conversions merely change the \ntiming of when individuals must pay tax on their retirement savings, \naccelerating tax payments in the case of those who convert. It does not \nresult in a net change in Federal revenues over any long-term period.\n  In addition, critics choose to ignore a reverse effect of the various \nretirement savings incentives. Because congressional budget estimates \nare done on a 10-year basis, these estimates ignore distant revenue \ngains as well as losses. Because tax incentives for retirement savings \nbasically and typically are front-loaded, the 10-year budget estimates \ngenerally reflect only large losses of Federal revenue. These estimates \nignore the fact that the Federal Government will recoup the tax on that \nmoney and the associated investment gains when it is distributed later \nin retirement.\n  From a budgetary standpoint, the Roth IRA conversion provision only \nbalances out a small part of this effect. If anything, this provision \nhas the potential to actually increase receipts over a long period of \ntime because it will lead to higher tax compliance as folks voluntarily \npay their tax up front.\n  This provision brings in real money into the Treasury, it is good, \nand, most importantly, it is bipartisan--or I guess it used to be \nbipartisan. Today it is very partisan, and that is something I don't \nunderstand. How could you as Democrats be for something over the 1990s \nand not be for it now? Is it because maybe the Republicans are in the \nmajority? It just doesn't make sense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wish to call attention to a saying \nthat is kicked around here quite often: When you are in a hole, quit \ndigging.\n  We are approaching $10 trillion in debt, and the majority--and I \nrespond to my friend and colleague for whom I have great respect, the \nSenator from Iowa, the chairman of the Finance Committee--is not \ndealing in a typically bipartisan fashion when conferences are held \nwithout the minority being invited to participate.\n  There is, in case no one noticed, a Republican majority Senate, a \nRepublican majority House, and the White House is occupied by a \nRepublican President. It is fair to say that what we see happening \nreflects directly the will of the majority.\n  As we look at approaching $10 trillion in debt--and we just approved \nit; it is going up to $9 trillion--the majority wants to continue the \nlifespan of the Bush tax cuts to add another $70 billion to our debt. I \nfind it incredible.\n  None of us have an exclusivity of knowledge--none of us. One can \nargue about whether an additional tax cut has value in increasing \nrevenues, about where that money is spent when it gets into the hands \nof those who get the largest part of it.\n  There is another side to this that I think deserves examination, and \nthat is we have done the tax cut thing, and where are we? We are deeper \nin debt. There is a song that goes: The harder I work, what do I get? I \nget deeper in debt.\n  When I see that we just increased the debt limit and we are about to \npush up against it pretty closely, we now want to add another $70 \nbillion to our debt, I think it is a subject for fair debate, whether \nit is good for business or isn't.\n\n[[Page S4418]]\n\n  I come from the business world, and I ran a very successful company. \nThe company I started with two other friends now employs 40,000.\n  We have ideas that have been thought out, and I think this is a fair \nplace to express them.\n  I know the other side of the aisle likes to say these are tax cuts to \nhelp everyday people, but I want to do a reality check. Those who earn \nover $1 million a year get 22 percent of the tax breaks in this bill. \nThat is a very small percentage of the wage earners in this country.\n  Millionaires get an average tax cut of almost $42 thousand--41,977, \nto be precise--while those earning from $40,000 to $50,000--I want to \npoint this out, millionaires get an average tax cut of about $42,000, \nwhile those earning from $40,000 to $50,000 a year get an average tax \ncut of $46.\n  I got some gas the other day and one tankful cost over $60. When you \nget an average tax cut of $46, my advice to those who get it is: Don't \nspend it all in one place; $46, distribute it around; maybe buy a \nlittle boat or something so you have some fun with it.\n  The last time we complained about unfair tax cuts such as this, one \nof our Republican colleagues actually accused us of ``persecuting \nmillionaires.'' Alas, what a pity, that we should be so biased in our \nstatements.\n  If Republicans were more concerned about helping the middle class in \nthis country, we would all be better off--all of us. The best idea we \nhave seen from the majority recently was to give everyone $100 to help \nwith soaring gasoline costs. Maybe that ought to be accompanied by a \nstatement that says if you go to Las Vegas or buy a lottery ticket, \nperhaps you can really hit it big. Mr. President, $100, how do you use \nthat? We now know how little $100 is, and the offer is offensive, so \noffensive that it was quickly withdrawn when people said: This doesn't \nmake any sense. What do we do for people? Giving them a $100 gift \ncertificate, if I can call it that.\n  Gas prices are out of control, wages are stagnant, more and more \nworking people are losing their health insurance, and the Republican \nside of the aisle is admonishing us about persecuting millionaires.\n  I know some people who made money in their lifetime. I know if you \nwant to buy a particular airplane, a G-5, that you have to wait 2 to 3 \nyears to get it delivered. It costs $30 million. If you want to add \nsome amenities, it can get up to $40 million. But there are so many \npeople wanting to buy them, you have to wait years to get delivery. \nYachts that are over 150 feet, that is a 2-year wait.\n  It looks like there is plenty of use for that $42,000 tax break.\n  President Bush and the Republican majority in Congress have lost all \nsense of fiscal discipline. When the President took office in 2001, he \ninherited a rosy fiscal picture, a better one almost than any President \nin history. We had a $236 billion budget surplus. We thought we would \npay off the entire national debt by the end of President Bush's first \nterm. But now we are on a track to double our national debt by 2011.\n  President Bush holds the Nation's credit card. We are the bank, and \nhe keeps asking us to raise his credit limit, also commonly called the \ndebt ceiling. In 2002, Republicans raised the debt ceiling by $450 \nbillion, and in 2003, they raised the debt ceiling again by a record \n$984 billion. And despite the earlier admonition, in 2004, they dug the \nhole deeper by adding another $800 billion to the debt ceiling. When \nwill this stop?\n  Then just 2 months ago, they squeezed through another $781 billion \nincrease in the debt ceiling. So now we will owe the Chinese and other \ncountries this money as we beg them to buy our bonds.\n  These numbers are so large that it is hard to relate to them. I think \nthat is exactly what President Bush and Republican colleagues are \ncounting on.\n  By adding nearly $4 trillion to our debt, we add a bill to every \nAmerican of over $13,000 that has to be paid off in the future. Your \nkids, my kids, everyone's kids will have to pay it back with interest. \nIt is time to get serious about fixing our Nation's financial \ncondition. We can't continue to run record-setting budget deficits year \nafter year, and we can't keep increasing our debt like it doesn't have \nto be paid off by future families and wage earners.\n  President Bush and the majority in Congress are doing long-term harm \nto our economy, to our standing in the world just by throwing more \nmoney at people who don't need it or, in many cases, don't even want \nit.\n  We have to stop conducting ourselves like the proverbial drunken \nsailor, like the guy in Las Vegas who is about to bet the family farm \non the turn of a wheel. We should not be passing our endless debt on to \nour children and as the legacy for our grandchildren. I hope we will \nsee votes against this irresponsible tax bill. I hope people on the \nother side of the aisle--and we can agree that maybe we ought to take a \ndeep breath, step back, and not just casually increase the debt limit \nwhile we fight to give the millionaires an average $42,000 tax break. \nIt is really something when we think about it.\n  Tax cuts for millionaires. We could send 1.9 million children to \npreschool. This tax cut that is designated to go to the millionaires \ncould be used to give health care to 8.7 million uninsured children. Is \nthat a better thing to do, I ask you, than to give those who make over \n$1 million a year another $46,000? I would rather give the health care \nto 8.7 million uninsured children. I can tell you one thing: There are \nno children of those who stand here who are without health care--not \none. But there are hundreds of thousands of children--millions, I \nshould say--who are uninsured; 8.3 million uninsured children.\n\n  Tax cuts for millionaires could send 2.8 million young people to \ncollege. Tax breaks for big oil, as we have given to them, could keep \ncollege tuition tax deductible for 6.4 million students and their \nfamilies. We give tax cuts for millionaire investors instead of tax \ncredits to help poor people save.\n  I hope we will stop passing along endless debt to our children and \nour grandchildren. Our legacy would best be shown as an indication that \nwe want this country to be stronger domestically. We want our country \nto be stronger when it comes to military engagements, and we are \nfailing that--failing that. If you read the papers--contrary to what I \nheard from our Secretary of Defense the other day about how everything \nis OK and we have enough people to do what we want to do--recruiting is \nway down and under pressure. So I think it would be a good idea if we \ngot together at this point and said: OK, let's agree that our legacy to \nour children is going to be eliminating or reducing the debt that we \nare placing on their shoulders. And instead saying: If you want to go \nto college, you don't have to end your college career with a debt of \n$50,000 or $60,000 or, in some cases, much more. If we want to leave a \nreal legacy, something of value to our children, then we have to say we \nwant an Earth that is free of contaminants in the air that our kids \nbreathe. We want to stop global warming. Some on the other side say it \nis a hoax, global warming. Ice floes are coming off of Antarctica. I \nwas there and visited Antarctica and the South Pole. You can find there \nchunks of ice floating that are bigger than some States. Kilimanjaro is \nabout to see the last of the snow that has been there since time \nimmemorial. Glacier Park is soon to be without glaciers. What does it \ntake? Those are the items of legacy that we ought to be talking about.\n  We want the air to be better so that when children are growing up, \nthey are free from asthma attacks on their respiratory system. If we \nwant to give our kids something to be grateful for, let's clean up the \nwaters that surround us and make sure that we are not going to be \noverflooding lands across this globe, with global warming creating \nmelting seas.\n  I hope we will be able to muster the courage to say: Don't increase \nthis national debt any more than we already have done, and don't give \ntax breaks to millionaires who don't need or want the money--$42,000 in \ntax breaks if you have a $1 million income. That is a pretty sizable \nbite. I don't think it is fair to say that Democrats are too stupid to \nsee the advantage of these tax breaks.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in spite of unprecedented shocks to our\n\n[[Page S4419]]\n\neconomy, terrorist attacks, corporate accounting scandals, rising \nenergy prices, and natural disasters, our economy is incredibly strong. \nIt is not an accident that our economy is so strong; it is a byproduct \nof policies proposed by President Bush and the Republican Congress that \nencourage Americans to work hard, keep more of their own money, and \ninvest in the economy.\n  Let's look at the facts. One of the most important components of this \nTax Increase Prevention Act that Congress initially passed in May of \n2003 was the tax relief on capital gains and dividends. Since enactment \nof that important tax-reduction measure back in 2003, we have seen \nabsolutely remarkable economic growth and job creation. More Americans \nare working than ever before, the economy has created over 5.2 million \njobs since August of 2003, and we have witnessed 32 straight months of \njob growth.\n  Take a look at this chart. It is no accident. The red lines going \ndown represent job growth as late as early 2003, and then we acted with \nthe tax relief package in 2003. There was a very dramatic turnaround in \njob growth beginning in August 2003, and it continues through today--\n5.2 million new jobs since we got the tax burden down on the American \npeople. Americans are willing to invest more now because they will be \nable to keep more of those earnings.\n  Unemployment remains very low, at 4.7 percent. Of course, we will not \nrest until every American who wants a job has one. But the fact is that \nthe current low, low rate of 4.7 percent is lower than the average \nunemployment rate of the 1960s, the 1970s, or the 1980s. It is even \nlower than the average rate in the 1990s, which our Democratic \ncolleagues would have you believe is the golden period of economic \nprogress.\n  From the time since the tax cuts to the beginning of this year, which \nis the latest period for which we have numbers available, America has \ncreated more jobs than the European Union-15 and Japan combined.\n  Let me repeat that. From the time since the tax cuts to the beginning \nof this year, the American economy has created more jobs than the \nEuropean Union-15 and Japan combined.\n  Economic growth remains strong. The economy grew at a rate of 4.8 \npercent in the first quarter of 2006.\n  Businesses are investing in our economy because of the 2003 tax cuts. \nThis chart shows that business investment has increased for 10 \nconsecutive quarters, averaging 9 percent growth over that period.\n  Americans are willing to invest more because they will be able to \nkeep more of these earnings. The stock market is up more than 3,100 \npoints since May of 2003. It has gone from 8,454 on May 1 of 2003 to \n11,639 on May 10 of this year, nearly a 37-percent increase in the \nstock market since we originally acted in 2003 to get the tax burden \ndown on the American people. It is not only good news to Wall Street, \nbut really good news to the folks with pensions and savings on Main \nStreet.\n  Americans have more money in their pockets. Their real after-tax \nincome is up 8.2 percent since President Bush took office. Over the \npast year, it is up 2.2 percent.\n  Consumer confidence is at a 4-year high--a 4-year high.\n  We cut the tax rate on capital gains, and tax revenues from capital \ngains have increased from $58 billion in 2002 to $78 billion in 2005. \nTax collections are up 14 percent over the past 12 months, even though \nwe have reduced taxes. By the way, revenue is up for State governments \nas well as a result of this booming economy.\n  We must never forget that Government does not create growth; \nentrepreneurs, risk-takers, and hard-working Americans create growth.\n  However, Government, through its tax, spending, and regulatory \npolicies, obviously can establish an environment that strangles growth \nor allows it to flourish.\n  This body, by lowering taxes in 2003, is making growth flourish. \nThese policies have been a resounding success--a resounding success--\nand the Senate clearly needs to extend them to project this booming \neconomy into the future.\n  We ought to reject efforts from the other side of the aisle to \nreverse this course and increase taxes by $70 billion on the American \npeople. Clearly, that is a bad idea.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am happy to be here in strong support \nof a bill that I guess I was somewhat responsible for in giving its \ntitle to: the Tax Increase Prevention Act. We first called this a jobs \nor growth package or something such as that, but that is not what it \nis. Taxes are going to go up if we don't extend these provisions to \nallow people to keep more of their own money, to not have the \nalternative minimum tax kick in that is going to affect over 350,000 \ntaxpayers in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. They will have to start \npaying the alternative minimum tax. As an AMT payer myself, I can tell \nyou: You don't want to pay this tax. This isn't fair for increasingly \naverage-income people who, if we don't fix it today, will now be thrown \ninto this alternative minimum tax situation which will cost them \nthousands of dollars in their tax bill. We stop that from happening. \nThe problem doesn't go away, though. We need to continue to work on \nthis to make sure we don't have this problem into the future.\n  The second thing we do is capital gains and dividends. Capital gains \nand dividends is a vital part of the growth that we have seen in our \neconomy. Since we passed them, we have seen 5.3 million new jobs. We \njust heard the Senator from New Jersey talk about how the benefits of \ncapital gains and dividends all go to these high-income individuals. \nWhat he forgot to mention was the 5.3 million people who have jobs \ntoday in large measure because of the tax policy that we put in place \nin 2001 and 2003. So while they may get a small financial benefit--\nalthough every financial benefit, depending on your income level, is a \nbenefit--the fact of the matter is, in many of these cases, over 5 \nmillion cases, they have a job, and they have a job paying at 20 \npercent above the average compensation of most jobs in America. So \nthese are good jobs. These are jobs that are family-sustaining jobs, \nand these are jobs I am sure these 5.3 million people--net new jobs \nthat we have--are very happy to have.\n  I will tell you what. I bet if we polled all of those folks who \nreceived those jobs in the last few years, they would be happy to have \nsomeone who created that job, who had a tax incentive to grow their \nbusiness so that they could, in fact, invest to make that job possible \nfor them. They are very happy to have someone who had a tax break \nbecause of a capital gains rate reduction or a dividend rate reduction \nor the AMT not being in place or the marginal rates being lower or \nhaving an expense of capital equipment as a small business. Those folks \nwould be very happy to get these jobs, from 2003 to today, I am sure, \nto allow that tax break to be in place so they could have the job in \nthe first place.\n  That is what we are talking about. We are talking about growing the \neconomy by investing in small businesses, by investing in people who \nare creating economic activity, who are creating jobs, who are building \nwealth, who are creating a better economy for all of us. When we passed \nthis legislation in 2003, the unemployment rate was 6.1 percent. It is \nnow 4.7 percent. In Pennsylvania, it is below that. We have had a great \nrun, as Senator McConnell talked about. The stock market is at all-time \nhighs. That doesn't just mean wealth for people who own stocks and \ntrade. We are talking about pension funds; pension funds which were on \nthe brink and are still having problems. But can you imagine what we \nwould be debating in the pension reform bill that we are trying to pass \nif we had the market at 20 or 30 percent below where it is today. A lot \nmore pension funds would be in trouble. A lot more folks would not have \nthe savings they have to be able to enjoy their retirement.\n  A lot of good things have happened because of the tax policy we have \nput in place.\n  Let's talk about the deficit. The Senator from New Jersey--I love to \nhear people get up on the other side of the aisle and gnash their teeth \nand woe, how terrible it is about these huge deficits--I mean huge \ndeficits--when we are talking about letting people keep their money. \nBut when it comes to\n\n[[Page S4420]]\n\nspending their money, we never hear a word about deficits on the other \nside of the aisle. Never. We went through the process of a budget, and \namendment after amendment, billions after billions after billions, \nhundreds of billions of dollars of amendments were offered on the other \nside of the aisle to spend more money, to increase the deficit by \nspending more money and not one word about how bad the deficit is. No. \nIf Washington spends it, if the bureaucracy spends it, if we are \ngrowing the size of government, we are OK with bigger deficits. We only \nhave a problem with deficits if we let you keep your money. Then there \nis a problem. This is the kind of misguided economic policy which the \nAmerican public thankfully has rejected time and time again.\n  I am very proud to be here today to say I am on the side of the \ntaxpayer. I am on the side of the people who are the middle-income \nfolks today and who are not going to see their taxes go up this year \nbecause of the alternative minimum tax. They are going to see capital \ngains and dividends policy extended for a couple more years so we can \ncontinue to see growth in our financial markets, more responsibility in \nthe corporate board room, the kind of benefit to the average taxpayer \nwhere 28.1 percent of Pennsylvania tax returns claimed income from \ndividends. Over half of that money came from returns--over half of \nthose returns have an average adjusted gross income of under $50,000.\n  We are looking at, not high-income people claiming dividend income \nbut a lot of my seniors--and I don't have a lot of high-income seniors \nas a percentage compared to some of the other States where folks retire \nin the South. We have a lot of moderate- and low-income seniors, and \nthat dividend income is a big deal. Not having to pay those taxes--it \nmay only be $40 or $50 to the Senator from New Jersey, who doesn't have \nto worry about $40 or $50, but there are a lot of folks who worry about \n$40 or $50.\n  I hear complaints all the time from the other side of the aisle: When \nit comes to prescription drugs we can't have a $2 copay or a $3 copay. \nIt has to be a $1 copay or something like that. Or we can't increase it \nby a dollar or two. Then they throw off $50 in a tax break as if it \nmeans nothing. Again, the idea if it is Government, it is OK; if it is \nletting people keep their money, it is not OK. It is OK in the minds of \nmost people to have the people who earn the money, who made the \ninvestment, be able to keep the investment, get the fruits of their \nlabor or wise investment, and be able to keep as much of it as \npossible. That is what this bill does.\n  I am proud of the fact we have been able to make this happen. We have \nnot concluded the exercise. We have more work to do on the tax side. I \nhave been a staunch advocate of making sure that we do something this \nyear to help our charities. Over the past 25 years we have seen \ncharitable giving go down from 2.5 percent of GDP to under 1 percent. \nThat is not to say we are not a generous country, but the bottom line \nis we are not giving as much as we have in the past. I think part of \nthat is the tax structure that we have. We need to create more \nincentives for folks to give to those who are helping millions of \npeople across this country in need. The charitable giving package I \ncontinue to fight for in the followup tax bill that is coming along, we \nneed to get that done. It is something vitally important.\n  There are several other issues we are working on in that second bill \nthat, in the interest of time, I will not go into. But I will tell you \nthere is more work to be done. This is a good start. This is a solid \nstart on a package of legislation that is going to stop taxes from \ngoing up. This is not a tax reduction, this is a tax increase \nprevention, and that is the least we should do at a time when we want \nto keep this economy growing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the conferees for \nsuccessfully concluding the negotiations and giving us a tax \nreconciliation bill that I believe fixes glaring problems that would \notherwise punish millions of American families. The provisions in the \nconference report before us today will also help to perpetuate the \nstrong growth our economy has experienced over the last 3 years that \nhas created millions of jobs for Americans. I want to exhort my \ncolleagues to give their support to the conferees' efforts and vote for \nthe passage of this conference report.\n  One major problem the conference report addresses is the fact that \nthe alternative minimum tax is due to hit tens of millions of American \nhouseholds this year had it not been temporarily fixed. The ``fix'' \nprovided in the bill before us is by necessity only a 1 year ``Band-\nAid,'' so our tax writers will have to address this issue once again \nnext year. Without this provision over 18 million households would \nunexpectedly find themselves bereft of deductions and facing a higher \ntax bill.\n  The alternative minimum tax is Exhibit A for the law of unintended \nconsequences in the tax world. Originally created as a response to news \nreports that a few millionaires were using available deductions to not \npay any taxes at all, this provision, which is essentially a parallel \ntax system to our ``normal'' tax system, is on pace to snare tens of \nmillions of households in just a few years unless repealed or reformed \npermanently. It is only the projection of major revenues from this tax \nthat keeps us from discarding it completely.\n  The alternative minimum tax is an especially pernicious tax for \nUtahns, as it unduly burdens large families by disallowing the \nexemptions for dependent children. A family of six earning $90,000 a \nyear pays enough taxes as it is without us taking away their \nexemptions.\n  While the fix of the alternative minimum tax is welcome, I believe \nthe most important provision in the reconciliation bill is the \nextension of the lower tax rate on dividends and capital gains to 2010. \nThis provision has proven to be a boon for economic growth since it was \nadded to the code in 2003.\n  The revenue cost of this lower rate has been very slight we collected \nmore tax revenue from dividends and capital gains last year than we did \nin 2002, the year before we reduced the tax rate. In fact, total \nFederal revenue growth has been simply tremendous the past 2 years as \nthe economy has taken off. Revenue grew more than 14.5 percent last \nyear and is growing at more than 11 percent this fiscal year, well \nabove the predictions made by CBO.\n  The benefits of the lower tax rates on dividends and capital gains \nhas been higher economic growth. The way it works is simple: a lower \ntax on investment income means that investors get a higher return from \ntheir investments, thus spurring them to save more. Greater savings \nmeans that firms find there is more money available for them to use to \nincrease production and improve the productivity of their workers, both \nof which ultimately lead to an increase in economic growth.\n  Moreover, the money invested is used more effectively with a lower \ntax on capital gains. Capital is not locked up in long-term investments \nheld in order to avoid paying the tax. As a result, capital flows to \nthe most productive investments, and economic growth is maximized. A \nvibrant, dynamic economy benefits from flexibility, both in the labor \nmarket and the capital market. Our 4.7 percent unemployment rate and 2 \nmillion jobs created in the past year, on top of a total of 5.2 million \nnew jobs created since August of 2003, testify to the strength of our \nlabor market. The $52 trillion of net wealth in this country, which \nincreased by 8 percent last year, is a manifestation of the strength of \nour capital market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also nearing \nits all-time high, in no small part due to the tax policies of this \ncountry.\n  The benefits of economic growth are in ample abundance in Utah, where \nthe current unemployment rate is just 3.4 percent, while wages \nincreased last year by nearly 4 percent.\n  I am also pleased to see the extension of the small business \nexpensing provision, which has been very important to business \ninvestment in this country. Another important provision included in the \nconference report is the 2-year extension of the active financing \nexemption under subpart F, which allows many of our U.S.-based \nmultinational firms to remain competitive with their foreign \ncounterparts.\n  We need to remember that taxes are only a means to an end. \nUltimately, a primary goal of the government needs to be to ensure the \ncontinued prosperity of its citizens, and our Tax Code\n\n[[Page S4421]]\n\nshould be constructed with that purpose in mind. Our Tax Code is by no \nmeans perfect; and I could litter this discussion with references to \nthe hundreds of exceptions, exemptions, credits, ill-advised \ndeductions, dubious penalties, and needless complexities that should \nnot be in there. But fixing the myriad imperfections of the tax code is \na task for a later Congress and was not the assignment of the \nconference committee. What they did accomplish was figure out a way for \nus to keep a provision that has been a boon to our economy for another \n2 years. I fervently hope that by the time this provision is next due \nto expire, or even before then, that my colleagues can see how \nimportant it is to have a Tax Code that encourages saving and \ninvestment. A lower tax rate on dividends and capital gains is a modest \nstep towards that goal, and one that has cost us little or no revenue \nin return.\n  At a time of growing prosperity, it is important to continue with the \npolicies that have contributed to that prosperity, and that is exactly \nwhat this bill has done. I urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from South \nDakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, in probably a few minutes we are going to \nbe voting on whether to extend the tax relief that was passed by this \nCongress in 2001 and 2003, and thereby give the markets in this economy \nsome certainty about what the rules are going to be. Frankly, that is \nsomething that investors need to know. They need to know for tax \nconsequence purposes whether Congress is going to be changing the law, \nwhether Congress is going to be raising taxes.\n  I think there is probably no better issue that illustrates the \ndifferences in philosophy between the two political parties in the \nSenate than does this one because it is the question of who spends the \nmoney. Do the American people spend the money? Do the taxpayers in the \ncountry get to spend their own money? Or do they send it to Washington, \nDC, so the politicians can spend it?\n  You have heard a lot of debate from both sides on this issue. If you \nlook at the statistics, it is pretty clear that beginning in 2003--of \ncourse, there were tax cuts in 2001 and then subsequent tax cuts in \n2003--the economy has behaved in a remarkable way. That proves, once \nagain, that the lessons of history have a tendency to repeat \nthemselves.\n  If you go back clear to the 1920s under President Harding when you \ncut taxes, when you cut marginal tax rates, you get not less revenue \nbut you get more government revenue. It happened in the 1920s under \nPresident Harding, it happened in the 1960s under President Kennedy, it \nhappened in the 1980s under President Reagan, and it is happening \ntoday.\n  If you look at the U.S. economy today, again in the first quarter of \nthis year, there is 4.8 percent growth, the fastest rate in 2.5 years. \nThe economy has been growing for 17 straight quarters. The average \ngrowth rate last year was 3.5 percent. There were 211,000 jobs created \nin March, 2.1 million jobs in the last 12 months, and more than 5.2 \nmillion jobs since August of 2003.\n  The unemployment rate has fallen to 4.7 percent, lower than the \naverage of the last three decades, and led by strong home values and a \nsteadily rising stock market; household wealth is at an all-time high, \nreaching $52.1 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2005; home ownership \nremains very close to its all-time high, more than 69 percent reached \nin early 2005.\n  As I said earlier, the ironic thing about this is the assumption that \nis made by many on the other side. You go back to 2003. The Democratic \nleader said:\n\n       The tax cuts didn't work to stimulate the economy during \n     the Reagan years and they are not working now.\n\n  That was the suggestion made in 2003 by our colleagues on the other \nside. Yet, again, the facts have borne out a very different story. That \nstory is an incredible response to the tax relief, a growing economy, \nrecord numbers of jobs, and ironically--people might think this is \ncounterintuitive--when you cut marginal tax rates, when you cut capital \ngains rates, you get not less Government revenue, you get more.\n  That is exactly what we have seen here. The Government revenues \nbetween 2004 and 2005 increased $274 billion, a 14-percent increase in \nGovernment revenues between 2004 and 2005. Between 2005 and 2006, the \nfirst 8 months that we are measuring for this year, Government revenues \nare up 11 percent, another $137 billion over the baseline of what was \nprojected previously.\n  So when you add that up, the fact that we are creating jobs, growing \nthe economy, raising more revenue for the Government not less, we have \nagain unemployment at an all-time low. And how do our colleagues on the \nother side want to reward that? With a big, fat tax increase because \nessentially if we don't extend these tax cuts. What we will in effect \nbe doing is raising taxes; marginal tax rates will go back up, capital \ngains tax rates will go back up, dividend tax rates will go back up, \nand you will see higher taxes which have the opposite effect of what we \nwant to see happen. We have stimulated the economy. It is growing, it \nis expanding, and rather than continue on that path by extending these \ntax cuts and allowing the economy to continue to expand and grow and \ncreate jobs, the Democrats, rather, would allow the tax cuts to expire \nthereby raising tax rates and mess with what is a very good thing in \nthe economy right now.\n  That is the opposite of what we ought to be doing. We ought to be \nextending these tax cuts. We ought to be giving people in this country \nan opportunity to take their realizations, to pay taxes, continue to \ninvest, and continue to grow the economy and create jobs. There are \nprovisions that have expired or will soon expire, including the \nexpensing for business equipment purchases for small businesses, relief \nfrom the alternative minimum tax--which is catching more and more \nmiddle-income taxpayers in this country--and, of course, lowering tax \nrates on dividends and capital gains.\n  Ironically, contrary to the arguments that have been made by the \nother side, if you look at who benefits from the tax relief--I am just \ngoing to use one example, dividend tax relief--those making under \n$50,000 a year see their taxes cut 7.6 percent. Seniors in this country \nsee their taxes cut by 17.1 percent. Those making over $200,000, the \nso-called rich in this country, as has been argued by the other side, \nrealize a 2.2-percent tax cut.\n  Where do the dividends tax relief benefits go? To people making under \n$50,000, to seniors across this country. We have a lot in both of those \ncategories in my State of South Dakota, people who are making under \n$50,000, and a high proportion of seniors in my State who will benefit \nfrom this tax relief.\n  It seems to me, at least, that when we have this vote in a few \nminutes, if we want to do right by the American people--and, again, we \nwant to assert what is a fundamental principle that at least I think \nmost of us on this side of the aisle adhere to, and that is the \nAmerican public is better and the American economy is better, frankly, \nif individuals across this country, taxpayers in this country, are \nmaking their own decisions about how to spend their own money for their \nfamilies, for themselves, for their communities, rather than sending \nthat money to Washington, DC, and having the Government and politicians \nin Washington decide how to spend it.\n  That I think probably points out as well as anything else in this \ndebate that we are having today the difference in philosophy between \nthose of us on this side of the aisle who want to extend the tax relief \nthat was enacted in 2001 and 2003 and those who want to allow that tax \nrelief to expire, thereby creating a huge, massive tax increase on the \nAmerican people at a time when the economy is growing, creating jobs, \nexpanding at a record level.\n  I hope today when the vote comes that we will have a strong vote in \nfavor of growing this economy and creating additional jobs for \nAmericans and allowing people in this country to keep more of what they \nearn and spend it on their own priorities, rather than sending it to \nWashington, DC, and allowing the politicians to spend it.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to see the tax reconciliation \nconference report before the Senate today. I commend the conferees' \nhard\n\n[[Page S4422]]\n\nwork and perseverance in reaching a compromise on this bill. I know it \nwas no easy task.\n  Americans have been asking for tax relief, and now is the time that \nwe give it to them. Lower taxes on capital gains and dividends--and \nhigher alternative minimum tax exemption amounts--will assist America's \nsmall businesses, encourage the kind of investment that creates jobs \nand makes our economy grow, and ensure fairer tax treatment for middle-\nincome families who would otherwise be left footing the bill for a tax \nintended for the wealthy.\n  These policies have a proven record of success. Since Republican pro-\ngrowth tax policies were enacted in 2003, the economy has grown at an \nunprecedented rate, over 5.3 million jobs have been created, tax \nrevenues are surging, and household wealth is at an all time high. We \nmust extend, not end, this trend and the conference report we have \nbefore us, in part, does that.\n  When the original tax reconciliation bill came before the Senate, I \nvoted against it. I did so because it contained a windfall profits tax \nprovision which would have imposed an additional $4.923 billion tax on \nthe energy industry alone. I voted ``no'' because the bill that was \nsupposed to provide tax relief actually raised taxes. I was pleased to \nsee and commend the conferees for stripping the windfall profits tax \nprovision out of the bill.\n  I am going to vote for this bill. The majority of it contains the \nkind of tax relief essential to creating jobs and growing our economy. \nBut I stand before you today to register my opposition to the addition \nof an expanded withholding provision--a near $7 billion tax increase in \na bill that claims in its title to prevent tax increases: The Tax \nIncrease Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005. That title is \nmisleading.\n  The provision requires withholding on payments to any person--\nincluding small businesses--providing goods and services to the \nFederal, State, and local governments. The rate of withholding is 3 \npercent on all payments, meaning that if contract payments were made \nquarter-annually, 12 percent of the total contract value--some \nundoubtedly in the hundreds of millions--would be withheld from the \ncontractor, kept by the Government interest-free for up to 15 months.\n  Proponents of this provision say it simply closes the ``tax gap'' and \nassists in collecting Federal taxes that are already owed. To say that \nthe expansion of withholding requirements is anything other than a \nsignificant shift in U.S. tax policy is misleading.\n  Withholding has not always been around. Federal income tax \nwithholding came into being during World War II, as the need for \nincreased tax collections arose. When Federal income tax withholding \nbecame mandatory in 1943, tax collections jumped from $7.3 billion in \n1939 to a whopping $43 billion in 1945. That's an increase of $35.7 \nbillion in 4 years.\n  In congressional hearings on the issue, Congressmen spoke candidly of \nthe revenues that needed to be ``fried out of the taxpayers.'' There \nwas no doubt in the minds of lawmakers that the result of withholding \nwould be an increase in the tax burden on the public. However, it was \nwartime and the proposal was sold as a patriotic one. What is our \nreason now?\n  Some say it is to improve compliance by ``closing a tax loophole'' \nthat allows some taxpayers to avoid their tax obligations. There is no \nsuch ``loophole''--the IRS has simply failed to do its job of \ncollecting and aims to shift this responsibility elsewhere.\n  Information reporting requirements are already in place to assist the \nIRS in its collection duties. Government entities are specifically \nrequired to make an information return, reporting payments to \ncorporations as well as individuals.\n  Moreover, every head of every Federal executive agency that enters \ninto contracts must file an information return reporting the \ncontractor's name, address, date of contract action, amount to be paid \nto the contractor, and other information.\n  Expanding withholding would now not only have the Federal Government \nspend taxpayers' dollars, but it would make taxpayers bear the burden \nand costs of collecting them too.\n  And the cost of this provision is high--nearly $7 billion over 10 \nyears. This offset is not without strings, and it is not free. As \nportions of individuals and small businesses' income are withheld for \nas long as 15 months, cash flows will drop and opportunities to invest \nwill go down. These expenses will result in a higher cost of business.\n  Withholding is the ultimate hidden tax. When taxpayers no longer see \nthe money that is withheld from their paychecks, the cost of government \nbecomes obscured. And with Government spending what it is right now, \ntransparency is what we need.\n  This is not the last time you will be hearing about this from me or \nthe taxpayers. This provision will not simply go by unnoticed. In fact, \nthe same type of withholding was tried on dividends and interest in \n1982. Public opposition was so profound that it was repealed less than \n1 year later. Although I will vote today to extend essential tax \nrelief, I will work to do the same before this tax increase takes \neffect in 2011. I will work to give more meaning to the phrase in the \nbill's title: ``Tax Increase Prevention.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this bill should be a billboard for the \ncorruption of the public interest in Washington. It is a disgrace, it \nis an abomination, and it should be rejected by the Senate.\n  Last year, when this body passed a version of this legislation, I \nvoted for it, principally because it included my amendment requiring \ncorporate executives to pay their fair share of taxes when they use \ntheir company planes for their personal use. That is a matter of simple \ntax fairness. When all other Americans take vacations, they pay for \ntheir air travel on commercial airlines with their after-tax income. \nYet when some of this country's wealthiest people, corporate \nexecutives, take vacations on their company planes, they fly for free \nand they pay almost no taxes on the actual value of that special \nemployment benefit. My amendment would have raised $44 million in \nFederal revenues during the next 10 years, all of it coming from some \nof the very richest Americans, all of it coming from the end of their \ntax avoidance scheme.\n  What happened to my amendment, which was adopted by the full Senate \non a unanimous voice vote? It was stripped from this conference report \nby the House-Senate conference committee which is controlled by the \nRepublican majority in both bodies. It was done behind closed doors \nwith no explanation and, thus, once again the greedy, a few rich and \npowerful Americans, have prevailed over the best interests of everyone \nelse.\n  No wonder so many working Americans have lost their faith and trust \nin this Congress and in this President. Under their control, the rich \nget richer and everyone else gets poorer. And the national interest is \nbetrayed behind the closed doors of a conference committee.\n  Stripping out my amendment is unfortunately only the beginning of the \nterrible abuses in this conference report. According to the nonpartisan \nTax Policy Center, someone in this country who earns between $20,000 \nand $30,000 a year will receive an average of $9 in tax cuts from this \nbill. Someone earning $40,000 to $50,000 a year will get an average $46 \ntax reduction. But the very wealthiest Americans with incomes over $1 \nmillion a year will get an average tax cut of almost $42,000 every \nyear.\n  Let us reverse those numbers since some of my colleagues are trying \nto portray our failure to pass this as a tax increase. Conversely, if \nthat were to be the case, someone who makes between $20,000 and $30,000 \na year would receive by their words an average of $9 a year tax \nincrease. Someone earning between $40,000 and $50,000 a year would get \non average a $46 tax increase. But the very wealthiest Americans, those \nwith incomes of over $1 million a year, would get an average tax \nincrease of about $42,000 every year. That is what progressive taxes \nare about.\n  Over half of this $70 billion which they want to reduce in Federal \nrevenues, almost $40 billion of that will go to the richest 4 percent \nof American taxpayers. By doing so, the rest of this country will go \ndeeper and deeper into public debt. Last year's combined Federal budget \ndeficit was $318 billion. All Federal revenue, including the surplus\n\n[[Page S4423]]\n\nin the Social Security trust fund thus amounted to only 87 percent of \nall Federal expenditures.\n  If you set aside the Social Security surplus, put it in a lockbox \nthat so many people, including myself and the President, campaigned on \nin the year 2000, that surplus which this administration is squandering \nevery year entirely on current consumption, then last year's so-called \non-budget deficit for the Federal Government was $483 billion. That \nmeant all Federal revenue set aside totaled only three-fourths of \nFederal expenditures.\n  That occurred during an expanding economy. It will continue this \nyear, according to the President's own projections, during an expanding \neconomy.\n  According again to the President's own budget forecast, this revenue \nshortfall of one-fourth of total expenditures will continue over each \nof the next 5 years. This even assumes the continuation of a relatively \ngood economy.\n  By contrast, in the fiscal year 2000, which is the last fiscal year \nof the Clinton administration, non-Social Security revenues totaled 106 \npercent of on-budget expenditures.\n  In other words, we were in a budget surplus--there was a budget \nsurplus projected every year for the next 10 years--and now those \nrevenues total only three-fourths of expenditures, which means that, \nstarting in 2001, President Bush and his supporters in Congress have \ndestroyed the fiscal integrity of the Federal Government by recklessly \ncutting taxes, which primarily benefits the rich and powerful, while \nincreasing Federal spending in every cycle one of those years, which \ncaused the bipartisan or nonpartisan Concord Coalition, headed by the \nformer Secretary of Commerce under President Richard Nixon, to call \nthis administration the ``most reckless'' administration in the history \nof this country in its fiscal policy.\n  This tax bill will further feed that greed of the richest and most \npowerful Americans and it will weaken our country. Any sensible \nAmerican understands that if their income is $30,000 a year and they \nare spending $40,000 a year, that is an unsustainable imbalance. \nBorrowing the difference only postpones the day of reckoning and makes \nthat future reckoning more painful and difficult.\n  Any farmer or small business person knows if their annual income is \n$150,000 and their annual expenditures are $200,000, they too will go \ndeeper into debt every year and eventually face bankruptcy. That basic \nlaw of economics also applies to governments and nations. It may take \nlonger to exhaust the wealth of a country with our resources, but that \nwill eventually happen unless we change our course.\n  This tax bill provides more tax favors to those who need them the \nleast while increasing our future deficits and putting additional \nfinancial burdens on our children and grandchildren who will ultimately \nface those days of reckoning for this fiscal hedonism.\n  What is most disgusting about this spectacle is that the people in \nWashington who are responsible for it, the people in the Bush \nadministration and in the majority of this Congress, know what they are \ndoing. They know--or at least they should know--the future damage they \nare inflicting on this country. They just know that they can get away \nwith it. They know when those days of reckoning arrive, when this great \nand strong nation has exhausted its ability to borrow from the rest of \nthe world, when it has been reduced to being the largest debtor nation \nin the history of the world, it will be other people's nightmare--\ncertainly another President's. And they can hope to avoid that future \nblame by now avoiding being responsible.\n  They have had plenty of help. These tax handouts don't happen by \naccident. They are heavily lobbied for by the people who benefit from \nthem. They are the same people who benefitted most from the 2001 tax \ncuts and the 2002 tax cuts and the 2003 tax cuts. But more is never \nenough. Greed cannot be satisfied by feeding it more. That greed will \neventually destroy this country, if it continues.\n  There used to be an ethic in this Nation that when you made more \nmoney, you paid more taxes. Now the obsession of individuals and of \ncorporations is to make more money but pay less taxes, or pay no taxes, \nor even get tax rebates. The annual report of a major corporation \nrecently noted proudly that it had paid no U.S. taxes in three of its \nprevious five years although it had been profitable during all five of \nthose years. The chief executive officer of that corporation then is \nnow the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury. He is advocating lower taxes, \nand even eliminating taxes on unearned income, corporate dividends, and \ncapital gains. He was quoted as saying:\n\n       It was as if a light switch has been thrown on. Rarely has \n     a piece of public policy been so effective, with the effects \n     so evident and immediate.\n\n  Reduce the rate on unearned income, dividends, and capital gains.\n  There is a noted economist, not a partisan on the other side, but the \nchief economist of Lehman Brothers Investment Bank, who said in \ncontrast you might credit the cuts with providing a little bit of a \njump-start, but they believe the main reason the economy has done so \nwell has more to do with the corporate sector starting to spend some of \ntheir record profits.\n  Former Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin, under President \nClinton, who presided over this period of economic expansion in the \n1990s when they balanced the Federal budget, said:\n\n       We had very good markets in the 90's, before all of these \n     tax cuts went into effect.\n\n  My colleagues on the other side are claiming that those tax giveaways \nback in 2003 are responsible for the modest economic expansion that \nbenefitted some Americans while leaving many other Americans worse off \nthan they were before. Most of the tax cuts that they are touting were \nactually passed and took effect in 2001, and they certainly were not \nbragging about continuing recession in 2001, 2002, and most of 2003.\n  Since then, our country's economy has improved, thank goodness, and \nthey want us to believe that this cycle is as sure as the sun is \nsetting and would not have occurred without their tax cuts for the rich \nand for the super-rich. And they claim the economic growth in this \ncountry will not continue if we don't extend those tax cuts, which are \nnot even scheduled to expire until the end of 2008, through 2009 and \n2010.\n  In fact, their priority is such that they will set aside such \nmeasures as tax credits for research and development, which this \ncountry does need, a real and far more effective fix to the alternative \nminimum tax, which is part of the Senate bill which I voted in favor \nof. Those have to be set aside, postponed, delayed, or take no effect \nat all so they can extend the lower rate on dividends and capital gains \nthe years 2009 and 2010.\n  Talk about the wrong priorities. Talk about destroying ethics in this \ncountry, that people who make more money, who are more privileged, more \nfortunate than anybody else on this planet, virtually in the history of \nthe world, should not have to pay their fair share of taxes to keep \nthis country strong and provide sufficient revenues to the Federal \nGovernment, to balance our budget, to be responsible, to pay our own \nway, which we are certainly capable of doing, and leave this country in \na sound financial state to those in this country now and to those who \nwill follow in 10 or 15 years.\n  I hope the people who are alive then and facing those consequences \nwill look back and review the transcripts of this debate today. I hope \nthey will ask themselves, Why is it that people today in responsible \npositions cut taxes for the very wealthiest, most privileged, and \npolitically powerful people in this country and added $70 billion to \nthe debt we inherited, that we have to pay in addition to the hundreds \nof billions of dollars more they are adding every year to that deficit \nand to the national debt? They are going to say it was wrong; they are \ngoing to say it was misguided; and they are going to wonder how it \ncould be that responsible people could have failed to foresee the \nconsequence of this selfishness and cater to the greed of those out \nthere who want these cuts and won't be sated until they get more and \nmore and more.\n  If they are working hard, as most Americans do today, they are going \nto ask themselves, Why is it that I struggle to pay my fair share of \ntaxes, most of which are withheld and never in my pocket to begin with? \nWhy am I paying higher tax rates from my earned income, from the sweat \nof my brow hour\n\n[[Page S4424]]\n\nafter hour, than the very wealthiest people in the country? People in \nmany cases don't even earn that much. Who are the beneficiaries--as I \nhave been, and as others of my family have been in my previous \ngenerations of success--who are not even willing to pay a tax rate \nsimilar to those who earn their income by their daily toil? It is \nfundamentally wrong. It is fundamentally wrong, what is happening in \nthis country. It is making the rich richer, making average Americans \npoorer and more tax averse. The cumulative result is that revenues are \nthree-fourths of expenditures, unsustainable, and a fiscally dangerous \nproposition from which we will suffer the consequences, the pain, for \nyears to come.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, budget reconciliation is a process \nadopted by Congress nearly three decades ago to facilitate the passage \nof legislation to reduce the deficit and to help bring the Federal \nbudget into balance. But in recent years, under the Republican \nmajority, that process has been repeatedly abused to enact more and \nmore tax cuts for the wealthy that make the budget deficit even larger.\n  Now, they are trying to do it again, in spite of the urgent problems \nfacing the Nation, from the ongoing war in Iraq to the devastating \nhurricane damage along the gulf coast that has not yet been repaired. \nPresident Bush's policies have already added $3 trillion to the \nnational debt in the last 5 years. Yet he is still proposing more of \nthe same, more tax cuts benefiting the wealthiest among us.\n  The audacity of the Bush administration and their congressional \nallies truly knows no limit. First, the Republican majority cuts \nspending on Medicaid and other important Government programs for people \nin need by nearly $40 billion. They claim we have to do it to reduce \nthe deficit. Then they bring this outrageous tax bill to the floor, a \nbill that will cut taxes by far more than the savings in spending from \nthe programs cuts. The net result will be a substantial increase in the \nbudget deficit--exactly the opposite of what the reconciliation process \nis supposed to accomplish. Billions of dollars will go from programs \nthat assist low-income families and senior citizens into the pockets of \nthe already wealthy. It takes from those with the least and gives to \nthose with the most. It is a breathtaking Republican scam on the Nation \nthat can only further discredit this Congress in the eyes of the \npeople.\n  From day one, the Republican plan has been to use this reconciliation \nprocess to push through a cut in the tax rate on capital gains and \ndividend income. These are tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the \nrichest Americans, with approximately half the tax benefits going to \nmillionaires. Leading Republicans have repeatedly made it clear that \ntheir top priority was extending capital gains and dividend tax breaks, \nand that is exactly what they did in this conference report. No matter \nthe cost and no matter what needs go unmet, the GOP is intent on \ndelivering these tax breaks to their wealthy supporters.\n  What is the real cost of these capital gains and dividend tax cuts? \nThe Republicans claim the cost of these provisions is $20 billion; the \nreal cost of extending the lower rates for another 2 years is $50 \nbillion. This tax break is particularly unfair because over 75 percent \nof capital gains and dividend income goes to taxpayers with incomes \nover $200,000 a year. Over half of all capital gains and dividends--54 \npercent--go to taxpayers with incomes over $1 million a year. The \naverage millionaire will save over $42,000 a year from these tax breaks \non capital gains and dividend income. By contrast, the average family \nearning $50,000 a year will save $46 in taxes.\n  As a result of this shameful Republican let-them-eat-cake proposal, \nmillions of working families will pay a substantially higher tax rate \non their wages than wealthy taxpayers pay on their investment income. \nWhat could be more unfair? Republicans are penalizing hard work, not \nrewarding it. They are giving a preference to unearned income over \nearned income.\n  The Republicans cynically claim that capital gains and dividend \nincome deserve special treatment because they will stimulate \ninvestment. The facts do not substantiate that claim. The stock market \ngrew much more rapidly in the 1990s than since the rates on capital \ngains and dividend income were cut in 2003. The overall health of the \neconomy has much more to do with financial stability than special tax \nbreaks for the rich. More tax cuts that America cannot afford will hurt \nthe economy, not help it.\n  As if the capital gains and dividend tax breaks were not enough, the \nconferees created another new tax break for the wealthy that was not \ncontained in either the Senate or the House bill. After 2010, the bill \nwill allow high-income taxpayers to have retirement accounts where \nunlimited amounts of interest, dividends, and capital gains income that \nthey receive would be totally tax free. This will have an enormous \nlong-term cost, taking billions of dollars each year out of the \nTreasury.\n  The Republican conferees also made sure that multinational \ncorporations got their piece of the pie. More than $5 billion in tax \nbreaks were added to the bill for companies doing business overseas, a \nfurther incentive for these corporations to invest abroad rather than \nin the United States. They also took care of the oil industry. The \nSenate bill would have eliminated several special tax loopholes that \nbig oil uses to avoid paying taxes on its substantial profits, \nincluding questionable accounting gimmicks that will cost the \nGovernment over $4 billion in lost tax revenue. However, those \nloophole-closing provisions were removed in conference. The Republicans \nmade sure that the oil companies will get to keep their tax loopholes.\n  There are some very important tax provisions that we should be \naddressing in this bill, but the Republicans threw them overboard:\n  The alternative minimum tax was never intended to apply to middle-\nclass families, and they deserve tax relief. However, this bill's AMT \nrelief is provided only through 2006, while capital gains and dividend \ntax breaks are extended through 2010. What about AMT relief for 2007? \nShouldn't that be a higher priority than capital gains and dividend tax \nbreaks for 2010?\n  The research and development tax credit is critical to our \ninternational competitiveness and should be retained. However, the R \ncredit was taken out of this bill to make more room for their tax \nbreaks for the rich.\n  The deduction for college tuition is vital to millions of middle-\nclass families struggling to afford a college education for their \nchildren. But it obviously was not very important to the Republican \nconferees. They took it out of this bill.\n  They also removed the savers credit, designed to help low- and \nmoderate-income families build a nest egg for their future. Those \nfamilies will just have to make do with less.\n  The priorities of this Republican Congress are truly scandalous.\n  The financial mismanagement of the Bush administration has weakened \nour economy and placed our children's financial wellbeing in peril. The \nnational debt has risen to an all-time high of nearly $9 trillion. \nUnder President Bush, our country has borrowed more from foreign \ngovernments and foreign financial institutions than in the prior 200 \nyears combined. We are losing control of our Nation's future, and all \nthe Republicans offer is more of the same. More and more tax breaks \nfurther enriching the already wealthy, while working families are left \nto struggle on their own in an increasingly harsh economy.\n  If we are honest about reducing the deficit and strengthening the \neconomy, we need to stop lavishing tax breaks on the rich and start \ninvesting in the health and well-being of all families. These families \nare being squeezed unmercifully between stagnant wages and ever-\nincreasing costs for the basic necessities of life. The cost of health \ninsurance is up 56 percent in the last 5 years. Gasoline is up 75 \npercent. College tuition is up 46 percent. Housing is up 57 percent. \nThe list goes on and on, up and up--and paychecks are buying less each \nyear. The dollars that go to pay for more tax breaks for the rich are \ndollars that could be used to help these families. Instead, this \nRepublican budget plan turns a blind eye to their problems.\n  The economic trends are very disturbing for any who are willing to \nlook at them objectively. The gap between rich and poor has been \nwidening in recent years. Thirty-seven million Americans now live in \npoverty, up 19 percent during the Bush administration. One in\n\n[[Page S4425]]\n\nfive American children lives in poverty. Thirteen million children go \nto bed hungry each night. Wages remain stagnant while inflation drags \nmore and more families below the poverty line. Long-term unemployment \nis at historic highs.\n  The Republican majority has abandoned our Nation's working families. \nThey cut the programs that these families depend on, while granting the \nwealthy even more tax breaks. The American people deserve better; and \nin November they will insist on a new Congress that truly shares their \nvalues and cares about their needs.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to the \ntax reconciliation conference report.\n  The Federal Government is the rare institution that can spend money \nit just doesn't have. We spend and we spend and when we don't take in \nenough to cover the bill, we just borrow from China and Japan and keep \non spending.\n  Families would go bankrupt if they managed their budgets this way. \nBusinesses would shut down. Most mayors and Governors would be thrown \nin jail. And yet Washington operates as if we can continue to get away \nwith more of the same.\n  The reality is, we can't. To do so simply passes the burden to our \nchildren and grandchildren, while keeping us in debt to our major \neconomic competitors.\n  By standard accounting rules, our Federal deficit last year rose to \n$760 billion, a figure that now makes our national debt more than $8.4 \ntrillion.\n  Think of it this way: last year, the Federal Government spent more \nthan it took in by about $2,500 for every single man, woman, and child \nin America. And that is on top of each household's $75,000 share of our \nnational debt. That is a credit card bill and a second mortgage that \nmost Americans didn't even know they had.\n  What is worse is that even these figures don't tell the full picture. \nThe rising demands on Medicare and Social Security over the next 35 \nyears will swallow up the Federal budget unless we adjust either the \namount that is paid into the two trust funds or the amount that is paid \nout.\n  Sadly, there may be too much partisan rancor right now to address \nthese long-term challenges. But, at the very least, what we can do \nright now is to stop making things worse. This bill doesn't do that. \nThis bill makes things worse--much worse.\n  The $70 billion pricetag is just the start. Because we know that that \nnumber is just a gimmick to push this through--and we know that more \ntax cuts are coming in another bill that will push the real cost closer \nto $150 billion in new deficits.\n  But the most offensive part of this bill isn't even the pricetag. The \nmost offensive part is where this tax relief is going. Because this \nmoney's not going to the working Americans who are already having \ntrouble paying their medical bills and tuition bills and their mortgage \npayments and their taxes. Those middle-class Americans will get an \naverage of $20 from this tax bill. Twenty dollars.\n  On the other hand, if you make more than a million dollars, well, \nthis is the bill for you--because you will get an average of $42,000 in \ntax cuts--$42,000 in tax cuts for millionaires.\n  This bill is out of touch with the country's priorities. It makes the \nwrong choice for Americans over and over again. It makes America more \nvulnerable financially at a time when we need to be stronger. It \nenshrines tax breaks for oil companies yet leaves out the deduction of \ncollege tuition. It creates a huge tax break for wealthy savings yet \nleaves out the saver's credit to help moderate-income households save \nfor retirement. It privileges the high incomes of wealthy investors yet \nleaves out tax credits that help employers hire people off welfare. It \nrushes to address the demands of big corporations out in 2009 yet fails \nto shield middle-class families from the outdated alternative minimum \ntax even through 2007.\n  Given our country's precarious budgetary situation, now is not the \ntime for a $70 billion tax cut that will only push us deeper into debt. \nBefore we embark on an expensive package of tax cuts or new spending \ninitiatives--no matter how meritorious--we should insist upon sensible \npay-as-you-go rules so that tax cuts and new spending are paid for \ntoday rather than passed along to our children and grandchildren.\n  You know, this place never ceases to amaze me. It amazes me that at \nthis time in our country's history--a time when so many Americans are \nstruggling to get by; a time when so many have lost faith in the idea \nof a government that looks out for their interests and upholds their \nvalues; a time when we continue to mortgage our future to bankers in \nChina; at a time when all this is going on--we are debating a $70 \nbillion tax bill that will give the wealthiest one-tenth of 1 percent \nof all Americans a tax cut that is more than 4 thousand times larger \nthan most middle-class Americans will get.\n  If you are wondering why our approval ratings are in the tank, take \nanother look at this bill. This is a bill that is neither responsible, \nnor fair, nor honest. It is not worthy of the people who sent us here, \nand it certainly doesn't help them. And so I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the conference report on tax reconciliation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD Mr. President, this country needs meaningful health care \nreform. I believe that health care is a fundamental right, and I \nbelieve that this right should not be compromised, nor should the \nquality of the insurance offered to Americans be compromised. Far too \nmany of our constituents lack health coverage, and we should be acting \nto address that problem today. In fact, we should have addressed that \nproblem long ago.\n  Unfortunately, it has become clear that in this current political \nenvironment Congress will not discuss ways to provide health care \ncoverage to all Americans. In fact, we find ourselves debating \nlegislation today that will set back our efforts to provide adequate \ncoverage to Americans.\n  The Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization Act would allow the \npreemption of State insurance mandates that were put into place to \nprotect people from plans that would otherwise drop coverage of \nmedically necessary services. Insurance regulation is an issue that has \ntraditionally been under the jurisdiction of the States. As a former \nState legislator, I appreciate the hard work that is done on the State \nlevel to tailor these laws to State residents, and I think that it is \nshameful to undo all of this hard work and subvert States' rights in \nthis area.\n  States rights are not my only concern about this legislation. This \npreemption could have a very dangerous impact on individuals and \nfamilies. It could result in health insurance policyholders no longer \nhaving access to numerous services including mammograms, mental health \ncare, and newborn baby care. And these are not simply my concerns--I \nhave heard from thousands of chiropractors, podiatrists, optometrists, \nand mental health providers in the State of Wisconsin, all of them \nconcerned about losing provider mandates in the State. The people of \nWisconsin believe that they should have access to comprehensive health \ninsurance, but this legislation would reverse the progress that \nWisconsin has made in ensuring adequate health coverage for its \ncitizens. Wisconsin is not the only State--many States would lose \nmandates under this legislation. This bill would essentially provide \nunderinsurance for Americans, and this isn't what Americans want or \ndeserve.\n  In addition, this bill would cause fragmentation in the health \ninsurance market, which would make it even more difficult for sick \nindividuals to obtain health insurance. Without adequate regulation, \ninsurance plans offered under this new scheme would be able to attract \nhealthy low-risk individuals, leaving higher concentrations of sick \nindividuals in traditional health plans that operate within State laws. \nThis could drive up the costs in these traditional health care plans, \npotentially making insurance unaffordable for their policyholders.\n  Supporters of this bill are right about one thing, small businesses \nare facing enormous challenges in offering health insurance to \nemployees. Health care costs have skyrocketed along with health \ninsurance premiums, and it is difficult for small businesses to stay \ncompetitive without being able to afford insurance for employees. I \nhave been hearing about this problem firsthand for years from small \nbusinessowners who attend my listening sessions and tell me that they \nwant\n\n[[Page S4426]]\n\nto provide insurance for their employees, but they are getting squeezed \nfinancially. They are looking for help from the Federal Government, and \nI regret that they are instead being offered a badly flawed bill.\n  Small businesses owners and their employees should have access to \nhigh-quality health insurance, and I introduced legislation with \nSenator Collins that would help provide this for small businesses. Our \nlegislation would avoid the problems of S. 1955 while still allowing \nassociations and small businesses to pool their members so as to \nnegotiate lower insurance premiums. This bill, the Promoting Health \nCare Purchasing Cooperative Act, would establish grant programs to help \nboth large and small businesses form group purchasing cooperatives \nwithin the framework of existing State regulation. This legislation \nprovides an alternative to the legislation we are debating that would \nnot preempt State mandates and that works within the existing framework \nin the States. But this legislation certainly isn't the magic bullet \nthat can address the entirety of the problems within the health care \nsystem.\n  We need to find a comprehensive solution to the problems with our \nNation's health care. Almost 46 million Americans are currently \nuninsured, and millions more underinsured. This number has been \nclimbing steadily for 20 years. People who fall into the category of \nthe uninsured are seven times more likely to seek care in an emergency \nroom. They are less likely to receive preventative care, and they are \nmore likely to die as a result. The effects of uninsurance are not \nlimited to individuals and families without coverage--each one of us \ndeals with the consequences.\n  By not taking action on providing affordable insurance for people in \nour country, we are putting our future physical and economic health at \nstake. America's survival rate for newborn babies ranks near the bottom \namong industrialized nations, better only than Latvia. Our other health \noutcomes for most segments of the population are poorer than outcomes \nin other industrialized nations. Additionally, our businesses are \nhaving difficulty competing in the global market with businesses in \ncountries that have universal health care. The combination of problems \nis clearly taking its toll on our country's future.\n  While we face these looming problems of poor health and access into \nthe health care system, we devote more of our economy to health care \nthan any other developed nation. In real dollars, we spend more on \nhealth care than the entirety of England's GDP. Despite this incredible \nspending, our country is still looking at astounding numbers of \nuninsured people, and Congress continues to do nothing.\n  The only thing worse than doing nothing is pretending to do \nsomething, and that is what this Republican-designated Health Week \namounts to. We have been given 1 week only 1 week to discuss the \nstaggering problems facing the health care system in this country. We \nhave been presented with legislation that ignores or exacerbates the \nreal problems we face. And we have been shut out of the opportunity to \noffer amendments. If we are going to finally debate health care, as we \nmust, we should engage in a real debate, a debate that gives health \ncare the attention it deserves, instead of debating a bill that \nRepublican leadership probably expects will not even be passed into \nlaw. Let's talk about real answers for real people. Let's talk about \ntrue health care reform.\n  I was pleased to be joined by the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. \nGraham, in introducing legislation that requires Congress to act on \nhealth care reform. Our legislation would force Congress to finally \naddress this issue. It requires Congress to discuss, debate, and \nconsider universal health care bills within the first 90 days of the \nsession following enactment of the bill. This bill does not prejudge \nwhat particular health care reform measure should be debated. There are \nmany worthy proposals that would qualify for consideration, and this \nbill does not dictate policy. This simply requires Congress to act. The \nAmerican people want action, the States want action, and it is time \nthat we answered their call.\n  Instead of avoiding the issue or offering dead-end solutions, we \nshould enact health care reform legislation that harnesses the talent \nand ingenuity of Americans to come up with new solutions. That is why I \nadvocate a State-based approach to health care reform, which allows \nStates to experiment with ways to enhance access to health care for \ntheir citizens. This approach takes advantage of America's greatest \nresources--its mind-power and diversity--to bring our country closer to \nthe goal of realizing a working health care system with universal \ncoverage. If the Federal Government helped States enact changes in the \nhealth care system, then I believe we would see our political logjam \naround health care begin to loosen.\n  We are already seeing States move ahead of the Federal Government on \ncovering the uninsured. Massachusetts recently passed into law a plan \nto require health insurance for residents. In Wisconsin there has been \ndiscussion of expanding health insurance coverage in the State. I think \nthe Federal Government should be working to encourage these innovative \ninitiatives.\n  States could be creative in the State resources they use to expand \nhealth care coverage. For example, a State could use personal or \nemployer mandates for coverage, use State tax incentives, create a \nsingle-payer system or even join with neighboring States to offer a \nregional health care plan.\n  This approach would guarantee universal health care but still leave \nroom for the flexibility and creativity that is necessary to ensure \nthat everyone has access to good, affordable coverage.\n  Why don't we use this so-called Health Week to discuss meaningful \nlegislation like the approach I have discussed, rather than simply \nbringing partisan bills to the floor that won't move? It is time for \nthe government to step up and fulfill its duty to make sure that the \nbenefits of our Nation's health care system can be enjoyed by all \nAmericans. I urge my colleagues to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1955\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am here to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest. I want to make sure when we have the cloture vote tonight, \nthat after cloture we are assured we can still have a vote on the \nDurbin-Lincoln bill as well as S. 1955.\n  I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is invoked on the substitute \namendment, notwithstanding rule XXII, it be in order for the Senate to \nconsider the Durbin-Lincoln substitute amendment, which is the text of \nS. 2510; provided further that the pending amendments be temporarily \nset aside immediately after cloture is invoked and the Senate proceed \nto the Durbin-Lincoln amendment.\n  I further ask that following 2 hours of debate, equally divided in \nthe usual form, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the \namendment, with no other amendments in order prior to that vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, I thank the chairman of \nthe committee for being so thoughtful as to include the substitute as a \npossible vote after cloture.\n  I ask the Senator if he would consider including stem cell research, \nwhich we have been waiting for for a year. Senator Frist has promised \nhe would bring it before the Senate.\n  There are millions of Americans suffering from afflictions such as \ndiabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Lou Gehrig's disease, and spinal \ncord injuries who are counting on us. Will the chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, as part of Health Care Week, amend his unanimous consent \nrequest to include a vote, after an adequate debate, on stem cell \nresearch?\n  Mr. ENZI. Our purpose is to get a vote on small business health plans \nof some form. You proposed a small business health plan. I proposed a \nsmall business health plan. I would like for both of them to be able to \nget a vote so that small business can get something out of this \nsession.\n  We have already been promised there will be a debate on stem cells \nand a vote on stem cells. I heard some of the discussion last night \nabout the three votes that will be taken on that issue. I am pretty \nsure that will be covered. It would be difficult to amend onto this \nbill because it is a totally different subject. We need to do something \nfor\n\n[[Page S4427]]\n\nsmall business. This allows your small business plan and my small \nbusiness plan to be considered and to get a vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, then let me ask the \nchairman of the HELP Committee, since we are just 4 days away from the \ndeadline on Medicare prescription Part D, and 6 or 7 million \nAmericans--seniors, many of whom are in precarious physical and health \nconditions--have been unable or have not signed up for the program and \n4 days from now will face a lifetime penalty for failing to sign up, \nwill the chairman of the committee, understanding the critical \nimportance and urgency of this issue, amend his unanimous consent \nrequest so that we can consider this before the deadline to make \ncertain these seniors are held harmless and have a chance to change \ntheir plans in the next year?\n  He can understand if stem cell research is promised months from now, \nand I hope we will reach it, this is something which is time-sensitive \nand urgent to millions of Americans. Will the Senator amend his \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. ENZI. I appreciate the request and the emphasis of making a \ndecision by Monday. I hope millions of people across the United States \nare using all of the different mechanisms--the volunteers, the phone \nnumbers, the Internet--to get to a very simple result, having Medicare \ndo the math so they can make that decision.\n  Deadlines are a marvelous thing. I operate on deadlines. So to do it \nbefore Monday would probably preclude a lot of people from making that \ndecision and will give people the impression that we will move the \ndeadline now, move the deadline next time, move the deadline next time. \nThat won't get people signed up. We have time to move the deadline \nafter the deadline if that seems to be a major concern--I am sure there \nis a major concern--but to move it beforehand and not to put the \npressure on it would be a huge mistake.\n  That falls under the Committee on Finance, not under the HELP \nCommittee, not under HELP, and the Finance Committee has to make those \ndeterminations to bring that forward. It would not be possible to put \nthat in this amendment.\n  Again, we are trying to keep it a small business health plan so that \nsmall business can have a chance for the first time in 12 years to have \nsomething done for them.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, I would like to say as \nfollows: On behalf of 9 million seniors in this country who face a \nlifetime penalty in 4 days because they failed to sign up for this \nconfusing prescription Part D program that has been created by this \nadministration, and on behalf of millions of Americans who ask me every \nchance they get: When will you possibly bring up this issue of stem \ncell research so we can have the medical research to spare people from \nsuffering and death, and on behalf of those millions of Americans who \nwill not have a chance during this Health Care Week to even have their \nissue considered by the Republican majority in the Senate, I am sorry \nthat I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. ENZI. It would do me no good to change the unanimous consent, so \nwe have 2 more hours of debate or have germane amendments available to \nyour bill?\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator is asking me a question, I have given him \ntwo other requests. There are others, such as reimportation of drugs.\n  This was supposed to be Health Care Week. The majority leader started \nwith medical malpractice and then went to your bill and does not want \nto talk about anything else. How can we miss this opportunity? The \nSenator from Wyoming knows these opportunities are few and far between. \nIf we do not seize this moment and take up these issues, we will not \nreach them this year and people will be left penalized and still \nwaiting for Congress to act.\n  Mr. ENZI. And there is only one opportunity to talk about small \nbusiness. I have been trying to expand that opportunity as much as \npossible. That is why I propounded this unanimous consent, so that it \ncould be absolutely clear that both methods of taking care of small \nbusiness would be done. I am sorry the other side is not willing to do \nthat.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from Wyoming yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Is the Senator from Wyoming aware we have had votes on \nthe extension of the May 15 deadline at least on two occasions or more? \nHas the Senate already voted on this issue repeatedly?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes, it has.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So what the Senator from Illinois is asking is to have \nanother vote after the Senate has already, on more than one occasion, \nvoted it down. So it is not that we have not discussed that issue. We \nhave discussed that issue in the past, and the Senator does not like \nthe decision of the Senate, but that does not mean we have not debated \nthat issue.\n  The second issue on which I wish to ask a question is the stem cell \nissue. I think you said this, but I want to make it very clear. Is the \nleader not in discussion right now with the Democratic leader on \nsetting up a framework to bring up stem cell? And did not the leader \nsay that he would bring this issue to the Senate, and he gave a \ncommitment, and isn't his intention--hasn't he stated it clearly--that \nhe will bring this issue to the Senate in a timely manner before the \nend of this session?\n  Mr. ENZI. I have been next to conversations but not a part of the \nconversation where that was absolutely the case. I have heard speeches \nin the Senate where that absolutely was the case. I know there are \nthree different proposals that will be voted on and debated in regard \nto that, so it is something which will be covered this session.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. And the third issue on which the Senator says we have \nto have a vote is the importation of drugs. Have we not debated that \nissue repeatedly in the Senate, and the position the Senator from \nIllinois has taken has repeatedly failed; is that not the case?\n  Mr. ENZI. Over a period of years, that has been debated and voted on \nhere, and it has been voted down.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask the Senator from Wyoming, have we ever debated \nand brought to the Senate small business health plan reform for the \nopportunity of small businesses to be able to get insurance for their \nemployees, to take care of one of the biggest problems Members on both \nsides of the aisle have talked about, which is the rate of uninsured in \nthis country? Have we ever debated this issue in your bill, in the \nSenate?\n  Mr. ENZI. It has not been debated in the Senate before. The House has \ndone it for the past 12 years. They passed it eight times, but we have \nnever done it on the Senate side. It has not made it out of committee \nbefore.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Let me understand, if I am correct, the Senator from \nIllinois is objecting to moving forward with a bill that has never been \nconsidered, that has support, I assume, from both sides of the aisle, \nthat is important from the standpoint of insuring more people; and the \nreason he does not want to let that go forward is to bring up two \nissues that have repeatedly been brought up in the Senate, including \nthis session of Congress, and he has been defeated on, and a third \nissue which the majority leader has already said he would give time \nfor. That is his reason for objecting to this unanimous consent?\n  Mr. ENZI. That is the reason that was given.\n  All I am asking is that we do something for small business. I know \nthey were concerned about getting a vote on the Durbin-Lincoln \namendment. I tried to make any concessions I possibly could to get that \nvote postcloture so that we would both be able to get a vote on the two \nbills and do something for small business. We can weed out what will \nwork for small business. We can do additional amendments. There are \nactually unlimited amendments that can be done to S. 1955 that the \nother side could use to improve that, if they so desire. What we do is \nhave 30 hours of debate and then a vote-arama on any issues remaining \nand a final vote on whether small business has anything different.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me correct my colleague from the State \nof Pennsylvania who has misstated a fact which I am sure has escaped \nhis attention; that is, on February 2, this year,\n\n[[Page S4428]]\n\nthere was, in fact, a vote on this Medicare prescription Part D. The \nvote was propounded by the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson. It was \nunder the debate on the budget and needed 60 votes, but 52 Senators \nvoted in favor, including, obviously, Republican Senators. So his \nstatement earlier that it has never passed in the Senate is not \ncorrect.\n  It is correct that he voted against giving relief to seniors who \nfailed to sign up in time on May 15. That is reflected in the Record. I \nwant to make sure that is clear for the record.\n  I also say when it comes to this issue, we have been told repeatedly \nregarding this wonderful program that the seniors would figure it out \nand all sign up. It turns out half of them have not. It is too \ncomplicated. It is too difficult. We have been trying to give the \nseniors some relief from the possible penalty they will face. I don't \nknow whether it is because of the embarrassment that the program is so \ncomplicated, but for whatever reason the Republican majority has not \nallowed this.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Does the Senator from Illinois recall what the \nestimates were as to how many seniors would sign by the date of May 15?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Whose estimates?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. By the Congressional Budget Office, which scores the \nbill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. No.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Between 28 and 30 million.\n  Does the Senator from Illinois know how many have signed up?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is very carefully avoiding the obvious; that \nis, the vast majority of seniors already have prescription drug \ncoverage. What we are trying to do is bring into coverage those who do \nnot have it, and more than half of them have not signed up for the \nprogram. So he is comparing numbers here that do not work.\n  I will reclaim my time because I would like to speak to the tax \nreconciliation bill. But before I do, the way to deal with this issue \non small business health insurance is on behalf of the leader to sit \ndown and decide what amendments will be in order and to move forward. \nBut that is not the way we do business in the Senate. It is a \nconfrontation strategy.\n  The Republican majority brings a bill to the Senate, fills the tree \nso no amendments can be offered, and then files cloture, which stops \ndebate. So we cannot have this conversation. We cannot offer other \namendments.\n  Why would the Republican majority leader want to avoid a vote on stem \ncell research? Because Members on the Republican side of the aisle up \nfor reelection are nervous about this vote. They have said they oppose \nstem cell research, and they know a majority of the people in their \nstates favor stem cell research and they do not know what to do. They \nwant to avoid the pain. They do not want to face the votes.\n  I remind them what my former colleague from Oklahoma, Mike Synar, \nused to say: If you don't want to fight fires, don't be a firefighter. \nIf you don't want to cast controversial votes, don't run for the \nSenate. That is what this is all about. You have to face the music and \nface the voters.\n  The Senator from Tennessee, the majority leader, is trying to protect \nand insulate his Senators from a delicate and difficult political vote. \nI am afraid he is going to have to answer to the millions of people \nacross America who believe that stem cell research is critically \nimportant to a nation that counts on medical research to deal with our \nfuture.\n  One out of three of our children alive today will be diagnosed with \ndiabetes. If we can do medical research with stem cells to save and \nspare those children, why don't we do it? We know what Parkinson's is \ndoing to so many healthy people--cutting their lives short, \ncompromising their ability. Alzheimer's is rampant. We have situations \nwith Lou Gehrig's disease, spinal cord injuries.\n  All of these could be addressed with stem cell research. And despite \nthe fact that the Senate majority leader has said he favors this \nresearch, he refuses to call it to the floor. That is not fair. It is \nnot fair to the families who count on us.\n  If this President has decided we are going to prohibit medical \nresearch, we should have a voice in that decision. The people should \nhave a voice in that decision through their Senators. And because the \nSenate majority leader wants to protect his Members from a tough vote, \na controversial vote, he does not want to bring this to the floor. That \nis unfortunate--unfortunate for the Senate, more unfortunate for the \npeople who count on us.\n  Let me tell you what we did have time to do this week. Before we \nleft, we found time to do something critically important. We found time \nto make sure we are dealing with the tax cuts being proposed by the \nRepublican majority.\n  What are those tax cuts worth to average Americans? Well, if you \nhappen to make about $75,000 a year or less, they are worth $110.\n  Do you remember when the Republican majority said, we will solve the \ngasoline price crisis by sending every American a check for $100, and \nthey were laughed out of Washington? Here they come again. Here comes \nthe Republican tax cut for working families across America--$110. Thank \nyou so much. It almost will buy two tankfuls of gas. That is their idea \nof helping working middle-income families.\n  But look down here on this chart. Look at the people who are making \nmore than $1 million a year. Do you know what the tax cut is worth to \nthem? It is $42,000. I will tell you this, there are 17,000 people in \nthe State of Illinois, in the State I am proud to represent, who make \nmore than $1 million a year. Do you know how many have written to me \nand said: ``Please, I need a tax cut for $42,000''? None. Not one. Do \nyou know why? They are doing quite well, thank you.\n  Mr. President, $42,000 more a year for them is money, perhaps, for \nanother purchase of something to make their lifestyle even more \ncomfortable, or to put it in their savings, or put it in investment, \nbut they do not need it to get by.\n  The people making $75,000 a year could use a real tax cut. But this \nbill that is before us has removed one of the tax provisions that would \nhelp working families across America. It is the tax provision which \nsaid that working families can deduct the cost of college education \nexpenses for their kids. Think about that. Working families, some who \nhave a first-generation son or daughter in a college, got a helping \nhand from our Tax Code to pay for the cost of college education. And \nyou know it is going up. Kids come out of college today with more and \nmore debt.\n  And to the families that want to help them, we said: We will give you \na helping hand in the Tax Code. But guess what. When the Republicans \nmet in conference, they eliminated that provision. They took out the \ntax cut for these working families for college education so they could \nput in a tax cut of $42,000 for people making $1 million a year.\n  Well, let me tell you what it means in real terms. When you look at \nthe average family across America, it means the tax cut is worth $16. \nYou could not fill up a gas tank unless you were driving, perhaps, a \nmotorcycle. Mr. President, $16--that is the average tax cut across \nAmerica.\n  The gentleman whose picture I have here is Mr. Lee Raymond, the \nretiring CEO of ExxonMobil. Do you remember his retirement gift from \nExxonMobil? After totaling up the largest profits in the history of the \ncompany, they gave him--not a gold ring, not an engraved plaque--they \ngave him $400 million as a retirement gift for leaving ExxonMobil. And \nthere is better news coming. This bill will give Mr. Raymond an \nadditional $2.5 million tax cut. There is a guy who really needs it--\nreally needs it--$400 million, and he did not even have to buy a \nPowerball ticket. And now the Republicans say: Come on. Give the guy a \nbreak. Give him a tax cut.\n  What is wrong with this picture? What is wrong with this picture is \nthat the tax cuts are not only unfair, they are building a wall of \ndebt. The legacy of the Bush administration will be the biggest \nincrease in the debt of America in our history.\n  Look at this chart. When this President took office, our national \ndebt ceiling was $5.8 trillion. By this year it is up to $8.6 trillion. \nThe mortgage on America has grown faster under this\n\n[[Page S4429]]\n\nPresident than any other President in our history, and more than a \nthird of the responsibility is the President's tax cuts. Do you know \nwhy? He is the first President in the history of the United States of \nAmerica to ever cut taxes in the midst of a war--the first.\n  Why didn't other Presidents cut taxes in the middle of a war? It did \nnot make sense. Along comes a war that costs you $2 billion a week, and \nyou are going to cut taxes? Don't you know that is going to drive your \ncountry into debt? This President should know that. Our Republican \ncolleagues should know that. But they are ignoring it.\n\n  And as we are debating this bill, do you know why we are moving on it \nso fast? We got word this week that they are going to have to raise the \ndebt ceiling again. We just raised it a few weeks ago. We are going to \nhave to raise the mortgage on America again because the fiscal policies \nof the Bush administration have failed so utterly.\n  Well, we have time to do this. We do not have time to debate stem \ncell research. We do not have time to have a real Health Care Week. But \nwe have time to pile debt on our kids. That is what this is all about.\n  If you want to know the foreign-held debt of America, take a look at \nthis chart. Who are the mortgage bankers for America? Japan, No. 1, \nwith $673 billion; China, No. 2, with $265 billion; and the list goes \non. We have to borrow money from foreign countries to float our debt. \nThey loan us money so we can keep going and give tax cuts to the \nwealthiest people in America, knowing full well that any of these \nforeign countries could turn on us tomorrow and say, ``We are sick and \ntired of the dollar. We are moving to the Euro or some other \nstandard,'' and our economy would be paralyzed as a result of it.\n  It is the height of irresponsibility--height of irresponsibility--for \nus to drive this Nation so deeply into debt, particularly from a party \nthat used to pride itself on being a fiscally conservative party. He is \nthe first President to raise taxes in the midst of a war, giving tax \ncuts to the wealthiest people in this Nation, piling debt on children \nto the point we have never seen in our history, and borrowing money \nfrom foreign governments at a rate we have never seen.\n  This chart indicates that in the history of the United States, before \nGeorge W. Bush was elected President, 42 other men held the Presidency. \nIn that entire 224-year period of time, in the history of the United \nStates, all of the previous Presidents borrowed $1.01 trillion in \nforeign-held debt for America--$1.01 trillion. This President, in 5 \nyears, has borrowed $1.22 trillion. That is more than double the \nforeign-held debt.\n  Is America safer and more secure because of this? Of course not. And \nyou know what the impact of this is. Remember the debate over Dubai \nPorts? More and more of these countries awash in dollars they have \nloaned us are now coming into the United States to invest. They are \nbecoming a bigger part of our economy. So it is not just debt for our \nchildren; it is squandering our economic future. And that is a priority \nthat this Republican majority wants to move to today.\n  When you consider who wins and who loses in Washington, it is very \nclear. Big oil wins with this bill, and not just Mr. Raymond who got a \n$2.5 million tax break. Two Senate provisions would have collected \nnearly $6 billion from oil and gas companies such as ExxonMobil, \nChevron, and ConocoPhillips. The Republican majority took them out of \nthe bill. At a time when the oil companies are experiencing the \ngreatest profits in their history, the Republican majority has decided \nthis is not the time to tax them, this is not the time to ask them to \ngive back to America. So they stripped out the tax provisions on big \noil.\n  The lobbyists for the financial service companies did very well, too. \nCitigroup, GE, and JPMorgan will be able to delay paying taxes on \nprofits they make overseas. What is it worth to them? It is worth $4.8 \nbillion. Why are we providing tax giveaways to companies to keep their \nprofits overseas? Why is our Tax Code rewarding conduct that ships jobs \noverseas? The Republican majority thinks this makes as much sense as \ngiving tax cuts to people who make $1 million a year.\n  Who are the losers? Well, every American is going to end up losing \nbecause our national debt is going to grow dramatically because of this \nirresponsible fiscal policy.\n  This bill, sadly, will not allow Americans to deduct State and local \nsales taxes. School teachers who buy their classroom supplies have lost \ntheir deduction. Families paying college tuition will not be able to \ndeduct the tuition from their taxes. Fewer people will be hired from \nwelfare to work. Businesses working to do research and develop new \ntechnologies will not get the tax credits they have had. These are only \nsome of the losers.\n  But the real losers are the American kids. The kids are going to have \nto pay for this: $2 trillion that the Bush tax cuts have added to the \ndebt of America--$2 trillion.\n  Our national deficit is expected to exceed $11 trillion within 5 \nyears. The money we are spending today is not free, no matter how much \nwe pretend it is. Someday we are going to have to pay for it. I should \nsay someday our children will have to pay for it.\n  So this President--the first in history to cut taxes in the midst of \na war, the first President to amass a wall of debt larger than every \nother President before him when it comes to foreign debt, the first \nPresident in history to create a $9 trillion IOU for our kids to pay--\nis going to have his chance in a few moments with his bill that he so \ndearly believes in. And you will find that his party will stand behind \nhim.\n\n  The President's popularity is not at a high point. Obviously, the \nRepublican Senators believe the way to win the next election is to keep \ndigging the deficit hole deeper. What we are witnessing here is not a \ndebate about tax policy. It is the death rattle of a failed Bush \neconomic policy.\n  I would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, I admire \nyour consistency. You stick with the program even though the debt has \nbecome unbearable. You stick with it even when conservatives in your \nown party can no longer explain what your party stands for. You stick \nwith it when we are in a war that costs us $2 billion a week. You stick \nwith it even though we have become indebted further and further to \nforeign countries, which, if they called in the debt, would make life \nmiserable for this entire Nation. At least you are consistent.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would also say, we know what the other \nside believes in. We know they believe in higher taxes. We know they \nbelieve in more Government spending. We have seen amendment after \namendment come here.\n  I cannot believe I hear again, repeatedly, from the other side of the \naisle the woe and complaint about deficits when it comes to letting \npeople keep their money, but no concern about deficits when it comes to \nspending and increasing the size of Government.\n  I want to correct the Senator from Illinois on a couple of points he \nmade with respect to the Medicare Program. He said I was wrong when I \nsaid the Nelson amendment lost. He said it got 52 votes. Well, a motion \nto waive the Budget Act requires 60 votes. Fifty-two is less than 60. \nIt lost. I want to make sure the Record is clear that I was correct \nand, in fact, the amendment did lose.\n  I also want to make sure the Record is clear when it comes to low-\nincome eligible seniors signing up for Medicare. The Senator from \nIllinois said more than half the people who need to go out and sign up \nfor Medicare have not done so. The bottom line is, my understanding is, \naccording to the HHS News of May 10, 2006, a total of 37 million \nseniors have signed up for the Medicare prescription drug coverage, of \na total of around 44 million to 45 million seniors. Now, that does not \nlook like half to me. It looks like a lot more than half have signed \nup, and a very small percentage have not.\n  As far as low-income individuals, 10 million of the 13 million have \nsigned up for the program. And those who have not signed up and do not \nsign up by May 15 will not be penalized. They will suffer no penalty. \nSo if you are a low-income individual, you will not suffer a penalty.\n  So let's understand now, 37 million have signed up, and there are 3 \nmore\n\n[[Page S4430]]\n\nmillion who, if they do not sign up, will not receive a penalty. So you \nhave 40 million people who either signed up or will not receive a \npenalty for not signing up, which leaves about 4 million people who \nwill receive a penalty if, in fact, they do not sign up.\n  Again, there were still, as of this number, 5 days. And as we have \nseen with other programs--just like as with Congress, we wait until the \nlast minute to do things--we will probably see, and I think we are \nevidencing, there will be a number of people who will come in and sign \nup.\n  The other thing is, believe it or not--I know this is hard for some \nto believe--some people do not want the program. Some people do not \nwant to participate in a Government program. They are very happy to not \nparticipate. They are very happy to purchase their prescriptions on \ntheir own.\n  I know that might come as a shock to some, but there are people who \ndon't like to participate in Government programs, who don't participate \nin a whole variety of programs the Federal Government offers. As we \nknow, with Medicaid there are lots of people who do not participate. \nWith Medicare, there are people who do not participate, even though \nthey can. It has nothing do with complexity, when you have that high a \npercentage, much higher than was anticipated by all of those who looked \nat this, including the Congressional Budget Office. And if you look at \nthe satisfaction of people who have been in the program, more than \nthree-quarters of the people surveyed said they are happy with the \nbenefit. So let's get the facts right.\n  The reason the Democratic whip objected to Senator Enzi's request to \nmove to a vote on cloture allowing the Durbin-Lincoln amendment was \nbecause they don't want to move to cloture. They don't want to pass \nsmall business health plans. They don't want to make this happen for \nsmall businesses because of another ideology they stick to. That is, \nthey want a big Government-run health care system, and they don't want \nus to cover other people. I appreciate their sticking to their \nideology, even though it has been proven to be a failure in every other \ncountry where it has been used and is not popular with the American \npublic.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will oppose H.R. 4297. It fails in \nnearly every aspect to justify enactment, but among the biggest of its \ndefects is that it adds $70 billion to our already mounting deficits. \nThe last thing we should be doing is adding to the burden already \nfacing our children and grandchildren.\n  What are we getting in exchange for this fiscal recklessness? Are we \naddressing some urgent tax need? Perhaps this bill finally gives us the \nkind of reform of the alternative minimum tax that is so clearly \nneeded. No, we get another 1-year patch on the AMT problem, and that is \nit. This bill does nothing further to fix the AMT because the real tax \nagenda in this bill is to enact dividend and capital gains tax cuts of \ndubious merit, and which do not take effect for 2 years.\n  Two years, Mr. President. We are running up a $70 billion credit card \ntab, and handing it over to our kids to pay, just so we will have a tax \ncut that takes effect in 2 years.\n  Worse, the body is once again abusing the reconciliation process in \norder to shield these questionable tax cuts from the kind of scrutiny \nthey so clearly need. Make no mistake: This bill would never pass \nwithout this abusive use of reconciliation. The benefits of this bill \nare grossly skewed to the most well off. The Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities notes that this tax bill provides middle-income \nhouseholds with an average tax cut of $20, about the price of two \nmedium sized pizzas. By contrast, households with incomes over $1 \nmillion will get an average tax cut of $42,000, the price of a Lexus. \nAltogether, more than half of the benefits from this bill will go to \nthe top 3 percent of households, those making $200,000 or more.\n  Moreover, in order to squeeze those questionable tax cuts into the \nlimited space afforded by the reconciliation maneuver, the conferees \nhave resorted to an outrageous bookkeeping gimmick which shifts \nrevenues that would have been collected in the future to the current \nbudget window. The Roth IRA conversion provisions permit individuals \nwith incomes over $110,000 and married couples with incomes over \n$160,000 to shift savings into tax sheltered Roth IRAs. The net result \nis to spend revenues from future budgets to shoehorn through grossly \nunbalanced tax cuts now. The Center on Budget and Policy priorities \nnotes that by 2050, the Roth IRA provision, which is being used as a \ntemporary revenue enhancer, will actually reduce revenues by $14 \nbillion in present value terms.\n  As I have had to note too many times, when we choose to spend on \ncurrent consumption--through appropriated accounts, mandatory spending, \nor tax cuts--without paying for that spending, we are robbing our \nchildren of their own choices. When we spend on our wants, by cutting \ntaxes or through government programs, without paying for those \ndecisions, we are saddling our children and even grandchildren with \ndebts that they must pay from their tax dollars and their hard work.\n  That is exactly what this bill does. The Roth IRA maneuver, along \nwith the billions in pure deficit spending contained in this bill, \ncomes out of our children's wallets. By digging the deficit ditch even \ndeeper, and by spending future revenues on tax cuts today, we are \nadding even more debt to the bill with which we are passing on to our \nchildren and even grandchildren. As a result, our children will have to \nforego program benefits or pay higher taxes.\n  This tax bill is an abuse of the reconciliation process, a process \ndesigned to reduce the deficit not aggravate it. The tax policy it \nencompasses is fiscally reckless and economically regressive. And this \nlegislation fails to address a tax problem that is truly urgent, the \nmounting problems with the alternative minimum tax. The Senate should \nreject this bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, with their latest tax plan, Republicans \nare showing once again that they care more about giving tax breaks to \nmillionaires than helping working families.\n  Republicans said this week would be health care week. While it is \ninsulting to devote only 1 week to such a critical issue, it's even \nmore troubling that Republicans pulled the plug on health care week in \nfavor of even more tax breaks for the rich. This tax bill and the \nSenate's failure to help families with the soaring cost of health care \nare further proof that Republicans have the wrong priorities.\n  If we want to make America strong again, we need to invest here at \nhome. Today middle-class families throughout Washington State and the \ncountry are struggling to pay for the skyrocketing costs of gas, \ncollege tuition, and health care. Instead of helping these hardworking \nfamilies, Republicans have once again decided to leave the middle class \nbehind.\n  While I am pleased that this bill includes a 1-year patch for the \nalternative minimum tax, there is not much else to be pleased about in \nthis bill. According to the Tax Policy Center, this tax bill would \nprovide middle income families an average tax cut of just $20, while \nmillionaires would get an average tax cut of $42,000. Rather than \nextending the middle-class tax cuts that have already expired or will \nexpire at the end of the year, Republicans have again turned their \nbacks on the middle class. The Republican bill also denies families in \nmy home State the ability to deduct their State sales taxes. It blocks \nteachers from deducting the cost of classroom expenses they pay out of \ntheir own pockets. It denies businesses access to the research and \ndevelopment tax credit which I helped extend in September 2004.\n  On its own, this bill has the wrong priorities, but when you look at \nthe bigger picture a more disturbing pattern is clear. This tax bill is \nthe second part of last year's budget resolution. The first part of the \nbudget resolution, which was enacted in February, cut $39 billion from \nimportant areas like health care and education. When we passed that \nbill, we were told that the bill was necessary to reduce the deficit. \nYet today we are presented with a tax bill that in fact increases the \ndeficit by $30 billion and adds to our massive debt.\n  We need a tax system that is fiscally responsible, helps business \ngrow, and provides maximum relief to the middle class, but this bill \nachieves none of this. Instead it takes out a loan against our \nchildren's future and adds\n\n[[Page S4431]]\n\nto the deficit. This tax bill makes it more difficult for us to address \nother important priorities like homeland security, paying for the war \nin Iraq, our nation's infrastructure, health care, and education. This \nis the wrong tax plan, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this tax reconciliation conference report \nbefore us today sets a new standard for irresponsibility. It is a huge \ngiveaway to the wealthiest among us that is papered over by a \ndisingenuous effort to increase short-term revenues at a great long-\nterm cost. Like so many of the bills we have considered recently, this \nconference report fails to invest in our Nation's priorities while \ndriving us deeper and deeper into debt.\n  Perhaps the most outrageous aspect of this bill is how deeply unfair \nit is. According to the Tax Policy Center, 87 percent of the benefits \nof this bill would flow to the 14 percent of households with incomes \nabove $100,000; 55 percent of the benefits would go those with incomes \nabove $200,000; and households earning more than $1 million a year, \nwhich account for only 0.2 percent of all households, would receive 22 \npercent of the benefits of these tax cuts.\n  In contrast, the three-quarters of American households with incomes \nbelow $75,000 would receive just 5 percent of the benefits. And the 60 \npercent of households with incomes below $50,000 would receive less \nthan 2 percent of all benefits. Approximately three-quarters of \nMichigan taxpayers would receive no benefit at all from the bill's most \nexpensive provision an extension of the capital gains and dividends tax \ncuts.\n  The inequities in this bill are even more glaring when you look at \nthe actual dollars. The average tax cut for the middle 20 percent of \nhouseholds would be just $20, while the top one percent would get \n$13,800. For those with incomes above $1 million, the average tax cut \nwould be $42,000.\n  What is even more brazen about this bill is that, with an outrageous \naccounting gimmick, it purports to pay for a portion of these tax cuts \nfor the wealthy by giving even more tax cuts to the wealthy. Proponents \nof extending the capital gains and dividends tax cuts had to find a way \naround a Senate rule that says a reconciliation bill may not increase \nlong-term deficits. One way would have been for 60 senators to vote to \nwaive the rule, but it was not likely that there would be 60 votes for \nthis expensive and inequitable proposal. Instead, proponents have \nresorted to a devious circumvention of this rule by pretending to \noffset the long-term costs with a provision that will increase revenue \nin the short-term before turning into a sea of red ink in later years.\n  Right now, individuals with incomes above $110,000 and couples with \nincomes above $160,000 cannot contribute to a Roth IRA. Furthermore, \nonly those with incomes over $100,000 are prohibited from converting \ntraditional IRAs to Roth IRAs. This bill would lift both of those caps \nbeginning in 2010, meaning that a large number of high-income \nhouseholds will convert their traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs because \nfunds in a Roth IRA are tax free when withdrawn in retirement. As taxes \nare paid on the funds being contributed to Roth IRAs, the Treasury will \nsee an increase in revenues over a few years, but the Treasury will \nlose revenues on investment gains for years down the line.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation, the Congressional Research Service, \nand other nonpartisan experts agree that this proposal will ultimately \nresult in a significant net revenue loss, even once interest is taken \ninto account.\n  So how did a revenue-loser get dressed up as a revenue-raiser in this \nbill? As a rule, official Joint Committee on Taxation estimates do not \nlook past the next 10 years, so if the decrease in revenues doesn't \noccur before 2017, it doesn't show up in the Joint Committee's \nestimate. Thus, for purposes of the Senate's rules, it is as though it \ndoesn't happen. But in the real world, it will happen. This is a \ntransparent gimmick, designed to indulge this Congress's addiction to \nirresponsible spending.\n  We owe it to our children and grandchildren not to continue building \nup this massive debt. Today, each American citizen's share of the debt \nis almost $28,000, and that will rise to more than $39,000 by 2016. \nPaying off this debt will require either extraordinary tax increases or \nsignificant cuts in critical areas such as defense or Social Security. \nTragically, it will mean that an increasing number of taxpayer dollars \nwill be spent not on moving America forward but simply on treading \nwater by making interest payments to our creditors, most of whom are \nforeign countries.\n  One of the few bright spots in the bill that the Senate passed last \nNovember was the meaningful antitax shelter provisions. Sadly, even \nthese have now been dropped from this conference report. House \nRepublicans once again rejected the economic substance provision that \nthe Senate has passed many times and that would prohibit abusive tax \nshelters that have no economic purpose other than tax avoidance. The \nSenate bill also included an amendment that Senator Coleman and I \npushed for that would increase penalties on those who promote abusive \ntax shelter schemes and the banks, law firms and others that aid and \nabet in these complex shenanigans. Dropping these provisions is a \ndisappointment that only benefits powerful special interests.\n  Finally, this bill misses yet another opportunity by failing to limit \nany of the unnecessary tax breaks currently enjoyed by major oil \ncompanies which are reaping record profits. In fact, the conference \ncommittee struck one of few provisions in the Senate bill that might \nhave helped. The Senate bill had a provision that would have allowed \ntaxpayers caught by the AMT to still enjoy the benefit of the consumer \ntax credits allowed for the purchase of hybrid and other alternative \nvehicles. Unfortunately, this provision, too, was omitted in \nconference.\n  Although the overwhelming majority of this bill is completely \nmisguided, I do support one positive provision in it--extending for 1 \nyear the patch that prevents middle income families from being slapped \nwith the alternative minimum tax. The AMT was originally created to \nmake sure that the wealthiest Americans paid at least a minimum amount \nof tax. Because the AMT is not indexed to inflation, however, it is \naffecting many more taxpayers today. At a time when median family \nincome is falling, middle-income families need all of the help they can \nget, and they certainly don't need to be socked with an unintended tax \nincrease.\n  Unfortunately, this bill provides the AMT fix for only 1 year. It \nmakes no sense to extend the capital gains and dividend tax cuts to \n2010 and give AMT relief only through the end of 2006. We all know that \nthe reason this bill does not offer longer AMT relief is because the \nfix so expensive--$33 billion for just 1-year. Knowing that we'll need \nto do a similar fix to cover future years and leaving the fix out to \nmask the real costs of the Bush policies, makes this costly bill all \nthe more irresponsible. Finding a more permanent fix for AMT is a cost \nthat we all know is coming, and we should not continue to ignore it in \nour fiscal policies.\n  Not only do we need to provide AMT relief for years past 2006, but we \nalso need to pay for it. When the Senate originally considered its \nversion of this bill, many of us supported an alternative package \noffered by Senator Conrad. That package would have paid for extending \nall of the tax cuts that expired at the end of 2005, including AMT \nrelief and the important R tax credit. It would have raised this \nneeded revenue by closing many loopholes in our current tax system, \nincluding one that allows oil companies to avoid taxation on foreign \noperations. Unfortunately, Senator Conrad's amendment was defeated on a \nnearly partyline vote of 44 to 52.\n  As a result of these many misplaced priorities, the bill before us \ntoday is an irresponsible giveaway to powerful industries and the \nwealthiest among us that will drive us deeper into the deficit ditch. \nAnd it uses outrageous shenanigans to hide its true cost. We do need to \nfix the AMT, but we also need fiscal responsibility, and we need \npolicies that will build economic security for all Americans, not just \nthose at the top who are already very secure economically.\n  Lower and middle-income families are getting squeezed from all sides, \nwith the costs of essentials like gas, health insurance, and education \ngoing\n\n[[Page S4432]]\n\nthrough the roof. And, as we have seen in Michigan, our Nation is \nhemorrhaging manufacturing jobs, and median family income is falling. \nWe need to be investing in our people and in our future, but this bill \nwould take a giant step backward. The tax cuts for the wealthy in this \nbill are totally out of whack with what America needs right now, and I \nwill vote against this irresponsible conference report.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, we have before us more of the same--tax \nreconciliation legislation that further undermines our underlying \nfiscal health while providing extraordinary, generous benefits for the \nvery wealthy but little relief for hard-working, hard-pressed, middle-\nclass Americans. As an editorial in today's New York Times says \npointedly, ``There's nothing in it for most Americans, and yet all \nAmericans will pay its cost. . . .''\n  The Republican conferees who produced this conference report made a \nseries of critical choices. Rather than providing tax relief for \nmillions of middle-class Americans, they have given most of the $70 \nbillion to the wealthy few.\n  Rather than extending critical tax provisions that expired at the end \nof last year--like the research and development tax credit, the college \ntuition deduction, and the credit for teachers who use their own money \nfor classroom expenses--they have extended tax cuts for the wealthy, \nwhich do not expire until 2009. Rather than finding ways to help \nAmericans address the tremendous prices at the gas pumps, they have \nallowed the big oil companies to continue enjoying their large tax \nbreaks and Government giveaways. Rather than charting a course to \nfiscal responsibility a change in direction long overdue they have \npresented us with a bill whose $70 billion in tax cuts will only add to \nthe already-massive Federal deficit, and whose budgetary gimmicks will \ncost the country billions of additional dollars in the years to come. \nAmong the most egregious of the gimmicks is the provision allowing \nwealthy taxpayers to contribute more to their Roth retirement accounts. \nWhile it provides revenue at this time to offset the costs of the \nbill's other tax cuts for the wealthy in the near term, it will cost \nbillions and billions of dollars in lost revenue in the future, and \nthis cost will be borne by future generations of working Americans.\n  An editorial in this morning's Washington Post sums up this \nlegislation succinctly: ``Budgetary dishonesty, distributional \nunfairness, fiscal irresponsibility,'' adding ``by now the words are so \nfamiliar, it can be hard to appreciate how damaging this fiscal course \nwill be.''\n  Again and again, the administration points to figures on the growth \nin the economy that mask the clear, deeply disturbing underlying trends \nthat show the income gap widening. Just the title of an article that \nappeared in the March 27th Wall Street Journal tells the story: ``Wages \nFail to Keep Pace With Productivity Increases, Aggravating Income \nInequality.''\n  Indeed, while the wealthy are getting richer, the incomes of the \nmiddle class and the poor have been steadily declining. There is an \nabundance of evidence on this point. As a New York Times editorial, \nentitled ``Barely Staying Afloat,'' noted yesterday, more than 37 \nmillion Americans now live below the poverty line, and an additional 54 \nmillion live between the poverty line and double the poverty line the \nso-called ``near poor.'' The Washington Post, in another editorial this \npast Sunday, reported that real income of families in the middle 20 \npercent has grown only 12 percent since 1980, while the incomes of \nthose in the top 10th have grown an astonishing 67 percent. Those who \nare fortunate enough to find themselves in the top 1 percent have seen \ntheir incomes more than double.\n  The bill before us reinforces this trend, delivering handsome \nbenefits to the very wealthy, while providing precious little for \nmiddle- and lower-class Americans. According to a report recently \nreleased by the joint Brookings-Urban Institute Tax Policy Center, \napproximately 87 percent of this bill's benefits will go to the 14 \npercent of households with incomes above $100,000, while 55 percent of \nthe benefits will go to the 3 percent of those with incomes over \n$200,000. While millionaires represent only two-tenths of 1 percent of \nour population, they will receive 22 percent of this bill's largesse. \nIn terms of real dollars, families in the middle 20 percent of income \nwill receive an average of only $20 in benefits from this bill. In \nstark contrast, those in the top 1 percent will receive an average of \n$13,800. Even more troubling, those with an income of over $1 million \nwill benefit by an average of $42,000. This means that millionaires \nwill receive on average 2,100 times as much from this bill as those in \nthe middle 20 percent of society.\n  Not only are these tax cuts skewed to the wealthiest among us, they \nfurther skew the fiscal dilemma that the Nation now confronts. When \nPresident Bush took office in 2001, the Federal budget was in surplus \nfor the third consecutive year. In 1998, the Federal Government had \nreported its first surplus in the budget since the 1960s, and surpluses \nof $5.6 trillion were projected over a period of 10 years. This very \nstrong fiscal situation put the Nation in a position to pay down the \nlarge national debt that had been accumulated as we moved through the \n1980s and into the 1990s. Instead President Bush squandered the \nprojected surpluses by instituting irresponsible and reckless tax cuts. \nWhen the history of this period is written, the fiscal policy of this \nadministration will be regarded as a gross irresponsibility.\n  When the President submitted his first budget proposal, he asserted: \n``We can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget deficits, even \nif the economy softens.'' The following year, 2002, with the budget \nalready in deficit, the President called for yet another tax cut, \npromising that ``our budget will run a deficit that will be small and \nshort term.'' In fact, the President's budget in that year confidently \nasserted that the deficits would be so short term that by this year \n2006 the budget would be back in surplus.\n  In fact, exactly the opposite has happened. Consistent with the \nirresponsible fiscal policy that this President has pursued, we have \nrun deficits each and every year since 2001. We went from a surplus of \n$128 billion in 2001 to a deficit $158 billion in 2002 a swing of $286 \nbillion. The deficit rose to $378 billion in 2003, rose again in 2004 \nto $413 billion, fell slightly in 2005 to $319 billion, and is now \nprojected to go back up again in 2006 to $371 billion. Far from being \nsmall and short term, these deficits are at record levels. Every year, \nthe goal of returning to fiscal balance recedes, as administration \npolicies drive us deeper into debt.\n  Much of this debt is held by foreign lenders, and that amount is \ngrowing all the time. At the end of fiscal year 2001, 31 percent of the \noutstanding Federal Government debt was held by foreign lenders. Over \nthe succeeding 4 years, borrowing from abroad accounted for more than \n80 percent of the increase in our Government debt. So as we have seen \nthe debt rise, the proportion of that debt held by foreign lenders has \nrisen at a much more rapid rate. As our borrowing abroad increases, a \nshift has also occurred from private to Government lenders.\n  If foreign lenders continue to buy 80 percent of new Federal debt, \nthe Federal Government will owe more than half of the debt to foreign \nlenders by 2011. In other words, as Blanche DuBois says in Tennessee \nWilliams' play ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' we will be dependent on \n``the kindness of strangers.\n  I opposed the President's tax plan as unfair and irresponsible at the \ntime the budget was in surplus, and I oppose the legislation before us \ntoday. It is unfair and it is irresponsible, and I urge my colleagues \nto vote against it.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the reconciliation \nbill that is before the Senate.\n  There are three reasons we should oppose the tax cuts that are \ncurrently before the Senate, as well as tax cuts that may come before \nthe Senate in the near future:\n  No. 1, we do not need these tax cuts; No. 2, we cannot afford these \ntax cuts; and\n  No. 3, we should be working on tax reform rather than enacting tax \ncuts in a piece-meal fashion.\n  Mr. President, we do not need these tax cuts now. In short, the \neconomy is already growing. The Nation's gross domestic product grew by \nover 4 percent in both 2003 and 2004 and 3.5 percent in 2005. In the \nfirst quarter of 2006, it was reported that the economy grew\n\n[[Page S4433]]\n\nat 4.8 percent. Additionally, unemployment has dropped from 6.6 percent \nto the current 4.7 percent.\n  The stock markets have regained their strength over time. In fact, \nproponents of tax cuts point to the stock market as an indicator of the \nNation's economic growth and have stated that if tax cuts are not made \npermanent, we threaten to send our stock market, and consequently the \neconomy, into a tailspin. The growth in the stock market may have \ncoincided with the enactment of certain tax cuts, but as the Wall \nStreet Journal reported, ``A group of Federal Reserve Board economists \nconcludes that the tax cut, which slashed the dividend-income tax on \nstocks to 15 percent from about 30-38 percent, was a dud when it came \nto boosting the stock market when it was announced and passed in \n2003.''\n  Moreover, I would argue there are other factors, arguably much larger \nin scope and importance, which played into the market's, as well as the \nNation's economic growth. A rational individual would conclude that the \nhistoric lows in interest rates played a large role not only in \nproviding cheap capital for business expansion but also to spur the \nhousing market. As former-Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan \nGreenspan indicated, there are factors outside the control of the \nFederal Government that have led to long-term growth, including the \nboon in productivity fueled by technology as well as the relative \nstrength of the world economy.\n  I do not doubt that tax cuts have some effect on the economy. In \nfact, some may point out that I supported two of the largest tax cuts \nto be enacted in American history, the tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. In \nboth of these instances I looked at the facts that were before me and \ncame to the conclusion that supporting these tax cuts was the right \npolicy decision. But they were the right policy decision for two \ndistinctly different reasons.\n  In 2001, our Nation was facing a starkly different fiscal picture \nthan what we have today. At that time, the 10-year surplus was \nestimated to be $5.6 trillion. There was a surplus on the table, and \nCongress was faced with two choices: spend the money or give it back to \nthe taxpayer. I chose to get that money off the table and out of \nWashington so it could not be spent, but I made this decision based on \nthe premise of using the surplus as a three-legged stool: providing tax \ncuts, paying down the debt, and controlling spending.\n  On June 7, 2001, the President signed the Economic Growth and Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act. I voted for this bill, which reduced the \nindividual income tax rates that apply to taxable income, increased the \nchild tax credit to $1,000 and extended it to smaller families, \naddressed the ``marriage penalty,'' phased out the Federal estate tax \nover the period 2002-2010, provided a temporary reduction in the \nalternative minimum tax, and provided some savings incentives and child \ncare credits.\n  In 2003, our Nation faced a very different scenario. The country was \nstill reeling from September 11, fighting the war against terror and \ntrying to rebound from corporate accounting scandals. We needed \nstimulative medicine to ensure that the economy did not sink further \ninto the doldrums. While I supported these tax cuts, I fought to ensure \nthat the amount was the right balance between needed stimulus and \ntaking the deficit into consideration. I joined Senators Olympia Snowe, \nJohn Breau, and Max Baucus to get the $350 billion that was eventually \nenacted.\n  On May 28, 2003, the President signed the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act into law. We accelerated the cuts from the 2001 tax \nbill such as the individual income tax cuts, the child tax credit and \nthe marriage penalty relief. We also extended the alternative minimum \ntax, AMT, again and reduce the rate on both dividends and capital gains \nto 15 percent for higher tax brackets and 5 percent for those in the \nlower tax brackets.\n  Mr. President, the world has changed again. Just as the decisions I \nmade in 2001 and 2003 were not made in a static environment, I now look \nat the economic outlook facing our Nation, as well as the ongoing needs \nI know this government will have to fund.\n  The second reason we should not move forward on tax cuts is that we \ncannot afford them. Our fiscal health is in dire straits. In the \nsimplest terms, the Federal Government continues to spend more than it \ntakes in. In case anyone has forgotten, the deficit for Fiscal Year \n2005 was $318 billion. This was the third highest deficit in our \nNation's history. The first and second largest deficits occurred Fiscal \nYear 2003 and Fiscal Year 2004.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1999, the national debt stood at $5.6 \ntrillion. The national debt now stands at $8.4 trillion, an increase of \nabout 50 percent. As a percentage of gross domestic product, GDP, our \nnational debt has grown from being 58 percent of GDP at the end of 2000 \nto an estimated 66.1 percent of GDP by the end of 2006.\n  In fact, the debt continues to grow so quickly that the House of \nRepresentative's Fiscal Year 2007 budget resolution is reported to \ncontain a provision that would raise the Federal debt ceiling to nearly \n$10 trillion. This is less than 2 months after Congress was forced to \nraise the debt ceiling from the previous ceiling.\n  According to the reports from Medicare and Social Security trustees, \nthe trust funds for these programs will be exhausted even earlier than \npreviously thought. According to the most recent trustees' report, the \ncost of Social Security and Medicare will grow from nearly 7.4 percent \nof the economy today to 12.7 percent by 2030, consuming approximately \nnot just 60 percent as predicted by the administration but 70 percent \nof all Federal revenues, crowding out all other discretionary spending \nand some other mandatory programs.\n  I am for entitlement reform. Senator Gregg took the first step last \nyear with the deficit reduction bill of 2005. I voted for that bill. We \nneed to do more to reform entitlements. No matter which way you look at \nit, entitlement programs coupled with an ever increasing national debt \nare staring down on our children and grandchildren.\n  Some Members believe that the solution is to grow the economy out of \nthe problem, that by cutting taxes permanently the economy will \neventually raise enough revenue to offset any current losses to the \nU.S. Treasury. I respectfully disagree with that assertion. I do not \nbelieve that in the current situation our country faces, we can \ncontinue to spend more than we take in.\n  In November 2005, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \ntestified before the Joint Economic Committee and told Congress:\n\n       We should not be cutting taxes by borrowing. We do not have \n     the capability of having both productive tax cuts, and large \n     expenditure increases, and presume that the deficit doesn't \n     matter.\n\n  That is exactly what we have been doing the last several years.\n  I have said many times on this floor that our major problem is we are \nunwilling to pay for or go without what we want to get done. We have \nbeen willing, time and time again, to put the cost of our current \nspending on the credit cards of our children and grandchildren. To be \ncandid and fair, we have had no choice in much of the spending since \nSeptember 11. The Federal Government had to rebuild after September 11. \nWe have made the decision to increase security for the homeland. We \nhave to fund the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. And we have to rebuild \nafter the devastation of dealing with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  What we should be doing is spending our time on tax reform. The Tax \nCode has nearly universal disapproval for its complexity and magnitude. \nAs the one who amended and pushed for the creation of the task force on \ntax reform in 2003 and 2004, I was delighted when the President said, \nin his 2004 convention acceptance speech, he would move forward with \ntax reform. We all know that fundamental tax reform is critical, and as \nwe consider these and future tax provisions, it becomes more and more \nclear we need to overhaul our tax code.\n  I simply cannot understand why some of my colleagues want to make so \nmany provisions of the current tax code permanent or add new tax cuts \nwhen we very well may be eliminating precisely the same provisions as \npart of fundamental tax reform. No homeowner would remodel their \nkitchen and bathroom right before tearing down the house to build a \nnewer and better one.\n  Frankly, one of the measures in the reconciliation bill I do have \nsympathy\n\n[[Page S4434]]\n\nfor and that is the patch for the AMT. Like the Sword of Damocles, it \nhangs over Congress's head nearly annually as it threatens to swallow \nmore middle-class taxpayers. We do need to fix the AMT. Unfortunately, \nevery year we move forward with a piece-meal tax policy, we delay \naction on permanently fixing the AMT, which will cost over $500 \nbillion. When will we wake up and face the music on AMT?\n  Additionally, simplifying the code to make it more fair and honest \ncould, by some estimates, save taxpayers over $265 billion in costs \nassociated with preparing their taxes. That would be a real tax \nreduction, and it would not cost the Treasury one darn dime. It would \nbe a tax cut that would guarantee that people are paying their fair \nshare and would bring more money into the Federal Treasury.\n  According to the Tax Foundation, we lose about 22 cents of every \ndollar of income tax collected in compliance costs. That amount adds up \nto the combined budgets of the Departments of Education, Homeland \nSecurity, Justice, Treasury, Labor, Transportation, Veterans Affairs, \nHealth and Human Services, and NASA.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is we do not need less revenue, we \nneed more revenue. As a recent Wall Street Journal article states, \n``federal taxes amounted to 17.5 percent of gross domestic product, up \nfrom a modern low of 16.3 percent in 2004, but well below the high of \nnearly 21 percent in 2000 . . . keeping the tax burden low will be \ndifficult. Last year, the federal government's spending exceeded its \ntax take by about $318 billion. And the retirement of the baby-boom \ngeneration starting in 2011 could cause spending on big-ticket federal \nretirement programs to jump.'' I could not have stated it better myself \nexcept I would utilize the on-budget deficit. In other words, if you \nexclude the Social Security surplus, money that I believe should be \nutilized for its intended purpose rather than funding the government, \nthe deficit was actually almost $492 billion. This number is even worse \nif we took the Department of Treasury's accrual number for FY2005, \nwhich was a deficit of $760 billion.\n  I know this is controversial to state, but if you look at the \nextraordinary and unexpected costs that we have with the war on terror, \nhomeland security costs, and rebuilding after Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita, the logical thing that one would think about is to ask for a \ntemporary tax increase to pay for them today. Instead, we are saying we \nwill let our children and grandchildren take care of these costs.\n  The people who are sacrificing today in this country are those who \nhave lost men and women in the war against terror. The people who have \nsacrificed today are the ones who have come back without their arms and \nlegs, thousands of them. They are making the sacrifice. The question I \nask is, what sacrifice are we making?\n  The simple fact is that we can not have it all--we need to set \npriorities and make hard choices--otherwise our children will end up \npaying for it. Anyone in the know who is watching us has got to wonder \nabout our character, our intellectual honesty, our concern about our \nnational security, our Nation's competitiveness in the global \nmarketplace now and in the future, and last but not least, our ``don't-\ngive-a-darn'' attitude about the standard of living and quality of life \nof our children and grandchildren.\n  The simple fact is we cannot have it all. We need to set priorities \nand make hard choices; otherwise, our children will end up paying for \nit.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wanted to talk briefly about the \ncurrent debate on S. 1955 and what is supposed to be Health Week in the \nSenate. It was my hope and the hope of many of my colleagues that this \nweek would bring about changes to improve health care for South \nDakotans and all Americans. This week should have provided an \nopportunity to debate many important and critical issues, but \nunfortunately the direction being taken is anything but productive and \nmeaningful.\n  A real Health Week would be about many things, including addressing \nproblems with the Medicare Part D Program. In recent months, I have \nheld several meetings in my home State with seniors, advocates, \npharmacists, and other health providers about the program. What I have \nheard over and over again is that the benefit is not only confusing for \nbeneficiaries but also often not adequately address prescription drug \ncosts. It has also been unrealistically demanding on pharmacists and \nother health care providers, literally threatening community \npharmacists' abilities to keep their doors open.\n  While the administration continues to tout their estimated number of \nbeneficiaries enrolled in Part D, the reality in small towns across \nSouth Dakota paints a very different picture. Supporters of the Part D \nProgram have marketed the low-income benefit as one of the most \nimportant and beneficial aspects of the program. While I did not \nsupport the bill that is now law because I believe its basic structure \nis flawed, I have always conceded that the low-income provisions will \nhelp those seniors in need, and we should be doing what we can to make \nsure seniors who are eligible are informed about their choices.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has done a poor job of ensuring \nthat those most likely to see a benefit from the program are actually \nenrolled. In my State, there are 29,000 beneficiaries eligible for the \nlow-income benefit, and according to a recent estimate by Families USA, \nonly 9 percent of individuals have been enrolled. These are everyday \nSouth Dakotans with limited resources and support and they need help.\n  Part of the problem is that the program is just too complicated and \nnot being administered effectively. Just last week, the Government \nAccountability Office released a report that indicated that when \nbeneficiaries contact the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services, \nonly 41 percent of questions are answered correctly regarding which \nplans are the least expensive and most appropriate for them. This is \nsimply unacceptable, and frankly all of my colleagues should be \noutraged by this statistic. This is a problem that must be addressed, \nand during this time of debate on health care, we should be working \ntoward enacting changes that will make things better.\n  Meanwhile, the clock keeps ticking toward the deadline for enrolling \nin the program. After May 15, only 5 days from now, seniors will suffer \na penalty for late enrollment. CMS cannot even answer questions \ncorrectly--questions that are essential in order to help seniors select \na drug plan that works for them, but the administration insists on \npenalizing seniors for delaying their decision regarding participation. \nAll this time, drug companies and insurance companies continue to see \nthe checks roll in. Negotiating lower drug prices under Medicare Part \nD, extending the enrollment for the program, and making the program be \nmore accountable to seniors--these are the things we should be dealing \nwith right now and what Health Week should be about.\n  Health Week should also be about passing embryonic stem cell research \nlegislation that will create a path toward cures for many diseases \nplaguing our society. It is hard to believe that on May 24, it will \nhave been 1 year since the House passed its bill, the Stem Cell \nResearch Enhancement Act of 2005 or H.R. 810.\n  I am strongly in favor allowing a closely monitored and controlled \nstem cell research effort to go forward using frozen fertilized embryos \nthat would otherwise be incinerated as medical waste, and I am a \ncosponsor of S. 471 which was introduced by Senator Specter and is \ncosponsored by 41 of my colleagues here in the Senate.\n  I believe these cells, which are created by the hundreds of thousands \nat fertility clinics, would be better used to advance medical research \nthat holds great promise for curing or preventing some of the world's \nworst diseases, as well as repairing spinal cord and other injuries. \nThis type of research is overwhelmingly supported by the American \npublic and by a broad range of health, science, and disease advocacy \ngroups.\n  I have met with and heard from hundreds if not thousands of South \nDakotans and their families, encouraging me to support vital, life-\ngiving research, including embryonic stem cell research, and I agree. \nMy values and my faith tell me to support lifesaving research which \nwill provide cures and therapies for devastating illnesses such as \ndiabetes and Parkinson's disease. The majority leader has indicated in \nthe past that he will allow an up-or-\n\n[[Page S4435]]\n\ndown vote on stem cell research on the Senate floor, and it is \nunfortunate that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not \npermit us to move forward, right now, on this issue.\n  A real Health Week would also be about promoting a health insurance \nproposal that does help small business, but does so in such a way that \nprotects consumers and does not infringe on State rights to regulate \nthe health insurance market. The Health Insurance Marketplace \nModernization Act or S. 1955 would make health care coverage more \naffordable in many cases but would do so at the expense of providing \nmeaningful coverage to consumers.\n  South Dakota has mandated that insurance companies that want to offer \nplans in the State must provide some basic services including diabetic \nsupplies and education, mammography screening, mental health parity, \nand prostate cancer screenings. My State also requires that insurers \nprovide access to certain types of providers including nurse midwives, \nnurse anesthetists, optometrists, osteopaths, chiropractors, \npodiatrists, psychologists, and social workers. S. 1955 will allow \ninsurers to come into South Dakota and provide bare bones coverage that \npreempts these State mandates. South Dakota deserves to determine what \nbasic care and coverage must be provided to our citizens, and S. 1955 \nwould take away that right.\n  To gain this exemption, all an insurer has to do is offer a plan that \nis similar to one offered to State employees in one of the five most \npopulous States. Now some have stated that the availability of this so \ncalled enhanced option will ensure access to services that States have \nmandated, but this is simply not true. The alternative plan does not \nhave to be affordable or comprehensive and could be a high-deductible \nhealth plan that provides virtually no preventive care. That means no \ndental screenings, no prostate cancer screening, no access to nurse \npractitioners.\n  The Small Employers Health Benefits Program or SEHBP Act provides a \nstrong alternative to the Enzi approach making coverage more affordable \nfor small businesses and providing individuals with the same type of \ninsurance offered to members of Congress and other Federal employees. \nThis proposal is based on the successful Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program which provides health coverage to millions of Federal \nemployees, retirees, and their families and does so with very low \nadministrative costs.\n  While this alternative does provide an opportunity for small \nbusinesses to obtain coverage for their employees, it does so without \njeopardizing the basic coverage currently ensured by South Dakota's \nhealth insurance laws.\n  It provides a tax credit to small businesses and ensures that State \nconsumer protection laws are kept in place. According to the most \nrecently available data from the Small Business Administration, in \nSouth Dakota 19,750 businesses fall in this category, employing 136,560 \npeople. The legislation also will provide for grant participation \nwaivers to businesses with more than 100 employees under some \ncircumstances.\n  The SEHBP approach is supported by groups such as Families USA, the \nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians, American Medical Association, \nConsumers Union, and the National Partnership of Women and Families.\n  We need to address the complex health care issues facing our Nation \ntoday, but we need to do so in a way that moves us forward. I believe, \nas do literally hundreds of organizations, including the AARP, American \nCancer Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, that S. 1955 is \nwrong for small businesses and their employees. I oppose this bill and \nwill continue to fight for adequate health care access in South Dakota.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the tax \nreconciliation conference report before us. We cannot afford it, and we \ndon't need it. Even more distressing, it benefits overwhelmingly those \nwith incomes greater than $1 million at the expense of middle-income \nfamilies, of our ability to protect and defend our Nation and of our \nfiscal bottom line.\n  We cannot afford adding $70 billion to the burgeoning deficit. Months \nago, my colleagues voted to cut programs such as Medicaid and child \nsupport--programs that directly serve low-income families and the \nelderly. They did this in the name of deficit reduction. Yet today, \nthose same Senators will vote to add $70 billion to the deficit.\n  We don't need the majority of this bill. The centerpiece of that $70 \nbillion is an extension of the tax breaks on capital gains and dividend \nincome. My colleagues have argued that this will prevent a tax \nincrease, but we all know such an increase is not imminent. The cut on \ncapital gains and dividends will not expire until 2008; this \nlegislation extends it from 2008 to 2010.\n  This legislation puts the needs of everyday Americans behind the \nluxury of an unnecessary tax break. Families making $50,000 a year or \nless will see an average of $20--half a tank of gas--in benefits from \nthis bill. But those with incomes of more than $1 million will get back \nan average of $42,000, enough to buy a new SUV.\n  The needs of everyday Americans are ignored by this legislation. \nBusinesses are ignored as the bill fails to extend the expired research \nand development tax credit. It overlooks the needs of students trying \nto pay for college by not extending the expired deduction for higher-\neducation tuition expenses. It ignores our teachers, by failing to \nextend the expired deduction for their classroom expenses.\n  Let's set aside extending tax cuts that don't expire for 2 years in \nfavor of extending those that expire now. Let's not go on a $70 billion \nspending spree in the face of record levels of Federal deficit and \ndebt. Let's not use our limited revenues to enrich those that need the \nleast at the expense of those who need the most. Finally, let's send a \nmessage to the American people about where our priorities lie.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if you want to know why this Republican-\ncontrolled Congress's approval rating has plunged to 22 percent and why \nPresident Bush's approval rating is an equally dismal 31 percent, \nexhibit A is this reckless, irresponsible tax reconciliation bill.\n  Let's consider the context in which the Republicans are pushing this \nlatest giveaway of $70 billion, all of which will be added to the \ndeficit and national debt:\n  The Republicans are ramming through these new tax breaks despite the \nfact that they we are facing a deficit, this year, in excess of $300 \nbillion a year despite the fact that they have run up $2 trillion in \nnew debt since President Bush took office, despite the fact that they \nare trying to raise the debt limit to an astonishing $10 trillion, \ndespite the fact that we are spending $10 billion a month on their \nendless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and despite the fact that they \nhave increased spending by 25 percent in just 5 years' time.\n  The level of irresponsibility here is just breathtaking. There is \nnothing conservative about handing out $2 trillion in tax breaks over 5 \nyears and passing the bill to our children and grandchildren. Rather \nthan providing for our children's education, health, and well-being, \nthis bill will provide them with another huge dose of our debt.\n  That is plain, old-fashioned recklessness and irresponsibility. It is \nsimply shameful.\n  In his State of the Union speech 3 years ago, President Bush made \nthis statement: We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass \nalong our problems to other Congresses, to other presidents, and other \ngenerations.\n  But that is exactly what this new tax-break bill will do. It will add \nto the $2 trillion in new debt that President Bush is passing on to \nother generations. It will deliberately create a fiscal time bomb set \nto detonate on January 1, 2011, which a future President and future \nCongress will somehow have to defuse. And it will result in higher \ninterest rates in the years ahead--indeed, interest rates are already \nrising rapidly.\n  This morning's New York Times runs two editorials that are dead on. \nOne editorial is titled, The Republican Agenda for 2006: Tax Cuts for a \nFavored Few. The second editorial is titled, The Republican Agenda for \n2006: Tax Increases for Everyone Else.\n  This bill is one of the most cynical giveaways to the wealthy we have \nseen. If this bill were entirely in effect this year, taxpayers making \nmore than $1 million a year would be getting an average tax cut of more \nthan $40,000 this\n\n[[Page S4436]]\n\nyear, enough to buy a new Mercedes. Taxpayers with middle incomes will \nget an average tax cut that may pay for a tank of gas or tow, for many \nit will be less than that.\n  According to the Brookings Tax Policy Center, assuming that all of \nmajor tax provisions were put into place this year, taxpayers making \nmore than $200,000 a year will get seven-eights of the benefits in this \nreconciliation bill. Taxpayers in the lower 60 percent of the income \nscale--average working Americans--will get only 1 percent of the \nbenefits in this bill--1 percent. This is simply outrageous.\n  But the cynicism does not stop there. The Republican tax conferees \nglued this package together with the worst kind of gimmickry. In order \nto stuff more tax breaks into this bill, they deliberately designed it \nin such a way as keep the revenues just within the $70 billion limit \nover 5 years. But they did it in a way that will drain countless \nbillions of dollars from the Treasury in the decades beyond the budget \nwindow.\n  How did they do this? They put in provisions to encourage the wealthy \nto convert their 401(k) plans and regular IRAs into Roth IRAs, which, \nitself, will be a bonanza for the rich. As one newspaper put it, this \nmorning:\n\n       This is what passes for fairness in Washington these days: \n     a big windfall for the wealthy to ``pay for'' another tax cut \n     for the wealthy.\n\n  The core of this bill is an extension of the 15 percent tax on \ncapital gains from 2008 to 2010. To make this possible, the tax-writers \njettisoned two very useful provisions that help ordinary Americans. \nThey did not extend the work opportunity tax credit, which creates \nincentives to provide job training for the more difficult to employ in \nour society, and they did not extend the research and development tax \ncredit, which promotes improvements in our efficiency and the \ndevelopment of new products. Those provisions have already expired.\n  Because this bill costs more than the $70 billion allowed, offsets \nwere needed. Did the tax writers cut the billions in excessive tax \nbreaks going to the oil companies--provisions such as the last in first \nout rule on their overseas operations? Even the oil company executives \nhave said they don't need this. After all, Exxon made $36 billion last \nyear. Exxon payed its CEO more than $140,000 a day. But the tax-writers \ndidn't touch this tax break for the oil companies which had been in the \nSenate bill.\n  Republicans claim that their endless tax cuts have created a strong \neconomy, and that the tax cuts will almost pay for themselves by \ncreating new revenue. This is the old supply-side economic theory--you \nknow, the idea that the best way to feed the sparrows is to give an \nextra big bag of oats to the horse. The first President Bush got it \nright; he called it ``voodoo economics.''\n  The truth is that current economic growth and job creation during \nthis recovery are well below normal, and they are well below the levels \nwe saw when President Clinton was doing what was necessary to balance \nthe budget.\n  Let's look at this economy. Business investment always recovers after \na recession. But, by historical standards, we have seen a sluggish \nrecovery in business investment. In the past 5 years, business \ninvestment has grown 65 percent more slowly than the average for all \nrecoveries since World War II. In the early 1990s, George H.W. Bush and \nBill Clinton signed significant tax increases into law in order to \nbalance the budget. But business investment was far greater during that \nperiod.\n  In addition, job creation during this recovery has been anemic, at \nbest. Last Friday, the administration ballyhooed the fact that 138,000 \njobs were created in April. The cheerleaders didn't mention that \n138,000 new jobs is not even enough to keep pace with population \ngrowth. And it is less than half of the job creation we experienced, \nmonth after month, under President Clinton. Remember, he dared to raise \ntaxes on the wealthy in order to balance the budget, and the resulting \neconomic boom created more millionaires than any recovery in history.\n  When President Bush passed his third round of tax breaks in 2003, he \nclaimed that it would create 5.5 million new jobs by the end of 2004. \nThat was when Congress cut the tax rate on dividends and capital gains, \nwhich the current bill would extend. That bill did not create the \npromised 5.5 million new jobs. Job growth was only 2.4 million, less \nthen the norm without tax cuts. Over the past 19 quarters since the \nrecession, the growth in employment has been consistently below normal. \nMeanwhile, incomes of workers have not kept up with inflation.\n  We have seen the same disappointing results in terms of gross \ndomestic product. Since the end of the last recession, GDP growth has \nbeen less then the average GDP growth following recessions since World \nWar II.\n  And what about the Republicans' argument that tax cuts largely pay \nfor themselves? Are they kidding? They have passed $2 trillion in tax \ncuts over the last 5 years. And, over that same period of time, the \nnational debt has increased by--you guessed it--$2 trillion.\n  Yes, we are seeing an increase in revenues at the moment, as one \nwould expect during a recovery. But our revenue estimates are actually \nbelow the levels predicted by the Congressional Budget Office in early \n2003, before we passed the capital gains and dividend tax breaks we are \nrushing to extend today.\n  And let me make one more point about these tax breaks on capital \ngains and dividends. Over and over again, our friends on the other side \nof the aisle claim that middle-income families are big beneficiaries of \nthese breaks. Yes, but the typical middle-income taxpayer gains a $20 \ncut here and a $100 cut there. But the lion's share of the benefits go \nto you know who. Half of the benefits go to those making more than \n$200,000 a year. When we just look at the cut in the capital gains and \ndividends rate: over half of those benefits go to those making over a \nmillion a year and over 93 percent of those benefits go to those making \nover $100,000 a year, according to a table just released by the Joint \nTax Committee.\n  This reconciliation bill gives $70 billion that we do not have, \noverwhelmingly to people who don't need it; and it passes the resulting \ndebt to people who haven't even been born yet. This bill is reckless. \nIt is irresponsible. And it is shameful.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this conference report so we can \nsubstitute a responsible bill--a bill that is progressively paid for, \nthat prevents the alternative minimum tax from penalizing middle-income \ntaxpayers, and that extends job training and the R tax credit.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today we are debating a $70 billion tax \nreconciliation bill and the centerpiece of this bill is a provision to \nextend the lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends that do not \nexpire until the end of 2008. I cannot support this bill for many \nreasons. It abuses the budget reconciliation process in order to \nprovide an extension of tax cuts to those with incomes above a million \ndollars rather than addressing tax issues in a fiscally responsible \nmanner.\n  This bill is the third and final piece of a flawed budget strategy \nthat does not put us on a path towards deficit reduction. The first \npiece was the spending bill that cut $40 billion, with most of those \ncuts hitting those who need our help the most. The second piece was a \n$781-billion increase in the debt ceiling, which will bring the total \nto $3 trillion under this administration's watch. If you combine these \nthree bills, the result is a $30 billion increase in the deficit and \nrecord level debt.\n  The conference report does not reflect the tax bill passed by the \nSenate. Back in November during the Senate Finance markup, I did not \nsupport the bill even though it did not include capital gains and \ndividends tax relief. I was concerned that the bill would come back \nfrom the House with this tax relief and that it would substantially \nincrease the deficit in future years. The conference agreement does \nwhat I expected and it is even worse than I initially imagined.\n  The only reason this bill is before us is to extend the lower rate on \ncapital gains and dividends. These lower rates do not even expire until \nthe end of 2008. We have repeatedly heard how American families have \nbenefited from this tax cut and that half of American households now \nhave some investment income. We do not hear the entire side of the \nstory. Even though about half of American households own stock, two-\nfifths of this stock is held in retirement accounts in which capital \ngains\n\n[[Page S4437]]\n\nand dividends earned are not subject to taxation, and thus do not \nbenefit from the lower rates on capital gains. According to the Federal \nReserve Bank's Survey of Consumer Finance, only 17 percent of the \nhouseholds in the bottom 60 percent own stock and the average value is \n$52,000. This accounts for 9 percent of all taxable stock. Households \nin the top 1 percent own 29 percent of all taxable stock and 84 percent \nof these households own taxable stock with an average value of nearly \n$2 million.\n  These tax cuts are skewed towards the wealthy because they have more \ncapital gains and dividends income than the average family. For those \nwith incomes under $100,000, capital gains and dividend income accounts \nfor 1.4 percent of their total income, but for those with incomes over \n$1 million, capital gains and dividends account for 31.4 percent of \ntheir income. According to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, those \nwith income over $1 million will receive an average tax cut of $32,000 \nin 2009, whereas those with incomes below $50,000 will only receive an \naverage tax cut of $11.\n  Not only will upper-income individuals benefit from this provision, \nthey will benefit from a new provision that was added during the \nconference. This provision removes the income limits for converting \nfrom traditional individual retirement accounts--IRAs--to a Roth IRA. \nThis provision was added to meet requirements of the budget rules, but \ndon't be fooled, this provision is a gimmick. It is ironic that this \ngimmick is being used to solve a budget issue--it is being added to \nsolve the budget issue of the capital gains and dividend provision \nhaving a $30 billion cost in the second 5 years of the bill. The Roth \nIRA provision does solve this budget problem, but this provision will \nadd to the deficit. It raises revenue initially because contributions \nto Roth IRAs are not deductible, but it loses revenue because earnings \nin these accounts accumulate tax free.\n  Only households with income over $100,000 would benefit from the \neasing the restrictions on rollovers to Roth IRA accounts. The Tax \nPolicy Center estimates that the 99.1 percent of the benefits of this \nprovision will go to those in the top 20 percent of households with \naverage incomes of $189,863. I have to admit that it is clever to \noffset one tax cut with another tax cut that only benefits families in \nthe upper-income limits. This provision highlights how this bill makes \na hypocrisy of the budget process.\n  As I said before, there are several budget gimmicks used in this bill \nto mask its real price tag of the bill and its total impact on the \ndeficit. All this is being done just so the lower rates on the capital \ngains and dividends can be extended for another two years.\n  Many of those in the majority will argue that the lower rates on \ncapital gains and dividends are needed to sustain economic growth. It \nis hard to prove that these tax cuts are the cause of recent economic \ngrowth. Prior to the enactment of these tax cuts, there were \nsignificant factors in support of an economic recovery. The President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisors was predicting a significant increase in \nemployment growth starting in 2003 without the enactment of additional \ntax cuts. The rationale for cutting the tax on capital gains and \ndividends income is that it stimulates investment, but there is no \nsolid data to support this conclusion. The stock market did much better \nduring the 1990s when we had a higher tax rate on capital gains than it \nhas done since the rates were cut in 2003.\n  Proponents argue that these cuts encourage a great deal of selling by \ninvestors, so much so that they pay for themselves. However, in a \nletter to Finance Committee Chairman Grassley, the Congressional Budget \nOffice found that, ``[I]ncreases might suggest a large behavioral \nresponse to the tax rate cut--except that realizations also increased \nby 45 percent in 1996, before the rate cut. Thus changes in \nrealizations are not necessarily the result of changes in taxes; other \nfactors matter as well.'' CBO explained that asset values, investor \ndecisions, and other economic conditions can influence capital gains \nrealizations just as much.\n  CBO not only examined the year following the 2003 tax cuts, but they \ndug even deeper and did a historical analysis of capital gains cuts. \nThe CBO experts found that, ``[a]fter examining the historical record, \nincluding that for 2004, we cannot conclude that the unexplained \nincrease [in realizations] is attributable to the change in the capital \ngains tax rates.'' CBO concluded that much of the volatility in capital \ngains realizations ``seems unrelated to changes in the capital gains \ntax rates.''\n  However, the majority seems to think that the cutting taxes on \ncapital gains and dividends is a priority and that debt financed tax \ncuts reflects sound economic policy. I disagree and believe that this \nbill chooses the wrong priorities. It fails to extend tax breaks that \nexpired at the end of 2005. The research and development tax credit \nthat is used to help businesses with innovative and groundbreaking \nresearch expired at the end of 2005.\n  This bill does not help families with the cost of college tuition. \nDue to the deepest cuts in student aid in more than a decade, loans \nwill increase by an average of $5,800. At the end of 2005, a tax \nprovision that provides a deduction for college expenses expired. This \nbill chooses not to extend this tax cut.\n  This bill does address the individual alternative minimum tax--AMT--\nfor 2006, but not for 2007. The conference report reflects the Senate \nlanguage that is based on an amendment that I offered with Senator \nWyden. This AMT provision will prevent any new taxpayers from being \nimpacted by the AMT in 2006 that were not impacted by the AMT in 2005. \nIt is important that we address the individual AMT, and it can be done \nin a way that does not increase the deficit.\n  The individual AMT was created in 1969 to address the 155 individual \ntaxpayers with incomes exceeding $200,000 who paid no federal income \ntax in 1966. Then, it applied to a tiny minority of households. But it \nis rapidly growing from 155 taxpayers in 1969, to 1 million in 1999 to \nalmost 29 million by 2010. It now affects families with incomes well \nbelow $200,000. By the end of the decade, repealing the AMT will cost \nmore than repealing the regular income tax.\n  In 1998, we began to notice that something was happening that was \nunintended--the AMT was beginning to encroach on middle class \ntaxpayers. At that time, the AMT was expected to impact over 17 million \ntaxpayers in 2010. The AMT problem resulted because the regular tax \nsystem is indexed for inflation, while the personal exemptions, \nstandard, deduction, and AMT are not. Under the AMT, exemption amounts \nand the tax brackets remain constant. This has the perverse consequence \nof punishing taxpayers for the mere fact that their incomes rose due to \ninflation. The AMT has another perverse consequence. It punishes \nfamilies for having children. The more children a family has, the lower \nthe income necessary to trigger the AMT.\n  As we debated the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act \nof 2001, I stressed the fact that the legislation would result in more \nindividuals being impacted by the AMT and that not addressing the AMT \nhid the real cost of the tax cuts. This holds true today. A choice was \nmade in 2001 to provide more tax cuts to those with incomes of over a \nmillion dollars rather than addressing a looming tax problem for the \nmiddle class. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n2001 did include a small adjustment to the AMT, but it was not enough. \nWe knew at the time that the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT \nwould continue to rise steadily. The combination of lower tax cuts and \na minor adjustment to the AMT would cause the AMT to explode.\n  Each year that we wait to tackle the AMT, more taxpayers are impacted \nand the cost of addressing it only increases. We missed an opportunity \nin 2001 to address the AMT. Repeatedly, the AMT has been pushed aside \nto give priority to making the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans \npermanent. So often we hear that the bulk of the tax cuts assist the \naverage American family. This is ironic because by 2010, the AMT will \ntake back 21.5 percent of the promised tax breaks for individuals \nmaking between $75,000 and $100,000 per year and 47 percent from \nindividuals making between $100,000 and $200,000. However, households \nwith annual income over $1,000,000 will only lose 9.2 percent of the \ntax cuts.\n  Instead of addressing the AMT for next year, this bill chooses to \nextend the lower rates for capital gains and\n\n[[Page S4438]]\n\ndividends for 2009 and 2010. This bill ignores the fact that we will \nhave to address the AMT for 2007. Without Congressional action, the AMT \nwill impact 23 million taxpayers. To prevent additional taxpayers from \nbeing impacted by the AMT in 2007, the exemption amount will need to be \nincreased at a cost of $48.3 billion. We need to address the AMT in a \nfiscally responsible manner before we extend tax breaks that do not \nexpire until the end of 2008.\n  Furthermore, this bill chooses to provide tax breaks to the oil and \ngas industry. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 contained $2.6 billion over \n10 years in tax breaks for oil and gas companies. Recently, President \nBush said:\n\n       Record oil prices and large cash flows also mean that \n     Congress has got to understand that these energy companies \n     don't need unnecessary tax breaks like the write-offs of \n     certain geological and geophysical expenditures, or the use \n     of taxpayers' money to subsidize energy companies' research \n     into deep water drilling. I'm looking forward to Congress to \n     take about $2 billion of these tax breaks out of the budget \n     over a 10-year period of time. Cash flows are up. Taxpayers \n     don't need to be paying for certain of these expenses on \n     behalf of the energy companies.\n\n  Not long ago, we heard the top oil executives testify before Congress \nthat they do not need the tax breaks either.\n  At a time when the world's largest energy companies are reaping \nrecord-setting profits, this bill chooses to only scale back one of the \nnew tax breaks for oil companies. Integrated oil companies will still \nreceive benefit of a provision to expense their geological and \ngeophysical expenditures. The provision only scales the tax break back \nby $189 million. The Senate bill included three provisions that address \nthe tax breaks of large oil and gas companies, totaling $5 billion. \nThis bill chooses not to include these provisions. Recently, I \nintroduced legislation to address tax breaks provided to the oil and \ngas companies that would repeal over $28 billion in tax breaks for this \nindustry.\n  It is embarrassing that this bill keeps in place tax breaks that are \nnot needed by this industry while at the same time providing lavish \nbenefits to oil and gas executives. An executive who makes $400 million \na year does not need tax breaks. Executives rewarded with exorbitant \namounts of stock options will be able to sell their stock and benefit \nfrom the lower tax rate on capital gains. It simply does not makes \nsense to provide a $42,000 tax break for millionaires when the average \nAmerican family has seen a $1,950 increase in their cost of gas.\n  During this debate, we have heard that this bill does not provide tax \ncuts, that it is just a continuation of tax policy, but it is a \ncontinuation of a reckless tax policy. According to the Tax Policy \nCenter, 87 percent of the benefits of the conference agreement go to \nthe 14 percent of households with incomes above $100,000. The top 0.2 \npercent of households, those earning over a million a year would \nreceive 22 percent of the benefits of this conference report. Those \nearning over $1 million will receive a $42,000 a year tax cut while the \naverage tax cut for the 20 percent of households in the middle of the \nincome spectrum would be just $20.\n  We should not continue a tax policy that helps those who do not need \nour help. While American families are struggling with the costs of \nhealth insurance, college education, and gas tax prices, it is not the \ntime to extend tax cuts that only help a small percentage of elite \ntaxpayers. Last quarter, the economy grew 4.8 percent, but wages only \ngrew 0.7 percent. Middle-class families are not feeling confident about \nthe economy. These families are not experiencing the 4.8 percent growth \nof the economy. They are worried about their economic future. They are \nliving paycheck to paycheck. With the continuing cost of the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan, it is not the time to extend debt financed tax \ncuts. We could have a very different bill before us that would extend \nthe tax cuts that help families with the cost of the education, address \nthe AMT for next year, and help businesses with the cost of research. \nInstead, we have a continuation of a tax policy that contributed to the \nbroadening disparity between the rich and the poor.\n  We are going through this process today, just so one provision in the \nbill can be passed--the extension of the dividends and capital gains \ncuts. These cuts expire at the end of 2008.\n  We do not need to make a farce out of the reconciliation process. We \ncan do better and we should reject this bill and take up a bipartisan \nbill that helps all American families.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this tax \nreconciliation conference report. It is a financially bizarre \nhodgepodge of misplaced priorities, missed opportunities and misguided \neconomics.\n  Not only is there nothing in this package that helps average American \nfamilies, whose incomes are stagnant, the Republican majority let \nprograms expire that helped ease the financial burdens of working \nfamilies.\n  Instead, this Republican bill showers tax breaks on the Nation's \nwealthiest, who don't need the help, the oil industry, which is \nenjoying record profits, and explodes the debt, placing a hidden tax on \nour children and grandchildren.\n  This bill is so bad you look at it and wonder: What were they \nthinking?\n  For instance, under this tax package the oil industry gets tax breaks \nworth $5.1 billion, while eliminating tax incentives on hybrid cars, \nsolar energy panels and other energy conservation measures that would \nhelp lessen our dependence on foreign oil.\n  What were they thinking?\n  The capital gains and dividend tax cut extensions overwhelmingly \nfavor households taking in more than $1 million a year. Middle income \nhouseholds get a tax savings of about $20 a year, while millionaires \nget a break of somewhere between $42,000 and $82,000.\n  What were they thinking?\n  I have supported capital gains relief as a way to stimulate \ninvestment, innovation and job creation. But this bill offers that \nrelief at a time when we're running a massive Federal deficit and does \nnext to nothing for anybody other than the wealthiest taxpayers.\n  Look at what's missing from this bill: The State and local sales tax \ndeduction, the college tuition deduction, the welfare to work tax \ncredit that encouraged employers to lower welfare roles by creating \njobs; and the research and development tax credit that helped spur the \ninnovation we need to compete in the global economy.\n  What were they thinking?\n  This bill does provide a one-year fix to keep middle-income Americans \nfrom falling into the alternative minimum tax trap. But even that is \nnot enough. We need to fix the AMT Problem once and for all.\n  A famed economic thinker named Marx--Groucho not Karl--once said: \n``Money frees you from doing things you dislike. Since I dislike doing \nnearly everything, money is handy.''\n  Groucho may have summed up the Republican approach to fiscal policy: \nThey avoid doing the things they dislike--like facing hard financial \ntruths and making tough fiscal decisions--and just keep showering money \nwe don't have on wealthy people and oil companies who don't need it and \nthen pass the bill off to our children who can't afford it.\n  At least Groucho was joking about how he spent his own money. We're \nstealing our children's. And that's no joke.\n  Mr. President, we must come to grips with the exploding deficits. We \ncan't keep cutting taxes, increasing spending and pretend there are no \nconsequences. There are. And it will be our children who will face the \nreckoning. And on that day they will look back at us in anger and cry: \nWhat were they thinking!\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to enter into the Record some \ninformation I just received from the Joint Committee on Taxation. I \nasked them to provide me with information on who benefits from the \ncapital gains and dividends tax cuts.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 84 percent of the \ncapital gains tax cut goes to individuals earning $200,000 or more. And \nalso according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 2 percent goes to \nhouseholds earning less than $50,000.\n  Additionally, for the dividends tax cut, 63 percent of the tax \nsavings goes to individuals with annual income of $200,000 or more. And \nonly 6 percent goes to taxpayers earning $50,000 and under.\n  I hope this information will help clarify some of the debate on the \nfloor today. Again, these numbers are directly from the Joint Committee \non Taxation with no interpretation.\n\n[[Page S4439]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this information be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                TABULATION OF CAPITAL GAINS TAXED AT 5% AND 15% RATES, ALL TAXPAYERS--CALENDAR YEAR 2005\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         Capital gains taxed at 5% rate        Capital gains taxed at 15% rate      Total: Capital gains taxed at 5% or\n                                    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------                15% rate\n                                       Returns      Amounts    Tax savings    Returns      Amounts    Tax savings --------------------------------------\n     Adjusted gross income \\1\\      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Returns      Amounts    Tax savings\n                                                                                                                  --------------------------------------\n                                       Millions    $ billions   $ billions    Millions    $ billions   $ billions    Millions    $ billions   $ billions\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLess than $10,000..................

Mr. President, I want to talk now about the rules of the \nSenate. With this bill, the majority has once again abused the process. \nWith this bill, the majority has once again shown its disrespect for \nthe rule of law.\n  Mr. President, I have served in the Congress for 32 years. I have \nserved in the Senate for 28 years. I am continually grateful to my \nemployers, the people of the State of Montana, for giving me this \nopportunity.\n  I was in the Congress in 1975, when the Budget Committee reported the \nvery first budget resolution. I was in the Senate in the early 1980s, \nwhen the Budget Committee reported its first budget reconciliation \nbill. I have seen this process change. And the Majority is changing \nthis process again today.\n  Mr. President, this bill comes before us today under the \nextraordinary procedures that we call budget reconciliation. This is a \nprocess that bypasses the normal Senate rules.\n  Under the normal Senate rules, Senators may debate legislation at \nlength. Under budget reconciliation, this bill is subject to a strict \ntime limit.\n  Under the normal Senate rules, and rule XXII, it takes the \naffirmative vote of 60 Senators to cut off debate. Under budget \nreconciliation, a simple majority will determine the outcome of this \nbill.\n  The Senate chose early on to limit the power to use budget \nreconciliation. The Senate saw early on that this power could be \nsubject to abuse.\n  Thus, starting in 1985, the Senate adopted the Byrd Rule against \nextraneous matter in reconciliation bills. This important rule was \nnamed after the dean of the Senate, the Senior Senator from West \nVirginia. The Senate enacted this rule to ensure that the majority did \nnot abuse the budget reconciliation process to cover extraneous \nmatters.\n  From 1985 through 1996, that meant that budget reconciliation bills \ncould not worsen the deficit. Then, in 1996, the current majority chose \nto overturn that understanding of the rule. And in 1996, the current \nmajority began the process of using reconciliation for legislation that \nworsens the Nation's fiscal balance. That choice is at the root of much \nof the fiscal debacle that we see today.\n\n  But at least one vital part of the Byrd rule remains. One part of the \nByrd rule so explicitly prohibits worsening the deficit that the \nmajority has not yet been able to write it out of the books. One part \ncontinues to prohibit including in reconciliation provisions that would \ncause a committee's entire work product to worsen the deficit in years \nbeyond those covered by the reconciliation instructions. That part is \nsection 313(b)(1)(E) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  I believe that, today, the majority is taking another step down the \nroad of abusing the reconciliation process. I believe that today the \nmajority is willfully ignoring the application of that rule. And I thus \nbelieve that today the majority is once again cheapening the rule of \nlaw.\n  My complaint lies with the Roth IRA provision that I discussed \nearlier. As I noted, that provision will worsen the deficit by \nincreasing amounts into the future. But because the majority chooses \nnot to recognize this fact, I am left with no procedural recourse.\n  I'll try to demonstrate my point through a series of steps.\n  First, let me take the hypothetical case of a budget reconciliation \nbill that contained just the Roth IRA provisions in this bill but \neffective in 2006. That is the case for which the Joint Tax Committee \nhas provided the revenue estimates that I discussed earlier. For the \nsake of simplicity, I ask unanimous consent that the Joint Tax \nCommittee estimates be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 2006.\n\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     To: Pat Heck, Judy Miller, and Ryan Abraham\n     From: Thomas A. Barthold\n     Subject: Revenue Estimate\n       This memorandum is in response to your request dated May 3, \n     2006, for a revenue estimate of your proposal to eliminate \n     the income limitation on conversions from a traditional to a \n     Roth IRA. Under your proposal,\n\n[[Page S4440]]\n\n     any amount otherwise required to be includible in income as a \n     result of a conversion that occurs in 2006 may be included in \n     income in equal installments in 2007 and 2008. Your proposal \n     would be effective for taxable years beginning after December \n     31, 2005.\n       We estimate that your proposal would have the following \n     effect on Federal fiscal year budget receipts:\n\n                                                                      FISCAL YEARS\n                                                                  [Billions of dollars]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Item                          2006    2007    2008    2009    2010    2011    2012    2013    2014    2015    2006-10    2006-15\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEliminate the income limitation on Roth IRA           -0.1     1.8     3.4     1.0    -1.1    -1.5    -1.7    -1.9    -2.1    -2.3        5.0       -4.5\n conversions; taxpayers can elect to have amounts\n converted in 2006 included in income in equal\n installments in 2007 and 2008....................\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In summary, it shows a provision that begins with revenue \nincreases but then shows revenue losses. Specifically, it shows revenue \nlosses of $1.1 billion in year 5, $1.5 billion in year 6, $1.7 billion \nin year 7, $1.9 billion in year 8, $2.1 billion in year 9, and $2.3 \nbillion in year 10.\n  Now, if this provision were the only provision in a budget \nreconciliation bill covering years 2006 through 2010, it would plainly \nviolate section 313(b)(1)(E) of the Congressional Budget Act because of \nits revenue losses in the out years.\n  This is of course a simplistic analysis. There are other provisions \nin the bill before us. The question then arises whether those other \nprovisions raise more revenue than the Roth IRA provision loses.\n  My Finance Committee staff have taken the Joint Tax Committee \nestimates for these other provisions--all the revenue raisers--and \nprojected their current rate of growth into the future. The results are \nshown in another table, which I ask unanimous consent be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 PROJECT REVENUE EFFECTS OF THE TAX RECONCILIATION BILL\n                                                  [Estimates by the Finance Committee Democratic Staff]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                      Projections\n              Raiser #                  2011       2012       2013       2014        2015    -----------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                 2016        2017        2018        2019        2020\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1.................................         31         33         35         38          41          44          47          50          53          56\n 2.................................          3          3          3          3           3           3           3           3           3           3\n 3.................................         10          3          4          6           6           6           6           6           6           6\n 4.................................          3          3          3          3           3           3           3           3           3           3\n 5.................................         12         12         15         15          16          17          18          19          20          21\n 6.................................         44         46         49         52          54          56          58          60          62          64\n 7.................................        209        224        241        259         279         299         319         339         359         379\n 8.................................        204        242        260        298         349         400         451         502         553         604\n 9.................................      6,079        215        220        228         235         242         249         256         263         270\n10.................................      2,541      4,929      1,756     (1,080)     (1,267)     (1,500)     (1,700)     (1,900)     (2,100)     (2,300)\n11.................................         18          9          5          2           1   ..........  ..........  ..........  ..........  ..........\n12.................................         24         26         28         29          31          33          35          37          39          41\n13.................................        228        234        239        254         268         282         296         310         324         338\n14.................................         46         53         62         69          75          81          87          93          99         105\n                                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total........................      9,452      6,032      2,920        176          94         (34)       (128)       (222)       (316)       (410)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This analysis shows that the provisions of this bill will \nworsen the deficit by $34 million in 2016, $128 million in 2017, $222 \nmillion in 2018, $316 million in 2019, and $410 million in 2020.\n  Now, if the appropriate authorities advised the Chair that the bill \nbefore us had the revenue effects described in this table, and the Roth \nIRA provisions caused the deficit to worsen in these by years by the \namounts that I have cited, even when taken together with all the other \nprovisions in this bill, once again, the Roth IRA provision would \nviolate the Byrd rule.\n  Thus, if one does some rather simple arithmetic, one can readily see \nthat the Roth IRA provisions in this bill would worsen the deficit in \nthe out years. And doing that rather simple arithmetic would render the \nRoth IRA provisions out of order.\n  The problem is that my staff's estimates, and even the estimates of \nthe Joint Tax Committee and the Congressional Budget Office, are not \nauthoritative. Under the Budget Act, the Chair is required to turn to \nthe Budget Committee for revenue estimates.\n  The problem is, for whatever reason, the Budget Committee majority \nhas chosen not to do this rather simple arithmetic. The Budget \nCommittee majority has chosen not to see the fiscal consequences of \nthis bill.\n  It is not as though these fiscal consequences are somehow obscure. It \nshould come as little surprise that one tax cut will not pay for \nanother tax cut. But the Budget Committee majority chooses not to see.\n  It is not as though the Budget Committee cannot look into the future. \nThe Budget Committee majority has complained of out year costs \ninvolving spending to help the victims of asbestos, for example. \nBut when it comes to these tax cuts, the Budget Committee majority \nchooses not to see.\n\n  It is not as though the Budget Committee cannot recognize a budget \ngimmick when it sees one. The Budget Committee majority has complained \nof shifts from one year to another in the highway bill, for example. \nThe Roth IRA provision before us today is the mother of all such \nshifts. But the Budget Committee majority chooses simply not to see.\n  Thus, Mr. President, I see this case as another abuse of the process. \nI see this case as another instance of disregard for the rules of the \nSenate. I see this case as another case of disrespect for the rule of \nlaw.\n  In 1996, this majority abused the reconciliation process by applying \nit to legislation to worsen the deficit. Last year, this majority \nabused the Senate rules by threatening to eliminate the right to \nextended debate through what folks call ``the nuclear option.'' And \ntoday, this majority adds another chapter to that history of abuse of \npower, by simply choosing not to see violations of the rule when they \nare there staring us all in the face.\n  I find it curious that the same majority that cried so loudly about \n``the rule of law'' in the impeachment of President Clinton today once \nagain shows such little respect for the rule of law right here in the \nSenate. For this disrespect for the rule of law is not about private \nmorality. This disrespect for the rule of law is about the exercise of \npower.\n  There is a word for disrespect for the rule of law in the exercise of \npower. It is called tyranny.\n  And that, Mr. President, is another reason to vote against this \nconference report.\n  Mr. President, I must say that I was surprised to see such a \ncomplicated and controversial provision in the conference agreement. I \nam referring to the provision to repeal the grandfather clause that was \nenacted by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, as part of the \nrepeal of the old FSC/ETI regime. Further, this provision was not in \nthe Senate or the House bill.\n  What is most surprising, though, is that it may not have been \nnecessary in addition to maybe not being prudent.\n  This provision purports to end a dispute with the European Union over \nthese long standing tax incentives. But the EU said it was willing to \naccept the remaining time on the 2-year transition period, and the \ngrandfathering of leasing contracts. The only provision\n\n[[Page S4441]]\n\nthat the European Union is totally against is the grandfather clause \nfor sales contracts. The European Union stated as much in a letter just \nlast week where they said they wanted to work out a negotiated \nsettlement.\n  So the question has to be asked: Why does this bill go beyond the \nEuropean Union's concessions? In an attempt to increase the revenue \nraised by this bill, the bill eliminates binding contract relief for \nboth lease and sales contracts.\n  In every step of the way during the last 7 years of this dispute, \nCongress has worked closely amongst tax and trade experts and alongside \nbusiness to minimize the harm any new regime might entail. But not \nhere. No hearings, no deliberations, ignoring a concession by the other \nside and game over.\n  It is interesting to reflect on the long history of this provision. \nBoth the extraterritorial income and the Foreign Sales Corporation, or \nFSC, regimes offered exclusions for export income. The Jobs Act \nrepealed the extraterritorial income exclusion provisions and provided \ntransition rules to phase out the tax benefits. The Jobs Act also \nprovided a grandfather clause which allowed certain contracts to \ncontinue to receive the extraterritorial income exclusion.\n  For the past two decades, the U.S. provided export-related tax \nbenefits under the foreign sales corporation regime. In early 2000, the \nWorld Trade Organization found that the regime was a prohibited export \nsubsidy under the relevant WTO agreements. Congress then repealed the \nforeign sales corporation provisions and enacted a new regime, the \nextraterritorial income regime, or ETI.\n  From its inception, the European Union has doubted the validity of \nthis regime. The European Union lodged a complaint with the World Trade \nOrganization. It argued that the provision was an export subsidy in \nviolation of World Trade Organization agreements.\n  The World Trade Organization agreed with the European Union in August \nof 2001. An appellate body upheld the finding in January 2002. The \nWorld Trade Organization later ruled that the European Union could \nimpose $4.03 billion in sanctions on its imports from the United \nStates. Congress immediately began work to fix the problem. There were \nseveral hearings that lead to a number of bills attempting to either \nrepeal or modify the exclusion provisions.\n  The Jobs Act repealed the extraterritorial income regime for \ntransactions after December 31, 2004. It provided a transition rule \nthat phased out the tax benefits over a 2-year period. Taxpayers could \nretain 100 percent of their exclusion benefits for transactions prior \nto 2005, 80 percent for transactions during 2005, and 60 percent for \ntransactions during 2006. For transactions after 2006, a taxpayer would \nnot have any income exclusion benefits.\n  The Jobs Act also provided that a contract in effect prior to \nSeptember 17, 2003, would still be awarded exclusion benefits for the \nduration of the contract. This is what we call the binding contract \nrelief. The purpose behind transition rules was to provide a soft \nlanding to corporations. To give corporations time to adjust to the \nchange in tax policy.\n  Prior to September 17, 2003, companies relied on the extraterritorial \nincome tax benefits when they entered contracts. The binding contract \nrelief protected U.S. companies where the company might otherwise be \nsubstantially harmed by the loss of the tax benefit. Eliminating the \ngrandfather clause eliminates certainty for these U.S. companies.\n  We shouldn't blindly accept a provision that was not part of the \nSenate nor the House bill. We shouldn't blindly accept a provision that \nrepeals a provision that took years to develop. We shouldn't blindly \naccept a provision that goes beyond what is required. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote down this bill.\n  Mr. President, we have had a very interesting debate today. As I \nexpected, it was a real battle of statistics and charts.\n  Again, I would like to thank my good friend, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee. I know that Senator Grassley fought hard to defend \nthe Senate position in the conference committee. And I think the vote \nin favor might have been overwhelming if he had been successful in \nbringing back that Senate bill rather than the bill we have today.\n  But I look forward to working with him and battling side-by-side to \ndeliver that promised second bill. And that brings me back to what I \nspoke of this morning: there is a substantial amount of work undone.\n  Despite $70 billion spent on tax cuts today, there are millions of \nteachers, families with kids in college, businesses that want to \nconduct important research or hire the hard-to-employ that will not see \none dollar of the benefits handed out today.\n  It is true that this conference report made tough choices. Those \nchoices were tough on teachers, tough on families, tough on businesses. \nHopefully, their relief boat will be coming soon.\n  Until then, though, I will be voting against this bill that made the \nwrong choices--putting 2009 tax cuts before 2006 tax cuts, and putting \nideological wants before America's needs.\n  I hope that the next bill will be a bipartisan product. I am sure if \nit is, that it will enjoy broad support in this Senate and across the \ncountry. I look forward to working on that bill.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank the individuals who \nworked so hard on this legislation.\n  First, I thank my good friend Senator Grassley, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, for his leadership on this bill. I also appreciate \nthe hard work and cooperation of his staff, especially Kolan Davis, \nMark Prater, Dean Zerbe, Elizabeth Paris, Christy Mistr, John O'Neill, \nChris Javens, Cathy Barre, Anne Freeman, Grant Menke, and Nick Wyatt.\n  Second, I thank the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation and \nSenate legislative counsel for their service.\n  Finally, I thank my staff for their tireless effort and dedication, \nincluding Russ Sullivan, Bill Dauster, Pat Heck, Melissa Mueller, \nJonathan Selib, Judy Miller, Rebecca Baxter, Ryan Abraham, Carol \nGuthrie, and Brianne Rogers.\n  I also thank our dedicated fellows, Mary Baker, Stuart Sirkin, Thomas \nLouthan, Tiffany Smith, Laura Kellams, Caroline Ulbrich, Margaret \nHathaway, and Robin Burgess. I also thank our law clerk, Christal \nEdwards.\n  I thank our hardworking interns Zachary Henderson, Lesley Meeker, \nLauren Shields, Britt Sandler, Jordan Murray, and Andreas Datsopoulos.\n\n\n                            Wage Limitation\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy \nwith the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nGrassley, regarding changes to the section 199 wage limitation. The \nconference report attempts to better target the application of the wage \nlimitation by counting only those wages that are ``properly allocable \nto domestic production gross receipts.''\n  This change may have unintended consequences for certain industries. \nIn some industries, many workers, particularly those with specialized \nexpertise, provide services as independent contractors or through their \nown businesses. In such cases, service payments to these workers are \nnot treated as wages under the current wage limitation.\n  When section 199 was first created, some of the impacted industries \nrequested that we adopt a rule to count these payments for services in \ndetermining the wage limitation. The request was dropped because we \naddressed their issue indirectly by allowing them to use a broader wage \nbase for calculating the limitation. By eliminating this ``headroom,'' \nwe are resurrecting a problem for these industries.\n  These industries are doing exactly what section 199 was meant to \nencourage. They are creating high-quality manufacturing and production \njobs and contributing substantially to our Nation's economy and trade. \nI am hopeful that we will reexamine this issue and take the steps \nnecessary to ensure that these industries are not adversely and unduly \naffected.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I appreciate my distinguished colleague from Montana, \nSenator Baucus, raising this concern. I can assure him that the changes \nmade to the section 199 wage limitation were intended to target the \nincentive to domestic production activities. If these changes unduly \nharm the types of industries he has raised in a way that is \ninconsistent with this intent, I would be happy to consider revisiting \nthis issue in future legislation.\n\n[[Page S4442]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee for this clarification and his willingness to work with me to \naddress this important problem.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering H.R. 4297, \nthe tax reconciliation conference report. This bill contains several \nimportant tax relief provisions, including relief from the alternative \nminimum tax, extended expensing provisions for small businesses, and a \n2-year extension of the 15 percent tax rate on dividends and capital \ngains. I will be voting for this bill in order to block tax increases \nthat would be harmful to our economy and to our citizens.\n  According to the latest data that I have seen, more than 100 million \nAmerican taxpayers benefit from the various tax reductions that we have \npassed since 2001. In Maine, 100,000 taxpayers have benefited from the \nlower capital gains and dividends tax rate, and about 25,500 Maine \ntaxpayers have benefited from AMT relief.\n  The 5-year cost of this reconciliation package is just under $70 \nbillion. Of this amount, nearly half--$33.4 billion will go to provide \nan additional year of relief from the alternative minimum tax. The AMT \nwas originally enacted to ensure that all taxpayers, especially high-\nincome taxpayers, paid at least a minimum amount of Federal taxes. But \nthe AMT is not indexed for inflation, and because of this flaw, each \nyear a larger number of middle-income Americans find themselves subject \nto this ``stealth tax.'' In fact, without the relief provided in this \nbill, the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT will increase to 20 \nmillion in 2006, up from just 3 million in 2004.\n  I believe it is essential to protect middle-income families from the \nAMT ``stealth tax.'' I also believe that the 15 percent capital gains \nand dividends tax rates have proven their effectiveness and ought to be \nextended.\n  When I voted to support lower capital gains and dividends taxes in \n2003, my hope was that this tax policy would help lift our economy out \nof recession and restore the healthy growth we need to create good jobs \nand opportunity for Americans. Since that tax relief became law, our \neconomy has grown at nearly 4 percent per year, and over 5 million new \njobs have been created. The unemployment rate has dropped to 4.7 \npercent--beneath the average of the past three decades.\n  I am aware of the ongoing debate among economists over whether, and \nto what extent, tax cuts can ``pay for themselves.'' Whatever one \nthinks of that debate, I cannot help but note how far off the estimated \ncost of this tax relief was. The year before this tax relief became \nlaw, the Federal Government received $49 billion in revenues through \nthe capital gains tax--at the 20 percent rate. The Joint Tax Committee \npredicted that reducing the rate to 15 percent would reduce revenues by \n$3 billion from 2003 to 2005. But, in fact, capital gains tax revenues \njumped instead--to $71 billion in 2004, and $80 billion last year--all \npaid at the lower 15 percent rate.\n  To me, the vote on this bill is not about settling a debate among \neconomists. My focus is on finding the right tax policy to help keep \nour economy healthy, and growing. It is only with strong economic \ngrowth that our Nation will be able to meet the needs we currently \nface--needs that will only become more urgent as our society ages.\n  Many in this Chamber, and many of my constituents, are concerned \nabout our growing national debt. I share this concern. That is why I \nhave been a consistent supporter of the pay-go rules throughout my \ntenure in the Senate. But I continue to be struck by the difference \nthat even a small change in our economy's growth rate can make to the \ndeficit and to the revenues we need to support critical social \nprograms. According to the Congressional Budget Office, a change of \njust one tenth of 1 percent in the GDP growth rate over a 10-year \nperiod would change revenues by $224 billion and spending by $48 \nbillion, for a total net impact of $272 billion on the deficit.\n  The actual growth rate we have experienced since 2003 has been higher \nby at least two-tenths of 1 percent than CBO predicted before the 15 \npercent tax rate was enacted. In light of the fact that CBO estimates \nthat a 0.1 percent change can have a net impact of $272 billion on the \ndeficit, it is so important to maintain policies that maintain a \nhealthy growth rate.\n  For all of these reasons, I will be supporting the tax reconciliation \nbill.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as one of the three Senate conferees on this \nlegislation, I want to take a moment to explain why this legislation is \nso important to our Nation's continued economic growth.\n  The centerpiece of this conference agreement is the extension of the \n15 percent investment tax rate for 2 more years, through 2010. Under \nthis rate structure, lower income taxpayers will have dividends and \ncapital gains taxed at a 5-percent rate through 2007, and in 2008-2010 \nwill have them taxed at a zero rate. Taxpayers who fall above the 15-\npercent income tax bracket will have their dividends and capital gains \ntaxed at a 15-percent rate through 2010. As the lead sponsor of the \nRepublican leadership bill, S. 7, to make the lower investment rates \npermanent, I am pleased we were able to extend these rates to give \ninvestors certainty that they will not face a tax increase in the near \nterm.\n  The reason I have worked so hard to extend these lower rates is \nbecause the policy has worked exactly as we intended it when we enacted \nthe rates in 2003. In 2003, we suggested that by reducing the marginal \nrate imposed on investment earnings we would give investors an \nincentive to put more of their money at work in the markets. At that \ntime, following the tech-bubble bursting and the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, investors had been very reluctant to put their hard-\nearned money at risk in the markets. But by reducing the marginal tax \nrate on investment income, the tax penalty imposed on the additional \ninvestment earnings the reward for taking on additional risk is \nsmaller, and thus makes the risk more attractive. When investors get to \nkeep more of their reward, they are encouraged to invest more; with \nmore investment, businesses have an easier time attracting the capital \nthey need to expand, create new goods and services, and also create \nmore jobs. All of this additional economic activity creates economic \ngrowth.\n  Critics argue that most of the benefit of the lower rates flows to \nthe wealthiest taxpayers, but they fail to acknowledge that millions of \nlow- and middle-income taxpayers receive dividends and capital gains \nand will benefit from the lower rates. Research by the Joint Committee \non Taxation and the Finance Committee has found that lower income \ntaxpayers will save more than higher income taxpayers, when the savings \nare measured as a percentage of total tax liability, thanks to the \nlower rates, especially the 5 percent and zero rates. The savings are \neven more pronounced for seniors. In 2008-2010, seniors with adjusted \ngross incomes of $50,000 and under will see their tax liability reduced \nby 17.1 percent as a result of the lower tax rates for dividends. In \ncontrast, seniors with income over $200,000 will see their tax \nliability cut by only 5.7 percent. All taxpayers with incomes of \n$200,000 and up will see their tax liability reduced by just 2.2 \npercent as a result of the dividend tax rates.\n  The sheer numbers of taxpayers who benefit from these policies is \nequally impressive. More than 19 million taxpayers claimed dividend \nincome in 2003 and more than 7 million reported capital gains. More \nthan 315,000 Arizona taxpayers reported taxable dividends in 2003 and \nmore than 127,000 Arizona families reported capital gains in 2003. More \nthan 38 percent of Arizona tax filers who reported dividend income in \n2003 had incomes under $50,000; 73.1 percent had incomes under \n$100,000. Of those reporting capital gains, 35.1 percent had incomes \nunder $50,000 and 68.8 percent had incomes under $100,000.\n  In addition to benefiting millions of taxpayers, the lower rates have \nencouraged investment in our growing economy. The economy expanded at a \n4.8-percent annual rate in the first quarter of 2006. This follows \neconomic growth of 3.5 percent in 2005 the fastest rate of any major \nindustrialized nation. Moreover, the economy has created about 2 \nmillion jobs over the past 12 months and more than 5.2 million jobs \nsince August 2003. The unemployment rate is 4.7 percent--this is lower \nthan the average of the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.\n  Productivity increased at a strong annual rate of 3.2 percent in the \nfirst\n\n[[Page S4443]]\n\nquarter of 2006. Productivity is a key factor to increasing standards \nof living. Hourly compensation rose at a 5.7 percent rate in the first \nquarter--more than twice as much as in the previous quarter. The \nConference Board index of consumer confidence increased in April to its \nhighest level in almost 4 years. Industrial production rose at a 4.5-\npercent annual rate in the first quarter. The stock market hovers near \nits all-time high. Our economy is booming, and it is due in large part \nto the tax policies we enacted in 2003.\n  Another argument we hear about this bill is that we cannot afford it. \nI don't think we can afford to not pass this bill. The growing economy \nthat has resulted from these tax policies has led to a surge of revenue \nflowing into the Treasury. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, ``Monthly Budget Review'' released on May 4, 2006, ``the 2006 \ndeficit will be significantly less'' than was predicted, even assuming \nenactment of the supplemental and the tax reconciliation agreement. \nRevenues for April 2006 were 14 percent higher than revenues for April \n2005. Government estimators had predicted that the reduction in capital \ngains rates that was enacted in 2003 would cost the Federal Government \n$27 billion in lost revenues for 2004, but CBO now reports that the \nlower rates actually brought in an additional $26 billion in revenue. \nSo instead of costing $27 billion, the lower rates actually made $26 \nbillion for the Treasury.\n  I heard that this morning Ambassador Portman, in his nomination \nhearing to be the new Director of the Office of Management and Budget, \ntold the Budget Committee that revenues flowing into the Federal \nTreasury will reach their post-World War II average of about 18 percent \nof GDP as early as this year. That means Congress must make the 2001 \nand 2003 tax cuts permanent just to avoid taking historic amounts of \nrevenue out of the economy. Clearly, the American people are not \nundertaxed.\n  I want to mention briefly some of the other important provisions of \nthis reconciliation agreement. It extends the AMT ``patch'' through \n2006, thus keeping 15.3 million taxpaying families out of the \nalternative minimum tax. I am a cosponsor of Senator Baucus's \nlegislation to repeal the AMT, S. 1103, and, as chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight, I held a hearing last year \nthat looked into the burdens of the AMT.\n  I am proud that we were also able to address some problems in the \ninternational section of our Tax Code in this agreement. The conference \nagreement provides ``look through treatment'' for 3 years for certain \npayments between related controlled-foreign corporations. I am the \nsponsor of legislation, S. 750, to provide this treatment permanently. \nToday's economy is different from the environment that existed when our \nforeign tax rules were introduced in the 1960s. Enacting the ``CFC \nLook-Through'' provision will simplify business structures for U.S. \nmultinational companies and make it easier for them to compete with \nforeign companies.\n  The conference agreement also includes an extension of the ``active \nfinancing income'' exception, which I actively sought in the conference \nnegotiations. I am a cosponsor of legislation to make this exception \npermanent, S. 1159. Active financial services income banking income, \nleasing transactions and other financial transactions that is earned \noverseas has an exception under law that allows deferral until the \nfunds are repatriated to the U.S. parent, but it expires at the end of \n2006. The conference agreement extends the exception through 2008.\n  The conference agreement extends the current thresholds for small \nbusinesses to expense equipment purchases through 2009. Under current \nlaw the increased thresholds were due to expire after 2007. Expensing \nmakes it more cost-effective for small business owners to grow their \nbusinesses by purchasing new machines and other equipment; extending \nthe provision through 2009 enables businesses to better plan for such \ninvestments.\n  Finally, the conference agreement eliminates the income restrictions \non the ability of taxpayers to convert a regular IRA into a Roth IRA in \n2010. Under current law, families with incomes over $100,000 cannot \nconvert a regular IRA into a Roth. Allowing the conversion will help \nfamilies save for retirement because Roth IRAs are made up of aftertax \nmoney, and all appreciation in the accounts is withdrawn tax free. We \nought not double-tax savings, especially when we need to encourage \nyoung people to do more to plan for their own retirements.\n  I thank Chairman Grassley for being so supportive of my efforts to \nextend the investment tax rate for 2 more years and for all of his hard \nwork as chairman of this conference. Through his efforts we were able \nto put together a tax reconciliation agreement that prevents tax \nincreases on millions of Americans and that will keep our economy \ngrowing strong well into the future.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, pursuant to section 313(c) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I submit for the Record a list of \nmaterial in the conference agreement on H.R. 4297 considered to be \nextraneous under subsections (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), and (b)(1)(E) of \nsection 313. The inclusion or exclusion of material on the following \nlist does not constitute a determination of extraneousness by the \nPresiding Officer of the Senate.\n  To the best of my knowledge, H.R. 4297, the Tax Increase Prevention \nand Reconciliation Act of 2005, contains no material considered to be \nextraneous under subsections (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), and (b)(1)(E) of \nsection 313 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I had first like to thank Chairman Grassley \nfor all of his hard work and leadership on the tax reconciliation bill. \nHe represented the Senate well during sometimes difficult negotiations \non this bill. Because Chairman Grassley stuck to his principles, we \nhave a better bill today.\n  I am very pleased to vote today for the Tax Increase Prevention and \nReconciliation Act of 2005. Enactment of this bill is beneficial for \nall Americans. It will help America sustain its economic strength and \nallow all Americans to keep more of their hard earned money in their \nown wallets.\n  One of the key provisions of the tax reconciliation bill extends the \ntax cuts on dividends and capital gains through 2010. We've heard a lot \nof chatter in the media, and frankly from the other side of the aisle, \nthat the investment tax cuts only benefit the wealthy. However, that's \nsimply not the case. The investment tax cuts benefit all Americans--\neven those in the lowest income brackets.\n  Let's just look at the hard facts. Out of the nearly 20 million \nAmericans who reported taxable dividends in 2003, more than 36 percent \nmade less than $50,000--and more than 70 percent made less than \n$100,000. Similarly, of the 7 million who reported taxable capital \ngains, more than one-third were taxpayers with income of less than \n$50,000 and two-thirds were taxpayers with income of less than \n$100,000.\n  We find the same trends in my home State of Oregon. Over 60 percent \nof Oregon families claiming income from dividends made less than \n$75,000--and 20 percent made $30,000 or less. Middle income Oregonians \nalso benefit from the lower capital gains rate. Almost three-fourths of \nOregonians claiming capital gains income made less than $100,000--and a \nfourth had income under $30,000.\n  Beyond putting money back into Americans' wallets, the recent tax \ncuts, including the investment tax cuts, have played a major role in \nstrengthening our economy--and enactment of the tax reconciliation bill \nwill assist in continuing this growth. According to virtually every \neconomic indicator, the U.S. economy is thriving. Our economy grew at a \n4.8-percent rate in the first 3 months of 2006, the fastest pace in the \nlast three years. This follows economic growth of 3.5 percent in 2005, \nwhich was faster than any other major industrialized nation. In \naddition, we have an unemployment rate of 4.7 percent, which is below \nthe average rate for each of the past four decades.\n  The recent tax cuts also have helped strengthen Oregon's economy. \nAlthough our economy still lags behind the Nation, Oregon's \nunemployment rate has fallen to 5.5 percent from 6.2 percent 1 year \nago.\n  Another important component of this bill is the AMT relief. The \noriginal purpose of the AMT was to ensure that taxpayers with \nsubstantial income could not avoid tax liability by using\n\n[[Page S4444]]\n\nexclusions, deductions and credits. However, because the AMT was never \nindexed for inflation, an increasing number of middle-income families \nhave become subject to the tax. Thanks to this bill about 15 million \nmiddle-income Americans will not be subject to the AMT in 2006.\n  Finally, I am very pleased that two issues that I have worked on \nlegislatively were included in the tax reconciliation bill.\n  First, in line with my bill, the American Veterans Homeownership Act \nof 2005, Oregon's qualified veterans' mortgage bond program will be \nexpanded. Under current law, Oregon can issue tax-exempt bonds, the \nproceeds of which can be used to finance mortgage loans to veterans. \nHowever, due to current limitations, veterans of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, Kosovo, Bosnia, Haiti, Somalia and \nthe 1991 Persian Gulf War are not eligible. The tax reconciliation bill \neliminates this limitation allowing more veterans to take advantage of \nthese low-cost home loans.\n  In addition, the tax reconciliation bill extends for 2 years the \nincreased amount that small businesses may expense. Although this \nprovision doesn't go as far as my proposal in the Tax Depreciation, \nModernization, and Simplification Act of 2005, which would make small \nbusiness expensing permanent, it is a good first step. Small businesses \nare the heart of our economy. This important provision encourages \ninvestment by small businesses--and provides administrative \nsimplification.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I offer my support for the Tax Increase \nPrevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 conference report, which will \nprevent a tax increase on millions of Americans and keep our economy \ngrowing.\n  This bill could also be called the Job Creation and Economic Growth \nAct. In the nearly 3 years since we cut taxes on dividends and capital \ngains in 2003, the U.S. economy has experienced significant growth. \nWe've had 32 straight months of job growth. More than 5.3 million jobs \nhave been created since August 2003. The Nation's unemployment rate is \n4.7 percent--the lowest in nearly 5 years, and lower than the averages \nof the last four decades. More Americans are working today than ever \nbefore, and they have more opportunities for better jobs.\n  Business investment is up. The stock market is up. And construction \nspending, home building and household wealth levels are at all-time \nhighs. These factors illustrate families in Tennessee and across \nAmerica are benefiting from the progrowth tax policies initiated by the \nPresident and Congress.\n  This legislation will continue those pro-growth policies. It includes \nan extension of lower rates on dividends and capital gains. More than \n425,000 Tennesseans--including seniors and lower-income workers--will \nbenefit from these lower rates, with an average tax benefit of $989 per \nyear. More than one third of these Tennesseans are families earning \n$50,000 or less. I am glad the Senate is passing this bill to keep \ntheir taxes from going up.\n  The bill also include a one-year extension of a provision that will \nkeep the alternative minimum tax, AMT, from hitting nearly 150,000 \nTennesseans when they file their taxes for 2006. The AMT was originally \npassed to ensure that wealthy Americans paid their fair share of taxes. \nWithout a change in the law, the number of Americans subject to the AMT \nwould have jumped from 4 million in 2005 to 19 million in 2006, \neventually growing to nearly 52 million by 2015. So by including AMT \nrelief in this legislation, we've prevented millions of Americans from \nhaving to pay higher taxes.\n  This legislation also provides tax relief to our small business \nowners by allowing them to continue to expense certain amounts of \nequipment they purchase. This gives our small business owners greater \nflexibility to buy the necessary items they need to expand and improve \ntheir businesses--which is particularly important in Tennessee, where \n97 percent of all businesses are small businesses.\n  This legislation also includes a provision to help songwriters in \nNashville and throughout the country. Under current law, these \nsongwriters have to pay a tax rate of 35 percent for any sale of their \nmusic catalogues or collected works. The tax rate on these sales will \nnow be taxed at the capital gains rate of 15 percent. Now songwriters \nwho sell their work will be able to treat it the same as the sale of \nany other business. Many songwriters earn modest incomes, so this \nchange will make a big difference in their lives.\n  The way Congress can keep our economy strong is by keeping taxes low, \nexercising fiscal discipline and controlling the growth of Federal \nspending. This Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 \nis an important step in that direction, and I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on other measures to promote economic growth and \nfiscal responsibility.\n  Mr. REID. How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the headlines glared yesterday from Bloomberg News: \n``Republicans Set Aside Middle-Income Tax Cuts to Focus on the Rich.'' \nThose are not my words. They are the words of Bloomberg News. It is a \nheadline they chose to describe the Republican tax reconciliation bill, \nand it is 100 percent correct: ``Republicans Set Aside Middle-Income \nTax Cuts to Focus on the Rich.''\n  This bill is a big gift to the wealthiest of the wealthy and an even \nbigger burden to future generations of Americans. It was bad \nlegislation when it left the Senate, and it is a lot worse now that it \nhas returned. To think, with gas prices still on the rise--the average \nprice in Nevada is about $3.08 a gallon--46 million Americans with no \nhealth insurance, students literally worrying about whether their \nparents can afford to send them to college, with the debt at $8.2 \ntrillion, the majority has sent us a bill that does nothing to help any \nof the people about whom I spoke. In fact, for many Americans, it makes \nlife far worse by presenting them with a tax increase. The choices the \nRepublicans made in producing this legislation are very revealing. \nRemember the headline: ``Republicans Set Aside Middle-Income Tax Cuts \nto Focus on the Rich.''\n  Three bad choices were made in this bill. They chose millionaires and \nbillionaires over the middle class. For 5 years, the Republican \nmajority has handed out billions of dollars in tax breaks and perks to \nthe wealthy elite at the expense of everyone else.\n  This bill is no different. It extends $21 billion in tax breaks for \ncapital gains and dividends over the next 5 years, a tax break that \noverwhelmingly benefits the wealthy. It ignores provisions that could \nhave helped families in Nevada and all across the country today. For \nexample, the sales tax deduction, some States pay a lot of sales tax. \nThis was not extended, even though it provides tax fairness for \ntaxpayers in nonincome tax States. This provision, the sales tax \ndeduction, expired. Why would a State such as Nevada that has no income \ntax be penalized? Because the majority wanted the wealthiest of the \nwealthy to get a tax break.\n  The tuition deduction was not extended, even though it helps families \npay for the high cost of college and the provision expired at the end \nof last year. During the 5 years that George Bush has been President, \ncollege tuition costs have gone up over 30 percent.\n  Something simple, the teacher school supply deduction, not a lot of \nmoney but what a symbol. Teachers in Nevada and around the country pay \nout of their own pockets for supplies that the school district can't \nafford to give them. This little deduction helped thousands and \nthousands of teachers with a deduction for the school supplies they \npaid for themselves out of their own pockets. It is not in here because \nit may take a little bit away from the billionaires. Remember the \nheadline from Bloomberg News: ``Republicans Set Aside Middle-Income Tax \nCuts to Focus on the Rich.''\n  What is in this bill are tax breaks on capital gains and dividends. \nAn analysis in yesterday's New York Times shows how unfair these tax \ncuts are. According to the newspaper, the 2003 tax cut for those with \n$10 million or more of income was one half of $1 million--$500,000. For \nthose with a meager income of $1 million a year, the average tax cut \nwas $41,400. In contrast, the\n\n[[Page S4445]]\n\naverage capital gains and dividends tax cut for those whose income was \nup to $50,000 was $10. So if you make more than $10 million, you get \nhalf a million; $1 million, $40,000 plus; anything less than that, 10 \nbucks. That says it all about this tax reconciliation.\n  Choice No. 2: Republicans wrongly ignore America's fiscal security. I \nalways thought the Republicans were the party of fiscal integrity. That \nhas been blown sky high as being a false impression. On the same day a \nmonth or so ago, we passed a bill increasing the deficit by billions \nand billions of dollars, and on the same day, we increased the debt \nceiling up to $9 trillion. But that is not enough. We understand the \nHouse is bringing one over here that increases the debt ceiling to more \nthan $10 trillion.\n  Given all the rhetoric from the other side in recent weeks about the \nneed to get the Federal Government's fiscal house in order, you would \nthink our Republican friends would come forward with a fiscally \nresponsible bill. I heard one Republican Senator say: We had the budget \nbill and Democrats offered amendments to increase spending.\n  I will now use leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Any amendment we offered to increase spending, we had some \nunique thing in this modern Republican world. What was so unique? We \nhad an offset for it. We found savings someplace else in this massive \nbudget to pay for what we wanted. Remember, during the last 3 years \nBill Clinton was President, we spent less money than we brought in. We \nbrought down the national debt by a half a trillion dollars. But not \nthis Republican Congress and this Republican President. Now it is red \nink as far as one can see.\n  Instead of real fiscal discipline, all the majority has given us is \ngimmicks that actually make the problem worse. They purport to offset \nthe cost of the tax cuts for capital gains and dividends. But as \nreported in the Washington Post yesterday, these offsets are nothing \nbut cheap tricks.\n\n       One measure would allow upper income savers with a \n     traditional individual retirement account to pay taxes on the \n     account's investment gains and then roll over some of the \n     balance into a Roth IRA, where the money can be withdrawn \n     tax-free upon retirement. The provision would raise about \n     $6.4 billion over 10 years, seemingly keeping the size of the \n     tax-cutting package down. But over the next 35 years, it \n     would cost the [federal] government $36 billion, according to \n     the Urban Institute.\n\n  Think about that. A gimmick to let people think that this was a good \nthing for the American people because it was raising revenue. It was \nonly about $30 billion short. It is a shell game, and it is a wrong \nchoice for America.\n  Choice 3: This bill, if you can imagine, is still lavishing tax \nbreaks on the oil companies. As we speak, ExxonMobil--we know they made \n$34 billion, which is the most any company has ever made in history--as \nwe speak, ExxonMobil has $34 billion in cash. We are giving them more \ntax breaks? We have these oil companies, as my friend from Oregon said, \nwhich are marinating in oil. They cannot make enough money because \nthere is no way they can make enough. But they made $34 billion last \nyear, and that is the most money made in the history of our Republic.\n  On the other hand, we have middle-class families who have paid for \nthese profits and they are sick and tired of being squeezed at the gas \npump.\n  Who did the Bush Republicans choose? Big oil companies. Their big oil \nfriends. This is the most oil-friendly administration in the history of \nour country. President Bush had an oil company. Vice President Cheney \nworked for an oil company. The Secretary of State was on the board of \ndirectors of Chevron. They liked her so much they named a tanker after \nher. Secretary of Commerce Evans? Oil.\n  This reconciliation bill kept in place billions of giveaways for big \noil, even though the industry is doing well enough to send a CEO into \nretirement--and there is a dispute as to how much he made when he \nretired, whether it is $400 million or $670 million. It was a lot of \nmoney.\n  Once again, this is the wrong choice for America. I oppose this bill. \nIt caters to an elite group of wealthy Americans at the expense of the \nmiddle class, those with the greatest needs, and future generations. We \nneed a new direction. This legislation won't do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be brief, and we will be voting \nshortly. We know that keeping taxes low spurs economic growth and that \nresults in the creation of jobs. Twice in the last 4 years, this \nCongress passed major tax relief bills. Together these laws have cut \ntaxes for nearly 100 million Americans, spurred a period of energetic \neconomic growth, improved our overall budgetary climate, and it has \nencouraged businesses to invest in their future. When you put all that \ntogether, it has created jobs.\n  Indeed, since the 2003 tax relief progrowth package, our economy has \nadded 5.3 million new jobs. We have seen unemployment rates fall down \nto record lows, where today it is remarkable that it is lower than the \naverage of the 1970s and the 1980s and the average of the 1990s, at 4.7 \npercent. We have enjoyed 18 consecutive quarters of robust growth.\n  You know, those are the statistics, and that is what we see, what is \nreported. What really results is that individual lives and families are \nleading more productive lives, with a higher quality of life. The \ncreation of jobs affects families.\n  The centerpiece of that 2003 bill was the reduced tax rate on capital \ngains and dividends. It did other things, but that was the heart of the \nbill. As we argued then, and what history as clearly shown, is that \nkeeping taxes low promotes tax revenue, what comes into our Government.\n  In January, the Congressional Budget Office found that the tax cuts \non capital gains and dividends resulted in the Government collecting an \nadditional $26 billion in revenue in 2004 and 2005. This year, revenues \nwill be 29 percent higher than they were in 2003. In fact, the Treasury \nDepartment just reported yesterday that this year's tax revenues were \nthe second highest in American history, giving the country a sizable \nsurplus for the month.\n  Mr. President, we hear about who is advantaged by this particular \npiece of legislation. A majority of households now own stock. A lot of \npeople may question that. The matter is that the majority of households \nin this country own stock. Almost half of all income tax returns that \nreport capital gains on dividends--the returns that were reported--came \nfrom households that have an adjusted gross income of less than \n$50,000. Of all of the tax returns that report capital gains on \ndividends, over half of those are reported from households making less \nthan $50,000. It is hard to argue that cutting capital gains taxes \nbenefits only the rich.\n  Chairman Grassley, Senator Kyl, Congressman Thomas, and all who have \nparticipated in this bill, have delivered for the American people and \nhave participated in a progrowth policy legislative agenda that will \ncreate jobs. The provisions will continue to strengthen our economy, \nwhich is growing, and help provide a stable and inviting environment \nfor small businesses to continue to grow and invest and create jobs.\n  Keeping these taxes low helps Americans find and create those jobs \nthat we know improve the quality of life for all Americans. Keeping \ntaxes low helps Americans support families and makes America a great \nplace to do business. We will keep taxes low so that we can keep this \ngreat country of ours strong and growing.\n  Last night, the House voted to pass the tax reconciliation conference \nreport and send it to the Senate for action.\n  I want to applaud the House and Senate conferees for working hard to \nmaintain the 2003 tax cuts that have boosted the economy and grown \njobs.\n  Here on the Senate floor, the Republican majority will work hard to \nkeep up the momentum and resist efforts to raise America's taxes.\n  I expect that some on the other side will continue to oppose low \ntaxes. They've supported billions of dollars of new taxes since they \nlost control of the Senate in 2002. Rarely have they met a tax hike \nthey don't like. But we can't let their anti-growth plans win the day.\n  If they get their way, nearly 7.5 million families and individuals \nwill see their capital gains taxes go up. Twenty million will see taxes \non their stock dividends rise, as well.\n\n[[Page S4446]]\n\n  In my home State of Tennessee nearly 150,000 families and individuals \nwill see their taxes increase if the current alternative minimum tax \nrelief expires this year.\n  More than 425,000 families and individuals will see their dividend \ntax rates rise from as little as 0 percent to as much as 35 percent \nafter 2008. Of these taxpayers, roughly 135,000 low-income taxpayers, \nmany of them senior citizens, reported dividend income in 2003.\n  When it comes to capital gains, nearly 325,000 families and \nindividuals will see their capital-gains tax rates increase from as \nlittle as 0 percent to 20 percent after 2008. Of these taxpayers, more \nthan 100,000 low-income individuals, including retirees, reported \ncapital gains in 2003.\n  The other side says only the rich benefit from tax cuts. But as the \ntaxpayers in my home State demonstrate, the 2003 tax cuts benefited \nhard working families across the income scale.\n  Opposing the 2003 tax cuts will hurt these families and hurts \nAmerica's economic strength.\n  I urge the minority leader to reject obstructionism and allow swift \npassage of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield back all time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the conference report to accompany H.R. \n4297.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, too many in our country are uninsured or \nunable to afford health care. For those with coverage, costs continue \nto rise as insurance premiums and copayment increases make it more \ndifficult to continue to access health care. We must take steps to \nincrease health insurance coverage and expand access to affordable \nhealth care, but we must not do so in a manner which will undermine \nexisting coverage and leave consumers without adequate protections and \nbenefit mandates.\n  I appreciate the efforts of my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, \nto expand access to employees through his bill, S. 1955, the Health \nInsurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act. However, the \npreemption of State laws will have negative impacts on consumers. \nExisting State benefit requirements ensure consumers are protected \nagainst the cost of illness and provided coverage to preventive \nservices at earlier stages for the better likelihood of favorable \ntreatment. AARP, the American Diabetes Association, and the American \nCancer Society, a sample of the many health care related organizations \nopposed to the legislation, believe that the bill ``could remove \ncritical consumer protections pertaining to rating and benefits as well \nas reduce broad access to the services necessary to continue producing \nbetter outcomes for those with cancer, diabetes, and other chronic \nillnesses.''\n  Health care organizations are not alone in their opposition to this \nlegislation. Attorney generals across the country, including Attorney \nGeneral Mark Bennett in Hawaii, are opposed to S. 1955 because it would \ncause health insurance consumers to lose important state protections.\n  We must act to make health care more affordable. An alternative to S. \n1955 is S. 2510, the Small Employers Health Benefits Program Act. This \nlegislation would help improve access to insurance without bypassing \nState consumer protections. The legislation would also provide a tax \ncredit to make health coverage more affordable.\n  In addition, we need to enact reforms to ensure generic competition \nfor name brand prescription drugs. The legitimate patent protection \nperiod needs to be respected, but we need to make sure that generic \nprescription drugs get to market in a timely manner and that name brand \ndrug companies cannot simply pay generic drug companies to not make a \ndrug. Greater use of generic drugs will help slow the increase in \nhealth care costs without reducing access.\n  Unfortunately, the majority in the current Congress have made it more \ndifficult to access health care. For example, the Deficit Reduction Act \ncontained a provision which will require individuals applying or \nreapplying for Medicaid to verify their citizenship through additional \ndocumentation requirements. For most native-born citizens, these new \nrequirements will most likely mean that they will have to show a U.S. \npassport or birth certificate. These requirements will create barriers \nto health care, are unnecessary, and will be an administrative \nnightmare to implement.\n  One in 12 U.S. born adults, who earn incomes of less than $25,000, \nreport they do not have a U.S. passport or birth certificate in their \npossession. Also, more than 10 percent of U.S.-born parents, with \nincomes below $25,000, do not have a birth certificate or passport for \nat least one of their children. An estimated 3.2 to 4.6 million U.S.-\nborn citizens may have their Medicaid coverage threatened simply \nbecause they do not have a passport or birth certificate readily \navailable. Many others will also have difficulty in securing these \ndocuments, such as Native Americans born in home settings, Hurricane \nKatrina survivors, and homeless individuals.\n  Having to acquire a birth certificate or a passport before seeking \ntreatment will create an additional barrier to care. Some beneficiaries \nmay not be able to afford the financial cost or time investment \nassociated with obtaining a birth certificate or passport. The costs \nvary by State and can be as much as $23 to get a birth certificate or \n$97 for a passport. Taking the time and obtaining the necessary \ntransportation to acquire the birth certificate or a passport, \nparticularly in rural areas where public transportation may not exist, \ncreates a hardship for Medicaid beneficiaries.\n  Further compounding the hardship is the failure to provide an \nexemption from the new requirements for individuals suffering from \nmental or physical disabilities. Those suffering from diseases such as \nAlzheimer's may lose their Medicaid coverage because they may not have \nor be able to easily obtain a passport or birth certificate.\n  It is likely these documentation requirements will prevent \nbeneficiaries who are otherwise eligible for Medicaid to enroll in the \nprogram. This will result in more uninsured Americans, an increased \nburden on our health care providers, and the delay of treatment for \nneeded health care.\n  I have introduced legislation, S. 2305, to repeal the additional \ndocumentation requirements to ensure that Medicaid\n\n[[Page S4447]]\n\nbeneficiaries are not unfairly denied access to care by these \nburdensome and unneeded requirements. I had hoped that I would be able \nto offer my bill as an amendment to the pending legislation. However, \nthe majority has taken action that will prevent this from occurring on \nS. 1955.\n  We also need to improve and simplify the Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit so that all seniors are able to obtain all of the medications \nthat they need. We must correct the mistakes of the Medicare \nPrescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act and fulfill the \npromise to seniors that the Federal Government will help beneficiaries \nget the drugs they need. We also need to extend the deadline so that \nseniors are not unfairly penalized if they need more time to figure out \nwhich plan is right for them.\n  Another important Medicare issue are provider reimbursements. Rising \ncosts, difficulty in recruiting and retaining staff members, and \ndeclining reimbursement rates make it necessary to make improvements in \nMedicare reimbursements to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have \naccess to health care services. We must increase Medicare \nreimbursements for service providers so that they can continue to \nafford to treat Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Another issue that should be addressed during Health Care Week is \nstem cell legislation. I am a proud cosponsor of S. 471, introduced by \nSenators Specter and Harkin, which would authorize Federal funding for \nresearch on stem cells derived from embryos donated from in vitro \nfertilization. Unless this legislation is enacted, these embryos will \nlikely be destroyed if they are not donated for research. This bill \nalso would institute strong ethical guidelines for this research. The \nHouse companion measure is pending consideration in the Senate. We must \npass this bill so that researchers may move forward on ethical, \nfederally funded research projects that develop better treatments for \nthose suffering from diseases such as diabetes and Parkinson's.\n  Mr. President, I am afraid that this will be a Health Week only in \nterms of rhetoric because we are not able to offer amendments to \naddress the pressing health needs of this country. Instead of working \ntogether to find common solutions to better meet the health care needs \nof our country, the majority party has simply offered up legislation \nthat is flawed and refuses to work with us in a meaningful way on this \nissue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/11/senate-section/article/S4447-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4447-S4460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETPLACE MODERNIZATION AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF \n                             2006--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof S. 1955 which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1955) to amend title I of the Employee \n     Retirement Security Act of 1974 and the Public Health Service \n     Act to expand health care access and reduce costs through the \n     creation of small business health plans and of the health \n     insurance marketplace.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Frist amendment No. 3886 (to S. 1955 (committee substitute) \n     as modified), to establish the enactment date.\n       Frist amendment No. 3887 (to amendment No. 3886), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Motion to recommit the bill to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor and Pensions, with instructions to report \n     back forthwith, with Frist amendment No. 3888, in the nature \n     of a substitute.\n       Frist amendment No. 3889 (to the instructions of the motion \n     to recommit), to change the enactment date.\n       Frist amendment No. 3890 (to amendment No. 3889), to \n     provide for the enactment date.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 60 \nminutes of debate equally divided between the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. \nEnzi, and the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, or his designee.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have a lot going on on the floor, and we \nare going to have one more vote today, and it will be up to an hour \nfrom now. But what we would like to clarify is who needs to speak from \nour side. Chairman Enzi is right here. Do we have anybody on our side? \nI know Chairman Enzi will be speaking. Is there anybody else from our \nside?\n  I ask the Democratic leader through the Chair who will be speaking on \ntheir side.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the only request for time I have at the \npresent time is for the Senator from Arkansas, Senator Lincoln, for 7 \nminutes. Is there anyone who wishes to speak? Senator Kennedy wants 10 \nminutes. Senator Durbin may request time, I think 7 minutes for Senator \nDurbin. No for Senator Durbin. So 7 and 10, 17 minutes over here.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask our chairman approximately how much \ntime we would need. What we want to do is try to get the time down as \nfar as we can. We have a number of people who have plans that they need \nto make, and we would like to vote as quickly as we can, but we want \nadequate time to speak.\n  Mr. President, through the Chair, I ask the Democratic leader, would \nit be agreeable that we have a unanimous consent request propounded \nthat we vote at 10 minutes after 6, the time equally divided between \nnow and then?\n  Mr. REID. Does that give us our 17 minutes? I ask to amend the \nrequest to 17 minutes on each side.\n  Mr. FRIST. So to restate, I ask unanimous consent for 17 minutes on \neither side, so the vote will be at approximately 14 minutes after 6 \no'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I was so excited when we came to work \nthis week with the opportunity to focus our Nation and the debate of \nthis body toward health, the health of our Nation, the health of our \npeople, and the health of our businesses, the fabric of this country, \nthe fabric of our Nation. It is such an important thing for so many of \nus--certainly, each of us in our own families. I have small children \nand aging parents.\n  All of us have responsibilities in our own lives and responsibilities \nto our constituencies. We have different constituencies such as the \nelderly who live in our communities and the small businesses that are \nstriving hard to keep our economy going; children, and those with \nchronic diseases and illnesses who desperately need to make sure that \nthe coverage they have is sufficient for what they may have or may not \nhave, but want to make sure that they are protected against in case, \nunfortunately, something might happen.\n  So as we came to the Senate this week to talk about health and how we \ncould make health a very real part of the discussion in this Nation, a \nreal part of what it meant to our economy and to our people and the \nquality of life, the real value of who we are as Americans, I was \nexcited. Yet I saw so much of it cut short. The discussion that started \non Monday ended with a line in the sand that said: My way or the \nhighway, not let's work a deal and let's figure out what will make \nhealth care real in this Nation and sustainable and that will make \nsense in our communities. Then we moved to talking about how we deal \nwith small businesses. To me, the most important thing we can do for \nour small businesses is to make available to them affordable, \naccessible health care but quality health care, the same kind of \nbenefits that we ourselves as Members of Congress are blessed enough to \nbe able to experience for our families and for ourselves.\n  As we proceeded into this debate, way too much of the debate centered \naround not what we could work hard to do that was right but what people \nwanted. Then, all of a sudden, we leave abruptly this incredibly \nimportant debate.\n  We leave behind this incredibly important debate to talk about a tax \nbill for tax cuts that don't even expire until January of 2009, instead \nof looking at something real and new, such as a new tax cut for small \nbusinesses to engage in the health insurance marketplace for their \nemployees and for themselves or looking at how we could extend tax cuts \nthat had expired, such as research and development and for education \nand tuition and so many more things that have been productive in our \neconomy and in our communities. We go through this debate, and we come \nback now to finalize debate on the health care of our Nation. And what \nhave we done? We have missed an opportunity to say to our seniors they \nare important enough that we are going to extend a deadline, a deadline\n\n[[Page S4448]]\n\nthat means so much for them to be able to take the time and the \nopportunity to understand this new prescription drug component of \nMedicare that we have passed.\n  I voted for it, Mr. President, and I want it desperately to work. I \nhave been out in the field in Arkansas, and I have made sure I met with \nseniors. We have hosted meetings and tried to educate, but there simply \nhas not been time enough to get to the complexity of what is offered \nout there. We look back at what efforts have been made. The GAO has \nreported that one-third of seniors' calls to Medicare operators \nresulted in flawed or no information. Think about that for a moment. \nOne in three seniors who called CMS for help were given bad or no \ninformation. Now those seniors must make difficult, sound decisions \nabout their health care by Monday of next week. I wish we had been \ngiven the opportunity to make a difference in that.\n\n  I wish we had the ability to make the difference for small \nbusinesses, offering them again the same opportunity we have, to enjoy \nquality health insurance at a low cost, with many choices for the \nvariety of Federal employees who work in this great Nation. We can do \nthe same. We could allow employers and small businesses and self-\nemployed individuals--think about that, a one-man shop--to reap the \nbenefits of group purchasing power and streamlined administrative costs \nas well as access to more plan choices.\n  The proposal we had looked to present would create all of that, \nwithout any new bureaucracy. How about not reinventing the wheel? For \nonce, we in Government would use something that was time tested for 40 \nyears, has a 1-percent administrative cost, that we could implement for \nsmall businesses and bring to them again the same quality of product we \nenjoy as Members of Congress.\n  On top of that, we could have incentivized it and brought them a new \ntax cut, a new tax benefit in order to be able to invest in themselves \nand in their employees and provide the kind of health care they \ndeserve.\n  It is hard for me to believe that we have missed all of those \nopportunities: to be progressive, to be thoughtful, to invest in our \ncountry, to make sure we are taking care of the fabric of this Nation \nand who we are.\n  About 53 million Americans work for businesses with less than 100 \nemployees. That pool is bigger than the Medicare population, which is \nabout 42 million. Think of what we could do in offering those small \nbusinesses that type of a pool, to be able to bring down their costs, \nincrease their choices, and maintain the quality they have demanded, \nthe types of services they may need now or that they may need in the \nfuture, whether it is diabetes or cancer screening, making sure that \nimmunization and child well care are all in there. We had an \nopportunity to do this and many things and we have missed that \nopportunity.\n  Working families and small businesses need help. Our seniors need \nhelp. Our community providers need help.\n  Mr. President, I ask for an additional minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President. I encourage my colleagues to \nlook at the missed opportunities and pull together to make a difference \nfor the people of this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, as many of you are aware, I am \na former insurance commissioner from Nebraska. For several years, I \nserved as the head of the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners and spent most of my adult working life, except for \nGovernment service here and in the State house, in the insurance \nbusiness. I do not propose that I can propound I am an expert, but I do \nthink I have some experience in this field.\n  I know you have heard from small businesses in your States. The \naverage cost of health care premiums has doubled in 5 years for small \nbusinesses. Everywhere I have gone around the State of Nebraska, every \nsmall business owner I have spoken to has told me the same story: We \neither can't afford or we can't find health care coverage for our \nworkers. We are very concerned about that. What can you do to find a \nsolution?\n  They pushed me toward the House version of the associated health \nplans. I couldn't support that unregulated form of self-insurance for \nthe promoting of insurance on an association basis. I couldn't support \nit. There was no guaranteed fund protection, no requirement for the \nfiling of forms--nothing. I could not support it.\n  I also knew the status quo where there are now more mandated \ncoverages in several States than people can afford, so the status quo \ncontinues to add to the problem, creating more and more uninsureds. We \nnow have gone to the total of 40 to 45 million uninsured, and the \nnumber continues to grow.\n  I am pleased that the Senate is finally debating the problem. We all \nrecognize it is here and it needs to be solved. I agree with my \ncolleague from Arkansas that we need to spend time on this. We just \ndisagree on how to get there.\n  More time is important, but I can tell you right now that the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Enzi, has spent more time listening \nand listening and acting on suggestions than I have ever seen happen in \nthis body. We could probably spend more time, but I think that is what \nit is about, that is what a cloture vote is about, spending more time \nrather than cutting it off at this point in the discussion. I believe \nwe were starting to make progress in finding the solution when Senator \nEnzi and I and our staffs began to talk with one another about how we \nmight solve the problem of having an uninsured plan with an insured \nplan with regulatory oversight, but cutting out the unnecessary cost to \nreduce overhead expense, therefore reducing the cost of the premiums, \nmaking it more available and more affordable to the employees and to \nthe owners.\n  I didn't want to create an adverse playing field between association \nhealth care plans and the small group market. The traditional AHP bill \ngave a rating and mandate advantage to association plans that resulted \nin adverse selection and an unlevel playing field. The proposed SBHP \nlegislation has eliminated this unfair playing field by including rules \nto prevent these problematic practices and at the same time requiring \nall insuring entities to abide by the same regulations.\n  Therefore, there is more than a modicum of State regulation \nassociated with this plan--on a financial solvency basis, on a rating \nbasis, and fairness as to the practices that could be provided.\n  Unlike AHPs, SBHPs must be fully insured and marketed by State-\nlicensed insurance companies. The insuring entities must meet the \ncapital and solvency requirements within each State they operate, \ncomply with the consumer protection laws in each State, pay the \napplicable premium taxes, and be part of any assessments associated \nwith high risk pools and/or guarantee funds. As a former State \ninsurance commissioner, keeping State regulation involved in this \nprocess was important to me because I know the value of State insurance \nregulation.\n  Competition will return to the small group market when we move \nforward with this legislation. The market will expand. There will be \nmore opportunities today than ever before when this passes. The rates \nwill be in competition as well. Everybody will benefit.\n  There are those who have suggested that this is not in the best \ninterests of some special interest groups. Senator Enzi and I and our \nstaffs have met with these individuals and in some cases we have made \nthe changes that would take away the concerns they have, but they still \noppose the bill.\n  It seems to me what we need to do is refine this legislation after a \ncloture vote and listen to the proposals that will be brought up. If \nthere are better ideas out there, I know this body will find them. But \nto close it off at this point in time is to say no to small business. \nIt is to say we don't care enough to move forward, to consider other \nproposals, but we simply are going to close debate.\n  I hardly ever vote to avoid moving forward and I am not going to vote \nagainst it now. I am going to vote to go to cloture so we can get a \nchance, if we get 60 votes. I would hate to see us be four or five or \nsix votes short of that process because I think there is too much at \nstake for our small businesses, too much at stake for us not to be able\n\n[[Page S4449]]\n\nto find solutions. I am afraid if we don't move forward and debate it \nfully and see what we can do on the floor of the Senate, it will carry \nover into another year.\n  I have been here long enough to know when somebody says we will do it \nnext year, you can't always count on next year coming. I think it is \nimportant we move this forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senate has spent much of this week \ndebating S. 1955, the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and \nAffordability Act of 2006. I commend my good friend and colleague from \nWyoming for all of his hard work on this legislation, which is intended \nto make health insurance more affordable for small businesses by \nallowing them to join together to purchase association-based small \nbusiness health plans. Despite my support for the goal of this bill, I \nthink its approach is fundamentally flawed. Let me explain my concerns.\n  One of my top priorities in the Senate has been to expand access to \naffordable health care for all Americans. There are still far too many \nAmericans without health insurance or with woefully inadequate \ncoverage. As many as 46 million Americans are uninsured, and millions \nmore are underinsured.\n  Since most Americans get their health insurance through the \nworkplace, it is a common assumption that people without health \ninsurance are unemployed. The fact is, however, that as many as 83 \npercent of Americans who do not have health insurance are in a family \nwith a worker.\n  Uninsured working Americans are most often employees of small \nbusinesses. In fact, some 63 percent of uninsured workers either work \nfor a small firm or are self-employed. Taking a look at the problems \nfaced by small businesses is, therefore, a good place to start as we \nattempt to reduce the numbers of uninsured.\n  Small businesses want to provide quality health insurance for their \nemployees, but the cost is often just too high. So I am totally in \nagreement with the underlying goal of this legislation, which is to \nmake health insurance more affordable for small businesses and their \nemployees. To that end, I have introduced bipartisan legislation to \nhelp employers cope with rising costs by creating new tax credits for \nsmall businesses to make health insurance more affordable and by \nproviding grants to States to assist with the development and operation \nof small employer purchasing cooperatives to increase the clout of \nsmall businesses in their negotiations with insurers.\n  I do, however, have a number of very real concerns about S. 1955, as \nit was reported out of the Senate HELP Committee.\n  First, the legislation preempts the States' traditional authority to \nregulate insurance and allows not just small business health plans but \nall health insurers to exclude important benefits like cancer \nscreenings, mental health coverage, and diabetes care that currently \nare guaranteed under many State laws.\n  States have had the primary responsibility for the regulation of \nhealth insurance since the 1940s, and based on my experience in \noverseeing the Maine Bureau of Insurance for five years, I believe that \nStates have generally done a good job of responding to the needs and \nconcerns of their citizens.\n  As the founder and cochair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I also am \nall too aware of the tremendous emotional and economic toll that this \ndevastating disease takes on an estimated 21 million Americans and \ntheir families. I am particularly concerned that the bill would preempt \nas many as 46 State laws guaranteeing coverage for the medications, \nequipment, services, and supplies that people with diabetes need to \nmanage their disease and prevent costly and potentially deadly \ncomplications.\n  This simply is penny wise and pound foolish. Diabetes currently costs \nour Nation more than $132 billion annually. Eighty percent of those \ncosts are due to the complications associated with diabetes--\ncomplications that, absent a cure, can only be prevented through \nprevention and proper management of the disease. If cloture is invoked, \nI will be offering an amendment with Senators Bingaman and Domenici to \npreserve State laws requiring coverage for comprehensive diabetes care. \nBoth the American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes \nResearch Foundation have endorsed our amendment.\n\n  I am also concerned that the bill would preempt State rating rules \nand establish a new national standard. Proponents of the legislation \ncontend that the application of this new national standard may not \ncause much disruption in many states. In Maine, however, which uses \nmodified community rating, it could alter the market substantially.\n  In fact, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, CBO, estimates \nthat one-quarter of all small businesses will actually pay higher \npremiums if this bill is passed. It is therefore likely that many small \nemployers in Maine--particularly those with an older workforce--will \nwind up paying more, and in some cases substantially more, under this \nbill.\n  This bill is no panacea, even for those small employers who will see \nsavings. The CBO estimates that health care premiums will only average \nabout 2 to 3 percent lower if S. 1955 is passed. Many small business \nowners have been told that the bill will cut their costs by from 12 to \n20 percent. Even those employers who do see savings are likely to be \ndisappointed that they are not as great as they had been led to \nbelieve.\n  Finally, I am concerned that the bill, as reported by the committee, \ncould allow health plans to exclude a class of health care providers, \nsolely on the basis of their license or certification, restricting \npatients' access to qualified health professionals. This is a \nparticularly important issue in rural areas like Maine, where there may \nnot be a sufficient supply of physicians to provide the care that the \nhealth plan has promised to cover.\n  For example, virtually all health plans cover medically necessary \nprimary care services. Many rural Americans use a physician assistant \nor nurse practitioner as their primary care provider because there \nsimply isn't an adequate supply of physicians where they live. In these \nareas, if a plan only covers primary care services offered by a \nphysician, patients will either have to drive great distances to \nreceive the care they need or pay out of pocket for services that are \nsupposed to be covered benefits.\n  If cloture is invoked, I will be offering an amendment to maintain \nthe application of all existing State laws prohibiting health insurers \nfrom discriminating against health providers who are acting within \ntheir scope of practice under State law, solely on the basis of their \nlicense or certification.\n  Mr. President, I do plan to vote for cloture. Congress should be \ntaking action to make health insurance more affordable for small \nbusinesses, and I believe that this debate should go forward.\n  I do not, however, believe that we need to preempt the good work that \nStates have done in the area of patient's rights and protections in \norder to help our small businesses. I would, therefore, oppose the \ncurrent bill on final passage unless it is substantially changed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to support affordable, \nadequate and accessible health insurance. We have a bill before the \nSenate, S. 1955, the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization \nAffordability Act of 2006. Chairman Enzi has worked very hard on this \nbill for many months now and I believe that it will help small business \npeople who are struggling to afford health insurance for themselves, \ntheir employees, and their families. I hope that the Senate will pass \nthis bill because the time for Congress to take action on this issue is \nlong overdue.\n  Most people in the U.S. who have health insurance obtain it through \ntheir employer or through a family member's employer as a workplace \nbenefit. Small employers however are far less likely than larger \nemployers to provide health insurance to their workers. In my home \nstate of New Mexico, I am embarrassed to say that almost 25 percent of \nthe citizens do not have health care. This is the second highest rate \nof uninsured in the country. Furthermore, there are approximately \n143,909 small businesses in New Mexico, and of these small businesses, \nonly about 37 percent of firms with fewer than 50 employees offer \nhealth insurance. For much smaller firms with five or less employees, \nthe numbers are\n\n[[Page S4450]]\n\neven more staggering; fewer than 50 percent of firms offer health \ninsurance. This is unacceptable. Working people deserve better.\n  The current realities of the insurance market make it much more \ndifficult for a small business people to secure quality, affordable \ninsurance. I believe that by allowing small businesses to band \ntogether, as this bill does, that economy of scale will be created and \nsmall businesses will be able to leverage their larger purchasing power \nto lower their health care costs. This would hopefully enable more \nemployers to afford such coverage and ideally reduce the number of \nsmall firm workers without health insurance. It is a real first step to \nproviding more access in a market where small business is currently \nstruggling.\n  Over the past few weeks, I have heard from many advocacy groups who \nare concerned with the way in which this bill addresses State benefit \nmandates. I understand these concerns and agree that widely accepted \ncritical protections for patients must be preserved in any legislation \nthe Senate ultimately adopts. That is why I have joined together with \nSenators Snowe, Byrd, and Talent to offer an amendment that would \nrequire small business health plans to comply with the benefits adopted \nby a majority of States. This amendment says if 26 States mandate it, \nthan a small business health plan must comply with it. This amendment \nis a good and workable compromise that alleviates one of my primary \nconcerns with the small business health plan bill. This compromise will \nhelp ensure that millions of Americans will continue to receive health \ncare coverage for most areas, including mammograms, diabetes care and \nmental illnesses. It is vitally important that we pass a bill that will \nbring health insurance to employees of small businesses who currently \nare not covered without consequently diminishing coverage already \noffered in other areas. This amendment should make it easier for us to \ndo so.\n  It is time for the Senate to take action on this issue. The House of \nRepresentatives has passed this type of legislation multiple times. The \nAmerican people are tired of excuses and they are tired of the status \nquo. They want to see change for the better. I again thank my \ncolleague, Senator Enzi, the chairman of the HELP Committee for his \nhard work on this important issue. I have long said that something \nneeds to be done to address the problem of the uninsured, and I have \nalso said that I support the idea of legislation aimed at helping small \nbusiness. I sincerely hope that the Senate will pass a bill that will \nallow small businesses to afford insurance for their employees.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I take a brief moment to explain why I will \nbe voting against cloture on S. 1955. The availability and \naffordability of health care is one of the most important issues that \nwe can debate this year in Congress. As was highlighted during the \nrecent ``Cover the Uninsured Week,'' the United States spends more on \nhealth care than any other nation, yet we still have almost 46 million \nuninsured Americans. This means that over 18 percent of Americans are \nuninsured and that there are 9 million children in our country without \nhealth insurance.\n  The Senate's response to this health care crisis, however, has been \nsorely lacking. The majority leader called this week health week and \nscheduled debate on three bills that would do little or nothing to \nassist the Nation's uninsured. The first two bills were medical \nliability bills that did not even achieve a majority of votes in the \nSenate. I have stated many times that I believe any meaningful tort \nreform should be enacted on the state level and voted accordingly. The \nthird bill is S. 1955, and I would like to take this opportunity to \nexplain my reservations about the bill.\n  The concept of S. 1955 is to allow small business or trade \nassociations to pool together in an effort to purchase health insurance \nat affordable costs. These new health plans would cross state lines and \ntherefore be eligible to bypass the state coverage and solvency \nmandates that apply to health plans offered by larger employers.\n  S. 1955 is a well intentioned bill. Senators Enzi and Nelson and \ntheir staffs have spent many hours meeting with all sides involved in \nthis important debate. This effort to bring everyone to the table \nresulted in a bill that improved upon previous small business health \nplan bills referred to as ``association health plans.'' However, S. \n1955 still falls short.\n  I have several concerns about S. 1955. First, I am concerned that \nthis bill could reduce access to critical benefits. S. 1955 replaces \nstate benefit requirements with a new standard that would allow \ninsurers and small business health plans to offer ``basic'' benefit \nplans, which would not have to include state-required benefits as long \nas they also make available an ``enhanced'' benefit plan, which would \nbe equivalent to one of the benefit plans offered to state employees in \none of the five most populous states. However, this new standard is \nmeaningless since those coverage options are likely to include a high \ndeductible/low coverage plan that would afford little protection to \nconsumers who need health care, whether due to illness or age.\n  Currently, insurance rating rules and the regulation and approval of \ninsurance plans are by done by state insurance commissioners. Most \nstate insurance commissioners are elected officials charged with making \nsure a state's market is based on rates that are fair and equitable to \nall based on state law. In my home State of Michigan, we have few \nbenefit mandates, but those mandates are important to the populations \nthat are protected. Some of the benefits that would no longer be \nrequired to be covered for Michigan citizens include hospice care, \nnewborn coverage, access to obstetrician/gynecologist, access to \npediatrician and diabetic drugs and prevention of diabetes programs. By \nsome estimates, this could affect over 2.7 million people in Michigan. \nThis pattern could be repeated in states across the country. My concern \nabout this is shared by many Governors, State Attorney Generals and \nState Insurance Commissioners, who have written the Senate to express \ntheir reservations about this bill.\n\n  A second concern I have about S. 1955 regards rate setting rules. \nThis legislation would create a new system allowing for insurers to \nvary premiums based upon, among other factors, health status and age. \nS. 1955 would wipe out state-based protections against discrimination. \nThis would affect older Americans and others such as groups with large \nnumbers of women, small businesses with fewer workers, and higher risk \nindustries.\n  Finally, I am concerned that S. 1995 would increase the potential for \nfraud and abuse. This concern is the basis for the recent letter to the \nSenate from 41 State Attorney Generals expressing opposition to this \nbill. S. 1955 will potentially erode state oversight of health \ninsurance plans and eliminate consumer protections in the areas of \nmandated benefits and internal grievance procedures. The bill provides \nno additional authority or resources to enforce the new Federal \nstandards created within it. This is eerily reminiscent to me of an \nexperience our country had in the 1970's with Multiple Employer Welfare \nArrangements or MEWAs. MEWAs were then exempted from state regulatory \ninsurance requirements, and the result was that almost 400,000 \nAmericans were left with more than $123 million in unpaid health \ninsurance claims.\n  Yesterday, the majority leader used a procedural tactic to prevent \nDemocrats from offering meaningful amendments to this bill which could \nhave improved it. One such amendment would have been the Democrat \nsubstitute to use the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan as a model \npool to allow for lower health care costs for small businesses. I would \nhave liked to have had the opportunity to also debate other health care \nissues as well such as extending the Medicare Part D enrollment \ndeadline, lifting the Federal restrictions on stem cell research and \nother efforts regarding the nation's 46 million uninsured.\n  Health care costs are rising too quickly, and I am sympathetic to the \nplight of small businesses. As a senior member of the Senate Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship Committee, I often hear from small \nbusiness constituents of mine about annual double digit health premium \nincreases. However, rising health care costs are not unique to small \nbusinesses--it is an untenable situation shared by most\n\n[[Page S4451]]\n\nAmericans--and this bill takes the wrong approach to solving this \nproblem. For all of these reasons, there is strong opposition to this \nbill from many state leaders, and from a coalition of more than 200 \norganizations, including the AARP, the National Partnership for \nFamilies and Women and Families USA.\n  At a minimum, we needed the chance to improve this bill. I cannot \nsupport cloture to end debate and restrict amendments on this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to comment on the legislation \nthe majority has brought forward during what it has dubbed Health Week \nand on health care more broadly.\n  While I do not support this legislation as drafted, I commend Senator \nEnzi for attempting to address the important issue of health insurance \nfor small businesses.\n  As of 2004, over 45 million Americans were uninsured. Unfortunately, \nthese numbers continue to rise with each passing year as more and more \nemployers cease offering coverage to their employees. In Rhode Island, \nthe percentage of companies offering health insurance coverage declined \nfrom 80 percent in 1999 to 68 percent in 2005. In my State, a small \nbusiness is more likely to drop coverage because of the prohibitive \ncost.\n  While some employers have stopped offering coverage altogether, \nothers have struggled to keep up with escalating costs. Since 2000, \npremiums for family coverage have increased by 73 percent compared to \nan inflation growth of 14 percent and a wage growth of 15 percent over \nthe same period.\n  Health insurance affordability not only affects employee \nsatisfaction, it also has a direct impact on a company's \ncompetitiveness.\n  We need to address these issues, but S. 1955 is not the answer. It \ndecreases cost by changing rating structures, allowing cherry-picking \nof healthy individuals, and offering plans with very few benefits.\n  S. 1955 would amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n1974 (ERISA) to allow for the creation of small business health plans, \nSBHPs, sponsored by business or trade associations that would, like \nself-insured plans, be exempt from State laws. As was the case with \nlegislation proposing the creation of association health plans, AHPs, a \nconsiderable number of health care experts have expressed concerns that \nthis legislation would exempt SBHPs from important State regulations \nthat protect consumers, guarantee access to coverage and treatment, and \nensure financial solvency. Millions of Americans could lose coverage \nfor such important care as screening for breast, cervical, colorectal, \nand prostate cancer; well-child care and immunizations; emergency \nservices; mental health; and diabetes supplies and education.\n  I have serious concerns that this legislation could weaken the \nalready fragile insurance market we currently have in the United \nStates. States have worked diligently to craft insurance regulations \nthat reflect their individual needs. They have developed rating systems \nand mandated benefits to best protect their citizens.\n  This bill will affect not only health insurance for small businesses \nbut also health insurance for all markets. In a letter to the chairman \nand ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions HELP \nCommittee, the Rhode Island health insurance commissioner expressed his \nstrong concerns about how S. 1955 would affect the State's health \ninsurance regulatory system, its ability to hold health plans \naccountable, and develop solutions particular to our Sate. I will ask \nthat the text of this letter be printed in the Record.\n  I have serious concerns about the health insurance that would be \noffered under this legislation. If insurance does not offer adequate \ncoverage, it is insurance in name only. It is of little use if you \ncan't afford it or access it when you need it.\n  A recent program on PBS' NOW focused on what it termed ``junk \ninsurance plans'' and profiled two particular cases where the insurance \nwas really no insurance at all, leaving couples who had faithfully paid \npremiums with astronomical medical bills. In one case, the insurance \nplan sold was marketed through an association for the self-employed.\n  It is important to try to address the problem of the uninsured, but \nwe need to be sure that it is being done in a sensible and thoughtful \nmanner.\n  While Senator Enzi has taken a great deal of time to meet with a \nvariety of stakeholders in drafting this legislation, there have been \nno hearings on the bill, even though my colleagues and I on the HELP \nCommittee requested such hearings. Moreover, 41 attorneys general have \nsigned a letter in opposition to S. 1955; 19 State insurance \ncommissioners and State departments responsible for insurance \nregulation have written letters opposing this legislation.\n  There are better options. The Lincoln-Durbin proposal would be more \neffective in curbing health care costs and expanding coverage, as well \nas help small businesses and their employees. It would create the Small \nEmployers Health Benefits Program SEHBP and provide tax breaks for \nemployers that offer financial assistance for insurance premiums to \nlow-income employees. SEHBP is based on the Federal Employee Health \nBenefits Program and would extend the purchasing power of the Federal \nGovernment to small businesses that choose to participate. In addition, \nSEHBP enrollees in local plans would enjoy an array of coverage \noptions, while at the same time benefiting from State consumer \nprotections.\n  I filed three straightforward, commonsense amendments to guarantee \nmore comprehensive coverage, to preserve State authority, and to make \nsure SBHPs actually reduce costs. I first proposed these amendments \nduring the HELP Committee consideration of this bill. The first \namendment would create a commission to establish a Federal floor of \nbenefit mandates in accordance with the laws adopted in a plurality of \nthe States, which would preserve some of the critical benefits \ncurrently mandated by Rhode Island and other States. The second \namendment would limit the preemption of State laws by clarifying that \nunless specifically provided for, nothing in S. 1955 would override any \nState or local law related to health insurance. The third amendment \nrequires the Government Accountability Office GAO to evaluate the \nprogram 24 months after its implementation, and if there is no evidence \nof a decrease in cost or increase in access to health care, the program \nwould be terminated.\n  I am disappointed that the majority is not allowing us to engage in a \nfull and fair debate on these and other amendments in the absence of a \nbroad agreement on the bill.\n  Earlier this year, we saw the implementation of another program that \nwas not well thought out and was fraught with problems as a result. \nMany of the problems with the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit \ncould have been averted. This crisis was anticipated for some time by \nindependent researchers and advocates for Medicare beneficiaries, yet \nthe Republican-controlled Congress repeatedly blocked remedies and \ncontinues to do so. Working to improve the Medicare drug plan is not \neven on the agenda for Health Week.\n  I did not support the Medicare Modernization Act because I felt the \nbenefit was insufficient and the emphasis on a privately administered \nprogram made it excessively complex for beneficiaries. This plan \nimposes penalties for those enrolled to change plans but allows the \nplans to change the prescriptions they cover at will. Millions of \nretirees faced with choosing among a large number of private drug plans \nstruggled with different rules, lists of covered drugs, and premiums. \nMany who are eligible to sign up have avoided doing so all together.\n\n  The problems have been so widespread that more than 20 States, \nincluding Rhode Island, had to step in to pay drug claims that should \nhave been paid by the Federal Medicare Program. At least two dozen \nStates have taken emergency action to help low-income individuals who \ncould not get their medications under the program, and States spent \nmany millions of dollars on this assistance.\n  Since its launch on January 1, doctors and pharmacists have \ncomplained that many drugs theoretically covered by the new Medicare \ndrug benefit are not readily available due to the insurers' \nrestrictions and requirements. Many pharmacists can't keep track of\n\n[[Page S4452]]\n\nthe plans' myriad policies and procedures and doctors say the diverse \nrequirements are onerous and can delay or deny access to needed \nmedications.\n  The May 15 deadline for enrollment in Part D is looming. We should be \ntaking action to extend the deadline and improve Part D during this \nsole week the majority has dedicated to so-called health care reform. \nLet's put America's Medicare beneficiaries first.\n  Another issue that is imperative for us to address is stem cell \nresearch. Last May, the House passed the Stem Cell Research Enhancement \nAct, H.R. 810, by a wide margin. We heard Senator Frist last summer \nannounce that he agrees with lifting the stem cell ban, but we have not \nseen any movement on this issue.\n  President Bush's policy limits Federal funding of embryonic stem cell \nresearch in practice to 22 stem cell lines that have been in existence \nsince 2001, and these lines are unsuitable for research. In recent \nyears, we have seen amazing medical breakthroughs thanks to a \ndedication to research. HIV disease, which was a virtual death sentence \njust over a decade ago, has become for many a chronic disease. The 5-\nyear survival rate for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia is \napproximately 85 percent, a dramatic increase because of new lifesaving \ntreatments.\n  I hope to be able to stand on this Senate floor a few years from now \nasking for support for new research and highlighting the advancements \nthat have been made in the treatment of spinal cord victims, children \nwith diabetes, and those with Parkinson's because of embryonic stem \ncell research. The Senate should be marking the 1-year anniversary of \nthe House passage of H.R. 810 by having a vote on the bill. We have an \nobligation not only to those stricken with these devastating conditions \nbut to the family and friends who care for them. H.R. 810 opens the \ndoor to medical research that could unlock the mystery behind many of \nthese devastating diseases while ensuring strong ethical and scientific \noversight.\n  I share Senator Enzi's desire to stem the rising costs of health \ninsurance, which pose a challenge to many, including our Nation's small \nbusinesses and self-employed individuals. While Congress should \ncertainly do more to address this matter and expand coverage to those \nwho currently lack it, S. 1955 would have little impact on these \ncrucial needs.\n  There are other equally critical health issues facing millions of \nAmericans. In addition to Medicare and stem cell research, we should be \nconsidering legislation to expand health insurance coverage to every \nchild in this country, legislation to strengthen our public health \nsystem, and legislation to ensure an adequate number of nurses and \nother health professionals to care for our aging Nation. While the \nmajority is stunting this week's debate, it is my hope that the Senate \nwill actually take the time and find a way to work together to have a \nserious debate on important health care issues this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the before-mentioned letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 13, 2006.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     Chair, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Enzi and Senator Kennedy: I am writing to \n     express my strong concerns Senate Bill 1955, and to ask that \n     it not be passed.\n       Context: Rhode Island has a strong history of active health \n     insurance regulation. In 1996, the state passed broad managed \n     care regulations regarding utilization review, member rights \n     and appeals and health plan oversight. These provided \n     protections which were later duplicated in other states. In \n     2000, the state overhauled its small group rating laws to \n     bring more equity between large group and small group rates. \n     In 2004, the legislature created a first-in-the-nation \n     cabinet-level health insurance commissioner role, to (in \n     part) ``direct health plans towards policies that promote the \n     public good through increased access, and improved efficiency \n     and quality''.\n       The results speak for themselves, Rhode Island has one of \n     the lowest rates of uninsurance in the country, lower medical \n     costs than its neighbors, high health plan satisfaction \n     measures, excellent scores in HEDIS and public health \n     performance measures, and nationally recognized innovations \n     in health care quality measurement and health care \n     information technology innovation. Studies by my office \n     indicate that rating forms have closed the health insurance \n     price gap between large and small employers.\n       Effect: In spite of recent amendments, the proposed bill \n     would put all this in jeopardy by eliminating the ability of \n     states to bring together stakeholders to develop local \n     solutions to the problems of affordable health insurances for \n     small businesses.\n       Specifically: Imposing national underwriting rules and \n     coverage standards for small businesses creates 1 local \n     instability in pricing and hinders innovation. States should \n     be allowed to develop programs for affordable health \n     insurance products and pricing, and then learn from one \n     another. Just this year, small business health insurance \n     reform bills have been introduced by both Democrats and \n     Republicans in the RI legislature that call for crafting new \n     affordable health plans, subsidizing their purchase through \n     reinsurance mechanisms and promoting price transparency. \n     These innovative programs would not be possible under this \n     bill.\n       The bill weakens health plan accountability. Health care is \n     delivered locally. It is intrinsically tied to public health \n     and important community institutions. Health insurers need to \n     be held accountable by local entities for their actions in \n     states--for the incentives created by their payment \n     mechanisms, for their support of local community health \n     activities and state-wide health policy. Bill 1955, in spite \n     of recent clarifications regarding the role of insurance \n     commissioners, would make it harder for national health plans \n     to be answerable to their local stake holders. It would usurp \n     public authority and place it with large national insurers, \n     who would be accountable to no one.\n       The bill does not address the real problem. The fundamental \n     health policy challenge facing the U.S. is the effect of \n     rising medical costs on the number of uninsured. As both of \n     you have noted, we need to move beyond underwriting and cost \n     shifting solutions to addressing the underlying utilization \n     drivers. This is best accomplished through local \n     experimentation and accountable insurers--both of which are \n     weakened by this measure. Mass group purchasing--which this \n     attempts to create--will not result in informed purchasers \n     driving system change, but a one-size-fits-all approach which \n     cedes power to national insurers.\n       As witnessed by the efforts of the sponsors with the \n     National Association of Insurance Commissioners, much good \n     work has gone into amending this bill. Unfortunately, major \n     concerns remain. The bill in its current form fails to \n     address the critical issues states and communities face in \n     developing an affordable, sustainable health care system that \n     works for employees in small businesses. To accomplish this, \n     we need accountable health plans, not association health \n     plans.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                        Christopher F. Koller,\n\n                                    Health Insurance Commissioner,\n                                            State of Rhode Island.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about my concern \nfor the 6.6 million uninsured individuals in California and the impact \nthe Enzi Small Business Health Insurance bill, S. 1955, will have on \nboth the uninsured and the insured in my State.\n  While the goal of this legislation is one I agree with--finding a \nsolution to lower health insurance costs and greater access to health \ninsurance for small business owners and their employees--I have serious \nconcerns about the fundamental shift toward insurance deregulation and \nbare bones insurance coverage under the Enzi bill.\n  It is my understanding that some changes have been made in the \nsubstitute amendment to the Enzi bill but that those changes do very \nlittle to change the fact that this bill will result in a loss of \ncovered benefits and an increase in costs for older, sicker workers.\n  While I respect the position of small businesses that support this \nlegislation, I simply cannot support a proposal that I believe would \nresult in higher costs for older, sicker workers and would result in a \nloss of covered benefits my State fought hard to guarantee.\n  My concerns are shared by a wide range of people.\n  It was also the conclusion of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice, 41 State attorneys general including the attorney general of \nCalifornia, 13 Governors, the California State insurance commissioner, \nthe California Public Employees' Retirement System and countless \nnational organizations such as the AARP, the American Medical \nAssociation, the American Cancer Society, and many more.\n  California has one of the most comprehensive set of required \ninsurance benefits in the country. A partial list includes: Coverage of \nroutine patient care costs of cancer clinical trials; coverage of \nbreast, prostate, cervical,\n\n[[Page S4453]]\n\ncolorectal and other cancer screening; coverage of breast cancer \nscreening, diagnosis and treatment, including prosthetic devices and \nreconstructive surgery; the right to a second opinion when requested by \ninsured individual or health professional treating an insured \nindividual; minimum maternity hospital stay; coverage of equipment, \nsupplies, including prescriptions, and management of diabetes; coverage \nof alcoholism and drug abuse treatment; coverage of blood lead \nscreening; coverage of contraceptives approved by the FDA; coverage of \nservices related to diagnosis, treatment and appropriate management of \nosteoporosis; coverage of domestic partners and coverage of infertility \ntreatment.\n  The legislation before us sets a ceiling, not a floor for insurance \ncoverage of vital services. Amendments that have been discussed such as \ncreating a 26-State benefit mandate threshold are a ceiling, not a \nfloor.\n  The reality is that any attempt to ``harmonize'' State benefit \nmandates will likely result in harm to Californians.\n  Just like legislation passed by the House last March called the \nNational Uniformity for Food Act which I strongly oppose, this \nlegislation preempts States rights.\n  California voters and elected officials have determined what they \nthink is best for the State and this legislation override the will of \nCalifornians whether they work for a small business or large one.\n  I am also concerned about the impact this bill will have on premiums \nfor small business employees. California has rules to protect premium \nadjustments from increasing year to year beyond 10 percent.\n  And in California, insurance companies may set premium rates for \nemployees based on only three risk factors: age, family composition, \nand geographic region.\n  Under this bill, not only will employees be subject to rating based \non additional factors such as the size of business, gender and type of \nbusiness, but California's age and geographic region limitations are \npreempted.\n  The new rating factors in the bill disadvantage certain small \nbusinesses and they disadvantage businesses with a high proportion of \nwomen of child-bearing age.\n  I find it deeply troubling that Senators on both sides of the aisle \nhave been denied the opportunity to vote on amendments to address the \nproblems with this legislation.\n  I would like to address another healthcare issue that I have been \ndeeply concerned about and that is stem cells.\n  The Senate has spent a week dedicated to health care and yet, the \nmajority leader has not scheduled a vote on embryonic stem cell \nlegislation.\n  It has been 8 years--1998--since I introduced one of the first bills \ndealing with the ethical issues around stem cell research.\n  It is almost one year--May 24--since the House passed the Castle-\nDeGette bill.\n  It has been 9 months--July 29--since the majority leader shocked the \nSenate and announced his support for stem cell legislation.\n  But no bill has been passed by the Senate.\n  What we have learned over that period is that the more than seventy \nlines the President said were available when he set his policy in \nAugust 2001 are down to just over twenty.\n  Those approximately twenty lines are contaminated with mouse feeder \nlines and they are old. They are of no therapeutic value.\n  We need more lines if we are going to untie the hands of researchers \nso they can do the research needed to learn about the biology of \ndiseases, the restoration and repair of damaged tissue, and the \ndevelopment of treatment therapies.\n  Time and time again researchers say they need more embryonic stem \ncell lines.\n  But, the leadership of the Senate and White House won't listen. They \nwould rather obstruct the work of scientists who want to work with \nembryonic stem cells. The result is scientists moving to other \ncountries to do their work.\n  The time to act is now. The price of inaction goes up every day.\n  Since this fight began, we have lost Christopher Reeve on October 10, \n2004, Dana Reeve on March 6, 2006, 4 million Americans to cancer, 1.8 \nmillion Americans to diabetes, and 144,000 Americans to Parkinson's.\n  I have heard opponents of embryonic stem cell research talk about the \npromise of adult stem cell research. No one I know is arguing that we \nshouldn't pursue adult stem cell research. That's why the Senate passed \nthe cord blood bill unanimously last year.\n  But, we must not fund this research to the exclusion of embryonic \nstem cells.\n  There is no question that this country needs an effective stem cell \npolicy--both to provide Federal funding for viable stem cell lines and \nto provide Federal ethical guidelines.\n  It is simply appalling that here we have a week dedicated to a debate \non health care and the leadership of the Senate has not scheduled a \nvote on the Castle-DeGette, embryonic stem cell bill.\n  I personally believe this week should be renamed the ``week of missed \nopportunities'' instead of ``health week''.\n  Instead of addressing problems associated with the Medicare drug \nbenefit such as the amendment I filed to the pending legislation to \nprotect seniors from insurance plans who may decide to end coverage of \ndrugs they said they'd cover when the senior enrolled in the plan, we \nare doing nothing.\n  Instead of allowing the Federal Government to use its bulk purchasing \npower to negotiate with drug companies to provide lower prices for \nseniors, we are doing nothing.\n  Instead of addressing the fact that millions of confused seniors will \nface a penalty in Medicare forever if they are eligible and don't sign \nup for the drug program by this Monday, we are doing nothing.\n  And yet we will have a cloture vote on a bill that will leave \nmillions of Californians without a guaranteed access to cancer \nscreenings and treatment, diabetes coverage, the right to a second \nmedical opinion if they request it, among many others.\n  All of those protections will be lost, and Senators will have been \ndenied without the opportunity to vote on any amendments to address the \nproblems associated with this legislation.\n  It is a shame that the leadership of the Senate has allowed this week \nto become one of missed opportunities when we have bills such as the \nCastle-DeGette embryonic stem cell bill that have passed the House and \nare sitting at the President's desk waiting to be taken up and passed \nby the Senate.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, access to affordable, quality health care \nis on the minds of virtually every American. As I travel across my \nState of Colorado and this nation, people urge me and my colleagues in \nCongress to solve our health care crisis. I rise today to again add my \nvoice to the millions calling for meaningful, comprehensive health care \nreform--reform that allows Americans to get the health care that they \nneed; reform that will stop the crippling effect that the rising costs \nof health care has on our citizens, businesses and economy.\n  Last year, Senator McCain and I introduced the National Commission on \nHealth Care Act, S. 2007. Its purpose is simple and bold--to fix our \nbroken health care system.\n  The need to reform our health care system could not be more \ncompelling. An astounding 46 million Americans lack health insurance. \nThey come from every community, every walk of life, and every race and \nethnic group. But the most telling part about them is that they come \nfrom working families who struggle to put food on their tables and pay \ntheir bills. They live in constant fear of getting sick. When they get \nsick, they often go without medical care and get sicker.\n  For those fortunate enough to have health insurance, the picture is \nalso grim. Health insurance premiums for family coverage have risen by \nover 59 percent since 2000, with the average annual premiums for \nemployer-sponsored family coverage costing nearly $11,000. Rising \npremiums place working families at risk of joining the ranks of the \nuninsured.\n  Rising health care coverage has also threatened the ability of \nAmerican businesses to maintain insurance coverage for their employees \nand compete on a global level.\n  Congress must act now to reform our system. We need much more than a\n\n[[Page S4454]]\n\nweek of gimmicks or piecemeal bills. We need comprehensive reform. S. \n2007 reflects that need. The act creates a bipartisan commission of 10 \nelder states men and women. I want to stress that this is a bipartisan \ncommission. Our health care crisis is not a Democratic or Republican \nproblem. It is a national problem that we must solve together.\n  The members will conduct a thorough investigation into our health \ncare system, building on the work of others to comprehensively look at \navailability, affordability, quality and costs relating to our health \ncare system. It will look at the uninsured, the small business \ninsurance market, the increases in premiums and health care costs, and \nthe problems that businesses face in maintaining insurance coverage.\n  The commission will study our government programs and the private \nhealth insurance industry. And, most importantly, the commission will \ndevelop comprehensive proposals and recommendations to actually solve \nproblems associated with our Nation's health care system. It is not \nenough to chip away at the problem by enacting policies related to one \naspect of our health care system. We need a comprehensive study and \ncomprehensive solutions.\n  The National Commission on Health Care will not duplicate the very \nimportant work that has already been done by other commissions and \nthink tanks. What it will do is study the proposals from a \ncomprehensive perspective, engage business, labor, health care, \nconsumer, insurance and other groups to develop workable policies that \nif enacted will solve the crisis we face today.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to pass the Commission Act to reform our broken health care \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to talk about the \nMedicare prescription drug program. I want to talk about the need to \nextend the deadline for seniors and people with disabilities and I want \nto talk about the rural, independent pharmacies that have suffered \nbecause of implementation problems with the drug program.\n  I was not a member of this esteemed body when the Medicare \nModernization Act creating this program was enacted. I therefore have \nno political stake in defending or criticizing the drug program. I have \nevery interest, however, in making sure that the program is properly \nimplemented and that our seniors and people with disabilities have \nadequate time and accurate resources with which to make decisions about \nwhat plans best meet their health care needs. I strongly support \nSenator Bill Nelson's legislation extending the deadline for seniors \nand people with disabilities to enroll in the program. I want to thank \nSenator Bill Nelson for his commitment to ensure that seniors and \npeople with disabilities have adequate time and accurate information to \nmake wise decisions about their prescription drug insurance.\n  In less than 1 week, seniors will face the deadline for enrollment in \nthe prescription drug program. For many seniors and their family \nmembers, selecting an appropriate prescription plan is a difficult and \nchallenging endeavor. I know firsthand how time-consuming and difficult \nit is to navigate through the various plans to select the plan that \nmeets the needs of an individual senior.\n  Several weeks ago, I helped my 82-year-old mother select a \nprescription drug program. In Colorado, there are over 42 plans to \nchoose from--each covering different drugs or formularies as they are \nknown, each with different monthly premiums; each with different \ncopayments, each with different drug prices, and each with different \nparticipating pharmacies. I speak from experience--the process is \ndaunting.\n  My offices have been helping many Coloradans with questions on \nMedicare prescription drug program. Often, individuals have called my \noffice in exasperation, trying to find a friendly voice to help them \nthrough this process. My staff has assisted these individuals. However, \nmany seniors continue to put off signing up for the program because \nthey are confused and nervous. In Colorado, there are still \nover 100,000 individuals who are eligible to enroll in the plans who \nhave not. Coloradans consistently tell me that they need more time to \nmake sure they review reliable accurate information to select the right \nplan. They should have that time.\n\n  The complexity of the plans and the importance of the choice that \nseniors and the disabled must make dictate that we allow them more time \nto make these important decisions regarding their health. Beyond the \ncomplexity of the program, seniors and people with disabilities need \nmore time because of the government's own inability to provide reliable \ninformation and available help to navigate the choices they are being \nasked to make.\n  Just this month the Government Accountability Office released a \nreport that highlighted the government's own shortcomings with respect \nto the implementation of the drug benefit. The report highlighted that \nthe Medicare help-lines were not providing accurate information for \nbeneficiaries with questions about enrollment. Posing as seniors and \nsenior advocates, the GAO made calls to the Medicare help-line with \nquestions about how the program works. Astonishingly, the GAO often \ncould not get through to an operator!\n  When the GAO staff did finally get through to an operator, the \ninformation specialists often could not answer their questions about \nthe drug benefit, could not help them with questions about specific \nplans, and could not provide the detailed information that seniors need \nto enroll. If the government that administers this program could not \nprovide timely, adequate information to beneficiaries, how can we hold \nthem to an artificial deadline? Our seniors and people with \ndisabilities deserve better. They certainly do not deserve to be \npenalized.\n  Individuals who miss the approaching deadline will not have an \nopportunity to enroll until November. In turn, they will face increased \npremiums and co-pays. And these costs increase the longer the \nindividual waits. Seniors should not be punished for the government's \ninability to provide them with information with which to make a choice \nregarding their health. We need to help our seniors in this process, by \ngiving them the time and resources needed to make the best decision for \nthem.\n  I also want to speak in support of Senator Lautenberg's Pharmacists \nMedicare Relief Act of 2006 to modify the Medicare drug benefit to \nallow pharmacies to get timely payment from prescription drug plans. As \nwe all know, pharmacies operating in rural towns and communities, like \nmy hometown in Colorado, are important components of the community's \nalready fragile health care delivery system. Because rural residents \ntend to be older and have more chronic conditions, pharmacy services to \nrural residents are particularly important.\n  The Medicare drug program has threatened the very survival of some \nrural pharmacies because of the manner in which the plans pay the \npharmacies. These pharmacies must pay their wholesalers on a weekly or \nbiweekly basis. Unfortunately, the prescription drug plans reimburse \nthe pharmacies every 6 weeks. The discrepancy in payment has seriously \naffected the business of many pharmacies, and particularly pharmacies \nin rural communities.\n  Fortunately, there is a simple fix: require the plans to reimburse \nthe pharmacies every 14 days. That is exactly what Senator Lautenberg's \nlegislation will do. This legislation would require the plans to pay \npharmacists within 14 days if the claims are submitted electronically, \nand 30 days if the claims are submitted by paper. The legislation also \nprohibits plans from cobranding Medicare beneficiaries eligibility \ncards--which means that it bans brands or names of pharmacies from \nbeing printed on the prescription drug cards, so that large pharmacies \ncannot use this advertising advantage at the expense of small \noperations.\n  These simple fixes will enable pharmacies in rural areas to continue \nto serve beneficiaries. Our rural pharmacies and the seniors and \ndisabled people they serve deserve our best efforts to correct problems \nwith the drug benefit plan to enhance health care delivery. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this small but very important fix.\n  One thing that we can all agree on is that our health care system is \nin crisis, and that crisis is harming health care providers and \npatients who need health care services. It is clear that we need\n\n[[Page S4455]]\n\nreal reform. The time for enacting piecemeal legislation that chips \naway at the massive health care problems is over. Our healthcare crisis \nwill persist long after this healthcare week in the Senate is over. I \npledge to put partisanship aside and work with all of my colleagues \ntoward real health care solutions.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, while Republicans proclaim this week as \nHealth Week on the Senate floor, it is quite the contrary in the homes \nof millions of American families. Today, 46 million Americans have no \nhealth insurance at all. And 1.3 million New Jerseyans have no health \ninsurance. Another 16 million or more Americans are underinsured, \nmeaning that they have insurance, but still do not have access to the \ncare they need. Complicating matters even more is the fact that the \naverage cost of family health coverage--$10,880--now exceeds annual \nearnings for a minimum-wage earner.\n  So what does the Senate majority propose to do to solve the problem? \nNothing more than dust off the old playbook and make another run at the \nsame old play. They propose a medical malpractice bill that has been \ndefeated over and over again, that does not even really reduce costs \nfor providers or patients, and in the process actually reduces remedies \nfor patients. They propose a bill claiming to help small businesses, \nbut it actually hurts patients by removing existing coverage and \nprotections and exacerbates the problem of the underinsured.\n  So at the end of Health Week in the Senate, all we have to show the \nAmerican people is more of the same--the same 46 million with no \ninsurance, the same 16 million people with inadequate insurance, and \nthe same families working 40 hours a week to earn a living for their \nfamily but still unable to afford quality health care for them.\n  Instead of leading us down a dead-end road, as Republicans have done \nthis week, we should be on the expressway to real health care \nsolutions--legislation such as the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, \nlegislation to extend the enrollment deadline for the new Medicare Part \nD drug benefit, legislation to provide real solutions to the large and \ngrowing number of uninsured Americans, and legislation to address long-\nterm care needs that will only become more pressing as the baby boom \ngeneration ages.\n  The Republican proposals being considered this week never even \nreceived a hearing or a vote in their committees of jurisdiction and \nwere destined to fail from the beginning. Is this really all the \nmajority party plans to address regarding the endless needs of our \nhealth care system? I believe we can and must do better.\n  First, Alzheimer's disease does not boast a party affiliation. \nNeither does cancer or diabetes or Parkinson's disease. Yet, potential \ncures to these debilitating and fatal diseases are being ensnared in \npolitical wrangling, posturing, and obstruction.\n  Today, almost 35 years after President Nixon declared war on cancer, \nthe Federal Government and Washington Republicans remain AWOL in the \nfight against this fatal illness and a host of other debilitating \ndiseases. While we have made great strides in researching potential \nvaccines and cures, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nchoose to tie our researchers hands.\n  The bottom line is this: When your life--or the life of a loved one--\nis on the line, you never give up and you never limit your options--\nnever. You never lose faith, and you pursue every option, every sliver \nof hope, of finding a cure.\n  This issue is about more than statistics, it is about more than \nnumbers on a fact sheet. These are real people. These are families. \nThese are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, aunts and uncles. \nThese diseases cut through race, age, religion, country, and political \naffiliation. We all suffer, which is why we must move beyond the usual \npartisan posturing and fight for expanding research.\n  I had the opportunity to vote on this stem cell legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives, where we had broad, bipartisan support. And I \nbelieve that same bipartisan support exists in the Senate, which makes \nit even more difficult to understand why we cannot come together and do \nsomething meaningful for those who are suffering.\n  We have an opportunity to do what is right, and the majority has \nagain let that opportunity pass them by. This bill means so much more \nthan ending restrictions placed on stem cell research. This bill means \nhope for the individuals challenged and fighting to live a life with \ndignity.\n  Stem cell research has vast potential for curing diseases, \nalleviating suffering, and saving lives. I know my colleagues recognize \nthe enormous potential of this research too, and it is time to clear \nthe way for discovering new cures and therapies and bring this bill to \na vote.\n  Another thing we cannot ignore is the fast approaching deadline for \nseniors to enroll in a Medicare prescription drug benefit without being \npenalized. We need to stand up for our seniors and extend the deadline \nso that our seniors have time to choose the plan that is right for \nthem.\n  When the Federal Government rolled out the new benefit, and it did \nnot go as planned, States such as New Jersey stepped up to the plate \nand provided emergency drug coverage to seniors and people with \ndisabilities in need. Now the Federal Government has a responsibility \nto recognize its shortcomings and give our seniors a chance to enroll \nwithout having to pay the price for the Federal Government's mistakes.\n  And the concerns go beyond just seniors' drug benefits. There is also \na grave concern that seniors and people with disabilities may lose \naccess to their local neighborhood pharmacies. Almost any senior will \ntell you that they rely on their local pharmacist to help them when \nthey have complications with their drugs--whether it is interactions \nbetween drugs or problems getting their medications.\n  I recently heard from Adolph Gonzalez and Alan Garcia who run the \nNorth Bergen Pharmacy, which has been open and serving its customers \nfor the past 21 years. Unfortunately, since prescription drug plans are \nnot paying their claims in a timely fashion, pharmacies such as this \none are dipping into their line of credit, taking out loans and \nscrambling to stay afloat. Unless things change, pharmacies such as the \none in North Bergen, NJ, are going to be forced to close their doors.\n\n  I introduced legislation to address problems with the Medicare Part D \ndrug benefit and so have many of my colleagues. All of us recognize \nthat unless we start making important changes to improve the program, \nseniors are going to see lapses in their care. We must be committed to \nmaking sure that all Americans have a comprehensive drug benefit that \nallows them to take the medication prescribed by their doctors, \nprovides them the information and flexibility to pick a plan that works \nbest for them without being penalized, and allows them to continue \nvisiting their local pharmacy.\n  Unfortunately, the majority party is not going to allow us the \nopportunity to improve the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit \nthis week. Our fight for seniors is one we are going to continue, but \none that has been overlooked this week in the U.S. Senate.\n  Second, the unproductive nature of this week is most insulting to the \n46 million people across the country who have no health insurance at \nall--1.3 million in New Jersey alone. No American family should be \nforced to skip a trip to the doctor because they fear it will also mean \nan unfortunate trip to the bank.\n  That is why I strongly support initiatives that will help small \nbusinesses afford meaningful health insurance for themselves and their \nemployees; increase coverage for uninsured parents by extending the \nState Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP; and help Americans \nnearing retirement buy into Medicare--programs that have proven \nsuccessful in reducing the uninsured and providing access to quality \ncoverage.\n  In addition, I introduced the Health Care COSTS Act, which will help \nhard-working Americans afford their health insurance when they are \nbetween jobs by providing an ``advanceable'' tax credit for half the \ncost of COBRA premiums. As I mentioned earlier, the average cost of a \nfamily health plan exceeds a full year's earnings for a minimum-wage \nworker, so there is no way most families can afford to continue to \npurchase coverage if they lose their job and have to find another.\n  Instead of debating a bill that will preempt the important New Jersey\n\n[[Page S4456]]\n\nState coverage protections--including coverage of cervical cancer \nscreening, contraceptives, home health care, mammography screening, \nmental health parity, and prostate cancer screening, to name a few--and \nprotection against age discrimination in setting premiums, the Enzi \nbill takes the high bar of health insurance for New Jersey, and lowers \nit to a dangerously low level that strips away the coverage our State \nfought so hard to get.\n  The choice before us this week--the Enzi bill or nothing--is a false \nchoice. This policy will result in reduced access to important health \nbenefits and substantially increase premiums for people who need \ncoverage most. It will allow insurance companies to cherry-pick the \nmost profitable patients and punish those who need coverage most. It \nwill allow companies to discriminate against older, sicker patients by \ncharging them 3 exhorbitant premiums for the care they get. It will pit \nyoung versus old, the healthy versus the sick. These are false choices, \nand we should not allow the majority to force us into making them.\n  What we should be doing is considering a bill that preserves State \nbenefits and prevents such cherry-picking. By offering small businesses \naccess to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which has \nprovided extensive benefit choices at affordable prices to me, my \ncolleagues, and all Federal employees for decades, we can do just that.\n  By pooling small businesses across America into one risk and \npurchasing pool like the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, the \nnew Small Employees Health Benefit Plan will allow employers to reap \nthe benefits of group purchasing power and streamlined administrative \ncosts, as well as access to more plan choices. That is why I support \nthe Lincoln-Durbin alternative. Unfortunately, the Republican \nleadership has refused to let us have a full debate and up-or-down vote \non this proposal.\n  Finally, the challenge of caring for our aging population will only \nincrease as the baby boom generation grows older and our life \nexpectancy increases. We need to work now to address the challenges of \nproviding affordable long-term care, encourage future retirees to plan \nfor their own long-term care, and strengthen our existing programs to \naddress this growing need.\n  I have introduced legislation to do just that. This week we should be \nsupporting legislation that helps all families afford to care for the \nones they love while also preparing for their own long-term care needs.\n  While I am disappointed in the partisan nature of this week's debate, \nit makes my commitment to fighting for the health and well-being of all \nAmericans that much stronger. I call on my colleagues to finally make \nthe health care priorities of the America people the health care \npriorities of the Senate.\n  No longer should we avoid a vote on stem cell research, a vote on \nimproving the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, a vote for a \nreal solution to solve the issue of the uninsured, and a vote to help \nour growing senior population age with dignity. At the end of so-called \nHealth Week in the Senate, we will have accomplished nothing for the \nmillions of Amerians who are uninsured or underinsured and struggling \nevery day to provide health care for their families.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the State \nHealth Insurance Assistance Program. I filed amendment No. 2917 to \nincrease resources for this important initiative.\n  The State Health Insurance Assistance program, known as SHIP, \nprovides one-on-one counseling and assistance to people with Medicare \nand their families. Congress created the program in 1990 so that \nMedicare beneficiaries could obtain free, unbiased and personal \nassistance with their health benefits. Today, SHIPs operate in all 50 \nStates, Washington, DC, and the territories.\n  Over the last 2 years, SHIPs have had the formidable task of helping \nAmericans understand the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. In all \nStates, SHIPs enlisted the help of thousands of volunteers--over 11,000 \nnationally--for a massive public outreach campaign.\n  SHIP counselors and volunteers--like Bobbie Roberts and Sue Bailey in \nBillings, MT.--conducted public education programs at senior centers, \nhospitals, assisted-living facilities, libraries, and other public \nvenues. They answered questions via telephone and in face-to-face \nsessions. And they spent countless hours helping Medicare beneficiaries \nchoose and enroll in a drug plan that best meets their needs.\n  These folks deserve our thanks. They are truly unsung heroes who have \nhelped make the drug benefit a reality for millions of people with \nMedicare.\n  And they did all this on a shoe-string budget.\n  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, operates the \nMedicare Program. As such, CMS is responsible for providing funding to \nthe SHIP. But last year, in the midst of the largest Medicare expansion \never, CMS provided SHIPs just $32 million to carry out their important \nwork. Thirty-two million dollars sounds like a lot of money. But when \nyou think about the workload the SHIPs faced, it is not much. In fact, \nthat $32 million translates to only 70 cents per Medicare beneficiary. \nA five-county region in Montana about the size of Delaware received \nabout $8,500 in SHIP funds for the entire year. That is not enough. I \nbelieve that the lack of sufficient resources for SHIPs goes a long way \ntoward explaining why enrollment in the drug program continues to lag.\n  I might also note that the $32 million CMS provided to SHIPs pales in \ncomparison to the roughly $300 million CMS spent promoting the new drug \nbenefit. That $300 million went to programs like the toll-free 1-800 \nMedicare hotline.\n  Last week the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, GAO, \nCongress's investigative arm--found major flaws with the Medicare \nhotline. GAO found that the Medicare hotline failed to give seniors \ncorrect information on one key question--which plan offered the lowest \ncosts for individuals taking a given set of drugs--almost 60 percent of \nthe time.\n  And what about some of the other funding devoted to promoting the \ndrug benefit? CMS spent some of the funds on a bus tour. In 2003 CMS \nspent $600,000 to promote Medicare with a blimp at football games. And \nother funding went to Ketchum Communications, which produced simulated \nnews reports on the drug program. In 2004, the GAO found that these \nvideos violated the government ban on publicity and propaganda.\n  We can do better. We can promote the drug benefit in more cost-\neffective ways by appropriately funding SHIPs. Recent findings from the \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission underscore this assertion. A \nrecent study by MedPAC suggests that only 1 in 5 people used the \nMedicare hotline and only 1 in 10 used the Medicare Web site to make \ndecisions about their Medicare drug coverage.\n  And even though this year's enrollment deadline is almost upon us, \nthe hard work is not over. Enrollment in the Medicare drug benefit is \nstill too low in many States. In Montana, 40 percent of people with \nMedicare still don't have any form of drug coverage. A study released \nyesterday by Families USA estimates that most people who haven't signed \nup have low income and would qualify for the extra help that Congress \nincluded in the drug benefit.\n  We need to increase SHIP funding to help meet challenges that lie \nahead. My amendment would provide $25 million for States to expand \ntheir SHIP activities. Funds also would be available for innovative \nprograms in States where Medicare drug coverage is low. And funds would \nbe available to CMS to promote the existence and services of SHIPs.\n  As the new program evolves, many people with Medicare and their \nfamilies will have even greater need for a reliable source of impartial \nadvice. And more needs to be done to help low-income people enroll. \nMany of us voted for the drug benefit because we believed it would help \npeople who need help the most. Let's make that happen in every \ncommunity in every State. Let's devote resources to a program that \nworks. Let's help thousands of volunteers help our seniors. Let's \nincrease vital resources for the State Health Insurance Assistance \nProgram.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support America's small \nbusinesses. I know how important small businesses are to the health of \nthe economy and to the communities that\n\n[[Page S4457]]\n\nthey serve. I know that small businesses are struggling to provide \nhealth care for their workers. We should move to offer small businesses \nreasonable solutions. I commend Senator Enzi for tackling such a tough \nissue, but this bill would ultimately end up increasing the cost of \nhealth care coverage for those that need it most.\n  We need to be talking about improving health care for all Americans \nat any age and making the care more affordable for patients, as well as \nemployers. American families are feeling stressed and strained, facing \nthe ballooning cost of health care. Health care coverage is one of the \nmost important issues facing Americans who are worried they will lose \ncoverage, and won't be able to afford the care they need.\n  It is true having health insurance is crucial but it cannot be just \nany health care packet; it must be a comprehensive packet. One of the \nbig problems with Senator Enzi's bill is allowing insurance companies, \ninstead of State-elected legislators who speak for their constituents, \ndecide the benefits that consumers should have when they purchase \nhealth care.\n  The benefits I am most concerned about protecting are preventive \nservices. There is a reason that so many of these benefits mandated by \nStates are preventive service--they wouldn't have been included \notherwise. There is a reason Maryland guarantees access to \nmammography--insurers were not covering it. There is a reason that \ndiabetic equipment and supplies are a guaranteed benefit--beneficiaries \nwere complaining that they couldn't get the supplies covered.\n  Imagine being diagnosed with diabetes--there are in fact 21 million \nAmericans who have received just this diagnosis. Then imagine being \ntold you must carefully check your blood sugar to keep your disease in \ncontrol--but your insurance company won't pay for this? The American \nDiabetes Association estimates that it costs $13,243 for every patient \nto manage their disease. This is what health insurance is for. Most \nStates have recognized the importance of guaranteeing coverage for \ndiabetes supplies and education and have passed laws that provide this \ncoverage to residents in State-regulated health plans. We must not undo \nwhat these States have identified as important covered services.\n  And what about mammograms? Breast cancer is the most common cancer \namong women, accounting for nearly one of every three cancers diagnosed \nin the United States. Over 40,000 deaths from breast cancer are \nanticipated this year alone. Screening and early detection are critical \nfor decreasing the mortality rates of breast cancer. Our reduction in \ncancer mortality depends on the increased use of mammography screenings \nfor early detection of this disease.\n  I have worked hard in Congress to ensure women have access to quality \nmammogram care. I authored the Mammography Quality Standards Act, MQSA, \nover 10 years ago. This improved the quality of mammograms by setting \nfederal safety and quality standards for mammography facilities. This \nincludes personnel, equipment and operating procedures. Before MQSA \nbecame law, there was a patchwork of standards for mammography in this \ncountry. Radiation levels used on patients varied widely, equipment was \nshoddy, and physicians often didn't have proper training. I went to \nwork in Congress to set national standards, helping to make mammograms \na more safe and reliable tool for detecting breast cancer.\n  My own State of Maryland is one of the many States that mandates \ninsurers provide mammography screening. We know this saves lives. \nMaryland also mandates insurers provide coverage for breast cancer \npatients who participate in clinical trials, so we can work toward a \ncure for breast cancer.\n  Covering services that prevent health conditions is not only sound \nhealth policy, it is sound fiscal policy. By finding and treating \ndiseases early we will save the U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars. In \nfact, it is the only real way to really decrease the cost of health \ncare in this country.\n  Knowing how important health insurance coverage is for small \nbusinesses, I have joined 26 of my Senate colleagues to support the \nSmall Employers Health Benefits Program, SEHBP, which gives small \nbusinesses affordable choices among private health insurance plans and \nexpands access to health care coverage for their employees. The SEHBP \nwould allow small businesses across America to band together for lower \nhealth care prices by pooling their purchasing power and spreading \ntheir risk over a large number of participants. Employers would qualify \nfor an annual tax credit to partially offset contributions on behalf of \nlow-income employees.\n  I came to the Senate to change lives and save lives. We need to \nguarantee that more Americans have access to services that prevent and \ntreat chronic illness. Unfortunately, S. 1955 will not do this and in \nfact this bill will compromise the coverage people already have. I will \ncontinue to work toward a solution for affordable health care for \npatients and employers. I will fight to make a difference. Together, we \ncan change lives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe we have 10 minutes. I yield 5 \nminutes to the Senator from Connecticut and I will yield myself the \nremaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts and \nvery quickly say to our good friend from Wyoming as well, I appreciate \nhis interest in the subject matter and his concern about it. I want to \npoint out to our colleagues why I am terribly disappointed with the \nprocedures we have been confronted with this evening dealing with this \nlegislation.\n  In committee we spent quite a bit of time and had some rather close \nvotes, tie votes on a number of amendments that were not adopted to the \nunderlying bill.\n  I raise two issues here in the very short time we have remaining. \nFirst is the process itself. This is the Senate. This Chamber \nhistorically is the place where debate occurs. To have a process here \nthis evening on an issue where we have dedicated the entire week to \nhealth care and then to basically lock out any amendments that might be \noffered to this proposal runs contrary to the very essence of this \nbody.\n  Whether or not you are impressed with the substance of this bill, if \nyou believe the Senate ought to be heard on a variety of issues \nrelating to the subject matter--when the amendment tree has been \nentirely filled, then obviously we are dealing with a process that \nought not to be. Even if you are supportive of the bill, it seems to me \nthe Senate ought to be a place where we can offer amendments, have \nhealthy debate over a reasonable time, and then come to closure on the \nsubject matter.\n  I am terribly disappointed. I know there are relevant issues and \nirrelevant issues. Members wanted to talk about things such as \nextending the time on the Medicare proposal. It is going to expire on \nMay 15. That is not an unreasonable proposal, in a Health Care Week, \nwhen you are debating these subject matters. My colleagues wanted to \ntalk about prescription drugs, to spend an hour or two out of the \nentire week to debate whether we ought to have a different proposal \nregarding prescription drugs. I don't think that is asking too much of \nthis body, for one small debate about an issue that is so important to \npeople. Even amendments designed to help small business would have been \nprohibited from being offered here as a result of this process. I am \nterribly disappointed that we are not going to have a chance to talk \nabout this bill in a broader context where Members could bring their \nideas to the debate.\n  The second issue deals with the substance itself. My colleagues ought \nto take note. The key word here is preempts, because this bill preempts \nour States--each and every one of us--from having the kind of health \ncare benefits that have been debated and discussed and adopted by our \nrespective States. We each have unique problems. I mentioned earlier \nthis week in this debate, Lyme disease is a huge issue in my State. It \noriginated and was discovered in the town of Lyme, CT. I live 2 miles \naway from Lyme, CT. People in my State are deeply worried about that \nissue. So the State of Connecticut in its wisdom adopted as part of its \nhealth\n\n[[Page S4458]]\n\ncare plan a requirement that insurance cover Lyme disease.\n  I recognize that may not be an issue in the State of some other \nMember. But we ought to allow Connecticut and every other of the 49 \nStates to decide how they can best serve their constituents, their \npeople, when it comes to health care coverage. This bill preempts my \nState from deciding whether they can cover certain problems that are \nunique to my part of the country.\n  And second, of course, we preempt the States when it comes to setting \nany kind of rating rules. That is a critical issue because even if you \nhave a comprehensive plan, if you allow the industry to price those \nproducts way beyond the reach of the average person, then de facto they \nare eliminated. So we preempt them on what they can cover and we \npreempt the States from determining what the prices ought to be for the \ninsurance products that will be sold.\n  I point out to my colleagues, not a single Governor has supported \nthis bill. Not a single attorney general, not a single insurance \ncommissioner. Over 200 health care organizations have said this bill is \nflawed and it ought not to be approved.\n  We are urging our colleagues to reject this proposal. Listen, if you \nwill, to what a business organization in my State had to say about this \nbill. The Connecticut Business and Industry Association represents \n5,000 small businesses in the State of Connecticut. They said:\n\n       We believe that in Connecticut federally certified AHPs \n     would destabilize the small business insurance marketplace, \n     erode carefully crafted consumer protections and raise \n     premium rates for small businesses with older workforces and \n     those that employ people with chronic illnesses or \n     disabilities.\n\n  That is a business organization representing 5,000 small employers. \nThis is not an organization that says those words lightly.\n  For those reasons, for process and procedure, as well as preempting \nstate benefits and rating rules, this bill ought to be rejected. I urge \nmy colleagues to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we have 5 minutes. Will the \nChair let me know when I have 30 seconds remaining, please.\n  I want to pay tribute to my two colleagues who are in support of \nthis, Senator Enzi and Senator Nelson. Senator Enzi and I, and \nDemocrats on our committee and Republicans alike, have worked very long \nand hard on a whole range of different issues.\n  We have made important progress. We are going to continue to do so, \nbut we take exception on this issue.\n  I commend the staff as well for all of their good work and help and \nassistance.\n  Senator Nelson, who has been enormously concerned about the problems \nof small business, has talked about this issue with me and, I know, \nwith other Members here on different occasions. He was such a strong \nvoice when we were considering the Patients Bill of Rights legislation. \nI always enjoy working with him, although we have a different position \non this issue.\n  We are in the last few minutes of this debate and discussion. In \nthese last few minutes, I want to join with those who have expressed a \ncertain amount of frustration in being unable to address maybe a \nhandful of different health care issues that I find are of concern to \nthe people of my State. In traveling around the country, people are \nconcerned about the prescription drug program. They are concerned about \nthe high cost of prescription drugs. They are concerned about the \nproblems small business has. But we do not believe the proposed \nsolution that has been advanced by Senators Enzi and Nelson is really \nthe best way. We have had a brief debate over this proposal and over an \nalternative way that we think would be more comprehensive, more \nrealistic, and more expansive than reaching the 1 percent or 2 percent \nof those who are uninsured and who, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, will be covered under the Enzi proposal.\n  The reasons the insurance commissioners have serious reservations, \nthe reasons the Governors and the attorneys general have taken \nexception to this legislation, are very important and have been stated \nagain and again; first is this bill's effective preemption of a number \nof the very important benefits that my State of Massachusetts and a \ngreat number of the States in this country have been willing to write \ninto law, to provide protections for their citizens. These protections \nare in the area of cancer, in the area of cancer screening, in the area \nof mental health, in the area of diabetes, and well-baby care. State \nlaws have effectively been preempted. The people of my State will no \nlonger be assured of those kinds of protections, if this legislation \npasses.\n  The second point, which has been raised again and again, is the \nquestion of raising premiums. In the legislation we refer to this as \nrating. In the initial Enzi proposal, it would have been possible to \nhave a 25-fold variation in the cost of insurance premiums--from $100 \nto $2,500--based upon your age, your past health history, or that of \nyour family. We know what would happen.\n  When you allow such variation, you are denying people an effective \nhealth insurance program. That is what Blue Cross-Blue Shield says in \nMassachusetts, my own State. They basically say that younger people \nwill be able to have insurance, but the older people and families who \nhave had health care challenges will be knocked off, unable to afford \nit.\n  What will happen? These people will go to the public health clinics, \nwith the State having to pick up the cost. That is what Blue Cross-Blue \nShield in my State says. This proposal is a shifting of the cost.\n  In this very excellent letter, which I will ask to have printed in \nthe Record, Blue Cross-Blue Shield in my State has been ranked among \nthe top five plans in the Nation by U.S. News & World Report.\n  In this letter, Blue Cross-Blue Shield warns us about preempting the \nState regulations of rating and benefit requirements. They say do not \ndo this. It will have a bad effect on our seniors. It will increase the \nnumber of uninsured and transfer the costs back to the public. The \ntaxpayers will pick it up.\n  We believe Blue Cross-Blue Shield and the other organizations that \nhave been identified are correct. This bill should not pass at this \ntime. We are prepared to work with the Senators from Wyoming and \nNebraska to try to deal with these health care challenges.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the aforementioned letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                            Blue Cross Blue Shield\n\n\n                                             of Massachusetts,\n\n                                                     May 10, 2006.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of Blue Cross Blue Shield \n     of Massachusetts, I am writing to express our opposition to \n     S. 1955 (``the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization \n     Act''). The legislation being considered by the United States \n     Senate will completely undermine the historic health care \n     achievements made by Massachusetts for which you played a \n     critical role.\n       At Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, we are \n     committed to providing access to affordable, quality health \n     care to the citizens of Massachusetts. With over 2.9 million \n     members, we are proud to be ranked among the top five health \n     plans in the nation by U.S. News & World Report and the \n     National Committee for Quality Assurance.\n       As you know, S. 1955 preempts state regulations as to \n     rating and benefit requirements. In so doing, it seriously \n     destabilizes the small group market nationally and critically \n     disrupts states, like Massachusetts, that utilize community \n     rating. Under Enzi, medical underwriting is permitted as are \n     premium surcharges based on age, gender, geography and group \n     size. In Massachusetts, older and sicker individuals will \n     face increased premiums, as will the self-employed and \n     smaller businesses.\n       Despite its intended goal, the Enzi legislation will \n     actually lead to a rise in the uninsured in Massachusetts as \n     older, sicker workers lose coverage. According to a recent \n     study by the Lewin Group, there will be an increase of over \n     37,000 uninsured in Massachusetts with an associated rise in \n     uncompensated care costs of over $8 million. Needless to say, \n     this places a further strain on our health centers, community \n     hospitals, urban medical centers as they see increased \n     uninsured and unhealthy individuals.\n       The Enzi legislation takes a completely different tact to \n     increasing access to affordable insurance than the \n     Massachusetts health reform bill. The Massachusetts approach \n     seeks to pool risk and optimize coverage to benefit the \n     community. S. 1955 would lower costs for individual groups by\n\n[[Page S4459]]\n\n     basing their rate on their own particular risk and minimizing \n     coverage. The Enzi approach may serve to increase access to \n     young and healthy small groups but does so at the expense of \n     older and sicker populations. From a philosophical and \n     practical standpoint, the two approaches cannot coexist.\n       The impossible dream, to which you so eloquently spoke, of \n     quality health care that will truly be available and \n     affordable for each and every man, woman, and child in our \n     state, will become just that--impossible--if S. 1955 is \n     allowed to pass.\n       We thank you for your ongoing efforts for our shared goals \n     of ensuring access to affordable, quality health care to the \n     citizens of the nation and our state of Massachusetts and \n     urge you to continue to vigorously oppose S. 1955 so that it \n     fails in the Senate.\n       As always, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Cleve L. Killingsworth.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, actions speak louder than words. People are \ngoing to have a chance in a little while to show some action for small \nbusiness. Once in a while there is a moment when you have a chance to \nmake a difference.\n  Today, most of the Democrats appear to be willing to sacrifice that \nmoment to make a statement. They are saying we cannot give small \nbusiness anything until we have votes on stem cells, until we have \nvotes on prescription drugs, until we have votes on drug importation, \nand to heck with the small businesses. What kind of an attitude is \nthat?\n  The Democrats' argument is: We are going to deny small business \nanything until we get them everything. Of course, they are promising \neverything in their bill.\n  Let us get this clear. The Democrats care so much about families \nemployed by small business that they are willing to keep them from \nhaving any insurance until they find a way to provide everything they \nthink they need. Spare me the care. We have a lot of smokescreens. One \nof the smokescreens is the process did not allow them to have votes.\n  I asked unanimous consent a little while ago, and I said I will \nguarantee you a vote on Durbin-Lincoln. I will guarantee you debate on \nDurbin-Lincoln. I will let that happen right after cloture.\n  The reason that has to happen is because of the process of the \nSenate; otherwise, they only get a vote and they still block me from \ngetting a vote on this bill that has been worked out with the insurance \ncompanies, with the insurance commissioners, and with the associations.\n  That is a smokescreen. There is going to be a vote on whether we care \nto debate some more on small business. There can be amendments after \ncloture. Amendments will allow you to cover everything that has been \nmentioned over here, whether it is ratings or whether it is mandates.\n  Let me tell you that mandates is another smokescreen. Where this has \nbeen done inside States, the companies that had the right not to have \nmandates, it covers the ones that you mentioned. This is about being \nable to have enough opportunity to expand across State lines where \nthere are 1,800 different mandates. You have to be able to get them \ntogether so that small businesses can go together across State lines \nand gather a big enough pool to effectively negotiate against insurance \ncompanies.\n  Yes, there are some insurance companies that are writing letters \nsaying: Do not let them do this. There is a profit motive. I can't \nblame them for that. But what the small businesspeople are really \nasking for on that is the same thing that big businesses have. We \nalready excluded big business from all of the mandates and the \noversight by States. We are not going that far.\n  We even have some provisions in there, and I am sure with some \namendments there would be some mandates in there. Here is where the \nsavings come in for these small businesses. I am extremely excited \nabout this.\n  The cost for administration for a small business policy is about 35 \npercent. If you check with Wal-Mart, which is excluded from everything \nand gets to have their own plan, their cost of administration is 8 \npercent. The savings are in the administration. That is 27 percent \nwhich they save.\n  For every 1 percent of savings, insurance brings in 200,000 to \n300,000 people into the market.\n  There are 27 million uninsured small businesspeople and employees out \nthere. They are like families.\n  I was talking to Senator Harkin. He was telling me about a small \nbusinessman he knows. These small businesses are kind of interesting. \nThey go to church with the same people who work for them. They go to \nwatch baseball with the same people who work for them. Their kids are \nin the same little league. They go to the same organizations. And this \nsmall businessman said: I have to tell them that I can't afford the \ninsurance anymore. And I still want to live with them. I want my family \nto have insurance, but that is not going to happen.\n  This is an opportunity to make a difference, to offer amendments to \nperfect the bill in whatever way the majority of people think needs to \nbe done. Anything else is a smokescreen.\n  I gave them an opportunity to vote on Durbin-Lincoln. I gave them an \nopportunity to vote on this, but it was an assurance that we would get \nto vote on both, so small business would get a vote. There is going to \nbe a vote on small business.\n  There are hundreds of people around the Capitol right now who are \nwith small business who are saying: We need the opportunity to have a \nbetter health care plan. Some of them will get insurance for the first \ntime; some will get a better health insurance plan.\n  As an accountant, I have to remind you that this is not a case of \nsubtraction. This insurance plan is an addition. We are bringing in \nnewly insured people. Anybody who votes against cloture needs to go to \ntheir dry cleaners tonight to pick up their laundry and look that \nperson in the eye and say: I do not think you deserve health insurance \nbecause you might not demand enough for yourself. So you know what? I \nsaved you from yourself. Can you say that to the mom and pop running \nthe business down the street from your home? Can you say that they do \nnot deserve health insurance? As you go home today after you leave the \nHill, think about the people around you, the regular people--the cab \ndriver, the worker at the dry cleaners, the person in the neighborhood \nrestaurant, all of those people you may not notice who really make the \nworld operate. Many of them do not have any insurance. Some may even \nown that little restaurant around the corner and still not be able to \nafford the insurance. I am not talking about deluxe insurance; I am \ntalking about any insurance.\n  So please overlook the smokescreen and vote to have some more debate \nand amendments and a vote on a small business health plan.\n  I yield the floor and yield the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture on the pending modified substitute \namendment to Calendar No. 417, S. 1955, Health Insurance Marketplace \nModernization and Affordability Act of 2005.\n       The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending \n     modified substitute amendment to Calendar No. 417, S. 1955, \n     Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability \n     Act of 2006.\n         Bill Frist, Johnny Isakson, Sam Brownback, John Thune, \n           Thad Cochran, Wayne Allard, John Ensign, Richard \n           Shelby, Larry Craig, Ted Stevens, John McCain, Lamar \n           Alexander, Norm Coleman, Judd Gregg, John E. Sununu, \n           Pat Roberts, Craig Thomas.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent the mandatory quorum call \nhas been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmodified substitute amendment to Calendar No. 417, S. 1955, the Health \nInsurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act of 2005 shall \nbe brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now \nbe a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for \nup to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Hawaii for his \nkindness.\n  I want to thank everybody who has been involved in the debate on \nsmall business over the last several days. I thank Senator Nelson for \nthe hours he and his staff put in working with me on this bill, along \nwith Senator Burns and his staff. I have said several times that our \nstaffs worked in the same room with the same people from the different \ncoalitions, including the insurance companies and the insurance \ncommissioners, for so long that I thought some of them must be related. \nI really wasn't sure which ones were from whose staff anymore, either, \nbecause they were all working this important issue together. Obviously, \nwe have some more work to do, but I am pleased with the vote we got.\n  I am disappointed that we didn't get the 60 and couldn't continue the \ndebate right now, that we couldn't have amendments right now and for \nthe next several days, resulting in a vote-arama that would have put \nthe best possible face on it that we could from the Senate. I talked to \nSenator Kennedy before and promised I would preconference it with the \nHouse before we did anything because this is a very critical bill. But \nthis is the first time the Senate has gotten it to a cloture vote. We \nwill only get it to cloture by working with people and getting some \nagreement. I am hoping we can bring this back up yet this year. I know \nthere are small businesses that are going to be asking, pleading, \nbegging that it be brought up again this year. Perhaps we can work some \nchanges in the meantime that might make a difference and get us over \nthat 60-vote margin. It is a little tougher in the Senate to pass than \nin the House because they only have to have a mere majority. We have to \nhave that 60 percent which is a little bit tougher.\n  Senator Kennedy and I have worked together on a lot of bills. I \nappreciate the courtesy he gave in committee. We had 68 amendments. We \nfinished the work in two half days. That is probably a record around \nhere for any committee which does show some cooperation. I am just \nsorry we didn't get to do the amendments like we did in committee, \nprobably many of the same ones we had in committee. I guess my strategy \nwas that those votes might put it over the top here and bring a few \npeople in. I didn't know there would be such strong resentment built up \nby this time.\n  Of course, I am extremely disappointed with the cancer society and \nthe diabetes society because I have never seen a letter that said, I \ndon't care what you do, vote against this bill. That means if we had \ndone the Cadillac of diabetes care and put it in the bill, they were \nstill suggesting that people vote against it. That is unconscionable on \nbehalf of the people that have diabetes or the people who have cancer. \nBoth letters said the same thing. It was truly a disappointment to me.\n  I know some opposition was built for this bill. The insurance \ncompanies said they would be neutral. I noticed there was a little \nunneutrality there. But the small businessmen will be coming to town. \nThey will be talking to people and expecting us to do something. I hope \nwe can continue to do so.\n  There are a whole list of people I need to thank, but I will defer \nfor the moment for some others to speak and come back and do that \nlater.\n  I appreciate the fact that we were able to have a cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see the principal cosponsor on his \nfeet. If he might indulge me for a moment, I want to give assurance to \nthe small businesses and families of this country, we are not going \naway. We are all very strongly committed to getting decent, quality \nhealth care for all Americans. Today, we avoided taking a step \nbackward. But we have heard the very eloquent statement of the Senator, \nmy friend from Wyoming, who said he believes we missed an important \nopportunity to step forward. What I hope Americans will understand is \nthat we have worked very closely together. We are committed to working \nclosely together. We are going to try to find common ground in this \narea.\n  I again thank Senator Enzi for his leadership on health issues. I \nlook forward to trying to find common ground on health care and other \nareas. I am grateful to him for all his courtesies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished \ncochair of the committee for his courtesies.\n  Naturally, I am disappointed with the outcome of the vote. Instead of \nthinking of it as a setback, I want to think of it as a step forward, \nbecause it is the first time since I came to the Senate that we have \nhad a serious debate about the accessability and affordability of \nhealth care for small businesses.\n  I thank Senator Enzi for his great work. It has been a pleasure \nworking directly with him. Not only is he tireless, he certainly is \nwilling to listen to other people and has shown a great capacity to \nlisten and to act on good advice. I thank him for that. He was able to \nbring together groups that had been on opposing sides for years. \nThrough his leadership, this bill was brought to the floor.\n  I also thank his staff. I appreciate all the assistance they have \ngiven me as we have developed this legislation. They are true \nprofessionals: Steve Northrup and Andrew Patzman have devoted hours to \nresearching and drafting the legislation and have so diligently reached \nout to my side of the aisle for suggestions, I now think of them as my \nsatellite staff.\n  I also thank Katherine McGuire, who has been instrumental in guiding \nus through this process, and Brittany Moore, who has coordinated all of \nour information.\n  Particularly, I thank Senator Kennedy for his gracious and agreeable \nmanner in disagreeing on the substance of an issue. It is typical of \nhis approach to the Senate. Especially I thank his staff: David Bowen, \nStacey Sachs, and Brian Hickey from the Democratic Policy Committee. \nThey have kept us on our toes.\n\n[[Page S4461]]\n\n  The staff of the leadership offices also has been helpful. I thank \nJay Khosla, a newcomer, and Liz Hall, a veteran, for their help. And \nparticularly I thank my staff, both Kim Zimmerman and Amy Tejral, and \nothers who have worked so hard to get us to this point.\n  Even though not all of my colleagues on this side of the aisle agree \nthat this bill is the right answer for small businesses, I know and \nrespect the fact that they want to find a solution. We all in the \nSenate want to find a solution, something that will deal with the \navailability and affordability of health care for small businesses and \ntheir employees. I am tonight encouraged that with this discussion, we \nwill be able to move together and work together to find a common \nsolution. Sometimes right after disagreement, there is a solution that \nis achieved.\n  I thank my colleagues on this side of the aisle for their willingness \nto listen and my friends for their votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me join in thanking all Members who \nhave been engaged in the debate. Although it did not result in the \npassage of a bill, I hope we did make progress.\n  First, let me congratulate again Senator Enzi for showing the courage \nto bring this matter to the floor. Very few Senators have done that. He \ndid not succeed at this moment, but I believe his determination and the \nrespect we all have for him will lead to a victory at another day, and \nI hope to be part of it. He showed himself to be genuine, committed to \nthis issue. The small businesses who have entrusted him with this \nassignment couldn't have picked a better Senator. I would say the same \nfor my colleague from Nebraska, Mr. Nelson. His knowledge extends back \nto his tenure as insurance commissioner as well as Governor. He \ncertainly understands this issue better than most. I thank both of them \nfor the personal commitment they made to this issue.\n  I also thank my colleague Senator Blanche Lincoln. She and I worked \ntogether on this bill, and I couldn't have had a better partner. \nBlanche is down to earth. She understands these complicated issues and \nexplains them the way the average person can understand them.\n  This is a matter I have been thinking about for a long time. I didn't \ncome up with this notion in just the last few weeks. In fact, it has \nbeen months now since I invited Senator Enzi and many others to come to \nmy office and listen as we explained what our concept was in hopes that \nwe might work toward common ground. We weren't able to do that this \ntime, but I hope we will the next time. I genuinely hope that those who \nwant to engage in this important debate will have a similar starting \npoint to our bill.\n  The first and obvious question that anyone should ask is: Senator, \nwhy do you propose health insurance for the rest of America that you \nwouldn't buy yourself? The health insurance we have as Members of \nCongress is the same health insurance Federal employees have, 8 million \nof them nationwide. My dream was to take that kind of group of 8 \nmillion diverse people who work for small businesses and create the \nsame mechanism, the same pool so they could enjoy the same protection, \nthe same benefits I have and my family has and the Members of the \nSenate have. If this health insurance is good enough for a Member of \nCongress, it is good enough for any American family. It should be our \nstarting point.\n  Senator Enzi raised an important question. Why did so many health \ngroups oppose his legislation? Some of them stridently opposed it. He \nmentioned two, the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes \nAssociation. The reason they felt so strongly was that the legislation \nproposed on the other side eliminated the protections being offered by \nStates for important cancer screening, for mental health care. Some 42 \nStates cover mental illness, and the Enzi bill would have eliminated \nthat coverage. When it comes to diabetes, it is true that at some point \nhe could have offered diabetes coverage, but they are concerned that if \nthis is a moving target, it could change tomorrow. That is why we have \nto get back to where we are as Senators, Congressmen, and Federal \nemployees. We know what we are going to have. We know our protection. \nWe can buy it. Shouldn't every American have that confidence and that \npeace of mind?\n  That is the starting point. The starting point is not reducing the \nprotections and guarantees in coverage to such a low level that it \nleaves families exposed to medical ruin if the bills go too high. We \nshould strike a balance which says that these preventive procedures, \nthese screening procedures, this basic health insurance is what every \nAmerican should have. It is much like a minimum wage. What we are \ntalking about is the minimum guarantees of health insurance across \nAmerica.\n  I know there are some things that are too expensive for us ever to \ncover in every health insurance plan, and we wouldn't suggest those. \nBut if we have coverage for 8 million Federal employees with basic \nprotection, why wouldn't we offer that to every American family? That \nshould be our starting point. Then let's figure how we can work \ntogether with small business and with the health community to strike \nthe right balance so the bill we produce will be one of which we will \nbe proud.\n  Again, I thank Senator Enzi. I didn't believe we would ever have this \ndebate on the Senate floor. I had almost given up hope. But because of \nhis dogged determination, his skill and dedication, he brought us \ntogether for this week. It is not the end of the debate. I believe it \nis the beginning. I hope it ends with passage of a bill for small \nbusinesses across America and will bring us closer to the goal of \nuniversal health insurance coverage for every single American. I think \nwe can achieve that goal if we work together in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I had intended to present a list of people \nwho worked for me, but a question was asked. I assume it was \nrhetorical, but I can't let it pass. The question--to me, I assume--\nwas, why offer what you wouldn't buy for yourself for others?\n  If I were in small business--and I was--and I was faced with rising \nhealth costs--and I was--I would have been happy to have been able to \nbuy this insurance for my employees. There is a whole different level \nof living out there. It is called small business. We usually think if \nyou are in small business, you are making lots of money. A lot of times \nthe employees are making more than the bosses. The bosses buy insurance \nbecause that is how they insure their family and they get a group. That \nhelps them, too. But when you have a group, that means that the people \nin the group get exactly the same insurance you do. You don't get the \nsame package as the Senate.\n  I will admit that the Senate has a pretty nice package. I would also \nlike to tell you, though, that when I was in small business, when I was \nin the accounting business, I had a better package than I have in the \nSenate. So it is available out there. It costs a lot of money. I was \ntrying to find some way to bring that cost down.\n  On your bill that you would have liked for everybody in America to \nhave--the same thing as the Federal employees--it didn't get there. I \nwould have been happy to have had a vote on that and had that debate. I \noffered you that opportunity. I wish you would have taken me up on it. \nWe would have had cloture. We would have had a vote on your bill, and \nwe would have had a vote on my bill. That is all it took. It just took \na few more votes and we would have had the 60, and small business would \nhave had some resolution tonight that they are not going to have.\n  You have to remember that everybody isn't living at the same level \nout there, and we have to watch out for those small businessmen because \nthey are the ones who are taking care of the backbone needs of this \ncountry every single day.\n  I apologize for going on with a little bit more debate. I thank the \nSenator from Hawaii. I do need to express some thanks because there are \na couple people here that are on this list that I have to keep away \nfrom ledges and high buildings yet tonight. They have devoted their \nlife for about the last year and 5 months to this, every day that they \npossibly could, and through the nights and the weekends, and we came up \nwith this bill, working with\n\n[[Page S4462]]\n\nsome unusual groups. I particularly have to thank Andrew Patzman for \nhis patience, ingenuity, capability, and his constant work. Of course, \nSteve Northrop probably helped a lot on that because he has a fine \nsense of humor and an extremely quick wit. That helped us out in a lot \nof those situations where we were trying to pull everything together \nafter a long time.\n\n  I thank Katherine McGuire, who is the director of the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee. While we are doing this, we \nare also trying to do the pensions conference and a whole bunch of \nother things. I don't know of anybody who has the capability that she \nhas to juggle as many things at one time as she does and still do a \ngreat job of being a mother. I have some really good people.\n  I could go through a whole list and mention Flip McConnaughy, my \nChief of Staff, who held everything together for all of the Wyoming \nissues and my Wyoming staff. I will just mention some of these other \npeople more quickly. The same kind of thanks to them, and I know what \nthey have done to help out. Brittany, Tod Spangler, Craig Orfield, Ryan \nTaylor; and then from Senator Gregg's staff, Conwell Smith and David \nFisher; from Senator Talent's staff, Faith Cristol; from Senator \nSnowe's staff, Alex Hecht and Wes Coulam; from Senator Ben Nelson's \nstaff, Kim Zimmerman and Amy Terrell; from Senator Isakson's staff, \nBrittany Espy; from Senator Hatch's staff, Pattie DeLoatche and Roger \nJohns; from legislative counsel, Bill Baird has just done tremendous \nwork with us; from Senator Frist's staff, the leader, Elizabeth Hall \nand May Khosla and Charlotte Ivancic; from Senator Ensign's staff, \nMichelle Spence; from Senator McConnell's staff, Scott Raab and Laura \nPemberton; from Senator Burr's staff, Jenny Hansen; from Senator \nAlexander's staff, Page Kranbuhl; from Senator Roberts' staff, Jennifer \nSwenson; from Senator DeWine's staff, Melissa Atkinson and Karla \nCarpenter.\n  That is a whole group of people who have spent days, nights, and \nweekends working on this bill and making it possible to put together \nwhat we have.\n  I know they are dedicated to it and they will continue to work and we \nwill work across the aisle and look forward to getting something done \nfor small business. I know small business will be asking--perhaps even \ndemanding--but there is a need out there. I hope everybody will \nrecognize that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/11/senate-section/article/S4462-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4462-S4463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise once again to discuss legislation I \nhave introduced to extend the federal policy of self-governance and \nself-determination to Hawaii's indigenous peoples. S. 147 would provide \nparity in the federal policies towards indigenous peoples in the 50 \nstates, to include American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native \nHawaiians.\n  To understand the importance of this legislation, one must understand \nHawaii's history. Despite the fact that the Congress passed P.L. 103-\n150, the Apology Resolution, which recites Hawaii's history, many of my \ncolleagues are unaware of our history. Let me provide some context of \nwhat we have experienced so that you might better understand the \nimportance of this bill to my state.\n  Captain James Cook landed in Hawaii in 1778. Prior to Western \ncontact, Native Hawaiians lived in an advanced society that was steeped \nin science. Native Hawaiians honored their land and environment, and \ntherefore developed methods of irrigation, agriculture, aquaculture, \nnavigation, medicine, fishing and other forms of subsistence whereby \nthe land and sea were efficiently used without waste or damage. Respect \nfor the environment and for others formed the basis of their culture \nand tradition.\n  The immediate and brutal decline of the Native Hawaiian population \nwas the most obvious result of contact with the West. Between Cook's \narrival and 1820, disease, famine, and war killed more than half of the \nNative Hawaiian population. This devastating population loss was \naccompanied by cultural, economic, and psychological destruction.\n  By the middle of the 19th century, the islands' small non-native \npopulation had come to wield an influence far in excess of its size. \nWesterners sought to limit the absolute power of the Hawaiian king over \ntheir legal rights and to implement property law so that they could \naccumulate and control land.\n  The mutual interests of Americans living in Hawaii and the United \nStates became increasingly clear as the 19th century progressed. \nAmerican merchants and planters in Hawaii wanted access to mainland \nmarkets and protection from European and Asian domination. The United \nStates developed a military and economic interest in placing Hawaii \nwithin its sphere of influence. In 1826, the United States and Hawaii \nentered into the first of the four treaties the two nations signed \nduring the 19th century.\n  The Kingdom of Hawaii, which began in 1810 under the leadership of \nKing Kamehameha the first, continued until 1893 when it was overthrown \nwith the help of the United States. The overthrow of the Kingdom is \neasily the most poignant part of Hawaii's history. Opponents of the \nbill have characterized the overthrow as the fault of Hawaii's last \nreigning monarch, Queen Lili'uokalani. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth.\n  America's already ascendant political influence in Hawaii was \nheightened by the prolonged sugar boom. Sugar planters were eager to \neliminate the United States' tariff on their exports to California and \nOregon. The 1875 Convention on Commercial Reciprocity, eliminated the \nAmerican tariff on sugar from Hawaii and virtually all tariffs that \nHawaii had placed on American products. It also prohibited Hawaii from \ngiving political, economic, or territorial preferences to any other \nforeign power. It also provided the United States with the right to \nestablish a military base at Pearl Harbor.\n  The business community, backed by the non-native military group, the \nHonolulu Rifles, forced the prime minister's resignation and the \nenactment of a new constitution. The new constitution--often referred \nto as the Bayonet Constitution--reduced the King to a figure of minor \nimportance. It extended the right to vote to Western males whether or \nnot they were citizens of the Hawaiian Kingdom. It disenfranchised \nalmost all native voters by giving only residents with a specified \nincome level or amount of property, the right to vote for members of \nthe House of Nobles. The representatives of propertied Westerners took \ncontrol of the legislature. The Bayonet constitution has been \ncharacterized as bringing democracy to Hawaii by opponents to S. 147. \nThe constitution was not about democracy--it was about a shift in power \nto business owners from natives.\n  On January 14, 1893, the Queen was prepared to promulgate a new \nconstitution, restoring the sovereign's control over the House of \nNobles and limiting the franchise to Hawaiian subjects. She was, \nhowever, forced to withdraw her proposed constitution. Despite the \nQueen's apparent acquiescence, a Committee of Public Safety was formed \nto overthrow the Kingdom.\n  On January 16, 1893, at the order of U.S. Minister John Stevens, \nAmerican Marines marched through Honolulu, to a building known as Arion \nHall, located near both the government building and the Hawaiian \npalace. The next day, local revolutionaries seized the government \nbuilding and demanded that Queen Lili'uokalani abdicate. Stevens \nimmediately recognized the rebels' provisional government and placed it \nunder the United States' protection.\n  I was deeply saddened by allegations made by opponents of this \nlegislation that the overthrow was done to maintain democratic \nprinciples over a despotic monarch. As you can tell by the history I \njust shared, our Queen was trying to restore the Kingdom to its native \npeoples after Western influence had so greatly diminished the rights of \nthe native peoples in Hawaii. Colleagues, I want to ensure that you \nunderstand our true history and the bravery and courage of our Queen, \nwho abdicated her throne after seeing U.S. Marines marching through the \nstreets of Honolulu. She did so to save her people.\n  Mr. President, I also want to discuss the diversity of Hawaii's \npeople. As I've\n\n[[Page S4463]]\n\nsaid before, we celebrate our diversity as the sharing of our cultures, \ntraditions, and languages; it is what makes us so special in Hawaii. \nOur diversity unifies us.\n  Colleagues, I want you to know that during the period of the Kingdom, \nmany people traveled through and to Hawaii. In 1832, records indicate \nthat there were 400 foreigners in Hawaii. Starting in 1852, sugar \nplantations began to recruit foreign workers to Hawaii. They included \nChinese, Portuguese, Japanese, and Filipino workers. While many of \nthese workers were temporary and returned to their homelands, a number \nof them stayed in Hawaii and have embraced the culture and traditions \nof Hawaii's indigenous peoples.\n  The opponents of this legislation first tried to represent this issue \nas a native vs. non-native issue. They failed to understand how we \ncelebrate diversity in my home State and how so many embrace all things \nHawaiian whether or not they can trace their lineage back to the \naboriginal, indigenous peoples of Hawaii. The opponents also fail to \nunderstand the tremendous respect the people of Hawaii have for Native \nHawaiian culture and the fact that the average person is not threatened \nby the idea of Native Hawaiians having recognition. The people of \nHawaii understand that the preservation of rights for Native Hawaiians \ndoes not happen to their detriment.\n  The opponents of this legislation have tried to spread misinformation \nabout the bill to lead non-Hawaiians to believe that their rights will \nbe taken away if the bill is passed. This is not true. In the days to \ncome I will elaborate more. Today, however, I wanted to share Hawaii's \nhistory and to explain the celebration of diversity and of \nmulticulturalism in my home state. I am proud of my constituents--proud \nof their many cultures and traditions--and the fact that they are \nsecure enough in their heritage to be able to support parity in federal \npolicies for Native Hawaiians.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in helping to do what is right, what \nis just for Native Hawaiians.\n  I look forward to the support that I will receive from my colleagues.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity to tell you about my \nhistory.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/11/senate-section/article/S4463-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TAX INCREASE PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a colloquy with \nthe majority leader, the Senator from Tennessee, regarding the \nreauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\nDetermination Act of 2000. This program is critical to bridge the gap \nin my State and others between what was, what is, and what will be the \nmanagement direction of Federal forests. For nearly 100 years, counties \nacross the country have shared in the productivity of Federal lands. \nThey have received 25 percent of revenues derived from commercial \nactivity on Forest Service lands, and under a separate statute--50 \npercent of BLM revenues derived from the O & C lands of western Oregon. \nIn areas that are dominated by Federal forests, these revenues also \ndominate county government budgets--budgets that pay for public \nschools, road maintenance and public safety.\n  This issue is not one of permanently replacing forest productivity \nwith a Government check. While I am a lead proponent of the safety net, \nwhich was not intended to be permanent, I have also tried very hard to \nrestore common sense, predictability and productivity to the management \nof Federal forests. These lands are both ecological and economic assets \nthat must be treated better.\n  Unfortunately, that day has not yet arrived. That is why we created a \nsafety net in 2000. That is why we also passed the Healthy Forests \nRestoration Act. That is why we must consider dealing with \npostcatastrophic event legislation, why we must continue funding the \nForest Service and BLM forest management programs and do the other \nthings that are needed to create real jobs in the woods and return \nviability to rural communities.\n  Again, the day when forests are ecologically and economically \nsustainable has not yet arrived. What has arrived is an impending \ndisaster if the county payments safety net is not extended. Oregon \ncounties are not alone facing the hard times. Places such as Clearwater \nCounty, ID; Chelan County, WA; and Siskiyou County, CA, will also be \ndevastated by failure to make a short-term extension of the Secure \nRural Schools Act.\n  A commitment from the majority leader to work with me to identify \noffsets for an extension of the Secure Rural Schools Act will embolden \nour efforts and reassure rural counties in my State that this issue is \nof the utmost importance to the Senate.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Senator from Oregon for his dedication to his \nState and all States that have been affected by the downturn in Federal \ntimber receipts. He has been in close contact with me, the assistant \nmajority leader and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee \ncommunicating the significance and urgency of his cause. I commit to \nhim to address the needs of rural counties and schools in Oregon and \nelsewhere. Working with the committees of jurisdiction, I commit to a \nthorough search for funding offsets so that these critical rural \neducation programs can continue to serve the youth of those \ncommunities.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am aware of Senator Smith's concerns and pledge to \nwork with him within the Finance Committee's jurisdiction, especially \nin the area of tax-exempt financing, to find the resources to assist \nthe hard-hit areas to which he refers.\n  Mr. SMITH. I appreciate the commitment of the Senator from Tennessee \nto help identify the needed offsets to extend the Secure Rural Schools \nprogram and look forward to working with him closely in the coming \nweeks. I also thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for his \nconsideration of this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/11/senate-section/article/S4463-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4463-S4464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  MEDICAL CARE ACCESS PROTECTION ACT OF 2006 AND HEALTHY MOTHERS AND \n                   HEALTHY BABIES ACCESS TO CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I regret that, twice this week, the Senate \nhas failed to address the problem of medical liability costs. I support \nS. 22, the Medical Care Access Protection Act of 2006, and S. 23, the \nHealthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act. Both of these \nbills would address the very real problem of access to medical care for \npeople in my State and across the country. We have a crisis in the \nUnited States, and in particular in Arizona, when it comes to the \navailability of providers.\n  The terrible distortions in our medical liability system have been \nwith us for years. In Arizona, we have seen emergency rooms that cannot \nremain open because there are not enough trauma surgeons and \nspecialists to staff the ER, physicians who have decided to move from \nmy State to States with more supportive medical liability law, and \nfinally, doctors who have opted to retire early. It is troubling to \nhave highly trained, dedicated, qualified members of the medical \ncommunity leave or to give up their profession--all to the detriment of \ntheir patients.\n  This shrinking availability of physicians is due in part to the high \ninsurance premiums that doctors are facing.\n\n[[Page S4464]]\n\nIn just 5 years, the premiums for general surgery in Arizona increased \nfrom $37,804 to $56,862--an increase of 50 percent. For obstetricians \nin Arizona, premiums in 2001 were $49,436 and are now averaging \n$72,734. These premiums are rising at a staggering rate in part because \njuries in malpractice cases have given high-dollar verdicts to \nplaintiffs. Some of the verdicts are merited; many, we know, are not. \nIn the end, these legal excesses damage the medical liability system, \npush up premiums, and lead to the early exodus of physicians. The \nsystem is broken and it is patients who suffer.\n  Hard-working men and women who need emergency medical treatment face \nlonger waiting times when there are too few physicians to staff \nhospitals. Instead of a few days, it takes weeks for children to be \nseen for complex conditions because of the lack of pediatric \nspecialists. Our seniors are forced to drive longer distances because \nthey are told that physicians are no longer seeing any new Medicare \npatients. The situation for both physicians and patients has grown \nbleak, and care is compromised.\n  We should address this by enacting meaningful medical liability \nreform. S. 22 provides full recovery of the cost of necessary medical \nexpenses and lost wages in a medical negligence case. When a wrong has \noccurred, it is important that the patient be able to gain a legal \nsettlement or verdict that meets his or her future needs. This has \nalways been a hallmark of medical liability legislation I have \nsupported because it is in the best interest of the patient. New to S. \n22 is the Texas model of caps on noneconomic damages,limiting them to \n$750,000 for noneconomic damages from three parties. I hear constantly \nfrom physicians who share with me the escalating costs of medical \nliability insurance and the ways they have had to alter their practice \nto pay these bills.\n  We have had an exodus of specialists from emergency room on-call \nrosters, and as you might have expected, hospitals are having trouble \nrecruiting new physicians to the area. Compared to the national average \nof 283 physicians per 100,000 people, Arizona has only 207 physicians \nper 100,000 people.\n  I recently got an e-mail from an emergency physician, Todd Taylor of \nPhoenix, who is leaving the clinical practice to go to Tennessee. He is \ngiving up medicine at the age of 49, in part, he said, because he sees \na bad situation getting worse. The American College of Emergency \nPhysicians recently issued a ``national report card'' and graded the \nmedical liability environment in Arizona a D-minus.\n  I also heard about a woman in Arizona who returned to her \nobstetrician to deliver her second child, only to find out that \nphysician had stopped delivering babies because of the high liability \npremiums. Arizona cannot afford to have physicians leave the State or \ncurtail their practices.\n  There are areas of my State like Apache County that don't have even a \nsingle obstetrician. That means women in labor have to drive to \nneighboring counties to deliver their children. Apache had only 34 \nphysicians in the whole county in 2004 and has seen even more \nphysicians leave the area since then. One physician there, Thomas \nBennett, said that his liability premiums, coupled with decreasing \nreimbursement, forced him out of his practice after 25 years. Dr. \nBennett was an OB/GYN and always practiced in rural areas. What a loss \nto that community and to our State. S. 23, the second bill I mentioned, \nwould provide liability protection for those who deliver babies and \nmight keep physicians in practice or encourage obstetricians to \npractice in underserved areas like Apache Conty, AZ.\n  This is not how the system was ever intended to work. If we want \nwomen and babies to enjoy the medical care they expect and deserve, we \nneed to find ways to encourage physicians to practice throughout my \nState and throughout the country. We cannot afford to have doctors \nrelocating to different States to find more favorable laws and for \ncommunities to go without vital services.\n  The health care community has asked for the protections it needs to \ncontinue to provide services.\n  My Senate colleagues should do the right thing for patients, \nphysicians, and hospitals, and reconsider their opposition to medical \nliability reform now. We will keep coming back until they are willing \nto address this situation--not just for the medical community but for \nall of the patients it serves.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the issue of \nmedical liability reform. Earlier this week, we attempted to bring the \nissue of medical liability reform to the Senate floor for a debate. Two \nbills were offered, S. 22, the Medical Care Access Protection Act, and \nS. 23, the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act, both \nmedical liability reform bills. We had two votes that would have simply \nallowed us to proceed to a debate on these two bills. Both of these \nprocedural motions failed, and unfortunately we were unable to discuss \nthis very important issue in the United States Senate.\n  The American Medical Association has declared a medical malpractice \ncrisis in 21 States, including my home State of Georgia. Hospitals, \nphysicians, and patients in Georgia and across the Nation are being \nnegatively impacted by rising costs in medical care and medical \nliability insurance premiums. Many health care providers have left \ntheir practices, retired, or moved to another State. As a result, we \nhave seen a reduction in access to health care services and an adverse \nimpact on the health and well-being of the citizens of Georgia. A new \nmedical liability law in Georgia hopefully will help to improve the \nquality of health care services and assist in lowering the cost of \nhealth care liability insurance in my State. I applaud the lawmakers in \nthe State of Georgia who took the time to address this issue on the \nState level and craft a law that will be beneficial to our physicians \nand patients.\n  I was disappointed that the Senate was not able to bring this \ndiscussion to the floor. Many of my colleagues and I would have enjoyed \nthe opportunity to participate in a healthy debate. While I do not \nagree with all aspects of the two proposed pieces of legislation, it is \nvital that we move forward with a discussion if we ever expect to find \na solution. Many of the issues that come before the Senate are not easy \nones. In order to find compromises, this body must participate in \ndebates.\n  Meaningful medical liability reform, at the Federal level, should \nhelp rid our court system of frivolous lawsuits, while addressing those \nwho are seriously injured because of negligence. This reform would have \nto allow injured victims compensation for economic damages--medical \nexpenses, rehabilitation costs, and loss of wages and future earnings--\nas well as reasonable awards for pain and suffering.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to SSG Greg \nWagner and his heroic service to our country. As a member of the South \nDakota National Guard, Staff Sergeant Wagner was deployed to Iraq with \nthe Battery C, 1st Battalion, 147th Field Artillery based out of \nYankton. On May 8, 2006, he died when his convoy was attacked in a \nBaghdad neighborhood.\n  Greg graduated in 1989 from Hanson High School in Alexandria. Soon \nafter his graduation, he enlisted in the South Dakota National Guard. \nAl Blankenship, the Commander of the American Legion in Alexandria, \nremembers him as a true military man. Dedicated to the South Dakota \nNational Guard, he worked full time as a heavy equipment mechanic at \nthe National Guard maintenance complex in Mitchell until his unit was \ndeployed in October 2005. Greg was a team leader for his unit, which \nwas tasked with training and evaluating the Iraqi police force in one \nof the city's police districts.\n\n[[Page S4465]]\n\n  Greg's high school football coach, Jim Haskamp, remembers him as a \nvery loyal person, which was evident in all aspects of his life. Greg's \nfavorite past time was football. Haskamp recalls that, ``You could chew \nhim out for something, and he'd come back and thank you for trying to \nmake him better.''\n  Sergeant Wagner gave his all for his soldiers and his country. Our \nNation owes him a debt of gratitude, and the best way to honor his life \nis to emulate his commitment to our country. Mr. President, I join with \nall South Dakotans in expressing my deepest sympathy to the family of \nStaff Sergeant Greg Wagner. He will be missed, but his service to our \nNation will never be forgotten.\n\n\n                     first sergeant carlos n. saenz\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, next week, the family, friends, and \ncomrades of 1SG Carlos Saenz will gather to say a final goodbye as he \nis laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery. I pay tribute to his \nlife and legacy.\n  Carlos Saenz will be buried at Arlington in the company of some of \nthis Nation's greatest fighters, leaders, and explorers--men and women \nwho changed the course of our country. It is completely fitting that \nCarlos Saenz be laid to rest there because Carlos represents all that \nis great about America.\n  Carlos was born in Mexico. He became a naturalized citizen and \nconsidered himself extremely lucky and proud to be an American, as we \nall should. And for more than 25 years, he gave back to this country \nwith every fiber of his being.\n  Carlos entered active duty in 1978 and was a member of the Nevada \nNational Guard from 1990 to 1992 serving with the 72nd Military Police \nCompany out of Henderson, NV, in Desert Storm and Desert Shield. In \nJune of 1994, he was assigned to the Guard's 1st Squadron, 221st Armor \nBattalion, Las Vegas, until January 2000. In January 2000, he became an \ninstructor at the 421st Regional Training Institute in Stead, NV. Then, \nin May 2002, he joined the Guard's 1864th Transportation Company, in \nHenderson, until he was honorably discharged in January 2004. He then \nwas assigned to the Individual Ready Reserve. He earned the rank of \nfirst sergeant in 2001.\n  Carlos was in Iraq as a trained civil affairs noncommissioned officer \nassigned to the 490th Civil Affairs Battalion, Abilene, TX. He had an \nextensive military education and had received countless awards for his \nservice. Carlos had also worked for the Nevada Test Site's security \nfirm for more than two decades where they are remembering him as ``a \npatriot, a great American, and a good man.''\n  Nowhere is his loss being felt more than at his home in Las Vegas, \nwhere he is being remembered and mourned by his wife, Nanette; his son, \nJuan; his parents; and brothers and sisters.\n  I had the opportunity to speak with Nanette Saenz yesterday. I called \nto extend my condolences and appreciation on behalf of this country. It \nshouldn't surprise me, but I am always taken aback by the strength and \npride of the families of our fallen heroes. It makes sense that our \nbrave servicemen and women have equally brave support systems at home. \nNanette was no exception. As the family made clear in a statement, they \n``know the legacy he leaves behind while serving in a profession where \n`all give some, but some give all'.'' Carlos loved being a soldier and \nloved what he was doing.\n  We are fortunate that someone like Carlos came to this country. He \ndied as an American--defending his country, fighting for freedom, and \nworking to keep his family and all our families safe and secure. May \nGod keep him close and watch over his family. And may God continue to \nbless America with people like Carlos and Nanette Saenz.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/11/senate-section/article/S4465-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   POLICE CHIEFS SUPPORT COMMON SENSE NATIONAL GUN SAFETY REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a national study of police chiefs' support \nfor a variety of possible gun safety regulations was recently completed \nby researchers at Wayne State University, the University of Toledo, and \nKent State University. The study, titled ``Police Chiefs' Perceptions \nof the Regulation of Firearms,'' was published in the April issue of \nthe American Journal of Preventive Medicine. I applaud the researchers \nfor addressing this important issue and for their contribution to the \ndebate about common sense gun safety legislation.\n  As the study points out, ``Firearm injuries are the second leading \ncause of injury death in the United States, and since 1972 have killed \non average more than 30,000 people each year.'' Our police chiefs see \nthe consequences of gun violence on a daily basis and are in a unique \nposition to evaluate possible solutions to the gun violence epidemic in \nour country. For their study, researchers surveyed 600 randomly \nselected police chiefs in cities with populations of more than 25,000 \npeople. This survey was intended to measure the police chiefs' support \nfor a number of possible gun safety regulations. While the responses of \nthe police chiefs may not be surprising to advocates of commonsense gun \nsafety legislation, they are striking and certainly worth noting.\n  There were a number of potential gun safety regulations that received \nthe support of an overwhelming majority of the police chiefs who \nreturned surveys. Specifically, 93 percent of police chiefs supported a \nrequirement that background checks be completed prior to the purchase \nof all handguns and 82 percent believed background checks should also \nbe required for the purchase of rifles and shotguns. This means that \noverwhelmingly police chiefs believe background checks should be \nrequired for the purchase of all firearms, regardless of whether they \nare purchased from a public or private dealer.\n  As my colleagues know, current law requires that when an individual \nbuys a firearm from a licensed dealer, a background check must be \ncompleted to insure that the purchaser is not prohibited by law from \npurchasing or possessing a gun. However, this is not the case for some \ngun purchases. For example, when an individual buys a firearm from a \nprivate citizen who is not a licensed gun dealer, there is no Federal \nrequirement that the seller ensure the purchaser is not in a prohibited \ncategory. This creates a loophole in the law, making it easy for \ncriminals, terrorists, and other prohibited buyers to evade background \nchecks and buy guns. This loophole creates a gateway to the illegal \nmarket because prohibited buyers know they will not be subject to \nbackground checks when purchasing a firearm from a private citizen.\n  One of the factors that automatically disqualifies a person from \npurchasing a firearm is a prior felony conviction. However, most \nmisdemeanor convictions do not disqualify a person under Federal law \nfrom buying a firearm. In response to the survey, a majority of the \npolice chiefs supported a prohibition on the sale of firearms to those \nwho have been convicted of misdemeanor crimes including the public \ndisplay of a firearm in a threatening manner, domestic violence, and \ncarrying a concealed weapon without a permit.\n  In addition, the police chiefs supported action on a number of other \ncommonsense gun safety regulations on handguns. More than 81 percent of \nthe police chiefs said that the Federal Government should require \nhandguns to be assigned tamper-resistant serial numbers that could \nassist law enforcement officials in the prosecution of illegal gun \ntraffickers. Nearly 70 percent of the police chiefs believe that all \nhandguns should be registered, and 82 percent believe that the Federal \nGovernment should require all new handguns to be sold with trigger \nlocks.\n  Our Nation's police chiefs are particularly knowledgeable and well \nplaced to assess the importance of commonsense gun safety laws in \nprotecting the safety of our communities and in stopping the flow of \nfirearms to the illegal market. Through their responses to the survey, \nthe police chiefs are sending a clear message that they believe that \nstricter national standards on the purchase and possession of firearms \nshould be enacted. Congress should listen to this important message and \ntake action on these issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/11/senate-section/article/S4465-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4465-S4466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new\n\n[[Page S4466]]\n\ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I \nhave come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has \noccurred in our country.\n  On March 10, 2006, in Holland, MI, Jason Burns, a student at Hope \nCollege, was attacked leaving the campus library. Burns, a well-known \ngay rights advocate, frequently held lectures on homophobia after his \nfreshman roommate moved out because of Burns' sexuality. While leaving \nthe library a group of students attacked Burns, striking him multiple \ntimes and yelling homophobic epithets.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/11/senate-section/article/S4466-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE MOSCOW HELSINKI GROUP\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, as chairman of the Helsinki Commission, \nI am pleased to recognize the accomplishments of the Moscow Helsinki \nGroup, which will mark the 30th anniversary of its founding later this \nweek in the Russian capital. I particularly want to acknowledge the \ntremendous courage of the men and women who--at great personal risk--\nestablished the group to hold the Soviet Government accountable for \nimplementing the human rights commitment Moscow has signed onto in the \nhistoric Helsinki Final Act. Today, the Moscow Helsinki Group is the \noldest of human rights organizations active in the Russian Federation. \nHaving played a pivotal role in the struggle for human rights during \nthe Soviet period, the group continues to work tirelessly for the cause \nof human rights, democracy, and rule of law throughout Russia.\n  When, on behalf of the United States, President Ford signed the \nHelsinki Accords in August 1975, he was criticized in some circles for \nsupposedly having accepted Soviet control and domination of Eastern \nEurope in return for what some viewed as worthless promises on human \nrights. Ultimately, the skeptics were proven wrong. The Helsinki \nAccords did not legitimize the Soviet conquest of Eastern Europe at the \nend of World War II. Moreover, by reprinting the entire text of Accords \nin Pravda, the Soviet Government had publicly pledged to live up to \ncertain human rights standards that were generally accepted in the West \nbut only dreamed of in the Soviet Union and other captive nations. That \nfact would have huge consequences.\n  In late April 1976, Dr. Yuri Orlov, a Soviet physicist who had \nalready been repressed for earlier advocacy for human rights, invited a \nsmall group of human rights activists to join in a public group \ncommitted to monitoring the implementation of the Helsinki Accords in \nthe USSR. Others responded to this invitation, and on May 12 creation \nof the Public Group to Assist the Implementation of the Helsinki \nAccords in the USSR was announced at a Moscow press conference \norganized by future Noble Peace Prize winner Academician Andrei \nSakharov. Among the founding members of the Moscow Helsinki Group, as \nit became known, were the current chairperson, Ludmilla Alexeyeva, Dr. \nElena Bonner, who would endure prolonged persecution with Dr. Sakharov, \nher husband, and others like cyberneticist Anatoly ``Natan'' Sharansky. \nThey were joined by seven brave and principled individuals who were \nready to sacrifice their comfort, the professional lives, their \nfreedom, and even their lives on behalf of the cause of human rights in \ntheir homeland. More would join in subsequent days.\n  The Moscow Helsinki Group carried out its mission by collecting \ninformation and publishing reports on implementation of the accords in \nvarious areas of human rights. The 26 documentation provided by the \ngroup proved particularly valuable when the signatories convened in \nBelgrade in 1977 to assess implementation of Helsinki provisions, \nincluding human rights.\n  Naturally, the Soviet Politburo and the Communist Party had no \nintention of tolerating citizens who actually expected their government \nto live up to the pledges it had signed in Helsinki. Some members of \nthe Moscow Group were forced to emigrate, many were sentenced to long \nterms in labor camp, the Soviet ``GULag,'' while others were sent into \ninternal exile far from families and loved ones. In September 1982, \nunder the repressive rule of former KGB chief Yuri Andropov, the Moscow \nHelsinki Group was forced to suspend its activity. Only three members \nremained at liberty, and they were constantly harassed by the KGB. \nTragically, founding member Anatoly Marchenko died during a hunger \nstrike at Chistopol Prison in December 1986, only a few months before \nthe Gorbachev government began to empty the labor camps of political \nand religious prisoners.\n  Between 1982 and 1987, it seemed that the Soviet Government had \nsucceeded in driving the human rights movement abroad, to the labor \ncamps of the GULag, or underground. The reality was that the Helsinki \nmovement had brought to light the deplorable human rights situation in \nthe Soviet Union and put the Kremlin on the defensive before a world \nincreasingly sensitive to the fate of individuals denied their \nfundamental rights. The efforts by Helsinki activists in the USSR, \ntogether with a stiffened resolve of Western governments, helped bring \nthe Cold War to an end and bring down the barriers, both real and \nsymbolic, that unnaturally divided Europe.\n  Reestablished in July 1989 by several veteran human rights activists, \nthe Moscow Helsinki Group faces new challenges in Putin's Russia. I \nhave met with Ludmilla Alexeyeva, a founding member who had been exiled \nto the United States during the Soviet era, who serves as the \nchairperson today. While Russia has thrown off so much of its Soviet \npast, the temptation of authoritarianism remains strong. Russia's \nimplementation of Helsinki commitments, particularly those concerning \nfree and fair elections and democratic governance, remain of deep \nconcern to me and my colleagues on the Helsinki Commission.\n  Ultimately, Mr. President, a strong and prosperous Russia will not be \nsustained by oil or natural gas revenues but on respect for the dignity \nof its citizens and the observation of human rights, civil society, and \nthe rule of law. These goals remain at the heart of the Moscow Helsinki \nGroup's ongoing work. I salute the dedicated service of the members of \nthe Moscow Helsinki Group, past and present, and wish them success in \ntheir noble endeavors to promote a free and democratic Russia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/11/senate-section/article/S4466-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4466-S4467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CELEBRATING JUNETEENTH\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to mark ``Juneteenth,'' the \nday in 1865 when General Gordon Granger issued his order proclaiming \nAmerica's remaining slaves free.\n  On June 19, 1865, MG Gordon Granger and a group of Union soldiers \nlanded at Galveston, TX. With their landing, they announced that the \nwar had ended and that the slaves were now free. This was more than 2 \nyears after President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, which had \nlittle impact in Texas.\n  Though initially celebrated in Galveston, TX, Juneteenth is now \nobserved nationwide. Americans from all racial and ethnic backgrounds \ncelebrate Juneteenth. And while this day holds a special resonance for \ndescendants of slaves, Juneteenth provides an important opportunity for \nus all to commemorate a central tenent of our great country: that we \nare all created equal. This Juneteenth let us all celebrate this \nmilestone in the struggle for liberty by recommitting ourselves to the \nadvancement of justice for all.\n  The stain of slavery can never be erased from the history of our \nNation, and should never be forgotten. In celebrating Juneteenth, we \nalso honor those who suffered under slavery and help to further our \nunderstanding of our Nation's history.\n  One of the most common elements of Juneteenth celebrations is the \nsinging of ``Lift Every Voice and Sing,'' written by James Weldon \nJohnson. I am happy to provide these lyrics of this great American \nsong:\n\n                       Lift Every Voice and Sing\n\n     Lift every voice and sing\n     Till earth and heaven ring,\n\n[[Page S4467]]\n\n     Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;\n     Let our rejoicing rise\n     High as the listening skies,\n     Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.\n     Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught \n           us,\n     Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us,\n     Facing the rising sun of our new day begun\n     Let us march on till victory is won.\n\n     Stony the road we trod,\n     Bitter the chastening rod,\n     Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;\n     Yet with a steady beat,\n     Have not our weary feet\n     Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?\n     We have come over a way that with tears have been watered,\n     We have come, treading our path through the blood of the \n           slaughtered,\n     Out from the gloomy past,\n     Till now we stand at last\n     Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.\n\n     God of our weary years,\n     God of our silent tears,\n     Thou who has brought us thus far on the way;\n     Thou who has by Thy might\n     Led us into the light,\n     Keep us forever in the path, we pray.\n     Lest our feet stray from the places, Our God, where we met \n           Thee;\n     Lest, our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget \n           Thee;\n     Shadowed beneath Thy hand,\n     May we forever stand.\n     True to our GOD,\n     True to our native land.\n\n  --James Weldon Johnson.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the \nfirst day designated to the conservation of the world's endangered \nspecies. I would like to take a moment to thank my Senate colleagues \nfor unanimously designating this special day, and especially to my \nSenate cosponsors for helping to make this day possible.\n  Let me also commend my constituent Mr. David Robinson for suggesting \nthe establishment of Endangered Species Day. I appreciate his hard work \nand dedication. Today's designation shows that individuals like Mr. \nRobinson do make a difference.\n  I am encouraged to learn that today many fine institutions across our \ncountry will use the opportunity of Endangered Species Day to bolster \npublic awareness about the threats facing endangered species worldwide. \nFrom lectures at local zoos to birding trips with regional Audubon \nchapters, events are being held nationwide to commemorate this day. My \nhope is that Endangered Species Day will spark the wonder and interest \namong young people, students, and the general public about how they can \nbecome more involved in these conservation efforts.\n  In fact, I am proud to note that in my State of California, \nconservation and management efforts have helped significantly to \nrestore California condor, winter run chinook salmon, and California \ngray whale populations. It is remarkable that even species once \nbelieved to have been extinct, such as the mount diablo buckwheat and \nthe ventura marsh milk vetch, have been newly found in our State. The \ndedicated conservation efforts of volunteers, organizations, \nbusinesses, private landowners, and government agencies have proved \neffective in rehabilitating many endangered species populations.\n  We can be encouraged by these developments. These instances \ndemonstrate that with responsible management we can halt endangered \nspecies from continuing down the path towards extinction.\n  Such success stories also show that more needs to be done to ensure \nthe survival of these species. There are more than 1,000 species in the \nU.S. and abroad that are designated as ``at risk'' of extinction. With \nawareness comes responsibility, and it is my hope that Endangered \nSpecies Day will inspire continued action in response to the precarious \ncircumstances of endangered species.\n  Mr. President, I hope that communities across the country take \nadvantage of this special day to discuss ways that they can participate \nin conservation efforts for endangered species in their State, \nthroughout the country, and around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/11/senate-section/article/S4467-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/11/senate-section/article/S4467-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/11/senate-section/article/S4467-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 9:31 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 1382.

A bill to award a congressional gold medal to Tenzin Gyatso, \nthe Fourteenth Dalai Lama, in recognition of his many enduring and \noutstanding contributions to peace, non-violence, human rights, and \nreligious understanding; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Dalai \nLama Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2006.\n  This legislation would convey upon the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin \nGyatso, one of Congress' most prestigious awards for his advocacy of \npeace, tolerance, human rights, non-violence, and compassion throughout \nthe globe.\n  I am deeply honored to be joined today by my colleague, Senator \nThomas, and wish to express my appreciation to him for his willingness \nto be the lead Republican sponsor of this legislation.\n  Senator Thomas has long been an advocate for addressing the plight of \nthe Tibetan people, and in 2001 joined with me in introducing the \nTibetan Policy Act, the first piece of legislation outlining U.S. \npolicy toward Tibet and its people. He was truly instrumental in \nhelping to advance its passage in the Congress.\n  In fact, one of my proudest days as a U.S. Senator was on September \n30, 2002, when President George W. Bush signed the Tibetan Policy Act \ninto law.\n  Both Senator Thomas and I are also grateful that 73 of our Senate \ncolleagues have agreed to be original cosponsors of this legislation \nhonoring the Dalai Lama.\n  Under the rules, Congressional Gold Medals need the support of at \nleast two-thirds, or 67 Senators, in order for the Senate Banking \nCommittee to consider such authorizing legislation.\n  I look forward to working closely with Chairman Shelby and Ranking \nMember Sarbanes to ensure that the Dalai Lama Congressional Gold Medal \nAct can be taken up and passed out of the Banking Committee in a timely \nand efficient manner.\n  In my view, there is no international figure more deserving of the \nCongressional Gold Medal than His Holiness the Dalai Lama.\n  This is a man who has dedicated his life to the betterment of \nhumanity as a whole. As one of the most respected religious figures in \nthe world today, the Dalai Lama's teachings on peace, non-violence and \necumenical openness have been embraced by millions.\n  One of his greatest contributions has been his promotion of harmony \nand respect among the different religious faiths of the world.\n  In his own words: ``I always believe that it is much better to have a \nvariety of religions, a variety of philosophies, rather than one single \nreligion or philosophy. This is necessary because of the different \nmental dispositions of each human being. Each religion has certain \nunique ideas or techniques, and learning about them can only enrich \none's faith.''\n  As the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, he has worked arduously \nfor nearly 50 years to increase understanding between China and the \npeople of Tibet.\n  He has also dedicated his life to the preservation of the Tibetan \nculture, religion, and language.\n  The Dalai Lama's story is a fascinating one.\n  In 1959, as a teenager, he fled his Tibetan homeland for neighboring \nIndia, where he established a government-in-exile that eventually \nsettled at Dharmasala--in the Himalayan foothills.\n  While he admittedly once espoused independence for Tibet--\nparticularly in the face of the heavy-handed oppression of the Tibetan \npeople by the Chinese Communists--the Dalai Lama foreswore this \nposition nearly two decades ago.\n  Alternatively, he began to pursue a reasonable and flexible ``Middle \nWay Approach'' that would provide for cultural and religious autonomy \nfor Tibetans, within the People's Republic of China.\n  In 1989, the Dalai Lama was the recipient of the Noble Peace Prize \nfor his consistent and unfailing advocacy for the rights of the Tibetan \npeople, along with his promotion of non-violence and peace throughout \nthe globe.\n  In their recommendation, the Nobel Committee wrote:\n\n       The Committee wants to emphasize the fact that the Dalai \n     Lama in his struggle for the liberation of Tibet consistently \n     has opposed the use of violence. He has instead advocated \n     peaceful solutions based upon tolerance and mutual respect in \n     order to preserve the historical and cultural heritage of his \n     people.\n\n  In April 1991 , when the Congress welcomed the Dalai Lama in a \nceremony in the Capitol Rotunda that was attended by the entire \nCongressional leadership, he offered a moving anecdote about receiving \na small gift from President Franklin Roosevelt when he was a young boy.\n  That gift--a gold watch showing phases of the moon and the days of \nthe week--became very special to him.\n  ``I marveled at the distant land which could make such a practical \nobject so beautiful,'' he said.\n  ``But what truly inspired me were your ideas of freedom and \ndemocracy. I felt that your principles were identical to my own, the \nBuddhist beliefs in fundamental human rights freedom, equality, \ntolerance and compassion for all.''\n  I have been blessed to be able to call the Dalai Lama a friend for \nalmost three decades. I first met him through my husband Richard during \na trip to India and Nepal in the fall of 1978.\n  Incidentally, our first stop was in Dharmasala, where we met with His \nHoliness and invited him to visit San Francisco where I was mayor.\n  The Dalai Lama was grateful for the invitation. At that time, he had \nnever even been to the United States.\n  For political reasons, the Chinese objected to his visiting the \nUnited States, and our government, which at that time was in the \nprocess of normalizing relations with the People's Republic of China, \nwas sensitive to these concerns.\n  While the trip was postponed temporarily, as mayor I was delighted to \nreceive the Dalai Lama and present him with a key to the city upon his \narrival in San Francisco in September 1979.\n  During our many conversations over the years, His Holiness has often \nreiterated that, at its core, Buddhism espouses reaching out to help \nothers, particularly the less fortunate. And it encourages us all to be \nmore kind and compassionate.\n  The Dalai Lama's persona exudes these qualities. He has a great sense \nof humor, responds quite spontaneously, and his philosophies cross all \nreligions, cultures, and ethnic lines.\n  I have visited with him many times since 1978, and while his \nprincipled beliefs have never wavered, his teachings have become more \nexpansive. His message has never been more relevant in our troubled \nworld.\n  At the same time, I also had the opportunity as mayor of San \nFrancisco to become acquainted with several of China's future leaders \nthrough the San Francisco-Shanghai Sister City Relationship that I \nstarted with Mayor Wang Daohan in 1980.\n  Mayor Wang's immediate successors, Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji, were \nboth later promoted to high-level positions in the Chinese Communist \nParty and Central Government after leaving Shanghai.\n\n[[Page S4472]]\n\n  Consequently, since 1990, my husband and I have had many discussions \nwith Jiang Zemin, Zhu Rongji, and other Chinese officials about the \nstatus of the Dalai Lama and the plight of the Tibetans in and outside \nof Tibet.\n  On three separate occasions over the past 15 years, I have hand-\ndelivered letters from His Holiness to the Chinese leadership, asking \nfor direct talks and reiterating that he does not seek independence for \nTibet.\n  I know that at the same time President Bill Clinton, President George \nW. Bush, and many others in the U.S. Government have also encouraged a \nmeaningful dialogue. For the most part, these efforts have had little \nsuccess.\n  If His Holiness the Dalai Lama were to return to Tibet, his wish is, \nas he says, to be a simple monk and to be involved only in religious \nand cultural matters.\n  China will be a better nation when it embraces the aspirations of the \nTibetan people.\n  Through the passage of this legislation, the United States Senate \nwould recognize the Dalai Lama's worldwide contributions to peace and \nreligious understanding.\n  Among past recipients of the Congressional Gold Medal are fellow \nmoral and religious leaders, including Pope John Paul II and Mother \nTeresa, and fellow Nobel Peace Laureates, such as Elie Wiesel and \nNelson Mandela.\n  By definition, a Congressional Gold Medal is reserved for the most \nheroic, courageous and outstanding--those who we wish to emulate in our \nlife's actions.\n  I strongly believe that the Dalai Lama is such an individual.\n  I am proud that the U.S. Congress has a long record of showing \nsupport for the Dalai Lama's message of peace and compassion, and I \nlook forward to joining my colleagues in recognizing him with this \ndistinguished award.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nCalifornia in offering this legislation to award the 14th Dalai Lama \nwith the prestigious Congressional Gold Medal.\n  Mr. President, the Dalai Lama has been one of the leading voices in \nadvocating for peace, tolerance, human rights, nonviolence, and \ncompassion throughout the globe. He has worked tirelessly for nearly 50 \nyears to increase understanding between the Tibetan and Chinese people. \nIn these difficult times, I believe it is necessary to recognize those \nwho fight to bring people together. There are few international figures \nmore deserving of receiving this award.\n  In 1959, the Dalai Lama fled his Tibetan homeland for neighboring \nIndia, where he established a government in exile. Under his ``Middle \nWay'' approach, he has worked arduously for the past two decades to \nfind a reasonable and peaceful solution for providing cultural and \nreligious autonomy for Tibetans within the People's Republic of China. \nHe has also been a steadfast and vigorous advocate for peace and human \nrights for all people across the globe.\n  In 1989, he received the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. In their \nrecommendation, the Nobel Committee noted that in his struggle for the \nliberation of Tibet, the Dalai Lama has consistently opposed the use of \nviolence, and has instead advocated peaceful solutions based upon \ntolerance and mutual respect.\n  The Dalai Lama's worldwide contributions to peace, religious \nunderstanding, and the advancement of human rights are innumerable. He \nhas made it his life's work to promote harmony and respect among the \ndifferent religious faiths of the world. In his own words: ``I always \nbelieve that it is much better to have a variety of religions, a \nvariety of philosophies, rather than one single religion or philosophy. \nThis is necessary because of the different mental dispositions of each \nhuman being. Each religion has certain unique ideas or techniques, and \nlearning about them can only enrich one's faith.''\n  By definition, a Congressional Gold Medal is reserved for the most \nheroic, courageous, and outstanding those who we wish to emulate in our \nown lives. The Dalai Lama is such an individual, and I urge all of my \ncolleagues to join Senator Feinstein and myself in honoring him with \nthis distinctive award.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself and Ms. MURKOWSKI):\n  S. 2789. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax credit to rural primary health providers; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr BURNS. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senator Murkowski in \nintroducing the Rural Physicians Relief Act of 2006. This legislation \nis intended to bring needed relief to doctors in rural America.\n  As those of us from rural States are well aware, our constituents \nface many unique challenges when seeking quality health care. Our \npopulations are small and spread out across extremely remote areas. \nIncidentally, the costs of operating even the most basic medical \npractice are simply too much for many physicians. As a result, many \nareas of our States tend to be some of the most medically underserved \nareas in the Nation.\n  To give you an idea of the situation in Montana, nearly 286,000 or \none third of my constituents live in what are known as frontier areas. \nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, these are counties with \nfewer than seven people per square mile. That means that 46 of \nMontana's 56 counties are classified as frontier--24 of those have \nfewer than two people per square mile and 10 of those have less than \none per square mile. However, what is even more striking is 9 of these \nfrontier counties have no doctors at all, and 10 others have fewer than \n3. Consequently, a large percentage of Montanans must travel great \ndistances simply to get basic medical treatment.\n  The legislation that Senator Murkowski and I are introducing today \nseeks to alleviate this problem. It will provide incentives to \nencourage physicians to practice in these remote and underserved areas. \nSpecifically, it would give a physician who is a Primary health \nservices provider a $1,000 tax credit for each month that he or she \nprovides services in a frontier area. Furthermore, physicians who treat \na high percentage of patients from frontier areas would also be \neligible for the tax credit.\n  All too often many of our constituents are at a disadvantage simply \nbecause of where they live. While this legislation will not completely \nsolve the problem, it will go a long way toward bringing quality health \ncare to those in rural America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2789\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator \nBurns in introducing the Rural Physicians' Relief Act of 2006. This \nimportant legislation will bring needed assistance to physicians who \nprovide primary health services to rural America.\n  Physicians who provide health care in the most rural locations in \nAmerica face challenges unlike their more urban counterparts. Often \ngreat distances, remote locations, limited transportation, and harsh \nclimate combine to make health care delivery extremely difficult to say \nthe very least. Patient populations are small and spread out across \nextremely remote areas. As a result, many of these areas tend to be the \nmost medically underserved areas in the Nation.\n  In my State of Alaska, a State that is larger than the States of \nCalifornia, Texas and Montana combined, nearly one-quarter of the \nState's population lives in communities and villages that are only \nreachable by boat or aircraft. In fact, Alaska has fewer roads than any \nother State--even fewer roads than Rhode Island. And unlike Rhode \nIsland where over 90 percent of the roads are paved, less than 20 \npercent of the roads are paved in Alaska.\n  This means that approximately 75 percent of Alaskan communities are \nnot connected by road to another community with a hospital. This means \nthat all medical supplies, patients, and providers must travel by air. \nThese remote populations tend to be among the poorest in the State. Air \ntravel equates to excessively high health care costs--generally 70 \npercent higher than costs in the lower 48 States. In short, ``rural'' \ntakes on a new definition in Alaska.\n  In Alaska, patient access to health care is exacerbated because our \nState also faces a chilling crisis--we have 25 percent to 30 percent \nfewer physicians than our population needs. In fact, Alaska has one of \nthe smallest numbers of physicians per capita in the country. We need a \nminimum of 500 more doctors just to be at the national average of \nphysicians per capita. An American Medical News article recently \ndeclared Alaska's precarious situation: ``Alaska has long ranked among \nthe worst states in terms of physician supply.''\n  Our physician shortage crisis will only worsen. There is an expected \nretirement of at least 118 physicians in Anchorage alone in the next 10 \nyears. In the 1990s, there were 130 new doctors each year. Now that \nfigure has dropped to only 31 new physicians since 2001. Outside of \nAnchorage, one in every eight physician positions is vacant.\n  Additionally, many physicians are forced out of the Medicare and \nMedicaid Programs because reimbursement rates simply do not cover the \ncost to treat those patients. With Alaska's growing population, \nespecially of our elderly, this shortage will lead to the severe health \ncare access crisis for all Alaskans.\n  On top of harsh physical challenges, Alaska's rural population also \nfaces significant human challenges. These rural patient populations are \noften in the greatest need for primary health care services. Heart \ndisease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases are the leading \ncauses of death in Alaska. Women in our State have higher death rates \nfrom stroke than do women nationally; and mortality among Native \nAlaskan women is dramatically on the rise, whereas it is actually \ndeclining among Caucasian women in Lower 48. The prevalence of chronic \ndisease such as diabetes and even tuberculosis is increasing faster in \nAlaska than any other State. Each of these health concerns is magnified \nbecause access to health care--especially in rural Alaska--remains our \ngreatest challenge.\n  The legislation that Senator Burns and I introduce today seeks to \nlessen this problem. It will both assist physicians who currently \npractice in rural America and will provide an incentive to encourage \nphysicians to practice in these remote and underserved areas. \nSpecifically, it would give a physician who is a primary health \nservices provider a $1,000 tax credit for each month that he or she \nprovides services in a designated ``frontier'' area. Furthermore, \nphysicians who treat a high percentage of patients from frontier areas \nwould also be eligible for the tax credit.\n  Mr. President, my hope is to encourage physicians to practice \nmedicine in rural Alaska and throughout rural America. Creating \nincentives that offset the high cost of providing care in the most \nremote areas of the Nation will go far in recruiting physicians to the \nareas that are most in need of their services.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Shelby, Mr. \n        Sarbanes, Mrs. Hutchison, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Smith, Mr Burns, Mr. \n        Allard, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Allen, Mr. \n        Graham, Mr. Lott, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Domenici, Mrs. Dole, Mr. \n        Talent, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Kerry, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mr. Reed, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Carper, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Pryor, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \n        Dorgan, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Biden, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Mikulski and Mr. \n        Jeffords):\n  S. 2791.

The port \nand rail provisions of this package are identical to provisions of the \ntransportation security bill, S. 1052, which was reported unanimously \nby the Commerce Committee last year. The transit provisions of the \npackage are identical to those reported unanimously by the Banking \nCommittee.\n  The events of 9/11 made clear that Congress needed to address the \nvulnerabilities within the Nation's transportation systems and \ndramatically increase security measures to protect the essential \ninterstate flow of commerce.\n  Even before 9/11, the Commerce Committee led the Senate's effort to \nachieve the delicate balance between improved transportation security \nand the uninterrupted flow of commerce. In the weeks and months \nfollowing the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Commerce Committee developed \nthe Maritime Transportation Security Act, which was signed into law by \nthe President in 2002. The committee later expanded\n\n[[Page S4474]]\n\nMTSA by developing the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of \n2004.\n  In MTSA, the Commerce Committee called on both public and private \nsector entities, including Federal agencies, the port community, vessel \nowners, shippers, and earners, to play a role in dramatically enhancing \nmaritime security. The International Maritime Organization followed \nsuit with its own improvements, many of which were based on the \nfoundation set forth in MTSA.\n  The Commerce Committee spearheaded the establishment of a harmonized \nsecurity credential for all transportation workers, authorizing the \ncreation of a Transportation Worker Identification Credential, TWIC, \nprogram in the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (2001), and \ntwice more in the Maritime Transportation Security Acts of 2002 and \n2004. Additional statutory authority from the PATRIOT Act reinforced \nthe importance of such a transportation credential.\n  TWIC is intended to improve identity management for all \ntransportation workers, ensuring that only authorized personnel gain \nunescorted access to secure areas of the country's transportation \nsystem. TWIC is designed to mitigate the threat of terrorists \nexploiting certain physical and cyber security gaps in the \ntransportation system.\n  The bill would require TSA to deliver a rulemaking on the \nimplementation of the TWIC program. It has been over three and one half \nyears since Congress first required such a card, and this provision \nsets a mandatory deadline of January 1, 2007 for rollout.\n  The bill that I propose also would direct the Coast Guard to expand \nthe deployment of Interagency Operations Centers to ports throughout \nthe United States. These centers, already operating in five cities, \nwould bring together all port security and operations stakeholders into \na single facility at major ports. This approach has proven effective at \nmaximizing communication among Federal, State, and local entities \ncharged with securing the ports.\n  In addition, the provision would require greater standards and \nrequirements for cargo screening equipment, and call for additional \ndata to be incorporated into the system used to target cargo and \ncontainers for searches.\n  While TWIC, Interagency Operation Centers, and equipment standards \nwill help improve security on our shores, we must be cognizant of the \nfact that maritime security begins in foreign ports. We must cast our \nsecurity net as far back into the inbound international supply chain as \npossible.\n  Two programs that were authorized by the Commerce Committee in MTSA \naddress the need to pre-screen cargo bound for the United States--the \nContainer Security Initiative CSI, and the Customs-Trade Partnership \nAgainst Terrorism, (C-TPAT).\n  CSI is a program in which U.S. inspectors are deployed to foreign \nnations to assist their foreign counterparts in the pre-screening of \nU.S.-bound cargo containers. C-TPAT is a voluntary supply chain \nsecurity program that allows companies to seek certification from the \nFederal Government that such companies have taken sufficient steps to \nensure that their supply chains are secure in exchange for expedited \ncargo clearance benefits at U.S. ports.\n  The bill that I introduce with my colleagues would require that basic \nprogram elements and standards be developed by DHS in order to provide \nCSI and C-TPAT participants a baseline understanding of the security \nstandards expected of them.\n  Maritime security is not the only improvement that we must make--the \nunfortunate attacks on passenger trains in Madrid and the subways in \nLondon underscored weaknesses in rail transportation that our bill \nwould seek to address. To improve rail security, our bill would require \nTSA to conduct railroad threat assessments and to prioritize \nrecommendations. In addition, the legislation would create a rail \nsecurity research and development program to encourage deployment of \nrail car tracking equipment for shipment of hazardous materials, and \nrequire threat mitigation plans when specific threat information \nexists. The bill also would authorize further studies of necessary \nimprovements to passenger rail screening, in an effort to increase \nsecurity in this mode of public transportation.\n  Our mass transit systems have pressing security needs, upon which \nour' colleagues on the Banking Committee are focused; as a result, \ntransit security improvements are incorporated into our bipartisan \nbill. It is unfortunate that many transit agencies in the U.S. still \nlack sufficient resources to fulfill the post-9/11 recommendations of \nthe Federal Transit Administration's security assessment. These needs \nare all the more pressing in light of recent DHS recommendations for \nU.S. mass transit systems to remain alert against the possibility of \nterrorist attacks. In response to this situation, our bill would create \na needs-based grant program to identify and address risks and \nvulnerabilities within transit systems across the country. The bill \nwould authorize $3.5 billion in funding over the next 3 years to \ntransit agencies to invest in projects designed to resist and deter \nterrorist attacks, including: surveillance technologies; tunnel \nprotection; chemical, biological, radiological, and explosive detection \nsystems; perimeter protection; and a variety of other security \nimprovements. The bill also would codify the role of an Information \nSharing Analysis Center, which would provide security information to \ntransit systems and ensure better communication among federal, state, \nlocal, and private sector entities.\n  To improve security, we must have clear objectives and methods to \nreach those goals. With limited resources, it is important to pinpoint \nrisks and vulnerabilities that exist within our transportation systems, \nand address them accordingly. By combining provisions approved \nunanimously by the Commerce and Banking Committees, respectively, this \nbipartisan bill would make significant targeted improvements to the \nframework now in place to secure the Nation's port, rail, and transit \nenvironments.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, it is hard to believe, but Congress has \nnot made any substantive improvements to the Nation's transportation \nsecurity systems since 2002. Yet nearly every day, we are provided \nfurther reminders that our transportation modes, particularly port, \ncargo, rail, and public transit, remain vulnerable.\n  Given the urgent need for further improvements, Chairman Stevens and \nI have joined with the Banking Committee leaders, Senator Shelby and \nSenator Sarbanes, to advance a comprehensive transportation security \nbill that reflects the importance of our transportation infrastructure \nto the quality of life and economic health of the country.\n  Our legislation combines the port, cargo, and rail provisions of our \nCommittee's Transportation Security Improvement Act with the Banking \nCommittee's Public Transportation Terrorism Prevention Act. Together, \nthe combined measure makes significant improvements to our port, cargo, \nrail, and public transit security nationwide.\n  It is important to note the level of Senate support for our approach. \nNot only have the elements of our bill been separately and unanimously \napproved by our respective Committees, our legislation has 42 Senate \ncosponsors on introduction. That kind of support demonstrates both the \nnecessity of these improvements and the distinct possibility that we \ncan move this bill this year.\n  The legislation that we introduce today, with its emphasis on the \nCoast Guard and the Transportation Security Administration, TSA, is the \nnatural counterpart to the port security bill approved by the House of \nRepresentatives last week. The bills are directly compatible, and if \nthe Senate moves quickly on this matter, we can proceed to conference \nand make real progress on transportation security before the session \nconcludes.\n  This legislation reflects the port, cargo, and rail security \nexpertise of the Commerce Committee and the public transit security \nexpertise of the Banking Committee. On the Commerce Committee, we began \nexamining port and cargo security in 1999 and had begun to craft \nsecurity legislation even before the September 11 tragedy.\n  In 2001, our committee authored the landmark Maritime Transportation \nSecurity Act, MTSA, which established the foundation for the Nation's \nport and cargo security. Under the MTSA,\n\n[[Page S4475]]\n\nthe Coast Guard became the lead agency on port security matters and \ncreated the Nation's current, international, inter-modal cargo security \nregime. That expertise and perspective is essential as we advance \nimprovements to our maritime security laws.\n  However, the implementation of MTSA's security improvements has been \nweak and inconsistent. The Department of Homeland Security's budgets \nhave not reflected port security's significance to the economy, and the \nAgency has missed numerous internal and legislated security deadlines. \nAs a result, vulnerabilities remain.\n  Given the recent focus on the Nation's lingering, significant port \nsecurity weaknesses, the country is now far more attuned to port and \ncargo security. The heartland is learning what the coasts have known \nfor many years: Our national economy and physical security depend on \nstrong port and cargo security.\n  Our legislation makes the many enhancements that are long overdue. It \nguides and enhances the Coast Guard's and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's, DHS, authorities on maritime security. It improves \nexamination of cargo before it reaches U.S. ports, provides a process \nfor the speedy resumption of commerce in the event of an attack on a \nseaport, and expands the use of interagency operations centers.\n  Specifically, our legislation improves the examination of shipments \nbefore they reach U.S. shores. It calls upon the U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection, CBP, to develop standards for the evaluation, \nscreening, and inspection of cargo destined for the U.S. prior to \nloading in a foreign port, and it provides greater targeting and \nscrutiny of high-risk cargo by requiring importers to file entry data \n24-hours prior to loading at a foreign port.\n  Also, the legislation authorizes the random inspection of incoming \ncargo--a method which has proven to be 12 times more likely to find \nillicit shipments than traditional inspection methods.\n  In the event there is a seaport attack, our bill clarifies the \nrequirements for expedited clearance of cargo through the Secure \nSystems of Transportation Program and extends the supply chain review \nto the initial point of loading. The bill also amends MTSA based on \nGovernment Accountability Office, GAO, recommendations to improve upon \nthe Container Security Initiative, CSI, the Customs-Trade Partnership \nAgainst Terrorism Program, C-TPAT, and Automated Targeting System, ATS.\n  It is important to note that while our port security regime has \nsignificant weaknesses, the agencies involved have also begun to make \nsome notable improvements in recent years. According to the Department \nof Homeland Security Inspector General's most recent report on the port \nsecurity grant program, the DHS has made substantial progress on the \nprogram and is beginning to deliver funding to the Nation's ports \nefficiently and effectively.\n  Our legislation builds upon the port and cargo security systems that \nhave taken 4 years to develop and provides the resources necessary to \nstrengthen port security infrastructure, planning, and coordination. \nOther pending proposals have sought to reorganize the DHS yet again and \nadd an additional layer of bureaucracy through a new Office of Cargo \nPolicy. Such changes are counterproductive and suggest a lack of \nunderstanding of local stakeholders' actual needs and given the need \nfor immediate improvements, they make little sense.\n  Our committee has also brought its transportation security expertise \nto bear on the challenges facing rail security. Consistent with the \nRail Security Act approved unanimously by the Senate in 108th Congress, \nour legislation requires the Transportation Security Administration, \nTSA, to conduct a railroad sector threat assessment and submit \nprioritized recommendations for improving rail security. It also calls \nfor the TSA and the Department of Transportation to clarify their \nrespective roles for rail security.\n  Our legislation provides grants through TSA to Amtrak, freight \nrailroads, and others to upgrade security across the entire railroad \nsystem. It provides funding through the Department of Transportation to \nmake needed security and safety enhancements to Amtrak railroad tunnels \nin New York, Washington, and Baltimore.\n  Our bill creates a rail security research and development program \nthrough DHS and encourages the deployment of rail car tracking \nequipment for hazardous material rail shipments. It so requires \nrailroads shipping high-hazard materials to create threat mitigation \nplans to protect high-consequence targets when specific threat \ninformation exists.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes studies to improve passenger rail \nscreening and immigration processing along the U.S. northern border, \ncreates a security training program for railroad workers, and provides \nwhistleblower protections for workers who report security concerns.\n  All of these enhancements have been thoroughly vetted over several \nyears of meticulous work. They have received the unanimous support of \nour committee membership, and in the case of the rail security \nprovisions, the support of the full Senate in 2004.\n  In the 108th Congress, the Senate conclusive determined that \ntransportation security and transportation safety could not be \nseparated. Thus, given its oversight of the Coast Guard, TSA, and its \ngeneral expertise in transportation matters, the Commerce Committee \nmaintained jurisdiction over transportation security generally, and \nport, cargo, and rail security specifically. Similarly, the Banking \nCommittee's expertise in urban transit has made it the Committee of \njurisdiction for public transit security.\n  This expertise matters, particularly when crafting legislation that \nimpacts how these systems operate. Transportation security legislation \nmust reflect a balanced understanding of security, safety, and \ncommerce. It is not enough to understand just one of those elements. \nOur economy is totally dependent upon efficient and effective \ntransportation systems. Thus, our security policies must be robust, but \nthey cannot ignore the realities of modern commerce nor the potential \neconomic damage that could result from public policies that did not \nsufficiently take into account the resumption of our systems.\n  The legislation that we advance today reflects the Commerce and \nBanking Committees' expertise and understanding of this important \nbalance. The time has come to advance these improvements, and nearly \nhalf of this body has already signed-on in support of this bill. Our \nlegislation presents an opportunity to make immediate progress on \ntransportation security, and it is my sincere hope that the Senate will \nact on this measure as soon as possible.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nin introducing legislation to improve security at our Nation's transit \nsystems, rail lines, and ports. The transit title in this legislation \nwas reported unanimously by the Banking Committee in November of last \nyear, and the rail and port titles were reported on the same day by the \nCommerce Committee. Combining these titles into one piece of \nlegislation makes extraordinary sense when one considers the urgent \nneed to improve security in all areas of our Nation's multimodal \ntransportation network.\n  As ranking member of the Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction \nover public transportation, I will focus my remarks on the transit \nportion of this legislation, though the need for improved security is \nequally great at our rail network and ports. Let me begin by noting \nthat during the last Congress, the Senate unanimously passed the Public \nTransportation Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which is identical to \nthe transit title in the legislation we are introducing today. \nUnfortunately, that legislation was never enacted into law, and the \nthreat to transit continues. Just last week the Department of Homeland \nSecurity issued a new warning to transit systems to remain alert \nagainst possible terrorist attacks. According to the Associated Press, \nthe warning said that four people had been arrested over the last \nseveral months in separate incidents involving videotaping of European \nsubway stations and trains or similar activity, which provides \n``indications of continued terrorist interest in mass transit systems \nas targets.''\n  Last year, the London subway system was the target of a tragic attack \nthat left 50 people dead, and in 2004, almost 200 people were killed \nwhen bombs exploded on commuter rail\n\n[[Page S4476]]\n\ntrains in Madrid. In fact, in 2002, the GAG reported that one-third of \nall terrorist attacks worldwide are against transit systems. Despite \nthis significant threat, security funding has been grossly inadequate, \nand, as a result, our Nation's transit systems have been unable to \nimplement necessary security improvements, including those that have \nbeen identified by the Department of Homeland Security. In an editorial \nlast July, just after the London attacks, the Baltimore Sun stated \nthat: Since September 11, 2001, the Federal Government has spent $18 \nbillion on aviation security. Transit systems, which carry 16 times \nmore passengers daily, have received about $250 million. That is a \nridiculous imbalance.\n  The editorial goes on to state:\n\n       How would those in charge of the nation's public transit \n     systems spend the extra money? Chiefly for necessities like \n     security cameras, radios, training an extra security \n     personnel. Those aren't extravagant requests.\n\n  Let me give one example of a critical need right here with respect to \nWashington's Metro. Their greatest security need is a backup control \noperations center. This need was identified by the Federal Transit \nAdministration in its initial security assessment and then identified \nagain by the Department of Homeland Security in its subsequent security \nassessment. This critical need remains unaddressed because it has been \nunfunded. This legislation would authorize the funding to make this and \nother urgently needed security upgrades at transit systems around the \ncountry.\n  We know that transit systems are potential targets for terrorist \nattacks. We know the vital role these systems play in our Nation's \neconomic infrastructure. We can wait no longer to make these security \ninvestments.\n  I thank the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Shelby, for \nhis excellent leadership on transit security and Senator Reed for his \nstrong and continued commitment on this issue. I also commend the \nleadership of the Commerce Committee for their foresight in moving the \nport and rail titles of this legislation. I thank all of our colleagues \nwho have joined as cosponsors of this legislation, and I urge the full \nSenate to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG:\n  S. 2792. A bill to revise and extend certain provisions of the Public \nHealth Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GREGG. As we seen in recent years, our Nation is not immune from \nmajor public health and medical emergencies such as the terrorist \nattacks on 9/11 or Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Many of us were living \nunder a false sense of security that the United States was not \nsusceptible to major terrorist attacks. We also believed that our \nFederal, state, and local governments had all the appropriate emergency \npreparedness measures in place to handle even the worst-case disasters, \nlike the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina or a pandemic outbreak \nof avian flu.\n  Prior to 9/11, our Nation's public health system provided passive \nsurveillance to detect and track the spread of infectious diseases and \nto educate the public on how to better protect themselves. Are we \nbetter prepared today to handle a national public health emergency than \nwe were prior to 9/11? I would say yes. But, we need to do more.\n  In the five years since 9/11 our Nation's public health system has \nbegun to transform into a health system able to respond to public \nhealth emergencies, whether it is a terrorist attack, such as the \nanthrax, or a natural event.\n  The Bioterrorism and Public Health Emergency Preparedness Act of \n2002, which I co-authored, provided a number of critical provisions to \nstrengthen our Nation's public health infrastructure after we were \nattacked on 9/11. The act has authorized almost $8 billion for state \nand local public health and hospital preparedness to increase medical \nsurge capacity and surveillance capabilities. The act created the \nOffice of Public Health and Emergency Preparedness at HHS to coordinate \nFederal public health and medical emergency preparedness and response, \nsuch as significant increases of vaccines, antivirals, and medical \nsupplies, such as gloves, masks and first-aid equipment for rapid \ndeployment anywhere in the U.S. through the Strategic National \nStockpile. The act also strengthened border protection authorities, \nincluding quarantine and isolation, and food importation and our water \nsupply.\n  While the Bioterrorism and Emergency Preparedness Act of 2002 \nimproved our Nation's public health and medical response \ninfrastructure, much work remain. We still cannot say with any \ncertainty that states are more prepared than before 9/11 because we \nstill do not have meaningful standards to evaluate our level of \npreparedness. Once states develop preparedness plans, we must test and \nevaluate them. Individuals throughout all levels of government and the \nprivate sector agree that one of the biggest public health weaknesses \nis the lack of adequate testing and evaluation of the response plans \nlong before an emergency occurs.\n  Now that we've had almost five years to strengthen our capacity to \nrespond effectively to a national emergency, we need to now shift our \nfocus to areas that are especially at a high risk of a terrorist attack \nor a natural emergency. The Federal government must play a role, but \ncannot stand alone. The state and local public health and medical first \nresponders will be on front lines during a national emergency. State \nand local governments have the in-depth knowledge of their own medical \nsurge capacity and response plans and must play a significant role in \ntheir own preparedness preparations.\n  We need to do more to encourage states and regions to coordinate and \nshare resources, including personnel, hospital beds and medical \nsupplies during a major emergency. The public health and emergency \nmedical response community agrees that it is critical to establish \nregional agreements among neighboring states. A regional approach will \ngreatly increase a state's surge capacity to handle a major public \nhealth emergency. Incentivizing states to coordinate emergency \npreparedness planning is critical. My state of New Hampshire, along \nwith Maine and Vermont, have established memo of understanding to share \nresources, such as medical personnel and hospital beds, during an \nemergency in the region.\n  Finally, we must establish coordination among all levels of \ngovernment--from the Federal government all the way down to the city \nand town leaders. The Federal response during a national emergency is \nmanaged by the Department of Homeland Security and guided by the \nNational Response Plan (NRP). The NRP directs the Department of Health \nand Human Services (HHS) to lead the Federal public health and medical \nresponse and support the state and local first-responders. It is \nessential that clear and robust lines of communication are developed \nbetween federal agencies to effectively prepare for and respond to \nnational emergencies.\n  Our Nation has certainly had its share of very difficult \ncircumstances to overcome in recent years. I believe these incidents \nhave given us a real wake-up call that we must prepare at all levels of \ngovernment to provide a rapid and robust response. I believe the bill I \nam introducing today will focus on all levels of government to be \naccountable and prepared to better respond to national public health \nand medical emergencies.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 2793. A bill to enhance research and education in the areas of \npharmaceutical and biotechnology science and engineering, including \ntherapy development and manufacturing, analytical technologies, \nmodeling, and informatics; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nPharmaceutical Technology and Education Enhancement Act. The \nlegislation that I introduce today would improve pharmaceutical and \nbiotechnological development and manufacturing through education and \nresearch at our nation's institutions of higher education. By expanding \npharmaceutical science, technology and engineering research within our \nuniversities, this bill aims to expedite the drug manufacturing \nprocess,\n\n[[Page S4477]]\n\nthereby producing quality pharmaceuticals at a more affordable cost to \nconsumers.\n  In 1999, 8.2 percent of total health care spending in the United \nStates was attributed to prescription drugs. By 2010, prescription \ndrugs are expected to account for 14 percent of our nation's health \ncare spending. In addition, the average cost of bringing a new drug to \nmarket has risen 50 percent in the last five years, now costing as much \nas $1,700,000,000.\n  The trend of rising pharmaceutical costs is disturbing as it \ndiscourages innovation and impedes efforts to fight disease and address \nimportant public health concerns. High pharmaceutical manufacturing \ncosts associated with outdated manufacturing processes significantly \ncontribute to the rising cost of prescription drugs and overall health \ncare in our country.\n  This legislation would establish a partnership between the Food and \nDrug Administration and other federal agencies, the pharmaceutical and \nmedical industries, and the National Institute for Pharmaceutical \nTechnology and Education whose member institutions include Purdue \nUniversity, in my home state of Indiana, and ten other exemplary \nresearch universities throughout the country. This collaboration will \nexpand the ability of those in the academic research field to \ncontribute to the medical technology and pharmaceutical industries to \ncreate better quality products with more efficient, less costly \nmanufacturing.\n  Without a change in the pharmaceutical manufacturing process, health \ncare costs in this country will continue to rise and prevalent public \nhealth concerns will remain unanswered. Engaging the academic community \nin this process is vital and I urge my colleagues to join me as co-\nsponsors of this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 2794. A bill to ensure the equitable provision of pension and \nmedical benefits to Department of Energy contractor employees; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today Senators Reid, Baucus, Bingaman, \nHarkin, Mikulski and Cantwell join me in introducing legislation to \nprotect the pensions and health care of America's nuclear defense and \nenergy workers who provide critical services to support our national \ndefense and energy security.\n  Our bill reverses a policy the Bush administration recently issued to \neliminate secure pensions and good health care for workers under \nDepartment of Energy contracts. This policy is bad for workers and bad \nfor business. By attacking their secure pensions and quality health \ncare benefits, this administration is undermining our government's \nability to protect our Nation and strengthen our economy. And it is \nbroadcasting a message that American workers' secure retirement and \ngood health care should be put on the chopping block. The Federal \nGovernment should be setting a good example with strong benefits for \nworkers, instead of leading a race to the bottom.\n  By refusing to cover the costs for secure pensions, this \nadministration is forcing contractors to put their employees into \ndefined contribution plans. Workers will bear the risks of uncertain \nstock markets and the risk of outliving their savings. And businesses, \ninstead of being free to choose which type of retirement plan is best \nfor their workers, will be forced into a one-size-fits-all model.\n  The American Academy of Actuaries, the professionals who understand \nas well as anyone the benefit system in America, strongly objects to \nthe Department's new policy, pointing out that it takes away \ncontractors' ability to choose the type of benefit plans offered to \nworkers and undermines retirement security. They urge that this policy \nbe immediately rescinded.\n  This is a particular concern given the timing of this announcement. \nRight now we have a pension bill in conference designed to strengthen \nthe defined benefit pension system.\n  At this critical time, the administration should be supporting the \ngrowth and expansion of the defined benefit pension system. But instead \nit is going the other way, by forcing businesses to abandon defined \nbenefit pension plans. This says to me that this President is not \ncommitted to a secure retirement for Americans. First he tried to \nprivatize Social Security; now he's trying to use our federal \ncontracting system to do the same with our Nation's nuclear defense \nworkers.\n  The administration is also attacking employer-provided health care, \nby saying the government will not pay more than the average in the \nindustry for health care costs under Department of Energy contracts. In \nother words, it will pay only the average or below.\n  And the quality health care benefits Department of Energy contractors \noffer workers will have to be replaced by limited medical plans that \nunfairly penalize the least healthy workers.\n  These high deductible plans don't work for people who need health \ncare the most. Persons with chronic health conditions or who are hit \nwith illness or injury will have to pay significantly more than they \nwould with the comprehensive insurance that the administration's \nproposal eliminates. These individuals will never be able to find the \nfunds to cover the care they need before meeting the high-deductible \nneeded for their plan to cover them. Is this how we want to treat \nAmerican workers?\n  If the President's goal is to cut spending for health care, this is \nthe wrong way to go about it. Workers with the kind of high-deductible \nhealth plan President Bush has mandated for Department of Energy \ncontractors are more likely to avoid, skip or delay the care that \nprevents a medical crisis. This means workers will get care when they \nare sicker and may need costly hospital or emergency room care. \nShifting costs to workers drives up costs instead of cutting them.\n  Last week Senator Reid, Senators Baucus, Bingaman, Harkin, Mikulski, \nCantwell, Murray and I sent a letter to the White House calling on the \nPresident to overturn this ill-conceived policy and call off his attack \non the retirement security and health care of these skilled workers. We \nhope that the President will reconsider. But if he does not, we will be \nlooking for every opportunity to address this issue through this \nlegislation.

Mr. President, the hurricanes of last summer brought new \ndemands on all of our nation's rescue resources. The needs of children, \nparticularly young children and their families, are unique and not a \npart of local and national recovery plans. Mental health, physical \nneeds, day care, education, and family separation continue to be needs \nthat for communities to address.\n  The National Center for Rural Early Childhood Learning Initiatives \nand the non-profit Save the Children, continue to lead the focused on \nthe special needs of children. While assessing damages and recording \ndestroyed facilities, the Rural Early Childhood center and Save the \nChildren, with assistance from others, also developed a plan for future \ndisasters.\n  Today I am introducing a Senate concurrent resolution that expresses \nthe sense of the Senate that the Federal Emergency Management Agency \nshould consider the unique needs of children and consider the recent \nexperiences, suggestions and solutions of organizations and research \ncenters. We ought to support the incorporation of child-specific needs \nand concerns into the National Response Plan. The Senator from \nLouisiana, Ms. Landrieu, is cosponsoring this resolution. We invite all \nSenators to join us.\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 94\n\n       Whereas major disasters resulting in Presidential disaster \n     declarations in the United States have increased from an \n     average of 38 per year in the 1980s, to 46 per year in the \n     1990s, to 52 per year during the first half of this decade;\n       Whereas the occurrence of major disasters in the United \n     States is expected to continue to increase in the foreseeable \n     future;\n       Whereas the number of people in the United States affected \n     by disasters each year is a staggering 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 \n     as measured by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (even \n     outside of truly catastrophic events as occurred on the Gulf \n     Coast in 2005);\n       Whereas 5,192 children were reported missing or displaced \n     to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children as a \n     result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and it took 6 \\1/2\\ \n     months to reunite the last child separated from her family;\n       Whereas the most serious of such cases were those 45 \n     children arriving at shelters separated from parents or \n     guardians with no adult supervision and it took more than 1 \n     month to resolve all of those cases;\n       Whereas 1,100 schools were closed immediately following \n     Hurricane Katrina and 372,000 schoolchildren were initially \n     unable to attend school in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast due \n     to the hurricane;\n       Whereas in Mississippi 7 percent and in Louisiana 21 \n     percent of elementary schools and secondary schools remained \n     closed 6 months after Hurricane Katrina;\n       Whereas more than 400,000 children under the age of 5 live \n     in or have evacuated from counties or parishes that have been \n     declared disaster areas by the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency;\n       Whereas the numbers of licensed child care facilities in \n     areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita declined by 4 \n     percent (54 facilities) in Mississippi and by 25 percent (356 \n     facilities) in Louisiana after the storms;\n       Whereas children are known to benefit from rapid mental \n     health programming following disasters to mitigate longer \n     term impacts;\n       Whereas the existing system of disaster management in the \n     United States is the purview of Federal, State, and local \n     government emergency management organizations and the \n     disaster management programs and activities of these \n     organizations are not mandated nor are able to fully respond \n     to the unique needs of children;\n       Whereas Federal, State, and local government emergency \n     management professionals lack the technical knowledge, \n     support, and contacts to address the unique needs of children \n     that need to be incorporated into such professionals' \n     disaster management programs and activities; and\n       Whereas existing legislative constraints on Federal \n     disaster response and recovery aid programs restrict disaster \n     officials from responding to the specific needs of children \n     in a disaster and there is no government liaison or program \n     concerning children's issues in disasters: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the needs of children and youth affected by major \n     disasters are unique and should be given special \n     consideration in planning, responding, and recovering to \n     major disasters; and\n       (2) the Federal Emergency Management Agency should consult \n     with appropriate child-focused non-governmental organizations \n     and public university national research centers with \n     experience in addressing the needs of children in major \n     disasters to address the needs of children and youth in \n     disaster preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation, \n     including by--\n       (A) incorporating suggestions from such organizations on \n     children's issues into the National Response Plan;\n       (B) seeking the recommendations of such organizations on \n     how to address the needs of children in emergency shelters, \n     trailer parks, and transitional housing sites;\n       (C) jointly developing child-, family-, early childhood \n     service-, and school-focused disaster preparedness materials \n     to support understanding of the impact of disasters on \n     children and strategies to mitigate them; and\n       (D) jointly developing risk assessment tools for \n     communities to use in determining children's specific \n     disaster risks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/11/senate-section/article/S4478-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4478-S4479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3925.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/11/senate-section/article/S4505-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as I indicated earlier today, the \nSenate passed the tax relief extension conference report. Chairman \nGrassley of course did an extraordinary job. He has the gratitude of \nall of us for his important role in advancing this extremely \nsignificant measure, which guarantees the continued robust economy we \nare enjoying.\n  Tomorrow we will be in a period of morning business. However, no \nvotes will occur tomorrow. Moments ago we reached an agreement for a \nvote on Tuesday morning that will be on the Smith circuit court \nnomination. We will return to the immigration bill on Monday, and we \nare hoping to have other votes stacked on Tuesday morning in relation \nto immigration amendments. The votes on Tuesday morning will be the \nnext set of rollcall votes.\n  Let me further underscore that it would be important for Members who \nhave amendments to the immigration bill to get over here Monday, lay \ndown and debate those amendments. We have a kind of gentlemen's \nagreement between the two parties here in the Senate that we are going \nto process a lot of amendments before completing that bill. The \noccupant of the chair, for example, has been deeply involved in this \nissue and has been very understanding of the needs of Members on this \nside who believe that amendments should be processed in the regular \norder before final passage on a bill of this magnitude. I know there is \na demand for amendments on the other side.\n  The way to accommodate all Senators, obviously, is for Senators to \ncome over here and offer their amendments, not delay; to be willing to \naccept rather short time agreements so that patience prevails around \nhere and we are able to accommodate the important amendments Senators \ndesire to offer on both sides of the aisle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/11/senate-section/article/S4505-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
