Mr. President, this morning we will resume consideration \nof the Energy bill. We will be spending all of this week and, in all \nlikelihood, all of next week on the bill. We plan on completing the \nbill by the end of next week. Yesterday, the chairman offered a first-\ndegree amendment relating to ethanol. Last night, we were able to \nconsider and table a second-degree amendment relating to safe harbor. \nToday, we will be considering another second-degree amendment which was \noffered by Senator Schumer. It is our expectation to have a vote in \nrelation to that amendment very shortly this morning, hopefully within \nthe next 30 minutes. Senators, therefore, should be on notice and their \noffices should notify them that we might be voting around 10 o'clock, \nor shortly thereafter. If we are able to table that amendment, we would \nlike to vote on the underlying first-degree amendment as well.\n  We expect to make further progress on the bill following those votes. \nSo it will be a very busy day. We may go into the early evening \ntonight. I know there are a number of events planned tonight. I say \nthat only to encourage people to come and offer their amendments and \ndebate their amendments over the course of the day.\n  We will be finishing the bill by the end of next week. The Democratic \nleader and I have been consistent with that regard. So we want people \nto come to the floor and offer those amendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we made a lot of progress yesterday. It may \nnot seem that way because all we did was ethanol. There were a lot of \nactivities going on behind the scenes to move this legislation forward. \nSenator Cantwell will offer her amendment this morning. I do not know \nhow long that will take. The unfortunate death of Jim Exon, I hope, \nwill not cause us to hold things up. I hope the two managers of the \nbill can have a number of amendments offered and stack those \namendments, with the permission of the majority leader, and probably \nvote on those, we hope, in the morning sometime.\n  The big issues left are a renewable standard for electricity, we have \na number of global warming issues, and there are other issues. If we \nget the Cantwell amendment decided and we do the global warming \namendments and electricity standards, I think we are down the road on \nthis important piece of legislation. We need cooperation from both \nsides.\n  It is an important piece of legislation. I know the President gave a \nspeech yesterday wanting us to move forward. We want to move forward on \nit. Senators Domenici and Bingaman have done a very good job of getting \nus to where we are.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/15/senate-section/article/S6600-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6600-S6601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6600]]\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today we will continue consideration of the \nEnergy bill, as we just discussed. The debate has been very thorough \nand robust. Today I expect it to be so as we debate a number of very \nimportant issues, but I am confident, very optimistic, that we will \nhave a strong bipartisan bill that will be overwhelmingly supported by \nthis body by the time we complete it at the end of next week.\n  I thank Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman for their tremendous \nleadership. They started in this session with a bipartisan commitment \nto produce a bill that speaks to the needs that are so clear and \nevident to all of us and to the American people. They deserve great \ncredit for working together and working hard through all of these \ncomplicated details to come up with a plan that both sides of the aisle \nwill be able to support.\n  I am pleased that during the Energy bill debate we are discussing the \nimportance of increasing our Nation's use of renewable fuels, such as \nethanol, which we spent a lot of time on yesterday, as we will today, \nas well as biodiesel.\n  I am a strong supporter of the renewable fuels standard which will \ndouble the use of ethanol and biodiesel over the next 7 years. \nIncreasing use of these home-grown, clean-burning renewable fuels is \nessential to reducing both our short- and long-term dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  We are currently, as has been discussed many times, 56 percent \ndependent on these foreign sources of oil with all predictions aiming \nthat we will be 68 percent dependent by 2025 if we do nothing. That is \na call to action and, in many ways, that explains much of the action on \nthe floor of the Senate this week.\n  One of the major goals in the bill is to reduce that dependence and \nthereby enhance our own energy security. We will accomplish that \nthrough adoption of this bill. The renewable fuels standard is a \ncritical component, an important aspect of this energy policy.\n  Increasing use of ethanol and biodiesel is a bipartisan issue. It was \nin the last Congress. I, along with the then-Democratic leader, Senator \nDaschle, introduced the renewable fuels standard amendment on the \nSenate floor. I am working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto help forge an agreement on this issue again this year, and I am very \npleased with our progress to date, over the course of yesterday, and I \nexpect today.\n  In particular I thank Senators Thune, Talent, Lugar, Hagel, Grassley, \nInhofe, Bond, Voinovich, Coleman, and colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle who worked so hard to get us to this point. It was, again, a \nhuge bipartisan effort with people in this body working together. I \nlook forward to supporting this bipartisan effort over the course of \nthe coming days.\n  When we go back to our States, again and again we hear that anyone \nfilling up that tank of gas knows that America is in desperate need of \nan energy plan. With gas now averaging well over $2 a gallon, every \nAmerican family, every worker, every small business owner is feeling \nthe bite, is feeling the pinch. Gas prices are taking a bigger and \nbigger piece out of the family budget and that, of course, leaves less \nmoney to spend on items such as clothes, food, groceries, as well as \nlooking forward to that next summer vacation.\n  We can do better. We are doing better in this bill. We know we can. \nAnd we have within our reach the ability to deliver clean, reliable, \nand affordable energy. All we have to do is imagine the future and \nproject out what the future is going to be like, and then pull that \nback to the present and take action by debating and, where appropriate, \namending the bill and then passing it over the next several days.\n  As we look to the future, imagine a future where coal is turned into \na clean, cheap gas. It is not as far away as one might think or as most \npeople thought 10 or 15 years ago. We have a 400- to 500-year supply of \ncoal right here in the United States. My colleague from Tennessee, \nSenator Alexander, discussed on the floor last week how, if we apply \nour technological know-how, imagination, and ability, capture that \ninnovation, we can turn that very coal into clean coal gas, and by \ndoing that, as a byproduct we would be able to share that with the \nentire world. We can do that by capturing our innovations, taking these \nnatural resources, applying those innovations in a way that transforms \nthem, and then sharing them with the entire world.\n  That is the sort of thinking that is going on in this bill. It is the \nsort of transformational thinking that the American people expect and \nshould expect. It is time for an energy plan that is long overdue but \nalso an energy plan that incorporates this innovation and this \ntechnology. We have gone on for way too long, we have gone on for 10 \nyears without a comprehensive plan. We have attempted this in the past. \nWe attempted it in the last Congress and we were unsuccessful. We \npassed a good bill on the Senate floor and the House passed a bill, but \nwe did not get agreement in conference to get a bill to the President \nof the United States.\n  As we have debated and have been unable to bring a bill to \nconclusion, energy prices have gone higher and higher. We have become \nmore and more dependent on foreign sources of energy. These foreign \nsources do not necessarily have the best interests of the United States \nat heart.\n  In the 1960s and early 1970s, the United States produced almost as \nmuch oil as we consumed. In those decades, imports were very small. In \nabout 1972, U.S. oil production began to decline, and it has been \ndeclining steadily ever since.\n  At the same time as our economy has grown, U.S. consumption of oil \nhas steadily increased. So declining supply, increased consumption. As \na result, our reliance on foreign oil and foreign sources of energy, of \ncourse, have had to increase. So the problem is pretty clear, and that \nis the response we are delivering on the Senate floor.\n  Today, we import most of our oil from the North, from Canada; also \nfrom the South, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico. However, as we \nlook out over the next 5, 10, and 15 years, the Department of Energy's \nEnergy Information Administration predicts that more of the oil that we \nneed will come from the OPEC countries in the Middle East.\n  We must take steps to reduce our dependence on foreign countries and \nthereby enhance our energy security at home. When we rely on other \nnations for more than half our oil supply, we simply put our security \nat risk. We need a system based upon efficiency, balance, and common \nsense. We need a system that will respond to the obvious needs that are \ngrowing worse, challenges that are increasing each day that we do not \nproduce a bill.\n  We can look at nuclear energy as a great example. It is clean, it is \nefficient, and it has the potential to significantly reduce our \ndependence on foreign supplies. The Navy powers dozens of its vessels \nwith nuclear energy and docks these ships at ports all over the world. \nThey have not had one accident.\n  France uses nuclear energy to provide 80 percent of its electricity \nsupply. Japan allows one, two, three new reactors to be built each \nyear. In the United States, we have not ordered a new nuclear power \nreactor plant in the last 30 years, since the 1970s. We can, and we \nshould, pursue commonsense efforts to produce clean, safe, affordable, \nand reliable energy, nuclear energy, for America's families. It only \nmakes sense. It is common sense.\n  Increasing our domestic supply is critically important, but we also \nhave to look at the conservation side of the equation. We simply need \nto look at the transportation sector. Nearly 70 percent of the oil we \nuse goes to power the cars and trucks that we drive every day. If we \nare serious about reducing our dependence on foreign oil, we must look \nat new ways to power and fuel those vehicles. We are already doing this \nwith hybrid cars which, as we all know, are becoming more popular, and \nwith the alternative fuels that we have been discussing on the floor \nyesterday and today, ethanol and biodiesel. We must continue to move in \nthis direction by continuing and increasing our investment in hydrogen \nfuel cell research.\n  President Bush has said that his goal is that today's children will \ntake their driver's test in a zero-emission vehicle. That would go a \nlong way toward helping to reduce our dependence and enhance our \nsecurity.\n\n[[Page S6601]]\n\n  The fuel that we are increasingly talking about, which is probably \nthe most dramatic when we look at the challenges before us, is natural \ngas. Natural gas is another energy source we depend on heavily and \nanother area in which we are becoming increasingly reliant on imports. \nBecause natural gas is clean burning and relatively cheap, it has \nbecome the fuel of choice for new electric power generation in recent \nyears. Sixty percent of homes across America are heated and cooled \ntoday with natural gas.\n  While demand has been steadily growing, and for good reason, domestic \nsupply has remained relatively flat. In fact, in 2003, we imported 15 \npercent of the gas we used but by 2025 the percent of gas that is used \nthat will be imported is going to go up twofold, is going to double. \nYes, we need to take bold action in the United States to address \nAmerica's energy challenges, and we need to do this head on. We are \ndoing that on the Senate floor.\n  The Energy bill we are debating over these 2 weeks is a strong step \nin the right direction. I hope that we will be able to continue to work \ntogether to pass a strong and bipartisan bill so we can get this \nimportant legislation to the President of the United States so that he \ncan sign it.\n  America needs this policy. It needs this policy to keep our families \nsafe, strong, and secure. We need a policy that keeps us competitive, \nand we need a policy that continues to help us to move forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/15/senate-section/article/S6601-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, from the outset of the debate on John \nBolton's nomination, Senate Democrats have had a clear and consistent \nposition. If the administration works in good faith to give the Senate \nthe information it deserves, the Senate Democrats are ready to \nimmediately give this nomination an up-or-down vote. We said this as \nfar back as April, and it remains our position today. Despite the \nadministration's refusal to turn over any of the requested information \nduring this time period, Senator Frist told me yesterday he was \ninclined to seek another vote on the Bolton nomination. While the \nmajority leader is certainly within his rights to do this, unless the \nadministration changes course before this vote is held, the outcome \nwill be exactly the same as it was last month and may even have less \nsupport than it did before.\n  Here is why: The history and precedent in the Senate makes it clear \nthe Senate has a right to information that bears directly on the \nfitness of a political nominee to serve. Virtually every other \nadministration has recognized the Senate's rights and provided the \nneeded information--every administration, that is, except this one. \nMany colleagues on the majority have stood for the Senate's right to \nget information from the executive branch in the past. We have many \nstatements on record to that effect. These colleagues have made it \nclear, with their words and deeds, that it was perfectly legitimate for \nthe Senate to withhold action on an executive nominee until the \nexecutive branch provided certain information, even if the information \nrequested had nothing to do with the nominee in question.\n  In this instance, we are seeking information that bears directly on \nthe fitness of John Bolton to serve as our representative to the United \nNations. We are not engaging in any fishing expedition. We are seeking \nclearly defined documents and information about two very important \nissues:\n  No. 1, did Bolton attempt to exaggerate what Congress would be told \nabout Syria's alleged weapons of mass destruction capabilities? \nRemember, we have some experience in weapons of mass destruction \ninformation being altered and manipulated.\n  No. 2, did Bolton use and perhaps misuse highly classified \nintelligence intercepts to spy on bureaucratic rivals who disagreed \nwith his views or for other inappropriate purposes?\n  These are two very direct, simple issues that bear on this man's \ncapability and fitness to serve in the United Nations.\n  The administration's position on these requests has been that \npolitical appointees are qualified to see this information but that \nSenators elected by the American people are not. I believe this is \nunacceptable.\n  During this impasse, Senate Democrats have repeatedly demonstrated \nour good faith to break the current impasse and give Mr. Bolton a vote. \nYesterday, I heard some of my Republican colleagues assert that \nDemocrats have been shifting the goalpost on resolving this issue, and \nthey are absolutely right, we have. Instead of having a 100-yard \nfootball field, now we have made it only 60 yards. We have moved in \ntheir direction. Just last week, Senators Biden, ranking member of \nForeign Relations and, of course, Senator Dodd, the ranking member of \nthe Rules Committee, made another effort to resolve the impasse over \nthe Bolton nomination. Everyone in the Senate and outside this body \nshould understand that this offer moves significantly away from our \ninitial request in a sincere effort to resolve the situation. Everyone \nshould also understand that, unfortunately, this latest effort to reach \nan accommodation with the White House has apparently met the same fate \nas previous efforts to work things out--silence from the \nadministration.\n  Even yesterday, the ranking member of the Finance Committee--I should \nsay the vice chair Senator Rockefeller of West Virginia, which is the \nproper title--offered his assistance, to break the impasse. He sent a \nletter to the Director of National Intelligence, John Negroponte, to \nthat effect.\n  We have said publicly, if this administration, similar to every other \nadministration, respects the requests of the Senate, we will \nimmediately move to grant Bolton an up-or-down vote. I stand by that \npledge today. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will \nrecognize we are following their precedent with our actions today. I \nhope this administration brings an end to its pattern of abusing its \npowers and treats this coequal branch of Government with the respect it \ndeserves.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/15/senate-section/article/S6601-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6601-S6614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2005\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 6, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6) to ensure jobs for our future with secure, \n     affordable and reliable energy.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Domenici amendment No. 779 (to amendment No. 775), to \n     eliminate methyl tertiary butyl ether from the United States \n     fuel supply, to increase production and use of renewable \n     fuel, and to increase the Nation's energy independence.\n       Schumer amendment No. 782 (to amendment No. 779), to strike \n     the reliable fuels subtitle of the amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I believe the order of business is my \nsecond-degree amendment to the amendment of my friend from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the pending question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. When do we expect a vote, Mr. President? What is the \norder of business here?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We do not yet have a consent request. We are \nexpecting that soon.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will address this amendment. Let me \nsay, this amendment is one that still requires all the Clean Air \nstandards to be met but removes the ethanol mandate. That is what this \namendment does.\n  The underlying Domenici amendment on ethanol is so wrong. The \namendment is a boondoggle. It hurts drivers and it hurts the free \nmarket. It is a boondoggle because it takes money out of the pockets of \ndrivers and puts it into the pockets of the big ethanol producers.\n\n[[Page S6602]]\n\n  The bottom line is very simple. In places where they need ethanol, \nthere is a mandate, and in places where they do not need ethanol, there \nis a mandate. This is nothing less than an ethanol gas tax levied on \nevery driver: the employee driving to work, the mom driving the kids to \nschool, the truckdriver who earns a living. Gas prices are high enough. \nIt is utterly amazing that in this body we seek to raise the prices \neven higher than they are now because that is what this amendment will \ndo--particularly if you are on the coasts or in large parts of the \nSouth. If you are not in an area that has a lot of ethanol production, \nmake no mistake about it, the underlying amendment will raise your gas \nprices. The Schumer amendment will make sure that gas prices do not go \nup any higher because of an ethanol mandate.\n  The bottom line is this boondoggle not only hurts drivers and puts \nmoney in the pockets of the big ethanol producers, but this amendment \nputs a dagger in the heart of the concept of a free market. We have \nlots of my friends, particularly on the other side of the aisle, who \npraise the free market all the time--as they should. But then they fold \nto the ethanol lobby and vote for one of the most anti-free-market \namendments that has come on this floor in decades, because not only do \nwe subsidize ethanol, which we do, and not only do we deal with ethanol \nin terms of imports, not only do we require ethanol in this amendment \nwhether you need it but, amazingly enough, this amendment says: If you \ndo not use the ethanol, you still have to pay for it.\n  So somebody driving in New York or Philadelphia or Boston or Bangor, \nME, somebody driving in Seattle or Portland or Los Angeles or San \nFrancisco--areas where there is not much ethanol--is going to pay 5 \ncents, 10 cents, 15 cents more to go into the pockets of the ethanol \nproducers, even when the drivers do not use ethanol.\n\n  It is so unfair to do this. It is wrong to do this. If you come from \nIowa or Illinois, and ethanol is good for your gasoline and it is the \nbest way to make it cleaner, that is fine. But if there are other ways \nto do this, then why do we require ethanol?\n  We know why. Some say it will help the corn grower. When was the last \ntime the little family farmer benefited from a policy where three or \nfour big companies control the show? They do not benefit when it comes \nto meat, they do not benefit when it comes to milk, they do not benefit \nwhen it comes to wheat, they do not benefit when it comes to corn. So \nto put a few pennies--and that is all it will be--in the pocket of the \nfamily farmer, we charge drivers around the country billions of \ndollars.\n  Make no mistake about it, most of those billions will not go to the \nfamily farmer, they will go to the Archer Daniels Midlands of the \nworld--a company that was once accused of price fixing. There will be \nno free market here at all.\n  There could not be an amendment that does more damage--damage to \ndrivers, damage to the free market, damage to the system that says we \ndo not force things on people they do not need. It is hard to believe.\n  I know the political forces here. We have coalitions. We have big \nindustry and people from the corn-growing States on one side. But if we \nrequired every person in New Mexico or Georgia or West Virginia or \nMontana to buy New York milk, no matter how much it cost and whether \nthey needed it, you would be on your feet hollering. But to require New \nYork drivers and drivers from Maine and Florida and Texas and Arizona \nand California and Washington to buy Middle Western corn-based ethanol \nis equally outrageous.\n  We have had this amendment around for a while. I have been fighting \nit as long as I have been here. I understand the political forces, but \nthe political forces should not mitigate what is right. If you believe \nin the free market, if you believe in protecting drivers, do not vote \nfor this amendment. If you would not vote for a gas tax, why vote for \nan ethanol tax? It is the same thing. It is the same concept. There are \nmany other ways to make the air cleaner.\n  Talk to refiners on the coasts. They can crack the petroleum to meet \nthe Clean Air standards. They are not going to buy the ethanol, anyway, \nbut they are still going to have to pay for it.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this poorly conceived, unfair \namendment that puts a dagger in the heart of anything that we might \nconsider the free market.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment will gut the ethanol \namendment which has been crafted in a bipartisan manner. My good friend \nfrom New York suggested it would be unfair to make us all buy milk \nproduced in New York. I think that would not only be unfair, but it \nwould be a disaster because we wouldn't have any milk anywhere because \nthey do not produce enough milk to go anywhere in the United States.\n  In any event, we ought to table this amendment and get on with the \nEnergy bill. I compliment the Senator on his arguments. He always makes \nexcellent arguments in behalf of his State and his people. In this case \nI believe the country is going to be well served by making us less \ndependent upon oil that is imported from a cartel.\n  He speaks of competition and whether there is going to be competition \nin ethanol. Let's be serious about this. There is no competition in the \nworld markets for oil. In this case we are going to be producing \nethanol that is American in order to displace, gallon by gallon, the \noil we import.\n  Having said that, I move to table the amendment. I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislatuve clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski), and the Senator from Alaska (Mr. \nStevens).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Jeffords) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 779\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are still on the ethanol amendment. I understand--so \nSenators will know--there are still negotiations taking place. I am \nhopeful they will be fruitful with reference to some portion of this \namendment. We are going to stay on it and see what happens.\n  In the meantime, a couple Senators have indicated they would like to \nspeak. I understood Senator Akaka had\n\n[[Page S6603]]\n\ncome up and asked if he could be heard. He is not here.\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are ready for the next amendment. What I \nwould suggest for the good of the order is that while they are \nnegotiating a finality of this ethanol amendment--that is taking place \nas we speak--Senator Cantwell be allowed to move forward on her \namendment. We would certainly agree that anytime they want to come back \nand finish the work on ethanol, she would step aside. But we have such \na limited amount of time on this most important piece of legislation.\n  We have today. Of course, because of the funeral of Senator Exon, we \ncannot have votes this afternoon. There are six or seven Senators \nleaving. Then we have a longstanding conference on Friday, so tomorrow \nis going to be the heavy workload of this week.\n  This is our first amendment. We believe we would do well if we could \nmove forward with it. Senator Cantwell has been very patient. She \nwaited here all day yesterday, and she is here again today.\n  So I am wondering--I see, of course, that the distinguished chairman \nof the committee is here. I wonder if I could have Senator Inhofe's \nattention. If I could, I am sorry to interrupt the conversation, but I \nam wondering if the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma would allow the \npresent amendment to be set aside. I know there are negotiations going \non at the present time. We could allow Senator Cantwell to offer her \namendment. Anytime you wanted to come back on the floor, we would be \nhappy to yield the floor and come back to you. It would just help \nthings move along.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I say to the distinguished minority leader that I \nappreciate his comments and I note his thoughts, but the answer would \nbe no.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the majority leader, and I want to \nmove this legislation along. We have great plans for the last week of \nthis work period to do some appropriations bills, one of which I hope \nwould be the bill of Senator Domenici and this Senator which we have \nbeen fortunate enough to be chairman and ranking member of that \ncommittee for many years. We were able to complete that yesterday in \nthe subcommittee and will be ready to move. It is such a waste of the \ncountry's time not to move forward. I have made my good-faith gesture \nto do so. I hope everyone understands that we can't rush forward on \ncloture when there is nothing having been done to allow us to offer \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me say to the distinguished minority leader, I am \nfully aware of the problem he has discussed. I am empathetic and want \nto move ahead. But I think it is better for a while to let the ethanol \ndeal which is being considered in terms of perhaps some modification to \ncontinue for a while rather than get off of it. We are going to do the \nbest we can to move this bill. We need your help. We need our leader's \nhelp to move ahead.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the chairman yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Oklahoma that if his amendment \nbecame the pending business right after Cantwell, he would be in \nexactly the same position he is in right now. Our discussions could \ncontinue. It would at least allow the Senate to process another \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that Senator Inhofe's amendment or \nthe underlying ethanol amendment will be the pending business after \nCantwell. That would be fine with us.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me ask maybe if we could put in a quorum for a \nminute.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have had a conversation as suggested by \nthe distinguished chairman. He is, as usual, right.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and \nthat Senator Cantwell be allowed to offer her amendment, and that at \nsuch time as the majority wants to regain the floor to discuss the \nmatter of ethanol, Senator Cantwell would step down.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, how long do you think \nthe Cantwell amendment might take?\n  Mr. REID. A couple of hours. With the 12:30 schedule, I would hope we \nwould have a vote on ethanol; otherwise, we will debate that and \nwhenever that finishes move to another issue, if ethanol is not \nresolved. It is not going to be a day-long debate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I ask the distinguished minority leader another \nquestion? Do you know if there are any other amendments that are ready \non your side after Senator Cantwell?\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that the ranking member of the \ncommittee has one on renewables that is ready to go, electricity \nrenewables, portfolio standard that we have debated on a number of \noccasions. I assume that with all the work done on global warming, \nthere are several amendments around, some of which are bipartisan. I am \nsure that is ready to go. So there are a number of amendments ready to \ngo.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think global warming is going to wait until next \nweek.\n  Mr. REID. Which is fine with us.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection--just a moment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, I would inquire of the \nChair, was there a UC proposed?\n  Mr. REID. Basically, to set aside this amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. To set aside mine. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for giving \nme this brief opportunity to speak about the renewable fuels provisions \nin the Energy bill. I thank my colleagues, Senators Frist and Reid, for \ntheir leadership, and Senators Lugar, Harkin, Talent, and so many \nothers for their efforts in developing this important legislation.\n  I am here today to support the renewable fuels provision in the \nSenate Energy bill. This legislation is one of the pillars for economic \ndevelopment for rural America, one segment of the population that \nlagged behind in the economic surge of the 1990s, yet a segment \npositioned to play such an integral role in fueling our Nation.\n  It is rare when legislation benefits all. It is rare when legislation \ncreates only winners. It is clear that the production and use of \nrenewable fuels is a win/win situation--a win for farmers from rural \ncommunities, a win for consumers, and a win for the environment. That \nis why as Governor of Nebraska, I invited other Governors interested in \ncreating a group devoted to the promotion and increased use of ethanol \nto join me in Nebraska. In September of 1991, we met, and the \nGovernors' Ethanol Coalition emerged. Membership in the coalition \ndoubled from 9 to 19 States during the first year, and now stands at 30 \nStates, with international representatives from Brazil, Canada, Mexico, \nSweden, and Thailand--30 States, red and blue States.\n  First, I mentioned this legislation is a win for farmers in rural \ncommunities. Three years ago, we completed the farm bill which at the \ntime was characterized as one very important part of the economic \nrevitalization plan for rural America. Economic stimulus can come in \nmany forms and the production of renewable fuels is certainly a viable \noption for rural America, especially--and candidly--in my State of \nNebraska.\n  It is as simple as this: Demand for corn to create ethanol raises \nprices for corn. Demand for sorghum to create ethanol raises prices for \nsorghum. Demand for soybeans to create biodiesel raises prices for \nsoybeans. Added to the important feature of farm profitability is the \nidea that increased grain prices result in less assistance to producers \nunder the farm bill in the form of loan deficiency payments and \ncountercyclical payments--yes, less government assistance. Merging the \nrealities of agricultural economics and farm policy into energy \nlegislation is the type of responsible legislation the voters sent us \nhere to enact.\n\n[[Page S6604]]\n\n  I am unabashedly proud of what my home State has accomplished in this \narea. Within the State of Nebraska, 11 ethanol plants currently produce \n523 million gallons of ethanol per year or 12 percent of the Nation's \ntotal. The benefits of the ethanol program in Nebraska don't just \ninvolve grain producers. It involves investment in industry, the \ncreation of jobs related to plant construction, operation, and \nmaintenance. It includes permanent jobs at the ethanol facilities and \nstimulates the economic engines in small rural communities. In Nebraska \nalone, more than 270 million bushels of corn and grain sorghum is \nprocessed at the plants annually. These economic benefits and others \nhave increased each year during the past decade due to plant expansion, \nemployment increases, and additional capital investment.\n  Next, a win for consumers: A study released by the Consumer \nFederation of America points out that motorists could be saving as much \nas 8 cents per gallon of gasoline at the pump if oil refiners would \nblend more ethanol into their gasoline supplies.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a copy of the Consumer \nFederation of America Report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nOver a Barrel--Why Aren't Oil Companies Using Ethanol To Lower Gasoline \n                                Prices?\n\n                            (By Mark Cooper)\n\n       Across the country, consumers are facing the highest \n     gasoline prices in memory, while oil companies are reporting \n     record profits. The profits at ExxonMobil alone exceeded $25 \n     billion in 2004 with every expectation that 2005 profits will \n     be even greater. The Wall Street Journal recently reported, \n     ``Exxon Mobil Corp. is gushing money. Amid soaring crude-oil \n     prices, it recently reported a fourth-quarter profit that \n     amounted to the fattest quarterly take for a publicly traded \n     U.S. company ever: $8.4 billion. That translated into $3.8 \n     million an hour.'' As oil companies squeeze every penny they \n     can from consumers' pocketbooks, they continue to import high \n     priced crude oil from the Middle East and elsewhere, engage \n     in mergers that further reduce already constrained \n     competition, and avoid, wherever possible, blending their \n     gasoline with alternative fuels like ethanol.\n       In the past, some consumers have expressed skepticism of \n     economic benefits derived from blending ethanol into \n     gasoline. But in the face of rising gasoline prices that \n     skepticism is beginning to wane. For example, Senator Chuck \n     Schumer (D-NY), once a critic of ethanol, now points to the \n     benefits of building local production capacity in New York to \n     create jobs and markets for farmers and lower gasoline prices \n     for consumers.\n       Contributing to the changing attitude toward ethanol is the \n     fact that prices for ethanol have declined while pump prices \n     for gasoline now exceed $2.20 per gallon in many parts of the \n     country. As Business Week recently reported, ``. . . since \n     the start of the year, the wholesale price of ethanol has \n     fallen more than 20 percent, to around $1.20 a gallon, while \n     black gold is soaring to record highs.'' Given the sharp \n     decline in ethanol prices, one would expect major oil \n     companies to increase their purchases of ethanol beyond what \n     is required by the Clean Air Act. However, contrary to \n     rational economic expectations, oil companies are not \n     expanding their purchases of lower-priced ethanol, but are \n     continuing to purchase expensive crude oil and raising \n     gasoline prices to consumers. Frustrated, some ethanol \n     producers are beginning to export their product. This creates \n     a situation of lower-priced ethanol leaving the country while \n     higher-priced oil enters it--hardly an indication of rational \n     economic behavior.\n       Changing consumer perceptions about the benefits of ethanol \n     are reinforced by several recent developments:\n       Rising gasoline prices amidst declining ethanol prices.\n       At a time when the price of gasoline all over the country \n     is increasing, the price of ethanol has been declining in \n     part because of increased production, but in part because oil \n     companies are refusing to purchase the available supplies to \n     blend with their gasoline.\n       Major oil companies cost consumers as much as 8 cents a \n     gallon by boycotting lower-cost ethanol.\n       With today's price differential between the wholesale price \n     of ethanol and the average wholesale price of gasoline, \n     consumers who purchase gasoline blended with 10 percent \n     ethanol could be saving as much as 8 cents a gallon if oil \n     companies purchased ethanol instead of importing more \n     expensive foreign oil.\n       Terminal and other infrastructure exists to handle \n     additional ethanol supplies in markets across the country.\n       Companies have built capacity--terminals, storage tanks, \n     blending equipment--to use ethanol. But even though this \n     capacity exists, oil companies have chosen to purchase more \n     expensive petroleum instead of ethanol.\n\n\n    Gasoline Price Increases, Consumer Costs and Oil Company Profits\n\n       According to the most recent data published by the Energy \n     Information Administration, the average US price for a gallon \n     of regular unleaded gasoline was $2.24 as of April 25, 2005. \n     This price is 42 cents a gallon higher than the year before, \n     a jump of 23 percent. Since December 2004, the average price \n     has climbed 40 cents a gallon. While some of this price \n     increase is due to the higher cost of crude oil, some of it \n     is directly related to continuing efforts by the major oil \n     companies to keep their inventories as tight as possible.\n       Decisions about refinery capacity and stockpiling of \n     product are business decisions. Figure 1 below demonstrates \n     that oil refiners have limited gasoline inventories to less \n     than 3 or fewer days of supply above the minimum operating \n     reserves necessary to keep the system functioning since the \n     consolidation of the industry. There is simply no slack in \n     the system and this keeps markets tight. The closure of fifty \n     refineries and the failure to build new ones in the past \n     decade and a half reinforce this strategy.\n       Oil company refinery and inventory management has not only \n     kept inventories low and prices high, but also resulted in \n     record high monopoly profits (see Table 1). The 13 oil \n     companies that account for over 84 percent of U.S. refinery \n     runs in 2004 increased their income on U.S. refining and \n     marketing operations in 2004 by more than 130 percent over \n     2003--from $6.6 billion to $15.3 billion. In other words, as \n     oil companies charged consumers an average of nearly 29 cents \n     a gallon more in 2004 than in 2003 for their gasoline, major \n     oil companies were reaping windfall profits. For the average \n     consumer, an increase of 29 cents a gallon means an extra \n     $160 per year in the cost of driving the average car.\n       When assessing oil company profitability in the refining \n     and marketing segment, it is important to recognize that \n     ``Domestic refining and marketing has become a more prominent \n     contributor to net income over the past 4 years but has also \n     demonstrated how volatile this segment of the industry can \n     be. In 2000, 2001, and 2003, domestic refining and marketing \n     had 3 of the 4 best years in terms of net income in the \n     history of the FRS survey . . .'' And 2004 was significantly \n     better than 2001, the industry's previous best year.\n\n               TABLE 1.--INCOME FROM DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          Refining/Marketing Income\n              Company              -------------------------------------\n                                           2003               2004\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExxonMobil........................           $1,348.0           $2,186.0\nShell.............................              379.0            1,686.0\nChevronTexaco.....................              482.0            1,261.0\nBP................................              748.0            2,478.0\nConocoPhillips....................            1,272.0            2,743.0\nValero............................              621.5            1,803.8\nMarathon..........................              819.0            1,406.0\nAmerada Hess......................              643.0              977.0\nMurphy............................              -21.2               53.4\nCITGO.............................              439.0              625.0\nSunoco............................              352.0              609.0\nPremcor...........................              116.6              477.9\nTesoro............................               76.1              327.9\nTotal.............................              6,730            15,219\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Company Annual Reports.\n\n       The first quarter of 2005, with dramatically rising crude \n     oil prices presents a stunning example of how domestic oil \n     companies exercise market power over price to abuse \n     consumers. If rising raw material (crude oil) costs were the \n     problem then we would expect the domestic spread to decline \n     as competition and consumer resistance (the elasticity of \n     demand) squeezed the margin between the cost of inputs and \n     the retail price. The opposite has happened because the \n     industry is not competitive. Only in 2002, when demand was \n     very weak due to the recession following September 11, did \n     margins return to their historic levels. The winter of 2002 \n     also taught the industry a lesson, that competition on price \n     lowers profits.\n       The rising domestic spread numbers translate immediately \n     into rising profits in the domestic refining and marketing \n     industry (see Table 2). For the ten largest companies that \n     refine crude oil in the U.S. profits increased by almost 60 \n     percent in the first quarter of 2005 compared to the first \n     quarter of 2004. This was a larger increase in profits than \n     domestic exploration and production (16 percent) and total \n     oil company operations (39 percent). There is no doubt that \n     crude oil price increases contributed to the increase in the \n     price at the pump, but so too did increasing margins and \n     profits for domestic refining and marketing.\n\n                                         TABLE 2.--OIL INDUSTRY PROFITS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Refining/Marketing U.S. Only            Global Total\n                     Company                     ---------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      1q 2004         1q 2005         1q 2004         1q 2005\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEXXONMOBIL......................................            $392            $645          $5,440          $7,860\n\n[[Page S6605]]\n\n \nSHELL...........................................             215             405           4,702           6,673\nBP..............................................             827           1,429           4,912           6,602\nCONOCOPHILLIPS..................................             403             570           1,616           2,912\nCHEVRONTEXACO...................................             276              58           2,562           2,677\nVALERO..........................................             273             622             248             534\nMARATHON........................................              49             210             258             324\nAMERADA HESS....................................             137             102             281             219\nMURPHY..........................................             -11              -8              98             113\nPREMCOR.........................................              53             129              53             129\n      TOTAL.....................................           2,614           4,162          20,170         28,043\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Company 1q2005 Reports.\n\n       In contrast to gasoline prices, which have risen as a \n     result of rising input prices and the exercise of market \n     power by domestic refiners, ethanol prices have not risen \n     because the cost of the raw materials has not risen and the \n     producers of ethanol do not have market power.\n       So why don't oil companies use more ethanol to keep price \n     increases down? The answer is simple. The market is not \n     competitive enough to force them to worry about price \n     increases. They also do not own the ethanol. They prefer to \n     process more crude oil and make more money by keeping the \n     price up.\n\n\n           Gasoline Price Decreases Consumers Aren't Getting\n\n       While the oil marketplace has become much less competitive \n     over the past ten years because of huge mergers between the \n     largest companies, one would still expect that the \n     availability of lower cost gasoline components would attract \n     buyers.\n       In sharp contrast to the oil industry, the ethanol industry \n     has become more competitive. According to a recent study \n     ``ethanol production was the only agricultural sector in \n     which concentration has steadily decreased. A decade ago, the \n     top four companies owned 73 percent of the ethanol market. \n     Today the top four companies control 41 percent of the \n     ethanol produced.\n       But, when it comes to ethanol, oil companies have failed to \n     respond. Over the last several months, ethanol prices have \n     fallen by between 40 cents and 50 cents a gallon in different \n     parts of the country, yet there is little, if any, evidence \n     that refiners have taken advantage of the opportunity to \n     purchase any supplies other than those required to meet the \n     requirements of the Clean Air Act. According to Bernie Punt, \n     general manager of an ethanol plant in Sioux Center, Iowa, \n     ``Unless most of these oil companies are told by the \n     government they have to use it, they won't.''\n       Table 3 below shows price changes for spot or wholesale \n     prices for ethanol and regular reformulated gasoline sold in \n     three major U.S. markets between November 2004 and March \n     2005. In all three markets, the spot price of ethanol fell \n     between 41 cents and 50 cents a gallon while the spot price \n     of gasoline rose between 13 cents and 30 cents a gallon.\n       Ethanol production has been climbing steadily as new \n     producers continue to add capacity that is expected to reach \n     4 billion gallons this year. On a monthly basis, production \n     of ethanol reached an all-time high of 245,000 barrels per \n     day in February.\n\n                                      TABLE 3.--ETHANOL AND GASOLINE PRICES\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                             Market                                    Nov.

In California, New York and Connecticut--states \n     which have phased out the use of MTBE--ethanol must be \n     blended with gasoline to meet Clean Air Act requirements for \n     oxygenated fuel. In New York and Connecticut, 10 percent \n     ethanol is blended with 90 percent gasoline while in \n     California, 5.7 percent ethanol is blended with 94.3 percent \n     gasoline.\n\n\n  gasoline price reductions to consumers with increased use of ethanol\n\n       The best example of how consumers could realize lower \n     gasoline prices is using sales of petroleum products and \n     ethanol in New York harbor (see Table 4). Gasoline and \n     ethanol shipped into New York harbor serve markets in New \n     Jersey where refiners still use MTBE and New York and \n     Connecticut where refiners blend ethanol. Assuming that \n     refiners and gasoline marketers in New York harbor took \n     advantage of lower-priced ethanol during March, they could \n     have lowered consumer gasoline prices by 5 cents a gallon in \n     New Jersey compared to RFG using MTBE and by 7 cents a gallon \n     compared to conventional gasoline used outside of the \n     metropolitan areas required use of RFG.\n\n                                            TABLE 4.--PRICES FOR REFORMULATED GASOLINE--NEW YORK SPOT PRICES\n                                                                     [$ per gallon]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                      NY RFG-MTBE                          NY RFG-ETH         Diff.

If, instead of just \n     blending 5.7 percent ethanol, California refiners chose to \n     blend 10 percent ethanol as they do in New York, Chicago and \n     Connecticut, California motorists could save as much as 8 \n     cents a gallon.\n       These potential cost savings to consumers represent only \n     the arithmetic result of blending more lower cost ethanol \n     with higher cost gasoline. The increase in available supplies \n     could have an additional effect in lowering prices and \n     reducing volatility.\n       Oil companies have the capacity to use more ethanol to \n     lower consumer gasoline prices.\n       In numerous markets across the country, oil companies have \n     put in place all the necessary equipment to blend ethanol. In \n     Atlanta, for example, where oil companies had prepared to \n     supply ethanol blends starting January 1, 2005, Chevron with \n     a market share of 14 percent stated it ``invested over \n     $2,000,000'' to its Atlanta area gasoline supply terminal. \n     In northern New Jersey, oil companies that supply \n     metropolitan New York (including southern Connecticut) \n     have had capacity to blend ethanol in place since January \n     1, 2004. Instead of supplying more expensive reformulated \n     gasoline (RFG) with MTBE, these companies could choose to \n     blend with less expensive ethanol to supply outlets in \n     northern New Jersey. And in most Midwestern states--Iowa, \n     Nebraska, Illinois, Missouri, and others--where ethanol is \n     blended in mid-grade (89 octane) gasoline, there is \n     nothing to prevent oil companies from blending ethanol in \n     regular (87) and premium (91) grades of gasoline.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       The consumer implications of the refusal to use more \n     ethanol are clear. While gasoline refiners are using as much \n     ethanol as required, the same refiners are not buying lower-\n     cost ethanol in other gasoline markets. Thus, consumers in \n     many parts of the country where ethanol can be delivered to \n     existing storage and terminal facilities are not receiving \n     lower cost supplies and are paying as much as 8 cents a \n     gallon more at the pump than they would if oil refiners \n     purchased ethanol to blend.\n       The broader public policy implications should not be \n     overlooked because the added abuse of consumers frustrates \n     the nation's ability to address the fundamental energy \n     problem. The failure of the oil industry to increase the use \n     of ethanol undercuts the claim that they need to drill in \n     Alaska to solve the problem for two reasons. First, we could \n     increase the production of ethanol much faster and provide a \n     lot more output to displace imported oil than new finds in \n     Alaska could ever produce. Second, the same companies that \n     dominate the gasoline business would control the flow of oil \n     from Alaska, so there is not guarantee that it would have a \n     substantial impact on prices, even if the amount of oil found \n     was significant.\n       When the American people are asked about the current \n     gasoline situation, they blame oil companies and the Bush \n     administration. This analysis suggests that they are correct \n     in that assessment. The Bush Administration defends the oil \n     companies, whose increased profits and strategic business \n     actions have played a big part in the recent price increases, \n     keeps asking the American people to make hard sacrifices to \n     deal with the problem in the long term, while the oil \n     companies get off easy and policy makers fail to implement \n     the simple and obvious policies\n\n[[Page S6606]]\n\n     that would help consumers in the short and long term.\n       The New York Times took the administration to task because \n     President Bush:\n\n     ``. . . completely ignored the surest way to reduce demand \n     and thus oil dependency, which is to improve the fuel \n     efficiency of America's cars and trucks. Indeed, everything \n     Mr. Bush said seemed designed to divert attention from this \n     simple and technologically feasible idea . . . Then, too, he \n     could not resist the deceptions that make debating energy in \n     Washington such a frustrating matter. These include . . . \n     drilling in the Arctic Natural Wildlife Refuge.''\n       Pointing out that the ``House bill is dreadful,'' the Times \n     concluded that this ``leaves the job of fashioning a coherent \n     strategy in the Senate's hands.'' Among the ideas with merit \n     that the Times noted for addressing the gasoline problem, in \n     addition to ``stricter fuel economy standards,'' is creating \n     ``biofuels'' from agricultural waste. The irony is that we \n     already have a ``biofuels'' industry that is not being fully \n     utilized.\n       Until policymakers start advocating sensible and simple \n     policies in the short and long term, American consumers are \n     right to resist the bad policies that are being foisted on \n     them.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. The recent decline in ethanol prices, coupled \nwith surging pump prices for gasoline, have created a market dynamic in \nwhich increased ethanol use could help curtail record high gas prices. \nConsumers in many parts of the country where ethanol can be delivered \nto existing storage and terminal facilities are not receiving lower \ncost supplies and are paying as much as 8 cents a gallon more at the \npump than they would if oil refiners purchased ethanol to blend. \nBlending high-priced gasoline with more modestly priced ethanol results \nin a more affordable final product. By using ethanol, oil refiners have \nan opportunity to pass along real savings to consumers during this \nperiod of high gasoline prices.\n  The Consumer Federation of America cites several reasons for the \ndramatic increase in gasoline prices, including tight crude oil \ninventories, inadequate oil refinery capacity, lack of competition, and \nthe oil industry's increasing market power. In contrast to gasoline \nprices, ethanol prices have actually fallen during the past 6 months.\n  As an example, the price of ethanol on the Chicago spot market hit \n$1.82 per gallon in November 2004 but averaged about $1.18 per gallon \nlast month. At these prices, why don't oil companies blend more ethanol \nto lower consumer prices? We have an opportunity to see that consumers \nbenefit from cleaner burning, affordable, and domestically produced \nfuel.\n  Finally, a win for the environment: For environmental and health \nconcerns, the Nation decided to clean up the fuels which have powered \nAmerica for nearly a century. The Clean Air Act identified numerous \nareas of the country which must reduce or eliminate their pollution \nlevels. Those areas have been meeting the challenges of the Clean Air \nAct through changing the gasoline and diesel fuels used, either year-\nround or seasonally. Studies show ethanol reduces emissions of carbon \nmonoxide and hydrocarbons by 20 percent, and particulates by 40 percent \nin 1990 and newer vehicles. In 2001 alone, ethanol reportedly reduced \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 3.6 million tons or the equivalent of \nremoving more than 520,000 vehicles from the road.\n  Now and through the next several years, cleaner and cleaner fuels \nsuch as ethanol, natural gas, propane, and biodiesel will be used in \ncars, trucks, and buses. Today's key issue is to determine which \nalternatives will extend or replace gasoline and diesel fuel to reduce \npollution.\n  We need to be working hard to craft a comprehensive rural development \nplan that will spur investment in agribusiness and promote economic \nactivity in the agricultural sector. This Energy bill, and the \nrenewable fuels standard contained within, is an important part of such \na rural development plan and is key to reversing the realities of \noutmigration in the rural areas.\n  If passed, this fuels language will establish a 4.0-billion-gallon \nrenewable fuels standard in 2006, growing every year until it reaches 8 \nbillion gallons by 2012. This is a responsible approach to meeting the \ndemands of an ever-increasing demand for fuel sources. Additional \nbenefits to this legislation include the displacement of foreign \nsupplies of crude oil, reduction in the U.S. trade deficit, and the \ncreation of tens of thousands of jobs throughout the United States.\n  It is quite apparent that increased use of ethanol will do much to \nboost a struggling U.S. agricultural economy and at the same time will \nhelp establish a more sound national energy policy.\n  A choice for renewable fuels is a choice for America, its energy \nconsumers, its farmers, and its environment. It will help us to reverse \nour 100-year-old reliance on fossil fuels, a more pressing concern than \never given the unrest in the Middle East and increased competition for \nenergy from growing economies throughout the world.\n  If each State were to produce 10 percent of its own domestic \nrenewable fuel as Nebraska does, America will have turned the corner \naway from dependence on foreign sources of energy. When you take a hard \nlook at the facts, you will see that this legislation is nothing but \nbeneficial for America.\n  The Fuels Security Act is balanced, comprehensive, and is the result \nof the dedication of so many, especially Senator Lugar and Senator \nHarkin.\n  Now I ask my colleagues to join me in promoting new opportunities for \nthe technologies that will put our Nation and our world's \ntransportation fuels on solid, sustainable, environmentally enhancing \nground. We owe it to our country now and to future generations to pass \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am delighted that we are now into the \ndebate and soon the passage of our energy bill. This is a bill we have \nworked on for several years. It is a bill that is an energy policy for \nthis country. It looks ahead through the years and tries to get an idea \nof what our needs are going to be and how we fill those needs. It is \nsomething we really need.\n  Certainly, everyone recognizes increasingly the profound effect it \nhas on our lives. Look outside at the thousands of cars. All of them \nare running on gasoline, of course. Look at electricity. We take it for \ngranted. We turn the lights on, and we do not think of where it comes \nfrom or how it got there. Air-conditioning is the same. We have noticed \nthat a lot the last few days. Think of what it would be like if we did \nnot have air-conditioning. We would probably be on recess, and I would \ngo back to Wyoming.\n  All of our technology now is tied to computers. We do not think much \nabout it. This is an opportunity for us to give some analysis to how we \nprovide this and, of course, costs. We do pay some attention to the \ncosts.\n  We have talked about this for years, and we have had bills on the \nSenate floor. In the last session, we had bills passed in the Senate \nand in the House. We went to a conference in which they were put \ntogether. We came back to the Senate floor, and over a couple of \nsmaller or singular items, we lost. So we have not had a comprehensive \nenergy bill.\n  We rely increasingly on foreign resources, some 60 percent or so on \nforeign oil. Unfortunately, that is continuing to grow. At the same \ntime it grows for us, the demand grows in other countries. Even though \nthere is some increased production, we see a smaller amount coming, and \nwe see the prices continue to go up.\n  We have greater demand. One of the things that has to be in a policy \nis a decision about efficient use and conservation so that not only do \nwe talk about supply but we talk about how we can more efficiently use \nthe resources we do have.\n  We think quite a bit about renewables. We think, Oh, my gosh, we do \nnot need to use oil all the time, there must be a lot of other things. \nIndeed, there are. The fact is that they are in the future. They are \nyet in need of a great deal of research, and right now, if we take out \nhydro, which is a renewable, about 3 percent of our power is provided \nby renewable energy resources. I am optimistic that over time that can \ncertainly be larger, but right now it is a very small part of the \noverall mix.\n  We have natural gas prices which have reenergized the effort, and we\n\n[[Page S6607]]\n\nshould pay attention to clean coal. Over the years, it has been easier, \nfrankly, and somewhat less expensive to build generating plants that \nare fueled by gas, and so that is what has happened. We have smaller \nplants closer to the market, so we do not have to worry about the \ntransmission as much, when the fact is that our greatest fossil \nresource for the future is coal. Coal is the largest generator of \nelectricity, but we can use gas for many more things than we can coal.\n\n  With coal there are some challenges. One challenge is to be able to \ngenerate electricity and still take care of the clean air and \nenvironmental problems that go with that. So we want to emphasize that \nneed for making clean coal technologies. Hydrogen is an energy that can \ncome from coal as well. In fact, there are plants now being planned \nthat will make synthetic diesel out of coal. So, again, that is an \nalternative source from where we are now.\n  We have some alternatives. We are importing a good deal of liquefied \nnatural gas, which is also more expensive and has created, some \ncontroversy about the necessary facilities to have dockings for those \nkinds of things. All of these are very difficult issues.\n  I have been on the committee a good long time and have enjoyed it \nvery much and certainly appreciate the leadership we are getting from \nour chairman and also our Democrat ranking member to work toward these \nthings, but I hope that we do look out long term. We are not going to \nsolve these problems next week or next month. We have to look out a \nlittle ways and say, all right, what are our needs, how are we going to \nmeet those needs, and what do we have to do in the long term to get \nthere. I hope this is a roadmap for the future. That is what it has \nbeen.\n  For over 4 years now, the President and the Vice President have been \nworking. My colleagues will recall they had an energy task force which \nbecame a little controversial for unknown reasons, really, but that was \none of the first items this administration talked about, and properly \nso. One of the controversies was that both of these gentlemen had been \nin the energy business, but all that did was give them more knowledge \nabout it.\n  Since that time, we have experienced higher prices and low prices, \nand now we are back to higher prices. We have experienced blackouts, \nwhich, of course, are a possibility at any time.\n  There are some things we can do in terms of generation. There have \nbeen no electric generation plants built in a number of years, and we \nare right up to capacity, and the same way with refineries. In fact, \nsome say we can get more oil shipped in from other places and refined \nhere, but we do not have the refining capacity. So those are some of \nthe things we need to talk about.\n  I emphasize again to my colleagues that we need a balanced program. I \nknow we all get involved in different aspects of it as it impacts our \ncommunities and our States, but the fact is, when it is all over, we \nneed to deal with alternatives, we need to deal with efficiency, we \nneed to deal with conservation, we need to deal with domestic \nproduction, and we need to deal with research for alternatives and \nrenewables. All of those things have to go together.\n  Then we get into the electric business. We have to talk about \ntransmission and about a lot of things. It is not an easy subject. When \na subject is brought to the Senate floor that has that many aspects, \nmany of which affect States and communities differently--for instance, \noffshore drilling. Well, in Wyoming, we are not too interested in \noffshore drilling as it affects us. We are interested in it in that it \nis the largest resource we have for the future. So we have to deal with \ndifferent facts in different places. We have a chance now to pass a \nbalanced and comprehensive bill.\n  I am, obviously, very interested in this issue, partly because I am \non the committee but more importantly because it is very important for \nour country. I come from a State that has incredible natural resources. \nThey mean very much to us economically, but more than anything we are a \nresource for the whole country. We have probably more coal than any \nother State. We have low sulfur coal. We have coal that burns \nrelatively cleaner than most. We need to continue to make it even more \nso. We have oil.\n  Some of the earliest oilfields in the West were in Wyoming, and they \ncontinue to produce. We are finding new ways to try to recapture oil \nthat we have not been able to bring out of the Earth. We can do that. \nWe have had a whole new growth of natural gas called methane gas. It is \nengulfed in water under the ground in the relatively shallow wells. We \nhave uranium. We had uranium mines active a number of years ago, and \nthen we kind of got away from nuclear powerplants. Now there is a new \nopportunity to go back into that area and some real advantages to that, \nparticularly in terms of clean air and climate control.\n  Nuclear powerplants, we kind of think, well, that is a funny thing. \nWe do not know much about them. I think 40 percent of the energy in \nIllinois is produced now with nuclear plants. We are concerned about \nthe waste areas, such as the Yucca Mountain issue out in Nevada. The \nfact is, however, that there are opportunities to do things better \nthere. We can look again at France. France uses almost all nuclear \npower. They have a system of recycling uranium so they do not have the \nwaste the way we do. So there are opportunities to do that.\n\n  We also have quite a bit of wind, and so we can capture wind energy \nas well.\n  These are the kinds of things we must do. We must modernize \nconservation such as with cars--and we are doing that, but it takes a \nwhile--so we get better mileage. We are finding household equipment \nthat better utilizes energy and electricity. We have to modernize our \ninfrastructure. This is a tough one, too.\n  One of the issues most of us like to talk about is mine-mouth \ngeneration for coal-powered electricity but yet generated at the mine. \nOne has to get it to the marketplace, and that takes very efficient \ntransmission, more transmission than we have now.\n  So these are some of the things we need to do. At the same time we \nwork with more production and different kinds of production with \nresearch, we need to protect the environment. We have issues in the \nWest. Half of our State, nearly 85 percent of Nevada is Federal lands. \nSo we have to have a program that allows for multiple use of public \nlands so that we can continue to use them for grazing, fishing, and \nwildlife, and at the same time in careful ways we can have production \nof energy as well.\n  This bill sets some direction in terms of research and incentives. We \nare beginning to do what we have not done before that may not be as \nefficient initially economically, but if we can provide some tax \ncredits, we can provide some sort of assistance, then it will become \nefficient, and then we can back out of that. The way businesses are \ninitiated into new things is to provide some incentive. These are all \nthings most of us would agree to, and the opportunity to pass them is \nnow.\n  The House has passed their energy bill, and when we pass ours, we \nwill go to the conference committee and work out some differences. \nThere are some differences, and there will be differences here. There \nare different ideas about what we do on world climate activities, \nKyoto. I have been to several of the Kyoto meetings, and over the whole \nworld there are different ideas. I seek to remind folks when I go there \nthat we are not putting on some of the regulations that some countries \nare. We want our economy to continue, and at the same time we are \nspending more in research for clean air and on the global situation \nthan the whole rest of the world put together. What really is important \nis to find new ways to be able to maintain the economy, manufacturing \nand production, and do it in such a way that it does protect the \neconomy.\n  National security, of course, is obviously a real part of this. As we \nbecome more dependent on foreign countries' resources, there is some \nquestion about our security. We are getting 62 percent of our oil from \noutside of the United States. Fortunately, much of that comes from \nCanada, so that is a little less concerning. But we are at the hands of \nVenezuela and lots of other places if we are not able to be a little \nmore dependent on ourselves. Energy independence depends on the things \nI have talked about: conservation, efficiency, and new sources of \nenergy.\n\n[[Page S6608]]\n\n  The global energy demand is changing as well. Certain places, such as \nChina, are using a great deal more energy than they did just a few \nyears ago. So the demand for coal has changed where they are importing \nthe kinds of things they were not importing before. India, the whole \nAsian picture is changing.\n  So these are some of the things that I believe we need to take a look \nat. We need to be realistic about it. Sometimes we get in sort of a \nfantasy that we can do all of this with renewables and we do not need \nto worry about oil and coal. Frankly, at least for the foreseeable \nfuture, that is not the case. We are getting about 3 percent of our \nenergy from renewables at this point.\n  We will get more. But, nevertheless, we have to also continue to \nimprove and make sure we have those kinds of sources of energy that we \nnow can depend on.\n  I am particularly involved and interested in the electricity portion \nof it. We need to encourage investment in generation as the demand \nincreases--and it does, constantly. Look around our cities. Even in our \nrural areas, there is an increasing demand. Everything we do demands \nmore energy. We need to generate the energy.\n  It becomes difficult, of course, particularly on private lands and \nsome Federal lands, to get efficient transmission. We think there are \nsome possibilities of getting more efficient so the same transmission \nlines can carry a great deal more of a load than they have in the past.\n  When we get into multiple kinds of ownership, we get controversy \nabout how you have access to the lines and all those things, but we can \nwork those out. That is partly what we are doing.\n  I again congratulate the leadership on this committee for getting us \nwhere we are. I am committed to doing whatever I can to get it through \nbecause I think it is so important. I believe we have a good bill, a \ncomprehensive bill, a bill that deals with all the aspects of the \nfuture. It helps create jobs and maintain the economy--which is, of \ncourse, one of the key things--and to keep this country self-reliant \nand not dependent on the rest of the world.\n  I hope we can move forward to deal with the issues, to talk about \nthem. It is all right to have different views. But I hope we don't get \ninto objecting and holding up things just because we have a point of \nview.\n  Offshore drilling, already there is some debate about it. We are \nwilling to give the States a lot of their own decisionmaking with \nregard to offshore. We are not going to tell them what to do.\n  We can make this work. I hope we can move forward and get this job \ndone. Let's get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me say, before the distinguished Senator leaves the \nfloor, how much I appreciate his comments today and his analysis of \nthis bill. But more than that, around the Senate there are some \npeople--I guess, in the parlance of the racetrack, some are show horses \nand some are work horses. This Senator is a work horse. He has been on \nthis committee for a few years--not as long as this Senator, but that \nis just because I have been here so long. Hardly anybody has been here \nlonger than this Senator. But he works all the time on this. He knows a \nlot about this bill. He has some specialties in this area to which he \nhas contributed immensely.\n  Some things on this bill he is right on. He is more correct than the \nbill. He didn't get to do what he wanted on some of them, but he \nunderstands that we have a good bill.\n  It is hard work. He was there all the time, helping us, doing his \nshare, pulling his part of the load, helping us get this bill through.\n  I want those who are aware of him and know of him to understand that \nis what the Senator from New Mexico thinks about that. I want the \nrecord to reflect that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Modifications to Amendment No. 779\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send modifications to the pending \namendment to the desk.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from New Mexico.\n  During the debate on this energy bill, we have already heard and will \ncontinue to hear about the importance of strengthening the energy \nindependence of America. The phrase ``energy independence,'' however, \nmust be heard no longer as a routine utterance. It must be heard as an \nurgent warning of the most serious magnitude.\n  The sirens are sounding, and I fear that we are not listening.\n  The days of running a 21st century economy on a 20th century fossil \nfuel are numbered--and we need to realize that before it is too late. \nThe price of gas is now around $2.24 per gallon. Crude oil is now \nsoaring over $50 a barrel. The Saudis are pumping at near-full \ncapacity, and their own oil minister says that the price of crude will \nprobably stay at this price for the rest of the year. And Goldman Sachs \npredicts that soon it may reach $100 a barrel.\n  Imagine what that would do the price of gas--$100 for one barrel of \noil.\n  Our own Department of Energy predicts that American demand will jump \nby 50 percent over the next 15 years. And as developing countries like \nChina and India continue to grow, the world will be faced with more \ndrivers than it knows what to do with. Right now, there are 800 million \ncars on the road. By 2050, that number will grow to 3.25 billion.\n  Think about that 3.25 billion cars guzzling oil that is becoming more \nlimited and more expensive with each passing day. We could open up \nevery corner of the United States for drilling and tell the oil \ncompanies to go to town, but with only 3 percent of the world's oil \nsupplies, it wouldn't even make a dent in the problem.\n  Of course, most of the rest of the world's oil lies in the Middle \nEast, a region we have seen torn by war and terror. Every year, we send \n$25 billion to these countries to buy oil. It doesn't matter if they \nare budding democracies, despotic regimes with nuclear intentions, or \nhavens for the madrasas that plant the seeds of terror in young minds \nthey get our money because we need their oil.\n  What is worse--this oil isn't even well-protected. Over the last few \nyears, terrorists have stepped up their attempts to attack poorly \ndefended oil tankers and pipelines. And a former CIA agent tells us \nthat if a terrorist hijacked a plane in Kuwait and crashed it into an \noil complex in Saudi Arabia, it could take enough oil off the market \nand cause more economic damage in the United States than if a dirty \nnuclear weapon exploded in downtown Manhattan.\n  Recently, I came across a quote from Henry Ford, the carmaker, who \nsaid these prophetic words in 1916:\n\n       All the world is waiting for a substitute to gasoline. When \n     that is gone, there will be no more gasoline, and long before \n     that time, the price of gasoline will have risen to a point \n     where it will be too expensive to burn as a motor fuel.\n\n  Mr. Ford was right--he was just ahead of his time. His words were \nspoken before the shocks to our economy caused by the oil crisis of the \n1970s, before the world's oil fields became areas of turmoil and \nterrorism, before growing nations like China and India joined us at the \ntrough of massive petroleum consumption.\n  We need a 21st century energy policy. Whether this bill accomplishes \nthat remains to be seen. But it is clear that part of the solution must \nbe greater use of renewable fuels instead of continued reliance on \nforeign oil. That is why I am astonished that there is any effort in \nthis Chamber to eviscerate a renewable fuels standard that can and \nwill--further America's energy independence while also strengthening \nour economy.\n  The Nation's ethanol production is expected to exceed 4 billion \ngallons this year. In the coming years, ethanol production is expected \nto be so robust that as much as 8 billion gallons of renewable fuels \ncould be in our fuel supply by 2012.\n  Right now, outside Washington, in cities and towns, on farms and in \nfactories across America, there is hope for us to do so much more than \nwe have been doing on energy. Whether it is farming the corn in \nGalesburg that can fuel our cars or fine-tuning the microchip in \nChicago that let's us plug them in, people are taking America's energy \nfuture into their own hands with the same sense of innovation and \noptimism that has always kept our country on the forefront of discovery \nand exploration.\n  They deserve a government that can see that future too.\n  The American people are asking us to address high gas prices. The \nAmerican people are asking us for greater national security. The \nAmerican people are asking us to invest in job creation. The renewable \nfuels standard in the Domenici amendment proposes to do just that in 7 \nyears, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  Instead of continuing to link our energy policy to foreign fields of \noil, it should be linked to farm fields of corn. I urge my colleagues \nto support the Domenici amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose Senator \nDomenici's amendment to require that U.S. refiners blend 8 billion \ngallons of ethanol into gasoline each year by 2012.\n  I think this is a mistake that will cost the Federal treasury $2 \nbillion by the time it is fully implemented and could further pollute \nCalifornia's air.\n  In my home State, the mandate will mean that refiners must choose \nbetween blending ethanol into gasoline or using a costly credit/trading \nsystem.\n  Either choice will mean California consumers pay more at the pump.\n  Accordiing to the California Air Resources Board, California would be \nable to mitigate the air quality impacts of a mandate if it were \nlimited to 6 billion gallons or less.\n  With a 6 billion gallon mandate, refiners in California would be \nrequired to use about 660 million gallons of ethanol, which they could \naccomplish in the cooler winter months alone.\n  However, at 8 billion gallons, the State's refiners would be forced \nto use about 880 million gallons of ethanol and they would either have \nto use ethanol in the hot summer months, when it could pollute the air, \nor buy costly ``credits'' for not using ethanol.\n  While we do not know exactly how the credit trading system will work, \nit\n\n[[Page S6610]]\n\nis estimated that the credits would cost about 40 cents per gallon of \nethanol.\n  So if California refiners were not able to use about 220 million \ngallons of ethanol per year, it could cost $88 million annually to buy \nthe credits--money that would inevitably be passed on to drivers.\n  I do want to thank Chairman Domenici for including two provisions in \nthe amendment that could help my State: repealing the 2 percent \noxygenate standard; and maintaining the summertime waiver for \nCalifornia.\n  The Federal 2 percent oxygenate standard has forced areas with poor \nair quality, including the entire State of California, to use either \nMTBE or ethanol in gasoline.\n  This Federal requirement has forced California's refiners to use an \noxygenate even though they can make cleaner-burning gasoline without \nMTBE or ethanol.\n  To meet this oxygenate requirement, California has been forced to use \nethanol since 2004 when the State officially banned MTBE, although many \nrefiners in the State started using ethanol as early as 2003.\n  Beginning in the Summer of 2003, ethanol was found to have had a \ndetrimental impact on the State's air quality. And on August 1, 2003 \nthe California Environmental Protection Agency informed me that:\n\n     . . . our current best estimate is that the increase in the \n     use of ethanol-blended gasoline has likely resulted in about \n     a one percent increase in emissions of volatile organic gases \n     (VOC) in the SCAQMD [South Coast Air Quality Management \n     District] in the summer of 2003. Given the very poor air \n     quality in the region and the great difficulty of reaching \n     the current federal ozone standard by the required attainment \n     date of 2010, an increase of this magnitude is of great \n     concern. Clearly, these emission increases have resulted in \n     higher ozone levels this year that what would have otherwise \n     occurred, and are responsible for at least some of the rise \n     in ozone levels that have been observed.\n\n  I will provide a copy of this letter for the record.\n  In September 2004, the California Air Resources Board sponsored a \nstudy by the Coordinating Research council entitled ``Fuel Permeation \nFrom Automotive Systems.''\n  The purpose of the study was to find out if three different fuels had \ndifferent chemical properties that made one evaporate more rapidly then \nthe others.\n  The fuels that were studied were MTBE-blended gasoline, ethanol-\nblended gasoline, and gasoline with no oxygenate.\n  The study found that emissions increased from all 10 of the gas tanks \nand engines that were studied when ethanol replaced the MTBE in \ngasoline.\n  In fact, the ethanol blended gasoline caused emissions to increase by \n65 percent when compared with MTBE blended gasoline, and by 45 percent \nwhen compared with non-oxygenated gasoline.\n  Here's why: ethanol-blended gasoline evaporate from the car's parts \nfaster and does so in a vapor form. Those vapors cause smog.\n  Ethanol's evaporative tendencies only get worse in hot climates. The \nAir Resources Board has since found that the use of ethanol on hot \nsummer days increases emissions of ozone forming compounds by about 75 \ntons per day above what they would be if we were allowed to use \nsummertime gasoline without ethanol.\n\n  This is important because ozone can cause respiratory difficulties in \nthe elderly and those with asthma.\n  There is a strong direct relationship between temperature and \nethanol--the hotter the day, the higher the emissions. On a 100 degree \nday, emissions are four times higher than on a 68 degree day. \nTherefore, the worst time to use ethanol is in the summer months.\n  Overall, the Air Resources Board believes that ozone levels in \nCalifornia are about 1 to 2 percent higher than they should be because \nof the oxygenate requirement.\n  This is a significant problem. Almost all of California's 37 million \nresidents already breathe unhealthy air. Current levels of ozone \npollution annually result in an estimated 630 premature deaths; 4,200 \nhospitalizations for respiratory diseases; and 3.7 million school \nabsences.\n  The Energy Committee approved my amendment to this bill to provide \nCalifornia with a waiver so that the State does not have to use ethanol \nin the summertime when ethanol-blended gasoline impacts air quality the \nmost.\n  I do appreciate the fact that Chairman Domenici has retained this \nwaiver in his amendment. However, I still believe the ethanol mandate \nis bad public policy, which increases the cost of gasoline for \nconsumers; does next to nothing to reduce oil consumption to increase \nenergy security; and, has severe impacts on the federal budget.\n  Last month, the Director of the Petroleum Division at the Energy \nInformation Administration stated before the House Government Reform \nCommittee that:\n\n       . . . refiners lost production capability when replacing \n     MTBE with ethanol. This, along with continued demand growth, \n     has contributed to price pressures. From 2000 through 2002, \n     California retail gasoline prices averaged about 19 cents per \n     gallon more than the U.S. average gasoline price, but in 2003 \n     as MTBE began to be removed, California prices averaged 27 \n     cents per gallon higher than the U.S. average, and remained \n     at that level through 2004.\n\n  So far this year, California's gasoline prices are at least 23 cents \nhigher than the U.S. average.\n  Much of this additional cost can be attributed to the cost of \ntransporting ethanol. Because ethanol cannot be transported through the \nexisting pipeline infrastructure and has to be trucked from the Midwest \nto the coasts, it adds another 10 cents to the retail cost of gasoline.\n  In other words, adding ethanol to our gasoline has increased the cost \nat the pump.\n  Moreover, the ethanol mandate does not improve energy security. The \nethanol mandate will only reduce U.S. oil consumption by one-half of \none percent when the 8 billion gallon mandate is fully implemented in \n2012.\n  In addition, since ethanol has a somewhat lower energy content, more \nfuel is required to travel the same distance.\n  This energy loss leads to an approximate 3 percent decrease in miles \nper gallon vehicle fuel economy with ethanol-blended gasoline.\n  And finally, I would like to point out how expensive this mandate is. \nEthanol receives a tax credit of 51 cents per gallon. If the mandate \nwere to increase to 8 billion gallons by 2012 from the 3.85 billion \ngallons of ethanol sold today, that would mean a net loss of an \nadditional $2 billion to the U.S. Treasury.\n  We should not be imposing a larger mandate for ethanol at a time when \nthe ethanol industry already receives such a huge subsidy, and when the \nNation has such huge budget deficits.\n  We need to either eliminate the mandate or end the subsidy. We can \nkeep one or the other but not both.\n  Yes, the provision to allow California not to use ethanol in the \nsummertime is a win for California's air quality. But the mandate, \nitself, could well be a loss for consumers and the Federal Treasury.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from which I quoted be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                          California Environmental\n\n\n                                            Protection Agency,\n\n                                   Sacramento, CA, August 1, 2003.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for your letter dated \n     July 15, 2003, in which you requested that the California \n     Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air \n     Resources Board (ARB/Board) investigate the impacts of \n     ethanol-blended gasoline and its potential contribution to \n     the recently degraded air quality in Southern California.\n       Like you, I am extremely concerned about the recent \n     increase in the number of exceedances of the federal ozone \n     standard and the high elevated peak ozone levels observed in \n     the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) this \n     summer. As you observe in your letter, the air quality in the \n     Los Angeles Basin has deteriorated this year, concurrent with \n     a dramatic increase in the use of ethanol-blended gasoline.\n       All of the causes of this year's increased ozone are not \n     yet known. In the two weeks since you wrote, the ARB has not \n     had sufficient time to fully determine the role that ethanol-\n     blended gasoline has played relative to other factors. We do \n     know that weather conditions have played a very important \n     role, and that increased use of ethanol-blended gasoline has \n     increased emissions over what they otherwise would have been. \n     That said, I also think it is fair to point out that\n\n[[Page S6611]]\n\n     the impact of ethanol-gasoline blends, while significant and \n     of great concern in California's ongoing efforts to reduce \n     ozone, is not large enough to explain the majority of air \n     quality deterioration that occurred in the SCAQMD this \n     summer.\n       Unfortunately, at this time we are not able to precisely \n     quantify the magnitude of the impact that higher emissions \n     associated with the increased use of ethanol-blend gasoline \n     has had relative to either weather or other factors affecting \n     this year's ozone pollution. However, I would like to convey \n     what we know today about the potential impact of ethanol use \n     on emissions of smog forming compounds in Southern \n     California.\n       As you know, as part of our efforts to obtain a waiver from \n     the two percent oxygen requirement that now applies to most \n     of the gasoline sold in California, the ARB has prepared \n     extensive analyses of the impact of ethanol-gasoline blends \n     on emissions and air quality. This information was submitted \n     to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) to \n     support our waiver request, and showed that emissions of \n     ozone and particulate matter precursors would be reduced in \n     California if U.S. EPA approved the waiver request. '\n       In addition to the information previously submitted, the \n     ARB has continued to conduct studies to further our \n     understanding of how ethanol-blended gasoline would affect \n     emissions in California. As is explained below, our current \n     best estimate is that the increase in the use of ethanol-\n     blended gasoline has likely resulted in about a one percent \n     increase in emissions of volatile organic gases (VOC) in the \n     SCAQMD in the summer of 2003. Given the very poor air quality \n     in the region and the great difficulty of reaching the \n     current federal ozone standard by the required attainment \n     date of 2010, an increase of this magnitude is of great \n     concern. Clearly, these emission increases have resulted in \n     higher ozone levels this year than what would have otherwise \n     occurred, and are responsible for at least some of the rise \n     in ozone levels that have been observed.\n       To elaborate on the ARB's analyses, there are several ways \n     that the use of ethanol in gasoline could potentially \n     increase VOC emissions. The most import factors are: \n     increased volatility of gasoline; the commingling of ethanol \n     and non-ethanol blends in vehicle tanks; and permeation of \n     ethanol through hoses and fuel system components.\n       Your letter mentions the potential for ethanol to increase \n     the volatility of gasoline. Increases in volatility lead to \n     increases in evaporative emissions from both the fuel \n     distribution system and from vehicles. This effect may result \n     in emission increases in other parts of the Nation where \n     volatility of ethanol-gasoline blends is not tightly \n     controlled. However, the California Phase 3 Reformulated \n     Gasoline regulations, which ban the use of Methyl Tertiary \n     Butyl Ether (MTBE) in California gasoline, anticipated this \n     effect and required all gasoline to meet the same volatility \n     standards whether ethanol was used or not. In addition, these \n     regulations actually slightly lowered the volatility limit \n     that most gasoline must meet. Therefore, we do not believe \n     that this factor is contributing to increased VOC emissions \n     in California.\n       Commingling emissions occur when consumers fill their fuel \n     tanks and mix ethanol and non-ethanol gasolines. The \n     California Phase 3 Reformulated Gasoline regulations were \n     designed to preserve the existing Phase 2 Reformulated \n     Gasoline vehicle emission benefits and to provide additional \n     emission reductions to offset potential commingling effects. \n     However, in 1999 when these rules were adopted, there was \n     limited information on the real-world effects of commingling, \n     and the ARB committed to further analyze this issue.\n       Board staff recently completed a study of the likely \n     emissions impacts of commingling in California. Based on this \n     study, we continue to believe that the California Phase 3 \n     Reformulated Gasoline regulations provide adequate \n     compensating reductions to offset the emission increases due \n     to commingling. The findings in the commingling study have \n     been submitted to the University of California for formal \n     peer review, and the review is expected to be completed \n     within the next month.\n       Increases in permeation emissions occur due to ethanol's \n     greater propensity (relative to most other components of \n     gasoline) to leak through the soft components of fuel lines \n     and through other parts of the fuel system. Because this \n     effect was not adequately quantified when the ARB adopted the \n     California Phase 3 Reformulated Gasoline regulation in 1999, \n     ARB staff was directed to investigate these impacts and to \n     return to the Board with recommendations on whether there is \n     a need to take further actions to address those impacts.\n       Preliminary results from this study are now available, and \n     strongly suggest that permeation impacts are both real and \n     significant. The ARB's analyses indicate that this effect \n     could increase ethanol evaporative hydrocarbon emissions by \n     between 10 and 15 tons per day in the SCAQMD at the current \n     level of ethanol use.\n       The information presented above is especially relevant in \n     light of the recent decision by the 9th Circuit Court that \n     overturns U.S. EPA's denial of California's oxygen content \n     waiver request, and requires U.S. EPA to reconsider this \n     issue. ARB believes that the information now available on the \n     impact of ethanol in gasoline on VOC emissions must be part \n     of U.S. EPA's reconsideration. We believe that the data on \n     commingling and permeation effects demonstrate that U.S. \n     EPA's denial of California's waiver request, which was based \n     on its conclusion that granting the waiver might lead to an \n     increase in overall VOC emissions due to commingling effects, \n     was in error. As part of our effort to gain a reversal of \n     this waiver denial, California is now preparing an \n     information package to submit this information to the U.S. \n     EPA.\n       I hope the information provided above is of value to you. \n     As in the past, I am sure that your office will be of great \n     assistance in assuring that California receives the needed \n     waiver, and I look forward to working with you on this \n     effort. Relative to understanding the factors that \n     contributed to higher ozone levels this summer, the ARB staff \n     will continue to work closely with SCAQMD staff to understand \n     the cause of the recent increases in ozone levels in southern \n     California. We will keep you informed of the results of this \n     effort. If you have any additional questions about this \n     important issue, please feel free to contact me, at (916) \n     323-2514, or Alan C. Lloyd, Ph.D., Chairman, ARB, at (916) \n     322-5840.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Winston H. Hickox,\n     Agency Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nbipartisan amendment to increase the renewable fuels standard. I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of this commonsense amendment--and honored to \njoin the senators, such as Senators Johnson and Lugar, who have been \nworking on this issue literally since its inception.\n  My parents always taught me that it was important to understand the \nhistory of our family, the lands around us and our Nation. I don't \nthink it's out of the question for us to take a moment to reflect on \nthe history of ethanol, too.\n  The use of ethanol in this Nation reaches back more than a century. \nHenry Ford's Model T was designed to run on ethanol. During World War \nI, ethanol accounted for 20 percent of vehicle fuels and during World \nWar II we converted whiskey distilleries to produce fuel ethanol. \nEthanol helped combat the oil crisis of the 1970s and was pivotal in \nthe phase-out of leaded gasoline in the early 1980s.\n  Now we have an opportunity to move forward again with ethanol, which \nHenry Ford referred to as the ``fuel of the future''. Last year this \nNation used 140 billion gallons of motor fuel, but only 3.45 billion \ngallons of ethanol and biodiesel. In other words, in 2004 only 2.5 \npercent of our Nation's fuel was renewable. The amendment we are \nconsidering now calls for 8 billion gallons of ethanol and biodiesel to \nbe produced in America by 2012. This will represent slightly less than \n5 percent of the transportation fuel that will be used in 2012.\n  At the moment, most of our biofuels are ethanol, and most of that is \nderived from corn. But this legislation helps the country to transition \nto producing more biodiesel and more diverse ethanol feedstocks. This \ntransition to a more diverse set of feedstocks will help our national \nsecurity and national economy, because it will allow farmers from all \nover the country to grow crops that can be used to make transportation \nfuels. These diverse feedstocks will include potatoes, tobacco, sugar, \nwood waste and more. And while this amendment works to diversify the \nfeedstocks for renewable fuels, it also contain very good incentives to \nestablish cellulosic ethanol. This is the ethanol of the future and we \nneed to develop it. While current ethanol has a positive energy return \nof around 35 percent, cellulosic ethanol has the potential to return as \nmuch as 500 percent of the energy required to make it. This will be a \nsignificant advance in our quest to set America free from foreign oil.\n  The amendment is meant to send a very clear signal to the market that \nAmerica is committed to this cheap, clean and reliable energy source. \nThis amendment is not, as some of my colleagues have suggested, an \n``outrage.'' This amendment is good for Colorado, good for America, and \ngood for the environment.\n  First of all, this amendment is good for Colorado. Rural economies in \nColorado and across the country need help. We cannot continue to \nmaintain the policies that have made rural America the forgotten \nAmerica. It is said that a rising tide lifts all boats, but too often \nthe tides never reach the Main Streets of our rural communities. \nEthanol can help make it possible for everyone to benefit from economic \ngrowth.\n\n[[Page S6612]]\n\n  Domestically produced biofuels can provide that assistance, in the \nform of good jobs, an influx of construction dollars, and new markets \nfor local agriculture. In Colorado alone, new ethanol plants are \nplanned for Windsor, Evans, and Sterling. There is some talk of future \nethanol plants in Fort Morgan, Commerce City, and Lamar. The facility \nin Sterling is under construction now and should be up and running by \nOctober of this year. It will employ about 32 people and may add up to \n100 secondary jobs. The facility hopes to supply about 1 million \ngallons of ethanol each year.\n  For biodiesel, we have small producers in Berthoud and in Denver, and \na new production and blending facility will come on line in Monte Vista \nthis year that should be producing biodiesel fuel within the next two \nmonths and will employ 12 people around the clock. Once in full \nproduction, this Monte Vista plant should create a ripple effect of up \nto 200 additional jobs. And right now, in my own San Luis Valley, \ncanola is being grown specifically for the production of biodiesel.\n  This amendment also includes potatoes as a possible feedstock for \nbio-fuel. The San Luis Valley grows, but cannot use, tons and tons of \npotatoes each year. The amendment allows for the possibility that \nsomeone in the San Luis Valley will pick up on this cheap feedstock and \nturn it into fuel.\n  Second, this amendment is good for America. It is a simple fact that \nour dependence on oil from a politically unstable region of the world \nputs our I national security at risk.\n  Remember what we are dealing with when we are so dependent on foreign \nsources of energy. Our four top sources for oil are Saudi Arabia, \nCanada, Mexico and Venezuela. It is no secret that stability in Saudi \nArabia is an open question, and each week records a new outrage from \nthe President of Venezuela.\n  Developing our own transportation fuels directly reduces this \ndependence on foreign oil and frees our nation to better protect its \ncitizens from economic or other harms. The production and use of 8 \nbillion gallons of ethanol and biodiesel by 2012 will displace more \nthan 2 billion barrels of crude oil, and it will reduce the outflow of \ndollars to foreign oil producers by more than $60 billion.\n  By reducing our dependence on foreign oil and the unstable \ngovernments that provide it, we strengthen our national security. By \nreducing our trade deficit, we strengthen our economy. This amendment \ndoes both.\n  Finally, ethanol and biodiesel are good for the environment. There is \nno monopoly on concern for protecting our natural heritage. Everyone in \nthis chamber share the goal of clean air, and ethanol is a simple, \ndirect route to getting there. Net carbon dioxide emissions from \nbiofuels are lower than from fossil fuels, because the carbon released \nduring combustion was taken out of the air by the agricultural crops in \nthe first place.\n  According to Argonne National Labs in Illinois, in 2004 ethanol use \nin the U.S. reduced greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 7.3 \nmillion tons, equivalent to removing the annual emissions of more than \n1 million cars from the road. According to the EPA, ethanol can reduce \nthe production of carbon monoxide, one of the chief ingredients of \nsmog, by as much as 30 percent. In fact, ethanol can reduce urban smog \nmore than any other fuel available.\n  Supporting this, amendment is the common-sense thing for the Senate \ntoday. It's a win for big cities and rural small towns alike. It \nbenefits the environment while putting us on a stronger economic and \nnational security footing. How often are we presented with an \nopportunity to implement policy that benefits every person in this \ncountry? To pass it up would be a I shame.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I reiterate that I am proud to cosponsor \nthis amendment to establish a strong renewable fuels standard. It is a \nclear-cut case of what we can do when we work together--Republicans and \nDemocrats--to fix problems that face our country. I wish it were not \nsuch a I unique development.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I regret that I am unable to be \npresent for the vote on the Domenici renewable fuels amendment, No. \n779. I support this amendment, and I am pleased that a majority of my \ncolleagues do as well. The Domenici amendment makes a significant step \ntoward reducing our Nation's reliance on foreign oil. For 30 years I \nhave been a supporter of renewable energy and alternative fuels, and I \nsupport this amendment which will require 8 billion gallons of ethanol \nin gasoline by 2012.\n  The Energy Committee's reported Energy bill sought to promote the use \nof biomass ethanol, biodiesel, hydrogen and biogas. I appreciate that \neffort. But, as we move forward with increased production of these \nrenewable fuels, we must do so in a manner that is environmentally \nsound.\n  We cannot separate energy policy from environmental policy. The \nSenate Energy Committee reported bill encompasses many provisions in \nthe jurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nUnfortunately, the only provision in this bill that was actually \nconsidered by the Environment Committee is the renewable fuels program. \nThe reason is that boosting the use of ethanol in gasoline has \nsignificant Clean Air Act implications, and we must ensure that \nconforming changes to the Clean Air Act are made to ensure no worsening \nof air quality. As included in the reported version of the Energy bill, \ngiving the Department of Energy authority for a new billion gallon \nrenewable fuels program does not accomplish our dual objectives of \nincreasing the use of renewable fuels while maintaining our Nation's \nair quality.\n  Prior to the Energy Committee consideration of this renewable fuels \nprovision, Senator Inhofe wrote Senator Domenici regarding the need for \nchanges in the Clean Air Act for an ethanol mandate to be effective. \nThe Environment and Public Works Committee has repeatedly approved \nlegislation to make such changes in the Clean Air Act to make the \nethanol mandate work and for the environment, air quality and public \nhealth to be protected.\n  The Domenici amendment is basically the same as the measure, S. 606, \napproved earlier this year by the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee but with a higher ethanol mandate and updated to prevent \nbacksliding on toxic emissions. The amendment phases out the use of \nmethyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, within 4 years. This phase-out \nwill be accomplished more safely because refiners will be required to \nmaintain no worse toxic emissions than occurred in 2001-2002. Those \nwere much better performing years than the 1999-2000 baseline in S. \n606. The amendment also provides EPA with authority to regulate fuels \nand fuel additives for the protection, not just of air, but of \nwater resources too. This is an important provision that will allow EPA \nto take action should another fuel additive prove a threat to drinking \nwater.\n\n  In addition, the amendment eliminates the oxygen content requirement \nfor reformulated gasoline--RFG--that was put into the 1990 Clean Air \nAct Amendments. EPA is required to issue regulations to ensure that all \nnonattainment areas use RFG that contributes less to smog. The Agency \nmust also regularly require fuel and fuel additive manufacturers to \nconduct health and environmental studies and make them public and to \nupdate its complex model for vehicle emissions from the outdated 1990 \nbaseline vehicle. Further, governors in the ozone transport region may \nopt-in to the RFG program for their entire State, not just a \nnonattainment area. The amendment also sets up an automatic check-back \nto see what impacts the fuel system changes, the ethanol mandate and \nthe MTBE phase-out will have on health, air quality, gasoline prices \nand supply, and other factors.\n  Oil companies began adding MTBE to gasoline as early as 1979 and by \n1991, 1 year before the Clean Air Act oxygenate requirement went into \neffect, oil companies were using more than 100,000 barrels of MTBE per \nday.\n  These facts belie the oil companies' argument that Congress made them \nuse MTBE and therefore Congress should stop the lawsuits. It is a well-\nestablished fact that oil companies were using MTBE years before the \nClean Air Act oxygenate requirement went into effect. The Clean Air Act \ndoes not mandate the use of MTBE, and the fact\n\n[[Page S6613]]\n\nthat there was any oxygenate requirement in the Clean Air Act at all \nwas due in part to oil industry lobbying.\n  Earlier today there was also a rollcall vote on the Schumer \namendment, No. 782. Had I been present, I would have voted in \nopposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from New York, Mr. \nSchumer.\n  The Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, was proposing to strike the \nwhole second subtitle, Subtitle B, from the Domenici amendment. While \nthe Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, argues that his strike merely \neliminates the ``mandate'' of requiring ethanol in gasoline, it does \nmuch more. First, the fact that it eliminates a national commitment to \nuse ethanol in gasoline at significant volumes should not be \noverlooked. Second, the Domenici provision would promote \ndiversification in ethanol production by promoting the development of \ncellulosic biomass ethanol. This is an important new technology, \ndesigned to produce ethanol from wood waste, plant materials, and \nanimal waste, in addition to corn and soybeans. It will allow more \nStates the opportunity to produce ethanol with locally appropriate and \navailable materials.\n  In addition, to address the concerns of the Senator from New York, \nMr. Schumer, there is detailed language in the part of the Domenici \namendment he seeks to strike that would allow States to seek waivers \nfrom the use of ethanol in the event that there is disproportionate \neconomic hardship. I think that this is the appropriate way to proceed. \nHigh gasoline prices and dependence upon foreign sources of oil are \nalready causing economic hardship, and now is the time to try to get \nmore domestically produced ethanol blended with our gasoline so that we \ncan reduce that dependence.\n  Though I support removing the liability shield for renewable fuels in \nSubtitle B of the Domenici amendment, I think that the Schumer \namendment is too drastic a tool to deal with the price concerns of his \nState and moves us away from a serious national commitment to renewable \nfuels. For those reasons, I would have opposed Senate Amendment 782 had \nI been present.\n  I support efforts to increase the use of renewable fuels. I believe \nit can and should be done in a way that is protective of this country's \nair, land and water. That means not allowing gasoline to become \ndirtier. And that means maintaining EPA's role in regulating fuels to \nimprove air quality while protecting current and future drinking water \nsources and not transferring these authorities to the Energy \nDepartment. The Domenici amendment accomplishes those objectives and I \nam pleased it has been added to the bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the renewable \nfuels standard, RFS, amendment. This important amendment, which I have \ncosponsored, will create a nationwide standard for the use of renewable \nfuels.\n  A renewable fuels standard is created that will increase the use of \ndomestically produced renewable fuels to 8 billion gallons by 2012. The \nbill also allows the Nation's refiners to buy credits from refiners \nthat use ethanol in other States to meet the requirement, ensuring \nadditional refiner flexibility to use ethanol where it is most \nefficient and economical.\n  In Illinois, roughly one in every six rows of corn, approximately 280 \nmillion bushels is the source for ethanol. Illinois ranks second in the \nNation in corn production, with more than 1.5 billion bushels produced \nannually, and is the Nation's leading source of clean-burning ethanol. \nIllinois currently has five ethanol plants, with two other plants in \nproduction. Corn grown in Illinois is used to make 40 percent of the \nethanol consumed in the United States. More than 95 percent of the \ngasoline sold in the Chicago area contains 10 percent ethanol.\n  Investment in the ethanol industry in Illinois exceeds $1 billion, \ngenerating 800 jobs in plant operations and 4,000 jobs in the industry-\nrelated service sector. In fact, Illinois ethanol production alone has \nincreased the national market price for corn by 25 cents per bushel.\n  Illinois farmers stand ready and eager to contribute to our Nation's \nenergy security, and the benefits extend to the environment as well. \nReplacing Mideast oil with Midwest ethanol is a winner for everyone but \nthe oil sheiks. When we can use our Illinois agricultural expertise to \nreduce our dependence on foreign suppliers, the whole Nation benefits.\n  This expanded role for renewable fuels means more than a boost to \nindustry; it means jobs to rural America, and increased energy \nsecurity. And in contrast to the environmental damage that can be \ncaused by drilling for oil, the only drilling required to produce \nethanol is the initial inch and a half deep planting of the corn seed. \nAnd for the soybeans used to make biodiesel, the seeds are only drilled \nan inch into the ground.\n  American farmers are the foot soldiers in our battle for energy \nindependence. Farmers throughout the country have come together to \nbuild ethanol production facilities that, in many instances, have \nbecome the backbone of a regional rural economy. In fact, farmer-owned \nethanol plants, taken together, are the single largest segment of the \nU.S. ethanol industry. As we look for solutions to high oil prices, we \nmust remember that renewable fuels are viable alternative fuels--\ndomestically produced and environmentally friendly.\n  Cleaner burning biofuels, that can be produced, transported and \ncombusted with major environmental benefits will contribute to cleaner \nand healthier air and less water and soil pollution. Importantly, \nbiofuels, being essentially greenhouse gas neutral, will also \ncontribute to achieving environmental goals while advancing the \neconomies of rural America.\n  According to an analysis completed by renowned economist John \nUrbanchuk of LEGC, Inc., an RFS that grows to 8 billion gallons of \nethanol by 2012 would have a significant impact on both the farm and \noverall economy over the next decade.\n  It would reduce crude oil imports by 2 billion barrels and reduce the \noutflow of dollars largely to foreign oil producers by $64 billion.\n  It would create 234,840 new jobs in all sectors of the U.S. economy.\n  It would increase U.S. household income by $43 billion.\n  It would add $200 billion to GDP between 2005 and 2012.\n  It would create $6 billion in new investment in renewable fuel \nproduction facilities.\n  And it would result in the spending of $70 billion on goods and \nservices required to produce 8 billion gallons of ethanol and biodiesel \nby 2012.\n  Renewable fuels provide for a dependable domestic source of energy \nthat increases fuel supplies, reduces our reliance on foreign oil, and \nenhances our ability to control our own security and economic future--\nwhile helping our farmers by increasing demand for their crops. \nIncreasing the use of ethanol and other renewable fuels achieves many \npositive public policy goals.\n  This amendment should be adopted.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are ready to vote on the ethanol \namendment, as modified.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note the presence of the distinguished \nSenator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, on the floor. We have agreed \nheretofore that her amendment would now be the subject matter before \nthe Senate. I understand the Senator is prepared to offer it.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, may we have a copy of the final draft of \nthe amendment?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes, we will send the amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have it. I wonder if we can discuss what the \nSenator's pleasure is. We have nothing else pending but her amendment \nfor at least a couple of hours or more. How much time does the Senator \nthink she might need?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I know there are many colleagues who \nwant to talk on this issue. I do not know how many members on the other \nside of the aisle want to speak. I would think we can dispose of this \nwithin a couple of hours. That would be my guess.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we will not set a specific time, but \nlet's talk about a couple of hours. I gather that the Senator would not \nneed all that time continuously, if somebody desired to speak. I ask \nthe Chair to recognize the Senator to answer my question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. That is correct. I think we will start the debate on \nthe Cantwell amendment, and if other Members want to address that or \nother issues, we are happy for them to come down and address those \nissues as the afternoon progresses.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is the understanding--and I hope Senator Cantwell \nwould comply--that there will not be any other subject matter come up. \nI ask unanimous consent that no other amendments be in order while this \ndiscussion is taking place, other than discussing the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, having said that, Senators on our side \nhave heard we will be on this amendment for 2 hours, probably longer. \nIf any of my colleagues desire to come down and debate the issue, I \nwould very much appreciate them letting us know or, in fact, come to \nthe floor and we will arrange for them to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee for his participation and help in clarifying this next \nsegment of debate on the Energy bill. While I think we have several \nissues left to discuss, I think it is very important to realize what a \nmilestone we have achieved. After a couple of sessions of the Senate \ntrying to get energy legislation, we are now on the precipice of having \nan energy bill that has great bipartisan support.\n  I compliment the chairman of the Energy Committee for his hard work \nand diligence in getting an energy bill that has such great bipartisan \nsupport. As a member of the Energy Committee and as a relatively new \nMember of the Senate, I can tell you how honored I was that Senator \nDomenici visited me in my office to talk about the issues impacting the \nNorthwest--because we have been hard hit by an energy crisis in the \nlast several years--and his willingness to work with my office on those \nNorthwest issues, particularly related to the hydro system.\n  I can say with certainty that just about every member of the Senate \nEnergy Committee participated in the markup of this legislation by \ngetting ideas and concepts into the Energy bill. While each of us have \ndifferent perspectives because we represent different regions of the \ncountry, people should realize that getting an energy bill is a very \nimportant step forward in our Nation.\n  I contrast that to the House version. The House version reminds me of \nwhere we were in the Senate version 2 years ago, except for the House \nversion just kept going in the wrong direction. It basically has what I \ncall ``gratuitous special interest deals'' relating to groundwater \npollutants. This includes letting MTBE manufacturers off the hook from \ntheir liability, something I know the Presiding Officer has concerns \nabout. The House bill also has rollbacks of the Clean Air Act, the \nClean Water Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and the Safe \nDrinking Water Act. I think these are bad precedents to set.\n  I am trying to bring attention to the fact that the product we are \nstarting with in the Senate is good legislation. The next week and a \nhalf will probably make this legislation even better, as Members who \nare not on the committee bring up issues, some of which, Members who \nare on the committee left to be discussed by all the Members on the \nSenate floor.\n  Something of particular importance to the Northwest is the \nelectricity title in this legislation. Establishing the electricity \ntitle was a very meaningful step toward responding to the scandalous \nEnron crisis and the unethical practices of market manipulation. We are \nreally getting tough on energy traders and executives who perpetrate \nthe kinds of abuses that we saw in the western energy market. We are \nsending a message to those industries and businesses that the consumer \nwill not provide the deep pocket for Enron kinds of bankruptcies.\n  I am grateful to the chairman and the ranking member from New Mexico \nfor their hard work on this legislation. There was a great irony taking \nplace the moment the Senate was about to make a decision on changing \nthe filibuster rules. Members of both sides of the aisle and all their \nstaffs were hard at work marking up a very comprehensive energy bill in \na very bipartisan fashion. If people were there, they would have \nrealized it was the Senate at its best doing its best work.\n  There are still outstanding issues that we decided we were going to \nbring to the Senate floor. Some of those issues were related to a \nvariety of concerns that we thought were best addressed on the Senate \nfloor. One of the issues that I think is important to bring up is my \namendment on energy security. It is an amendment that will set a \nnational goal for getting off our overdependence on foreign sources of \noil. I am pleased to be able to offer that amendment with Senators \nDurbin, Salazar, and Kerry because it is important that energy \nindependence be\n\n[[Page S6615]]\n\npart of our strategy for a national energy policy.\n  Many Americans are feeling this overdependence at the gas pump today. \nThey know we are overdependent on foreign oil. They want to see more \ncompetition in gas prices. Americans may not realize that now the \nUnited States imports about 58 percent of our oil supply. That is about \n11 million barrels a day. This number is expected to grow to about 62 \npercent by 2015. The underlying bill tried to address this by saying we \nshould cut our dependence on oil by a million barrels a day, but what \nthat underlying bill does is leave us worse off by 2015 than we are \ntoday. It would leave us more dependent on foreign oil than we \ncurrently are. The mathematics of the underlying bill need to be \nimproved.\n  My amendment would direct the President to develop and implement a \nlong-term strategy to reduce our dependence on foreign oil by reducing \n7.6 million barrels of oil per day by 2025. So, instead of allowing our \nforeign oil imports to grow from the 58 percent that it is today to 68 \npercent in 2025, my amendment would reverse this alarming trend.\n\n  We can see where we are today and where we need to get to reduce this \ndependence.\n  Under my amendment, this would be a 40-percent reduction by the year \n2025. It is very important that this goal be included as part of our \nenergy legislation.\n  It should be no surprise because many of the Members have talked \nabout energy independence as part of the energy legislation. If my \ncolleagues believe in the underlying fundamentals of this legislation, \nthen they must believe that we can be successful in getting off our \noverdependence on foreign oil.\n  What this legislation is missing is an adequate goal to actually \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  It is no surprise that consumers and experts alike agree on this. In \nfact, there was a recent poll which showed that 92 percent of Americans \nare very worried about our dependence on foreign oil, and 93 percent of \nAmericans want our Government to develop an energy strategy that will \nget us off our overdependence on foreign oil. In fact, the President \nhas joined in the call, saying that in order to make sure our economy \ngrows, we need to encourage small business sector growth and vitality. \nWe need to address a major problem facing our country, and that is our \nNation's growing dependence on foreign sources of energy.\n  The President has joined in this debate in saying that getting off \nour foreign dependence is important.\n  We have had many others speak out, such as the leadership on both \nsides of the aisle. In the House, Speaker Hastert said: Our Nation is \ndependent on a fickle foreign oil market that is being stretched to the \nlimit by foreign demands.\n  National security experts, such as CIA Director James Woolsey, former \nSecretary of State George Schultz, and others in the Energy Future \nCoalition, have said that the possibility exists for future oil \nembargoes and supply disruption that make us more dependent on the \nMiddle East.\n  In fact, those gentlemen, in their report, said: For the foreseeable \nfuture, as long as vehicle transportation is dominated by oil, the \ngreater Middle East and especially Saudi Arabia will remain in the \ndriver's seat.\n  We have a chart that shows who owns the oil supply and who are the \ntop global oil companies in the world. If one thinks about these \ncompanies on the chart, looking at the names, Aramco and various \ncompanies, and they look at the countries that basically own these \ncompanies, people will see that they are 100-percent owned by those \nentities. We can see what countries they are. We can see where the \nsupply is.\n  If Americans look at this chart, then they know that we cannot leave \nour economic future and our national security for future oil supply in \nthe hands of these governments and these countries. What we need to do \nis to get off of our overdependence on foreign oil and diversify, and \nthat is specifically what my amendment calls for.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Energy Future \nCoalition that calls for major new initiatives to curtail U.S. oil \nconsumption be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Energy Future Coalition,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 2005.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are writing to follow up on the \n     letter we sent to the President in March, urging an \n     aggressive program to address America's growing dependence on \n     foreign oil, which in our judgment endangers our national and \n     economic security. We asked the President to ``launch a major \n     new initiative to curtail U.S. oil consumption through \n     improved efficiency and the rapid development and deployment \n     of advanced biomass, alcohol and other available petroleum \n     fuel alternatives.''\n       The signatories, representing a broad range of political: \n     views, support a new national commitment: to reduce U.S. oil \n     consumption substantially, through the accelerated \n     introduction of advanced technology vehicles and alternative \n     fuels. We believe domestic biofuels can cut the nation's oil \n     use by 25 percent by 2025, and substantial further reductions \n     are possible through efficiency gains from advanced \n     technologies. That is an ambitious goal, but it is also an \n     extraordinary opportunity for American leadership, \n     innovation, job creation, and economic growth.\n       Mr. Chairman, we recognize that you and the other Members \n     of the Committee are well along in the drafting process, and \n     we hope that legislation can be enacted this year that \n     addresses the critical energy challenges confronting the \n     nation. We want to commend you for the leadership you are \n     showing and the bipartisan approach you have pursued in \n     developing a comprehensive energy bill. You have demonstrated \n     a willingness to look anew at the facts on the ground and to \n     adjust to those facts as appropriate.\n       We come forward now in a constructive spirit, with \n     recommendations drawn from the work of several groups that \n     have recently examined this topic in addition to the Energy \n     Future Coalition--the National Commission on Energy Policy, \n     the Set America Free Coalition, the Apollo Alliance, Rocky \n     Mountain Institute, and others.\n       The President said last month, ``Our country is on the \n     doorstep of incredible technological advances that will make \n     energy more abundant and more affordable for our citizens. By \n     harnessing the power of technology, we're going to be able to \n     grow our economy, protect our environment, and achieve \n     greater energy independence.'' We could not agree more \n     strongly.\n       We see a broad and bipartisan consensus emerging at various \n     levels of government throughout the country on the need to \n     move to a new model of energy production and use. As \n     promising as that vision is, however, it won't happen by \n     itself. Public policy and investment are needed to hurry the \n     future, and now is the time to act, before a crisis.\n       Toward that end, we recommend certain first steps, outlined \n     briefly below. The cost of this package is small, relative to \n     both the risks and opportunities at hand, but it would begin \n     to change the nation's direction on this critical issue. We \n     would be pleased to work with you and your staff on specific \n     legislative language.\n       1. Reward technological innovation that increases fuel \n     efficiency--Transportation accounts for two-thirds of U.S. \n     oil consumption, and light-duty vehicles account for more \n     than half of all transportation demand. New vehicle \n     technologies, including hybrids and advanced diesels, can \n     dramatically increase the efficiency of that fleet.\n       The health of the U.S. economy is closely linked to the \n     health of its auto manufacturing industry, which affects one \n     out of every 10 private-sector jobs in America. The \n     industry's vitality in turn depends on its ability to \n     innovate and respond to rapidly changing customer \n     preferences.\n       We recommend tax incentives for U.S. vehicle and component \n     manufacturers that will enable them to retool existing \n     production lines for both cars and trucks and produce \n     advanced technologies that reduce fuel consumption and U.S. \n     demand for foreign oil. We also recommend tax incentives, as \n     the President did again last month, that will increase \n     consumer demand for these technologies. We recognize, of \n     course, that tax policy falls within the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee on Finance, and we will send a similar letter to \n     Chairman Grassley.\n       2. Support the next generation of advanced vehicles--Fuel \n     consumption is closely tied to vehicle weight. Lighter \n     vehicles are thus desirable as long as they do not compromise \n     safety or performance. Advanced materials--such as composites \n     now used in advanced aircraft--could allow dramatic gains in \n     fuel economy if they could be reduced in cost. We recommend \n     that the Federal government carry out a program to \n     demonstrate the feasibility of high-volume, low-cost \n     manufacture of these materials, which will have important \n     military applications as well.\n       Additional reductions in oil demand would flow from \n     extending the range that hybrid vehicles can travel on the \n     electricity stored in their batteries. This will require \n     further improvements in battery technology and the ability to \n     plug in to the electric power grid, but may have the \n     additional benefit of leveling peak utility power loads. We \n     recommend support for further development,\n\n[[Page S6616]]\n\n     demonstration, and deployment of these technologies.\n       3. Accelerate the introduction of alternative \n     transportation fuels--The production of ethanol has increased \n     dramatically in the last two yeas, but must grow much further \n     to displace a major share of U.S. oil demand. Technologies to \n     convert widely abundant plant fiber--cellulosic biomass--to \n     liquid fuels have been demonstrated at pilot scale but face \n     considerable financial and technical risk in moving to first-\n     of-a-kind commercial-scale production. A Canadian company, \n     Iogen, is currently producing ethanol from wheat straw, but \n     at relatively small scale. Biodiesel fuels--from sources as \n     diverse as soybeans, waste cooking oil, and turkey offal--are \n     also emerging as important alternatives.\n       A well-focused and adequately funded program to take these \n     technologies to the point of becoming low-risk commercial \n     choices should be pursued on grounds of national security. \n     This may be the only way that the U.S. can have--in years, as \n     opposed to decades--a significant supply of renewable \n     domestic fuels, chemicals, and other products for which we \n     now depend on imported oil or limited natural gas reserves. \n     The Federal government should be directed to conduct a one-\n     time technology competition, supporting private-sector \n     construction of at least 10 commercial-scale demonstration \n     plants within the next five years--testing the comparative \n     advantages of different conversion processes, feedstocks and \n     end products.\n       We also support an aggressive program to increase the use \n     of renewable fuels in the fleet (similar to S. 650, for \n     example) to encourage development of these fuels and their \n     use as fuel substitutes, not just as additives. Flexible-fuel \n     vehicles can use ethanol or gasoline interchangeably, and \n     some four million are already on the road. Because new cars \n     can be given flexible-fuel capability at negligible cost, we \n     recommend that this technology be rapidly introduced into the \n     fleet to give consumers a choice in refueling options. We \n     also believe the corporate average fuel economy program \n     should provide credit for the demonstrated use of alternative \n     fuels not based on petroleum, and we recommend that all \n     biodiesel blends be treated alike in the tax code.\n       Finally, we are not unmindful of the current budget \n     situation and its implications for the energy bill; however, \n     we think that a more rational allocation of scarce resources \n     would substitute the unfunded elements of this package for \n     the $2 billion ``ultra-deepwater and unconventional onshore \n     natural gas and other petroleum research and development \n     program'' contained in the House bill. As the President noted \n     recently, with oil at $50 a barrel, ``energy companies do not \n     need taxpayers'-funded incentives to explore for oil ad \n     gas.'' We should support instead a new direction in energy \n     policy that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil, expand \n     the production of domestic transportation fuels from \n     agriculture, and create new jobs, economic growth, and \n     investment in America.\n       Mr. Chairman, we note that the Committee has held \n     conferences this year on natural gas supply and on the future \n     of coal, as well as hearings on other relevant topics, but \n     not on the subject of oil dependence and national security, \n     despite the remarkable rise in the price of oil over the past \n     year. We respectfully urge you to consider such a session and \n     offer our participation if you so desire. In any case, we \n     would be pleased to discuss these initiatives with you as you \n     consider incentives for innovative clean energy technologies, \n     as well as other provisions on renewable energy, fuels and \n     vehicles, and oil and gas.\n       These recommendations are the product of three years of \n     work by the Energy Future Coalition and others, who have come \n     together in a constructive and non-partisan effort to develop \n     politically viable answers to seemingly intractable issues, \n     so that we might have a national energy policy that responds \n     strategically both to the challenges we face and to the \n     opportunities they create.\n       With best wishes,\n           Sincerely,\n         Robert C. McFarlane.\n         R. James Woolsey.\n         Frank J. Gaffney, Jr.\n         Richard L. Trumka.\n         Charles B. Curtis.\n         C. Boyden Gray.\n         Timothy E.

Specifically, this coalition believes that domestic \nbiofuel, something that we just debated as part of this energy \nstrategy, can be used to produce a very significant amount of our \nfuture energy, and they are calling it an extraordinary opportunity for \nAmerican leadership for job creation and economic growth.\n  I think this group of individuals, who are part of a coalition that \nis interested in our country's national security, are pointing out that \nthis very chart, showing the ownership by foreign entities, is of great \nconcern to our future. I think this letter does adequately call on us \nto do our job in making sure we are getting off of our foreign \ndependence.\n  I believe this underlying legislation gives us the tools to do so. \nThat is especially true if you think about the framework that is in the \nbill and the debate we just had on biofuels, the 8 billion gallon \nbiofuels goal by 2012. What is great about the biofuels amendment that \nwas adopted and revised from the committee markup is that it includes \nboth ethanol and biodiesel, and specifically ethanol research and \ndevelopment of what are called cellulosic ethanols--biomass-based \nethanol materials.\n  We know we have Midwestern States that are already producing ethanol \nand giving us a source of supply. But if you take those five Midwestern \nStates and try to transport that product to the Northwest, as we do \ntoday--we are selling biofuels and ethanol in a variety of places in \nWashington State today, but you are adding a 30-cent to 50-cent \ntransportation cost. What the amendment we just adopted does is make \nsure that various parts of the country can also be in the biofuels \nbusiness; that we can start producing products in other parts of the \ncountry, closer to the source and consumers that are going to use them. \nSo it is a very positive step forward.\n  The bill also includes clean coal technology, that I know my \ncolleague who is on the floor, the Senator from Tennessee, has worked \non so diligently. It includes hydrogen fuel cells, and it includes next \ngeneration nuclear power, things I know my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle have worked hard to perfect. It includes new research and \ndevelopment, to play a vital role in the commercialization of new \ntechnology. It promotes in, a bipartisan way, conservation initiatives. \nIt is exciting to catch a sense of the new technology that will be in \nthis bill to give us more efficiency in our homes and businesses. We \nwill get a lot of savings from these programs and tools.\n  There are many tools in the underlying bill to achieve the goals we \nset out for ourselves. We believe this underlying bill has the right \ntechnology answers; that is, it has all the various means by which we \ncan get off our foreign oil dependence, but it is simply lacking a \ngoal. That is what my amendment will provide. This legislation should \nreflect the resolve of the American people, who say that getting off \nour overdependence on foreign oil is a national priority, and we are \ngoing to stick to it.\n  I know various Members are going to come down here and offer \namendments\n\n[[Page S6617]]\n\non other issues, issues related to global warming and greenhouse gas \nemissions. We are going to have proposals regarding a renewable \nportfolio standard, which would basically mean that our electricity \ngrid would use more renewable energy to provide supply. I think Senator \nFeinstein is still going to come down and offer her amendment to close \nthe SUV loophole, to try to make SUVs more fuel efficient.\n  We are going to have a lot of discussion to help improve the bill. \nBut without setting a national goal, without saying our country has to \nget off our dependence on foreign oil, we will have missed an \nopportunity. This underlying legislation sets a goal that will actually \nmake us, in 2015, more dependent on foreign oil than we are today. I \nthink we need to set a goal as a legislative body, that we want to \nreverse that trend. In 2025 we want to actually be importing less \nforeign oil, and that is exactly what my amendment does.\n  Why is this so important? First, we all know it is in the economic \ninterest of the United States to diversify off foreign oil. We know our \ndependence has cost us, since 1970, something like $3.6 trillion. In \n2003, imports cost us $10 billion every single month, and our oil \nimports count for about 34 percent of our existing trade deficit. Think \nabout that, 34 percent of our trade deficit, just because of the cost \nof oil. In fact, Alan Greenspan has said that the high cost of fuel has \nbasically caused 8 out of the 10 postwar U.S. recessions; they were \nrelated to high energy prices and spikes in oil.\n  We know there is a strong relationship between energy costs to our \noverall economy. That is what we are trying to change. But a number of \nfactors remain, and that is what is of great concern. Who actually \ncontrols those energy costs? We know the OPEC cartel, as well as \ninternational events and political events, have an impact. We know the \ngrowing demand in China and India for the same supply of oil has an \nimpact. We know we need to do something about it.\n  If you talk to economists about what is going to happen to the price \nof oil in the future, the signs are pointing to oil prices could reach \n$100 a barrel in the next 20 years. If that is the case, that would \nhave a devastating impact on our national economy. Yet that is exactly \nwhat we are hearing from them. That is exactly what people are saying. \nThere is a world economic outlook report that was issued this spring by \nthe International Monetary Fund, and that report basically said that \noil could spike to $100 a barrel between now and 2030.\n  The Wall Street firm of Goldman Sachs also predicted that the price \nof oil could reach $105 in the next few years, and energy markets could \neasily be in the early stages of a superspike period. I know the United \nStates has been through these periods before, where we have seen \nextreme spikes in energy costs. It has had a devastating impact on our \neconomy. That is something we are trying to avoid by setting a national \ngoal to diversify away from foreign oil.\n\n  We have many economic reasons for this amendment. But as I stated \nearlier, we also have security reasons. Let me expound on that just a \nlittle bit because I think it is important to understand the demand for \noil and, basically, who holds the reserves. The oil reserves of every \narea in the world are in decline except for the Middle East. That means \nif we continue to be dependent on foreign oil, we are going to be more \ndependent on OPEC and its member countries. Given that those reserves, \nlet's just say, are constantly under some scrutiny because of the \nchallenges in that region of the world, some analysts, when looking at \nthe oil futures market, basically describe what they call a fear \npremium. That is, the price of oil futures actually increases because \npeople are concerned that international incidents may happen, terrorist \nthreats and other things, that will damage that oil supply. So the cost \nof oil futures actually goes up, just on the fear of what might happen.\n  That is troubling because as we all know, we cannot predict what is \ngoing to happen on an international basis. We do our best to protect \nthat oil supply, but Saudi Arabia alone has about a quarter of the \nworld's oil reserves and more than 60 percent of that country's total \noil inputs are processed at a single facility. So if you think about \nit, it is the home to almost all of the world's spare production \ncapacity. Again, we are putting all our eggs in one basket. I am simply \nsaying lets set a national goal to get off that dependence on foreign \noil because of this security reason, as well as the economic reason and \nwho owns this supply and how important it is.\n  I would like to talk for a second about the picture as it relates to \nother people interested in that oil supply. I mentioned China and India \nand the projections of the price of oil reaching $100 a barrel. \nAnalysts agree that China, because of its growth and huge demand, is \nlikely to shift the whole center of gravity for energy markets. That \nis, China has already moved past Japan in its global energy \nconsumption. It is the second largest oil consumer and the third \nlargest oil importer. In the next decade, China is going to continue to \ngrow to about half of today's U.S. combined car and truck total, so \nthey are going to be looking for lots of energy supply. It is expected \nthat their imports are going to double by 2010 and quadruple, to 8 \nbillion barrels of oil a day, by 2025. Imports will be 60 percent of \nChina's total oil consumption.\n  While we are looking at the picture, already knowing we are \noverdependent on foreign oil and that the challenges to security are \nthere and that the American economy is already suffering, we also need \nto recognize there are other nations who are going to be bidding for \nthat same resource.\n  We need to get off our overdependence on foreign oil. How are we \ngoing to do that? First, we have to have the resolve. There are many \ntimes in American history this country has shown American resolve. We \nhave put a man on the Moon. We have ushered in the nuclear age. We \nstood up in the OPEC crisis and got fuel efficiency standards for cars. \nWe ought to have the resolve now. We need to bet on the ingenuity of \nAmerican brain power to get us off our overdependence on foreign oil. \nIf we are smart enough to put a man on the Moon, we ought to be smart \nenough to get off our overdependence on foreign oil. When John F. \nKennedy made the declaration of wanting to put a man on the Moon in a \n10-year period of time, I don't think he had the answer to every single \nelement of how to do that. He left the details up to both the public \nand private sector in getting new technology developed so we could move \nforward.\n  In this case we have an underlying bill that actually can achieve \nthis goal of reversing the trend by 2025 and reducing 40 percent the \nconsumption of the United States of foreign oil. How do we do that? \nMany people have talked about how we get there. I will show one chart \nwith examples of the oil savings technology in this legislation.\n  The biofuels amendment we talked about: Many organizations, including \nsome of those security initiative organizations such as Energy Future \nCoalition and some environmental organizations such as Natural \nResources Defense Council, have said biofuels can play a significant \nrole. They could help produce 3.9 billion barrels of alternative fuel a \nday.\n  I hope my Midwest colleagues and my colleagues from other parts of \nthe country who are interested in biodiesel and ethanol are excited by \nthat opportunity. It means an economic opportunity for all the regions \nof our country that can produce those fuels. It also has a higher \nnational purpose, to help us get off our over-dependence on foreign \noil.\n  We can also improve efficiencies in various sectors such as aviation, \nresidential applications, and various modes of transportation. I am \nvery proud the Northwest has figured this out.\n  At the Paris Air Show we are seeing a lot of news about future \nplanes. One plane you will not see there today but is on the drawing \nboards and is getting rave reviews from people making purchase orders \nis the next generation 787. What is great about that is its whole \ndesign is based on a more fuel-efficient plane. Boeing estimates it can \nsave between 20 and 30 percent on fuel costs. They figured out the \nmarketplace is going to be very sensitive to the high expense of \ntransportation fuel and have developed a plane to answer the call from \nthe marketplace. What has the marketplace said? The marketplace is \nresponding with over 200 orders for a plane that is not even finished \nyet.\n\n[[Page S6618]]\n\nThat is a great example of how we can get efficiencies in aviation and \nother sectors.\n  This chart explains how we can make a big step forward in energy \nsavings, which are aspects of this legislation. They are very important \naspects to look at.\n  A few of my colleagues who are anxious about this legislation want to \nknow if it is a back door to higher fuel efficiency standards; that \nsomehow this bill mandates CAFE. It does not mandate a higher fuel \nefficiency standard, although this Member would certainly support a \npiece of legislation in the Senate that suggested that. This amendment \nrealizes there are hybrid cars in the marketplace that are likely to \ncome onboard. There are estimates that you can increase the efficiency \nof our economy using hybrids and save up to 2 million barrels a day by \n2015. That's just from the growth in the hybrid auto market. That is \njust American consumers buying hybrid cars and making that investment. \nIt does not have to be CAFE, although I personally think we are losing \na huge opportunity in the American marketplace by not being more \naggressive about cars that can run on alternative fuels. I say that, \nmentioning the Boeing experience in aviation.\n  The aerospace industry in the Northwest is responding to the demand \nof more fuel-efficient transportation. I wish the auto manufacturers \nwould be more aggressive. Actually, as oil has hit $50 a barrel they \nhave gotten more aggressive. They have gone over to Japan and said, \nokay, we want a technology deal with the Japanese auto manufacturers; \nwe want to get more of these cars in the United States market. Maybe \nthat will work.\n  However, this amendment does not assume we are going to have a new \nCAFE standard. It simply says to the United States, if you are serious \nabout this problem, you will set a national goal to get off our \noverdependence on foreign oil by 2025 and start reducing the trend. \nInstead of continually importing more, we should be importing less.\n  This chart shows the trend we are trying to reverse. Today we are \nbasically importing 13 million barrels a day; if we do nothing, by \n2025, we will be importing 19 million barrels. This is the trend we are \ntrying to reverse. This is the direction we did not want to go in. We \nwant to make a change.\n  Some of my colleagues ask, how can you set this goal? If you are not \nspecific about how you get there, how are we going to achieve it? There \nis a lot I am sure that President Kennedy thought about when he wanted \nto put a man on the Moon, and maybe his original projections were not \naccurate. There is a lot of research and development we are going to do \non a variety of these technologies.\n  One country that has taken this challenge and embraced it is Brazil. \nIt is a country which looked at this same dilemma the United States \nhas, from the economic perspective. They said, we cannot afford to be \ndependent on the high cost of imported oil. In fact, in the 1970s, \nBrazil had about 80 percent of its supply from imports. That was a big \nchallenge.\n  As it exists today, Brazil has, because of its biofuels initiative, \nchanged that trend. In fact, Brazil has gone from 1975 being 80 percent \ndependent on foreign oil to 1990 being only 45 percent dependent on \nforeign oil, and in 2006, Brazil actually plans on being an energy \nself-sufficient country and maybe even being a net exporter of fuel. \nThat is very interesting. As it stands today, they are only importing \nabout 11 percent of their supply.\n  How do you go from 1975 at 80 percent to 11 percent in 2003? The \ncountry took the initiative and said they were going to produce a \ncompetitive product to fossil fuel. That competitive product happened \nto be sugar-based ethanol. They got good at producing sugar-based \nethanol. They got so good at producing sugar-based ethanol they \nactually can produce it and ship it here cheaper than we can produce it \ntoday.\n  I don't like losing the competitive edge to somebody else on the \nproduction of an alternative fuel source. I want the United States to \nbe a leader in the production of alternative fuel sources. It holds a \nlot of promise for the United States.\n  One might say, well, Brazil is only one-eighth the size of the United \nStates economy and we have much more demand than Brazil. That is true, \nbut Brazil has learned about the efficient production of ethanol. Are \nwe saying somehow the United States does not have the raw material \nsupply for ethanol, whether it is sugar-based ethanol or biomass-based \nethanol?\n  We actually are trying to put the American farmer in the fuel \nbusiness. If there is anything we ought to be sure we have its \nagriculture. We know we only sit on 3 percent of the oil reserves in \nthe world, so we know we are not going to get it from there. We are \ntalking about importing liquified natural gas, so we know we are \nchallenged there. But we sure know that the American farmer can produce \na lot of product as it relates to ethanol, whether it is sugar based or \nbiomass based, and we can produce a lot as it relates to biodiesel \nproducts as well.\n  That is exactly what this legislation does. It is very specific about \nthe research and development that needs to take place to get us into \nthe alternative fuels business. I am so certain of the well-crafted \nnature of that section of the bill that I am willing to say that I \nthink we really can achieve our goal of decreasing our energy \ndependence by 2025. So it is a very positive step for us to look at \nwhat we have seen around the globe as far as other countries trying to \nget toward energy independence or becoming less dependent on foreign \noil.\n  Now, I have another chart that shows examples of what we are trying \nto reach. This chart basically demonstrates how we can reduce, by 7 \nmillion barrels a day, U.S. consumption. It does not have to be the \nexact mix as shown on the chart of how we achieve that. This is just \none of the proposals. You have market growth in hybrid cars; industrial \nimprovements, efficiency improvements in aviation; efficiency gains in \ntrucks and heavy-duty equipment. One of our National Laboratories in \nthe State of Washington, the Pacific Northwest Labs, is doing great \nresearch on lightweight trucks, lightweight materials, transportation \nefficiency, for the trucking industry in our country. Other areas to \nreduce consumption: how to make the movement of goods and services more \nefficient, saving transportation costs; the replacement of tires, you \ncan get more fuel efficiency just by having better balance of your \ntires to get better gas mileage; and there are transportation choices; \nand biofuels. Again, biofuels is a big opportunity for us.\n  So I hope all my colleagues are listening who are very supportive of \nthe biofuels section of this legislation--which I hope there are many \nbecause I think it is a great opportunity. If you are supportive of \nthat biofuels section of the bill, you ought to be very supportive of \nsetting a goal because you really ought to believe the national goal is \nachievable. You ought to believe that the economic interest of our \ncountry in getting that new production of biofuels is not only an \neconomic and security matter, it is also just plain good job creation \nfor our country. You are putting the American farmer back in business \nwith a product that now will see huge demand.\n  Now, I do not know if we have it here on the floor, but I took great \nnote that the Economist magazine wrote a piece on biofuels a few weeks \nago. In fact, it was a front-page cover story article that week about \nbiofuels. What was interesting about it is that it discussed the fact \nthat we are at this point where biofuels make so much sense because of \nthe price of oil.\n  Now, several years ago, when we were talking about oil at $20 a \nbarrel and people were talking about biofuels, maybe it did not make \nmuch sense, the economics did not make much sense. But we have hit, as \nAndy Grove would say, an inflection point, and that inflection point is \nthat now we are seeing prices over $50 a barrel for imported oil.\n  So the article basically says that it is no longer the ``blue sky'' \nstuff that people talk about, but it is an idea whose time has come. It \nis a very substantive opportunity for anybody who can produce biofuels \nbecause at anywhere around $50 a barrel, instead of $25 a barrel, \nbiofuels can be competitive.\n  Now, in Washington State, we are selling biodiesel and alternative \nfuels. A few weeks ago, we had the opening of one of our first biofuels \nstations. It was\n\n[[Page S6619]]\n\nactually at the same location as a previous traditional petroleum-based \nstation. So they changed over from serving customers gasoline to now \nserving biodiesel.\n  Right now, the product is something that is shipped from the Midwest, \nrefined at a production facility in Seattle, and then sent over to what \nwas this particular station, Laurelhurst Oil. They are producing a \nbiofuel in Seattle, even though the oil is still imported from another \nstate. That biofuel, I think at the time, was about 30 cents more than \nwhat you could go around the corner and get to fill your car up with \ngasoline--30 cents more. And you ask: Well, how are you expecting to be \ncompetitive if it is 30 cents more? It was 30 cents more because we had \nthe transportation cost of bringing that agricultural product to the \nNorthwest, having it processed, and then sold. The production facility \nthat is actually producing this biodiesel in Seattle believes it can \nreduce the cost by 30 cents--they could be selling the biodiesel at the \nsame cost we are buying gasoline per gallon in Seattle--by simply \nproducing the product in the State of Washington.\n  So that is what this bill allows us to do. I think the Economist was \nright, that the private sector is starting to respond to this and \nstarting to come up with solutions. So then you say: Well, if the \nprivate markets are responding, why do we have to set a national goal? \nWell, let me address that because as a former businessperson, I \nunderstand that businesses are responsive to their customers and they \nare responsive to their shareholders. I do not blame a national oil \ncompany for setting its own agenda on when it wants to get into new \nenergy technologies. That is their prerogative.\n  You see lots of commercials on TV all the time about how existing \nfossil fuel companies are going to generate biofuels, how they are \ngoing to diversify. They would make you think they are doing that in a \nrapid fashion. I am not so sure it is rapid enough for the consumers of \nWashington State, who are paying a very high price for gasoline, have \npaid a very high price for electricity recently, and are reeling from a \nhard-hit economy because of high energy costs.\n  We would like to see a much more aggressive effort. But those \ncompanies are not going to set a national goal and they are not going \nto diversify until it is in their financial interest. So the question \nis whether this body is going to set a national goal, which I think \nthis underlying bill can achieve, and whether we, as a country, are \ngoing to diversify off of that overdependence on foreign oil. It is not \ntheir job; it is our job. And we should get about showing the American \npeople that we have the will to do it and that we are betting on \nAmerican ingenuity to achieve it. I have to believe that putting a man \non the Moon is a lot harder than discovering how to be as efficient as \nthe Brazilians are in the development of ethanol. I have to believe \nthat was a tougher challenge.\n  So I think about the things we have achieved in our country's \nhistory. I think about the fact that, in response to the threat of what \nother countries might be doing with the nuclear bomb in World War II, \nFDR ushered in the nuclear age in 2 years. He shifted our spending in \nthe development of energy in 2 years from about $8,000 to 86 million \ndollars and ushered in the nuclear age. Why? Because he saw a threat, \nand he wanted to set a national goal. We have had these instances where \nour country has decided it was in our economic interest and our \nsecurity interest to move ahead. That is what we need to do today.\n  So I am glad to offer this amendment that simply says that we should \ntake the underlying legislation and change its goal. The underlying \nbill already has a goal. It says that our goal should be to get off of \nforeign oil by 2015 by reducing it a million barrels a day.\n  What we need to do is reduce our oil supply in a much more aggressive \nfashion. We need to reduce that 40 percent by 2025. That is what my \namendment calls for. I am happy to hear from my other colleagues on \nthis issue. I hope that my colleagues will take this issue as an \namendment to improve the underlying bill.\n  The underlying bill has the tools and the framework we need. What we \nneed to do is have the resolve as a country to set a national goal. The \nprivate sector is not going to do that. We are not going to have \nconsumers make market choices that don't exist. They want more market \nchoices. What we have to do is set the wheels in motion. The good news \nis, once the Government sets a goal, it is amazing how many people \nrespond to that.\n  Our country has set lots of goals. We set goals for more homeland \nsecurity. I have seen more security technology companies come through \nmy office in the last 2 years than imaginable. Why? Because we said we \nwant more homeland security. So we have every imaginable aspect of \nhomeland security being addressed by thousands of companies across \nAmerica.\n  If we want to be serious about getting off our overdependence on \nforeign oil, we will pass this amendment, and we will be on the track \nfor setting a goal that both the private sector and public sector will \nrespond to. I think with that we will be able to say to Americans that \nwe are on the right track, that we are not going to let consumers \ncontinue to pay high transportation costs, and that we have a plan for \nthe future. We are not going to continue to be so singularly dependent \non the fossil fuel industry. We are not going to continue to have \ntransportation-sensitive industries caught in a stranglehold by high \nenergy costs. We are going to say to them instead that our national \nsecurity interests, our economic interests, our environmental interests \nare being met by a new national goal that all of us will participate in \nmaking a reality.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for her leadership. The amendment she \nis proposing--and we hope will be embraced by both sides of the aisle--\nwill set a goal to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. I can't think \nof a single person in America who wouldn't agree with that goal. We can \nall understand that as we wait every day for a press release from the \nOPEC nations to try to determine whether or not the price of gasoline \nis going to go up or down. This proud, strong, leading nation in the \nworld goes hat in hand to the Saudi peninsula looking for oil. We wait \nfor them to determine what the price will be. It affects every \nindividual and family and business and airline, right down the line.\n  Is it not true that the bill before us, S. 10, has a goal of reducing \ndependence on foreign oil over the next 10 years by 1 million barrels a \nday, which is not as ambitious or as far reaching as the goal of \nreducing dependence on foreign oil by 40 percent over 20 years? Is it \nnot also true that the President sent a letter to Congress yesterday \nand said if we include this provision--the weaker provision that is \nalready in the bill--reducing the barrels of oil by 1 million a day \nover 10 years, the President will veto the bill? Is that the message \nthat we have received from the Bush White House about our goal in \nreducing dependence on foreign oil?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The Senator is correct. In the underlying bill, we have \nlanguage that says we should reduce our dependence on foreign oil by 1 \nmillion barrels a day by 2015. The problem with that goal is, when you \nare currently importing 58 percent of your oil supply from foreign \nsources and you calculate in the growth of demand--obviously, our \neconomy continues to grow--there is demand for more oil. Even with that \namendment, in 10 years, in 2015, we will be importing 60 to 62 percent \nof what our Nation consumes in oil supply from foreign sources. So the \nunderlying amendment does nothing to stop this trend. In fact, we will \ncontinue to be more dependent on foreign oil.\n  I know the White House has sent some communication to Senators saying \nthey oppose even that milestone in the bill which does attempt to try \nto reduce oil consumption. But the provision in the bill doesn't take \ninto effect the fact that the economy grows. I guess it is saying: We \ndon't want to have any goal to actually try to decrease the amount of \nforeign oil coming into this country.\n  I want to have a goal for decreasing the amount of foreign oil coming \ninto this country. I want to reverse the trend. I want to go from what \nwe are expected to have, 68 percent in 2025,\n\n[[Page S6620]]\n\nand say, let's switch that down towards 50. Let's get to 56 percent. \nLet's start doing as the Brazilians did, which is an amazing story, if \nyou think about it. Here is a nation that basically went from 80 \npercent, now, today to 11 percent, and is on the verge of becoming an \nexporter. When you think about the economic opportunities our country \nhas in actually being an exporter of new energy efficiency technology, \nit is a great opportunity.\n  The Senator is right that the administration opposes any goal setting \nin this bill. Why would somebody oppose goal setting? All the tools are \nhere in this legislation. I am not saying which technology is going to \nwin. Basically, our amendment is technology agnostic. It doesn't say: \nYou are going to have CAFE; you are going to have nuclear power.\n  A lot of my colleagues are betting on nuclear power. There is new \nlanguage in here for new nuclear technology. A lot of people think it \nwill provide us hydrogen sources, and we will have hydrogen fuel cells. \nWe will move to having a more fuel-efficient economy that way.\n  I am not being prescriptive because 2025 is a long time from now. But \nI know if we look at specifics, we can get there through these various \nmeans, but we won't get there without a goal.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for a further question, we \ncan't pick up a news magazine or a newspaper in America without reading \nabout the growth of the Chinese economy. They are expanding at the \nexpense of many other countries, including the United States.\n  We have lost hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs over the \nlast 4 years to China as their economy is exploding in size. Many of \nthe companies in China that are growing are American companies. The \nfact is, China is expanding its economy dramatically. It is no longer a \nbackward Communist nation. It is a full-fledged world competitor, and \nmany believe that China and India will be our competitors in the next \n50 years for jobs and economic growth.\n  Is it not also true that China has one problem it has to face, and \nthat is the fact that within the borders, as huge as China is, they \ndon't have a lot of energy resources. So to keep this economy moving \nforward, they need to import energy into China, which means in the \nyears to come, we will see more and more competition for foreign oil, \nnot just the United States versus the rest of the world, but the United \nStates versus China and the rest of the world, which means oil for $50 \nper barrel, which has now raised our price at the pump, may go to $100 \nper barrel.\n  I ask the Senator from Washington, setting this goal of reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil through conservation techniques, through \nalternative fuels, through finding environmentally sensitive resources \nthat we can use, is that not looking forward to the kind of global \ncompetition we are going to face and accepting the reality that if we \ndon't do this as a nation, we will find ourselves losing out from a \nsecurity viewpoint as well as global competition with nations such as \nChina?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The Senator from Illinois brings up an important \nquestion, which is with China's interest in global oil supply and the \ndemand, is it going to drive up the price. I don't think an oil company \nreally cares whether the price of oil is driven up or not. What do they \ncare?\n  Somebody is going to pay them, whether it is $50, $55, $60, $80, or \n$100. With an increase in demand, that is good news for them. Oil \nsupply costs just go up. They reap the benefits; they reap the profit. \nBut what it is not good for is the American economy.\n  So the Senator is absolutely right, China's entrance into the demand \nfor foreign oil should be seen by this country as an economic and \nsecurity risk. China's consumption and growth rate is staggering. China \nis going to be consuming I think I said 8 million barrels of imports. \nThey have already overtaken Japan, and they are fast on our heels to \ncatch up to our consumption, and they will get to a point where they \nare the 800-pound gorilla in the dynamics of world oil supply.\n  Even our underlying bill says you can try to ramp up different \nsources of U.S. production. But we all know with the United States \nbeing situated on 3 percent of the world's oil reserves, it is not a \nlikely scenario for us in the United States to be able to drill our way \nto energy security. So the Senator is right, China is a unique concern \nin this. We ought to take that, along with the other national security \nfactors, and the fact that the oil supply is located primarily in these \nMiddle Eastern countries--if we can put the chart back up there. If you \nlook at where the supply is already, the countries and state ownership, \nthat is already worrisome enough. Now, when you throw into the equation \nthat China is going to be demanding more supply from these entities, it \nis going to lead to a higher price. I am not sure any of these \ncountries are worried about the U.S. consumer and what they have to pay \nfor transportation costs. I don't think they are responsive to the \nneeds of U.S. consumers. The United States might be responsive to our \nown consumers if we were the owner of these companies, but we are not.\n  So this is about setting a national goal that recognizes the hardship \nthe American economy is going to encounter, and that we are going to be \nunder in the future if we continue to pay these prices. We might, in 10 \nyears, be happy we were talking about $50 a barrel prices, if some of \nthe expectations of Wall Street come to pass--the predictions that we \ncould see superspikes and get to $100 a barrel. We are already feeling \nthe pain now. Americans are losing jobs, pensions, like the pensions of \ntransportation workers, where there are issues because of high fuel \ncosts; and people are curtailing economic activity because of high \ntransportation costs. We ought to take the Chinese part of the equation \nand realize this goal needs to be set and we need to make it a reality, \njust as we did to reach the goal of putting a man on the Moon.\n  My colleague from Tennessee is also on the floor. I want to give him \nan opportunity to add whatever comments he wants to add about this.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 784\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I call up my amendment at the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Ms. Cantwell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 784.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To improve the energy security of the United States and \nreduce United States dependence on foreign oil imports by 40 percent by \n                                 2025)\n\n       Beginning on page 120, strike line 23 and all that follows \n     through page 122, line 14, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 151. REDUCTION OF DEPENDENCE ON IMPORTED PETROLEUM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) based on the reports of the Energy Information \n     Administration entitled ``Annual Energy Outlook 2005'' and \n     ``May 2005 Monthly Energy Review''--\n       (A) during the period beginning January 1, 2005, and ending \n     April 30, 2005, the United States imported an estimated \n     average of 13,056,000 barrels of oil per day; and\n       (B) the United States is projected to import 19,110,000 \n     barrels of oil per day in 2025;\n       (2) technology solutions already exist to dramatically \n     increase the productivity of the United States energy supply;\n       (3) energy efficiency and conservation measures can improve \n     the economic competitiveness of the United States and lessen \n     energy costs for families in the United States;\n       (4) United States dependence on foreign energy imports \n     leaves the United States vulnerable to energy supply shocks \n     and reliant on the willingness of other countries to provide \n     sufficient supplies of oil;\n       (5) while only 3 percent of proven oil reserves are located \n     in territory controlled by the United States, advances in \n     fossil fuel extraction techniques and technologies could \n     increase United States energy supplies; and\n       (6) reducing energy consumption also benefits the United \n     States by lowering the environmental impacts associated with \n     fossil fuel use.\n       (b) Goal.--It is a goal of the United States to reduce by \n     40 percent the amount of foreign oil projected to be imported \n     during calendar year 2025 in the reference case contained in \n     the report of the Energy Information Administration entitled \n     ``Annual Energy Outlook 2005''.\n       (c) Measures To Reduce Import Dependence.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and every two years thereafter, the \n     President shall--\n\n[[Page S6621]]\n\n       (A) develop and implement measures to reduce dependence on \n     foreign petroleum imports of the United States by reducing \n     petroleum in end-uses throughout the economy of the United \n     States sufficient to reduce total demand for petroleum in the \n     United States by 1,000,000 barrels per day from the amount \n     projected for calendar year 2015; and\n       (B)(i) subject to clause (ii), develop and implement \n     measures to reduce dependence on foreign petroleum imports of \n     the United States by reducing petroleum in end-uses \n     throughout the economy of the United States sufficient to \n     reduce total demand for petroeum in the United States by \n     7,640,000 barrels per day from the amount projected for \n     calendar year 2025.\n       (ii) If the President determines that there are \n     insufficient legal authorities to achieve the target for \n     calendar year 2025 in clause (i), the President shall develop \n     and implement measures that will reduce dependence on foreign \n     petroleum imports of the United States by reducing petroleum \n     in end-uses throughout the economy of the United States to \n     the maximum extent practicable and shall submit to Congress \n     proposed legislation or other recommendations to achieve the \n     target.\n       (2) Requirements.--In developing measures under paragraph \n     (1), the President shall--\n       (A) ensure continued reliable and affordable energy for the \n     United States, consistent with the creation of jobs and \n     economic growth and maintaining the international \n     competitiveness of United States businesses, including the \n     manufacturing sector; and\n       (B) implement measures under paragraph (1) under existing \n     authorities of the appropriate Federal agencies, as \n     determined by the President.\n       (3) Projections.--The projections for total demand for \n     petroleum in the United States under paragraph (1) shall be \n     those contained in the Reference Case in the report of the \n     Energy Information Administration entitled ``Annual Energy \n     Outlook 2005''.\n       (d) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the President \n     shall submit to Congress a report, based on the most recent \n     edition of the Annual Energy Outlook published by the Energy \n     Information Administration, assessing the progress made by \n     the United States toward the goal of reducing dependence on \n     imported petroleum sources by 2025.\n       (2) Contents.--The report under paragraph (1) shall--\n       (A) identify the status of efforts to meet the goal \n     described in subsection (b);\n       (B) assess the effectiveness of any measure implemented \n     under subsection (c) during the previous fiscal year in \n     meeting the goal described in subsection (b); and\n       (C) describe plans to develop additional measures to meet \n     the goal.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I know there are many Members who want \nto speak. I ask unanimous consent that Senators Feinstein and Reid be \nadded as cosponsors of the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe Senator from Tennessee, Senator Kerry be recognized to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nher contribution to the debate today and for her contribution to the \ndebate in our committee process.\n  While it may seem like ``inside baseball'' to those outside the \nSenate, the process here is very important. We don't get anywhere \nunless we have some sort of consensus. That is the way this body \noperates. So far, over the last several years, we have not had a \nconsensus on energy. I thought the Senator from Washington, at the \nclose of our committee markup proceedings a couple of weeks ago, made a \nvery important comment. She said this was a clean energy bill, but she \nsaid it also was a clean process. She was referring to the fact that \nboth Senator Domenici, the Republican chairman, and Senator Bingaman, \nthe Democratic ranking member on the committee, have been working \ntogether to try to identify areas of consensus.\n  Senator Domenici literally set out on that by going from office to \noffice on the Democratic side and on the Republican side to see what he \ncould do. We all had our say. We didn't all get our way in those \nproceedings, but we had long hearings on gas, we had long hearings on \ncoal, and we had much discussion of renewable energy. In the end, we \nreported to this body a piece of legislation with a vote of 21 to 1. \nThere was only one dissenting vote.\n  The Senator from Washington made an important contribution to that \ndiscussion, as she did today, with her discussion of biodiesel, which \nis a promising renewable fuel. It is in its infancy. We don't know how \nfar it will go. Biodiesel has only contributed about 2 percent of all \nof the fuel we use in the United States today. We have to always \nremember what a huge economy we have and how long and how much it takes \nto turn it around. But she offered an amendment that the committee \nadopted and which was included in the bill now before us. It has as \npart of the mandate for use of renewable fuels biodiesel.\n  The Senate, by a large vote a few minutes ago included, I believe, an \n8 billion gallon standard for renewable fuels. So she made an important \ncontribution. And the spirit of our discussion so far has been that we \nrecognize the urgency of the issue we are talking about, which is blue-\ncollar workers, homeowners, keeping jobs from moving overseas, and that \nthis is serious business and we need to get it right.\n  I will make some observations about the Senator's amendment. There \nwill be three observations. One is I respectfully suggest she has the \nwrong goal for the near term. Two, I suggest the bill we have before us \nactually presents an excellent, balanced approach toward what we need \nto do. Three, I will reemphasize the importance of not just reducing \nour dependence on oil, the growth of our dependence on oil in the \nUnited States--that is the goal, I believe--but lowering the price of \nnatural gas for the benefit of blue-collar workers, homeowners, and \nfarmers. That is the point.\n  The Senator talked about President Kennedy and probably the most \ncelebrated goal of the last 100 years--certainly one of the most \ncelebrated in our history, and very much in keeping with the American \nspirit and character. We are always setting high goals, such as \n``anything is possible'' and ``all men are created equal'' and ``we \nwill pay any price and bear any burden to defend freedom.'' A lot of \nour politics is about the disappointment of not reaching those goals. \nIn fact, most of American history is the story of setting high goals, \nmissing them, being disappointed, and recommitting ourselves to the \ngoals. But the goals we remember and the leaders we remember are the \nones who have challenged us within some reason. We used to have a \nwonderful citizen of Tennessee named Chet Atkins, who played the \nguitar. He may have been the best guitar player in the world. He always \nsaid: In this life, you have to be mighty careful where you aim, \nbecause you are likely to get there.\n  I don't think we would have remembered President Kennedy as well if \nhe had said in 1960 that we need to put a man on Mars by 1970, or a man \non Jupiter by 1970. President Kennedy didn't say that. That would have \nbeen far outside of our reach. Our scientists knew that, but it was \nwithin our reach to go to the Moon. He said that and challenged us, and \nwe figured out the details of doing it.\n  I suggest the goal of the Senator from Washington would be like \nputting a man on Mars. It is out on another planet, it is somewhere out \nthere. It might be the right goal one day, but we have to go to the \nMoon before we go to Mars. I suggest her goal is the wrong goal. The \nSenator suggests that the United States, over the next 20 years, reduce \nits dependence on foreign oil by 40 percent. That sounds pretty good, \nlike going to Mars might have sounded pretty good in 1960, but we would \nnever have gotten there. Let me try to put her goal in perspective.\n\n  She says get rid of 7.6. We use about 20 million barrels of oil a day \nin the United States. It supplies about 40 percent of all of our \nenergy. The Energy Committee, including the Senator from Washington, \nconsidered all of this, and we came to a consensus that we should look \nfor wherever the Moon might be in this goal. And we said: Let's save 1 \nmillion a day. Let's ask the President to save 1 million a day by the \nyear 2015, 1 million of that 20 million.\n  That million is a pretty big number. Drilling for oil in ANWR, which \nwe argued so heavily in this body, would produce about 1 million \nbarrels of oil a day. If I am not mistaken, if we were to adopt the \nCAFE standards legislation that Senator Cantwell herself suggested in \nearlier debates, that would have saved about 1 million barrels of oil a \nday. But she is saying 7.6 million barrels of oil a day over the next \n20 years.\n  I agree it might be possible to go higher than 1 million barrels of \noil a\n\n[[Page S6622]]\n\nday. Senator Johnson and I introduced the National Gas Price Reduction \nAct of 2005 earlier this year. We had in that an oil savings amendment \nof 1.75 million barrels of oil a day.\n  All these amendments direct the President to figure out a plan for \ndoing this and then to implement it. These are not just idle \nsuggestions.\n  I think there is a consensus in this body, certainly on this side and \nthat side of the aisle, and I might say, as Senator Bingaman mentioned, \nwe did not really vote Republican and Democrat in our committee \nhearings. We had a lot of votes, but they generally split on our \nindividual views and regions, not whether we are a Republican or a \nDemocrat. I think there is still a consensus here. Of course, we want \nto reduce the growth of our dependence on oil, but to say our goal \nshould be to reduce by 40 percent in 20 years our reliance on oil is \nsomewhere out on another planet, not within our reach.\n  Many of us have been reading very carefully the National Commission \non Energy Policy report called ``Ending the Energy Stalemate, A \nBipartisan Strategy to Meet America's Energy Challenges,'' that \nincludes within it a broad variety of people--Mr. Holdren, Bill Reilly, \nMr. Rowe from Exelon Corporation, a representative from the United \nSteelworkers. We all read it, and I suppose we all like the parts we \nagree with and try to agree with some things that may have changed our \nmind. Here is what this commission report, which is an excellent \nreport, says about oil:\n\n       Over the last 30 years, the United States has sought to \n     improve oil security by promoting a greater diversity of \n     world oil suppliers, reducing domestic consumption through a \n     substantial increase in new passenger fuel economy between \n     1975 and 1987, and creating the largest dedicated strategic \n     petroleum reserve in the world. Due to these policies and as \n     a result of structural shifts, the U.S. economy today is less \n     oil-intensive and therefore less vulnerable to oil price \n     shocks than it was in 1970. The fact that oil imports have \n     nonetheless steadily increased since that time suggests that \n     calls for energy independence--while rhetorically seductive--\n     represent the wrong focus for the U.S. energy policy.\n\n  To try to get another example of the practical effect of the \namendment of the Senator from Washington, we asked the Energy \nDepartment to take a look at it. Here is what they said. Remember, the \nCantwell energy security amendment calls for a 7.64-million-barrel-per-\nday reduction in oil consumption over the next 20 years. EIA, the \nEnergy Information Administration, which looks at all these things, \nestimated that by a combination of policies outside the transportation \nsector, the upper limit of what we could do in this country would be 2 \nto 3 million barrels of oil per day.\n  So we take out 2 or 3 million barrels of oil a day and let's say that \nleaves 4.5 million barrels oil per day. The Cantwell amendment would \nrequire the President to, therefore, impose on the transportation \nsector of our economy this achievement, and here is what it would \ntranslate to in terms of a CAFE standard miles per gallon. It would \nrequire a 78.6-mile-per-gallon CAFE standard. That is a 185-percent \nincrease over today's standard. And it would require 60.8 miles per \ngallon for light trucks. That is a 174-percent increase.\n  I submit that is putting a man on Mars instead of a man on the Moon. \nThat is somewhere off on another planet and not anything that we could \nreasonably do. The effect of enforcing that on the American economy \nwould be to destroy jobs and raise fuel prices and raise expectations \nand disappoint the people who sent us here.\n  I much prefer the approach the committee bill takes that came out of \nthe committee 21 to 1, with a very broad consensus. I will admit, we \nall recognized, when that came out, that we would reserve for debate on \nthe floor some of the more contentious issues, such as MTBE, global \nwarming, CAFE standards, and the size of the oil savings \namendment, about which we are talking today.\n\n  We said 1 million a day. That is what the committee could agree on. I \nand Senator Johnson thought 1.75. Senator Cantwell is at 7.6, and that \nis the wrong goal.\n  What would the right goal be? The right goal is to say, of course, we \nwant to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It makes no sense \nwhatsoever for us to rely for so much of our oil on an area of the \nworld where men and women are getting blown up every day, including a \ngreat many Americans. It makes no sense whatsoever.\n  So our goal should be this: Putting us on the path to a steady supply \nof low-cost, adequate, American-produced clean energy--low-cost, \nadequate supply of American-produced clean energy. As we do that, we \nreduce our reliance on all oil. We reduce our reliance on oil not just \nfrom around the world but from this country.\n  Here would be some of the things that are already underway in this \nbill. As I mentioned, we just adopted an 8-billion-gallon requirement \nfor renewable fuels. Personally, I think that is a little high. That is \nstretching the limit. I believe the House of Representatives is at 5. \nRemember, only at 2 percent of all of our energy is renewable fuels. So \nwe have done that.\n  We have in our bill which is before the Senate research for biofuels, \nabout which the Senator from Washington talks. They are very important, \nbut they are minuscule at this time. We have a way to go. There are \nsome associated waste problems that occur with them, and there are \nproduction problems about which we have to think. To produce large-\nscale biodiesel fuel requires large areas of land. We have to think \nabout that as well. Clearly, we should do it in this bill, which \nsupports research for that.\n  If we are really serious about reducing our demand for overseas oil, \nthen we should start with efficiency and conservation in the United \nStates, both of oil and natural gas because they often come together. \nAnd so the provisions in this legislation, twice as strong as last \nyear's Energy bill, provide for efficiency and conservation standards \nfor such items as appliance efficiency standards. It would avoid \nbuilding 45 natural gas powerplants of 500 megawatts each and save \nbillions of dollars.\n  This legislation also includes a 4-year national consumer education \nprogram which, when used in California, helped produce a 10-percent cut \nin peak demand. This is natural gas we are talking about. But we are \ntalking about conserving energy, and oil and gas often are found \ntogether.\n  If we were to add a provision, as I tried to do in the committee, and \nas I would welcome the Senator from Washington helping me do on the \nfloor as we debate this bill, to encourage utilities to use first the \nelectricity most efficiently produced from natural gas, we could save \nand conserve even more. Add that to the oil savings amendment of 1 \nmillion barrels of oil per day, which is in our legislation, which is \nabout the same as the amount of oil produced onshore in the State of \nTexas, and then add on top of the provisions that are in the Finance \nCommittee's mark that would continue the deduction for American \nconsumers to purchase hybrid, and I would hope advanced diesel vehicles \nas well, that saves oil, that gives an incentive, that helps to change \nthe market in a very promising way without a mandate. If we include the \nprovision that is also in this legislation that supports discouraging \nlarge trucks from running their motors all night long so they can have \ntheir air-conditioning on and their TV on and their appliances on, one \nmay think that is a small potatoes item, but it is actually a big \npotatoes item. Big trucks are a big part of our energy use in the \nUnited States. They are a big part of our air pollution in the United \nStates. When we encourage them to plug into a battery instead of \nleaving their trucks on, we are using less oil. All of this is a well-\nbalanced approach.\n  So it is my respectful suggestion that we remember President Kennedy \nfor saying, Let us go to the Moon. We would not remember him as well if \nhe had said, Let us put a man on Mars in 1970. I believe the committee \napproach is the right goal and is the right balance and much more \nrealistic than the goal of the Senator from Washington State which, \naccording to the Energy Department, would produce a CAFE standard of 78 \nmiles per gallon for cars and 60.8 miles per gallon for light trucks.\n  I conclude by making a general remark about natural gas and other \naspects of how we ought to be producing energy in this country. One \nimportant part of it is American-produced. That is what the Senator \nfrom Washington\n\n[[Page S6623]]\n\nis emphasizing with her amendment. Another important part is low cost. \nAnother important part is reliable and adequate supply.\n  We use 25 percent of all the energy in the world in the United States \nof America. We spend $2,500 per person on it. Another important part is \nclean air. This is not the clean air debate, but it is the debate that \nwill solve the clean air problem, in my opinion, because clean air and \nclean energy are so intricately related.\n  The legislation that is before this Senate begins with conservation \nand efficiency. That reduces our demand for oil, as well as natural \ngas, and helps to lower prices at least of natural gas. It goes next to \nincreasing supply of natural gas, and I would say oil.\n  Listening to the Senator from Washington, she is saying we need to \nreduce our demand for oil from overseas, and since it is unrealistic to \nthink we could save this much oil in that 20-year period of time, that \nwould suggest to me that she would be advocating a big increase in \nsupply of oil as well as natural gas from domestic sources in the \nUnited States.\n  In the legislation that Senator Johnson and I offered, we recommended \nthat. It recommended that we look onshore and offshore for new supplies \nof natural gas as well as oil in the Rocky Mountain area and offshore. \nWell, that has been greeted with a very cold gaze by many Members of \nthis body, including some who have created objections to unanimous \nconsent agreements just to stop us from even considering increasing our \nexploration for drilling the large amount of oil and gas that we have \njust offshore, even though we could put the rigs far out to sea where \nno one could see them.\n  It would seem to me as we are talking about oil savings, if we want \nto keep prices down in the United States and keep jobs here, we need to \ntalk about oil and gas supply at the same time coming from the United \nStates. I did not hear very much about that.\n  We also need to hear more about LNG. I am speaking now of natural \ngas, which is an essential part of this debate. Many in the Senate \noften talk about gasoline prices. The truth is, as the Senator from \nWashington accurately observed, there is a huge demand for oil. Prices \nare going to stay up for the foreseeable future, that is the truth \nabout it in terms of gasoline, and we need to learn to reduce our use \nof the oil. The one thing we can do is lower the cost of natural gas, \nwhich is a big part of this bill. That affects millions of blue-collar \nworkers, millions of farmers, and tens of millions of homeowners.\n  We have gone from having the lowest priced natural gas to the highest \nprice natural gas, and this is outsourcing jobs, putting farmers out of \nbusiness, and making home heating and cooling prices too high.\n  If we are going to reduce the price and conservation does not do it, \nthe next best step is to import some from overseas. That goes directly \nin the face of what the Senator is talking about to reduce our supply \nof natural gas. If we do not import liquefied natural gas from \noverseas, we are going to be exporting jobs from America to overseas. \nSo we can either import natural gas or export American jobs. We have to \nbe realistic in the near term in what we have to do.\n\n  I would hope that we could drill offshore and drill in the United \nStates and use the extensive amounts of natural gas we have and bring \ndown the price that way. But if we are not going to do it that way we \nare going to have to bring it in from overseas at least for a while \nuntil we have an alternative form of energy.\n  When we talk about alternative forms of energy, we often go to the \nrenewable fuels, and I will talk about those more in a moment. I am \njust as excited about those as anybody. We have in Memphis a Sharp \nplan, for example, that produces solar energy. They have exciting new \ntechnologies. In the Oakridge National Laboratory we have a whole \ndivision on renewable energy and renewable fuels. They have exciting \nnew technologies in solar. That is only 2 percent of our energy and 2 \npercent of our fuels. We have to be realistic about where we are going \nfrom there.\n  Where are we going to get the energy we need that will create this \nadequate supply of American-produced clean energy? After conservation, \nafter new supply, we have to come to nuclear power. I suggest if we \nwant to talk about American independence, we talk about nuclear power, \nthat we do what France is doing. They are 80 percent nuclear power. We \nshould do what Japan is doing. They are adding a nuclear powerplant \nevery year. We invented the technology. We have used it without \nincident for more than half a century in our Navy. We produce 20 \npercent of our electricity today from nuclear power and 70 percent of \nour carbon-free electricity comes from nuclear power.\n  So if we really want American-produced energy, we need to build \nadvanced nuclear powerplants so that we can have them at a cost that \nmakes us less reliant on oil and gas from overseas.\n  Waiting in the wings and right behind nuclear power is coal \ngasification and carbon sequestration. I see the Senator from North \nDakota on the Senate floor. He has been a leader in that area for a \nlong time. He talks about it a lot and talks about it clearly. That \ntechnology is not completely with us yet. We know how to do coal \ngasification; that is, turn coal into gas and then gas into \nelectricity. That gets rid of mercury, nitrogen, and hydrogen by and \nlarge. It still leaves carbon in the air, but there is a technology \ncalled carbon sequestration. We are a few years away from that, but if \nwe accelerate research on carbon sequestration that would be a good \ngoal.\n  Then we can burn the coal we have in the United States, and we have a \n400- or 500-year supply of it. We are the Saudi Arabia of coal. \nConservation plus our own supply of natural gas, plus nuclear power, \nplus coal gasification and carbon sequestration would fuel this great \nbig economy.\n  One might ask, what does that have to do with automobiles? Well, \nhopefully, by that time we will also have invested a lot of money in \nresearch and development--not just for nuclear power, not just for \ncarbon sequestration, but also for hydrogen, which the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is a leading spokesman for, and for fusion. When we get to \nhydrogen and these hybrid cars that we see being driven around America \ntoday--a gasoline engine with an electric engine, that is called a \nhybrid--when that hybrid becomes an electric engine and a hydrogen \nengine, then we have to have some way to make that hydrogen. We are \neither going to import oil and gas from overseas as we are doing it \nnow, we are going to supply it from our own reserves, we are going to \nconserve enough, we are going to make it from nuclear, or we are going \nto make it from coal gasification.\n  I am glad we are having a debate about American energy independence. \nJust as President Kennedy is remembered for having the right goal by \nsaying, Let us put a man on the Moon, and not for picking an \nunrealistic goal in 1960 and saying, Let us put a man on Mars in 1970, \nlet's be realistic. Our bill stretches our country, causes us to aim \ndifferently, and if adopted will transform the way we produce \nelectricity and will increase our independence on foreign sources of \ngas and oil.\n  One last thought about renewable fuels, before I finish. We need to \nkeep that in perspective. If we were a small country, we might be able \nto rely on renewable fuels or renewable energy, but we are not. We are \na country that uses 25 percent of all the energy in the world. Stretch \nas we might, for the foreseeable future we are going to have to rely on \nconservation, on our own supplies of oil and gas, and, yes, on some oil \nand gas from around the world. Then we are going to have to invest in \nan incredibly aggressive way in advanced nuclear technology and \nadvanced coal gasification and carbon sequestration technology if we \nare going to have a reliable, low-cost power of American-produced clean \nenergy.\n  I hope the Senate will prefer the committee report which was adopted \nby 21 to 1, that includes a balanced approach to the right goal. I \nwould say it is more in keeping with President Kennedy's ``man on the \nMoon'' goal. This is a ``man or woman on Mars'' goal, and maybe we will \nget there one day, but it is unrealistic today. It would be disruptive \nof jobs if you set a 78 mile per gallon CAFE standard for cars, a 185-\npercent increase; a 60 mile per gallon standard for trucks, light \ntrucks, a 174-percent increase. I hope we will stick\n\n[[Page S6624]]\n\nwith the consensus that passed 21 to 1, and one day we might also reach \nthis goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for \nhis comments and for his diligence in following energy policy both on \nthe committee and on the floor. I know he cares greatly about this \nissue and has spent many hours on the details in various sections of \nthis legislation. I appreciate his interest and unique focus on clean \ncoal technology. He has great interest and knowledge about clean coal \ntechnology, and has articulated his views about that numerous times.\n  I know my colleague from North Dakota is here so I want to give him \nan opportunity to talk, but I want to respond. The 7 million barrels \nreduction is an achievable goal. If you believe in the underlying \ntechnology the Senator from Tennessee just discussed, which is the \nvarious ways we can get to that goal, he and I are in agreement. Where \nwe seem to be in a disagreement is whether we want to set this goal. I \nbelieve the American people deserve to have a goal set that is \nachievable.\n  The underlying bill that says in 2015 we will be more dependent on \nforeign oil than we are today doesn't seem the goal we should be \nputting forth. While the committee passed that out of committee, we \nknew we were going to come out here and discuss a variety of issues. \nNow that we have the perspective of the entire bill with a lot of \ndifferent technology solutions, I would say it is time for the Senate \nto be more bold about this.\n  I commend to my colleagues this report, ``Securing America; Solving \nOur Oil Dependence Through Innovation.'' There are two different \norganizations, the NRDC and the IAGCS, that basically outline in their \nreport how we can save close to 7 billion barrels of oil per day.\n  We have a submittal to the Record from the Committee on the Present \nDanger, on our oil security. It, too, talks about how we can achieve \nthis goal and what some of the sources are.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    A Committee on the Present Danger Policy Paper: Oil and Security\n\n               (By George P. Shultz and R. James Woolsey)\n\n\n                                SUMMARY\n\n       This paper could well be called, ``It's the Batteries, \n     Stupid.'' Four years ago, on the eve of 9/11, the need to \n     reduce radically our reliance on oil was not clear to many \n     and in any case the path of doing so seemed a long and \n     difficult one. Today both assumptions are being undermined by \n     the risks of the post-9/11 world and by technological \n     progress in fuel efficiency and alternative fuels.\n       We spell out below the risks of petroleum dependency, \n     particularly the vulnerability of the petroleum \n     infrastructure in the Middle East to terrorist attack--a \n     single well-designed attack could send oil to well over $100/\n     barrel and devastate the world's economy. That reality, among \n     other risks, and the fact that our current transportation \n     infrastructure is locked in to oil, should be sufficient to \n     convince any objective observer that oil dependence, today \n     creates serious and pressing dangers for the US and other \n     oil-importing nations.\n       We propose in this paper that the government vigorously \n     encourage and support at least six technologies: two types of \n     alternative fuels that are beginning to come into the market \n     (cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel derived from a wide range \n     of waste streams), two types of fuel efficient vehicles that \n     are now being sold to the public in some volume (hybrid \n     gasoline-electric and modern clean diesels), and one vehicle \n     construction technique, the use of manufactured carbon-carbon \n     composites, that is now being used for aircraft and racing \n     cars and is quite promising as a way of reducing vehicle \n     weight and fuel requirements while improving safety.\n       The sixth technology, battery improvement to permit ``plug-\n     in'' hybrid vehicles, will require some development--although \n     nothing like the years that will be required for hydrogen \n     fuel cells. It holds, however, remarkable promise. Improving \n     batteries to permit them, to be given an added charge when a \n     hybrid is garaged, ordinarily at night, can substantially \n     improve mileage, because it can permit hybrids to use battery \n     power alone for the first 10-30 miles. Since a great many \n     trips fall within this range this can improve the mileage of \n     a hybrid vehicle from, say, 50 mpg to over 100 mpg (of oil \n     products). Also, since the average residential electricity \n     cost is 8.5 cents/kwh (and in many areas, off-peak nighttime \n     cost is 2-4 cents/kwh) this means that much of a plug-in \n     hybrid's travel would be on the equivalent of 50 cent/gallon \n     gasoline (or, off-peak, on the equivalent of 12-25 cent/\n     gallon gasoline).\n       A plug-in hybrid averaging 125 mpg, if its fuel tank \n     contains 85 per cent cellulosic ethanol, would be obtaining \n     about 500 mpg. If it were constructed from carbon composites \n     the mileage could double, and, if it were a diesel and \n     powered by biodiesel derived from waste, it would be using no \n     oil products at all.\n       What are we waiting for?\n       There are at least seven major reasons why dependence on \n     petroleum and its products for the lion's share of the \n     world's transportation fuel creates special dangers in our \n     time. These dangers are all driven by rigidities and \n     potential vulnerabilities that have become serious problems \n     because of the geopolitical realities of the early 21st \n     century. Those who reason about these issues solely on the \n     basis of abstract economic models that are designed to ignore \n     such geopolitical realities will find much to disagree with \n     in what follows. Although such models have utility in \n     assessing the importance of more or less purely economic \n     factors in the long run, as Lord Keynes famously remarked: \n     ``In the long run, we are all dead.''\n       These dangers in turn give rise to two proposed directions \n     for government policy in order to reduce our vulnerability \n     rapidly. In both cases we believe that existing technology \n     should be used, i.e. technology that is already in the market \n     or can be so in the very near future and that is compatible \n     with the existing transportation infrastructure. To this end \n     government policies in the United States and other oil-\n     importing countries should: (1) encourage a shift to \n     substantially more fuel-efficient vehicles, including \n     fostering battery development for plug-in hybrid vehicles; \n     and (2) encourage biofuels and other alternative fuels \n     that wherever possible can be derived from waste products.\n\n\n                   PETROLEUM DEPENDENCE: THE DANGERS\n\n       This fact substantially increases the difficulty of \n     responding to oil price increases or disruptions in supply by \n     substituting other fuels.\n       There is a range of fuels that can be used to produce \n     electricity and heat and that can be used for other \n     industrial uses, but petroleum had its products dominate the \n     fuel market for vehicular transportation. With the important \n     exception, described below, of a plug-in version of the \n     hybrid gasoline/electric vehicle, which will allow recharging \n     hybrids from the electricity grid, substituting other fuels \n     for petroleum in the vehicle fleet as a whole has generally \n     required major, time-consuming, and expensive infrastructure \n     changes. One exception has been some use of liquifed natural \n     gas (LNG) and other fuels for fleets of buses or delivery \n     vehicles, although not substantially for privately-owned \n     ones, and the use of corn-derived ethanol mixed with gasoline \n     in proportions up to 10 per cent ethanol (``gasohol'') in \n     some states. Neither has appreciably affected petroleum's \n     dominance of the transportation fuel market.\n       Although there are imaginative proposals for transitioning \n     to other fuels, such as hydrogen to power automotive fuel \n     cells, this would require major infrastructure investment and \n     restructuring. If privately-owned fuel cell vehicles were to \n     be capable of being readily refueled, this would require \n     reformers (equipment capable of reforming, say, natural gas \n     into hydrogen) to be located at filling stations, and for \n     natural gas to be available there as a hydrogen feed-stock. \n     So, not only would fuel cell development and technology for \n     storing hydrogen on vehicles need to be further developed, \n     but the automobile industry's development and production of \n     fuel cells also would need to be coordinated with the energy \n     industry's deployment of reformers and the fuel for them.\n       Moving toward automotive fuel cells thus requires us to \n     face a huge question of pace and coordination of large-scale \n     changes by both the automotive and energy industries. This \n     poses a sort of industrial Alphonse and Gaston dilemma: who \n     goes through the door first? (If, instead, it were decided \n     that existing fuels such as gasoline were to be reformed into \n     hydrogen on board vehicles instead of at filling stations, \n     this would require on-board reformers to be developed and \n     added to the fuel cell vehicles themselves--a very \n     substantial undertaking.)\n       It is because of such complications at the National \n     Commission on Energy Policy concluded in its December, 2004, \n     report ``Ending The Energy Stalemate'' (``ETES'') that \n     ``hydrogen offers little to no potential to improve oil \n     security and reduce climate change risks in the next twenty \n     years.'' (p. 72)\n       To have an impact on our vulnerabilities within the next \n     decade or two, any competitor of oil-derived fuels will need \n     to be compatible with the existing energy infrastructure and \n     require only modest additions or amendments to it.\n       2. The Greater Middle East will continue to be the low-cost \n     and dominant petroleum producer for the foreseeable future.\n       Home of around two-thirds of the world's proven reserves of \n     conventional oil--45% of it in just Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and \n     Iran--the Greater Middle East will inevitably have to meet a \n     growing percentage of world oil demand. This demand is \n     expected to increase by more than 50 per cent in the next two \n     decades, from 78 million barrels per day (``MBD'') in 2002 to \n     118 MBD in 2025, according to the federal Energy Information \n     Administration. Much of this will come from expected demand \n     growth in China and India. One need not argue that world oil \n     production\n\n[[Page S6625]]\n\n     has peaked to see that this puts substantial strain on the \n     global oil system. It will mean higher prices and potential \n     supply disruptions and will put considerable leverage in the \n     hands of governments in the Greater Middle East as well as in \n     those of other oil-exporting states which have not been \n     marked recently by stability and certainty: Russia, \n     Venezuela, and Nigeria, for example (ETES pp. 1-2). Deep-\n     water drilling and other opportunities for increases in \n     supply of conventional oil may provide important increases in \n     supply but are unlikely to change this basic picture.\n       Even if other production comes on line, e.g. from \n     unconventional sources such as tar sands in Alberta or shale \n     in the American West, their relatively high cost of \n     production could permit low-cost producers, particularly \n     Saudi Arabia, to increase production, drop prices for a time, \n     and undermine the economic viability of the higher-cost \n     competitors, as occurred in the mid-1980's. For the \n     foreseeable future, as long as vehicular transportation is \n     dominated by oil as it is today, the Greater Middle East, and \n     especially Saudi Arabia, will remain in the driver's seat.\n       3. The petroleum infrastructure is highly vulnerable to \n     terrorist and other attacks.\n       The radical Islamist movement, including but not \n     exclusively al Qaeda, has on a number of occasions explicitly \n     called for worldwide attacks on the petroleum infrastructre \n     and has carried some out in the Greater Middle East. A more \n     well-planned attack than what has occurred to date--such as \n     that set out in the opening pages of Robert Baer's recent \n     book, Sleeping With the Devil, (terrorists flying an aircraft \n     into the unique sulfur-cleaning towers in northeastern Saudi \n     Arabia)--could take some six million barrels per day off the \n     market for a year or more, sending petroleum prices sharply \n     upward to well over $100/barrel and severely damaging much of \n     the world's economy. Domestic infrastructure in the West is \n     not immune from such disruption. U.S. refineries, for \n     example, are concentrated in a few places, principally the \n     Gulf Coast. The recent accident in the Texas City refinery--\n     producing multiple fatalities--points out potential \n     infrastuture vulnerabilities. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline has \n     been subject to several amateurish attacks that have taken it \n     briefly out of commission; a seriously planned attack on it \n     could be far more devastating.\n       In view of these overall infrastructure vulnerabilities we \n     do not suggest that policy should focus exclusively on \n     petroleum imports, although such infrastructure \n     vulnerabilities are likely to be the most severe in the \n     Greater Middle East. It is there that terrorists have the \n     easiest access and the largest proportion of proven oil \n     reserves, and low-cost production are also located there. Nor \n     do we hold the view that by changing trade patterns anything \n     particularly is accomplished. To a first approximation there \n     is one worldwide oil market and it is not generally useful \n     for the U.S., for example, to import less from the Greater \n     Middle East and for others then to import more from there. In \n     effect, all of us oil-importing countries are in this \n     together.\n       4. The possibility exists particularly under regimes that \n     could come to power in the Greater Middle East, of embargoes \n     or other disruptions of supply.\n       It is often said that whoever governs the oil-rich nations \n     of the Greater Middle East will need to sell their oil. This \n     is not true, however, if the rulers choose to try to live, \n     for most purposes, in the Seventh century. Bin Laden has \n     advocated, for example, major reductions in oil production.\n       In 1979 there was a serious attempted coup in Saudi Arabia. \n     Much of what the outside world saw was the seizure by \n     Islamist fanatics of the Great Mosque in Mecca, but the \n     effort was more widespread. Even if one is optimistic that \n     democracy and the rule of law will spread in the Greater \n     Middle East and that this will lead after a time to more \n     peaceful and stable societies there, it is undeniable that \n     there is substantial risk that for some time the region will \n     be characterized by chaotic change and unpredictable \n     governmental behavior. Reform, particularly if it is \n     hesitant, has in a number of cases been trumped by radical \n     takeovers (Jacobins, Bolsheviks). There is no reason to \n     believe that the Greater Middle East is immune from these \n     sorts of historic risks.\n       5. Wealth transfers from oil have been used, and continue \n     to be used, to fund terrorism and its ideological support.\n       Estimates of the amount spent by the Saudis in the last 30 \n     years spreading Wahhabi beliefs throughout the world vary \n     from $70 billion to $100 billion. Furthermore, some oil-rich \n     families of the Greater Middle East fund terrorist groups \n     directly. The spread of Wahhabi doctrine--fanatically hostile \n     to Shi'ite and Suffi Muslims, Jews, Christians, women, \n     modernity, and much else--plays a major role with respect to \n     Islamist terrorist groups: a role similar to that played by \n     angry German nationalism with respect to Nazism in the \n     decades after World War I. Not all angry German nationalists \n     became Nazis and not all those schooled in Wahhabi beliefs \n     become terrorists, but in each case the broader doctrine of \n     hatred has provided the soil in which the particular \n     totalitarian movement has grown. Whether in lectures in the \n     madrassas of Pakistan, in textbooks printed by Wahhabis for \n     Indonesian schoolchildren, or on bookshelves of mosques in \n     the U.S., the hatred spread by Wahhabis and funded by oil is \n     evident and influential.\n       It is sometimes contended that we should not seek \n     substitutes for oil because disruption of the flow of funds \n     to the Greater Middle East could further radicalize the \n     population of some states there. The solution, however, \n     surely lies in helping these states diversify their economies \n     over time, not in perpetually acquiescing to the economic \n     rent they collect from oil exports and to the uses to which \n     these revenues are put.\n       6. The Current Account deficits for a number of countries \n     create risks ranging from major world economic disruption to \n     deepening poverty, and could be substantially reduced by \n     reducing oil imports.\n       The U.S., in essence, borrows about $13 billion per week, \n     principally now from major Asian states, to finance its \n     consumption. The single largest category of imports is the \n     $2-3 billion per week borrowed to import oil. The \n     accumulating debt increases the risk of a flight from the \n     dollar or major increases in interest rates. Any such \n     development could have major negative economic consequences \n     for both the U.S. and its trading partners.\n       For developing nations, the service of debt is a major \n     factor in their continued poverty. For many, debt is heavily \n     driven by the need to import oil that at today's oil prices \n     cannot be paid for by sales of agricultural products, \n     textiles, and other typical developing nation exports.\n       If such deficits are to be reduced, however, say by \n     domestic production of substitutes for petroleum, this should \n     be based on recognition of real economic value such as waste \n     cleanup, soil replenishment, or other tangible benefits.\n       7. Global warming gas emissions from manmade sources create \n     at least the risk of climate change.\n       Although the point is not universally accepted, the weight \n     of scientific opinion suggests that global warming gases \n     (GWG) produced by human activity form one important component \n     of potential climate change. Oil products used in \n     transportation provide a major share of U.S. manmade global \n     warming gas emissions.\n\n\n                  THREE PROPOSED DIRECTIONS FOR POLICY\n\n       The above considerations suggest that government policies \n     with respect to the vehicular transportation market should \n     point in the following directions:\n       1. Encourage improved vehicle mileage, using technology now \n     in production.\n       Three currently available technologies stand out to improve \n     vehicle mileage.\n     Diesels\n       First, modern diesel vehicles are coming to be capable of \n     meeting rigorous emission standards (such as Tier 2 standards \n     being introduced into the U.S., 2004-08). In this context it \n     is possible without compromising environmental standards to \n     take advantage of diesels' substantial mileage advantage over \n     gasoline-fueled internal combustion engines.\n       Substantial penetration of diesels into the private vehicle \n     market in Europe is one major reason why the average fleet \n     mileage of such new vehicles is 42 miles per gallon in Europe \n     and only 24 mpg in the U.S. Although the U.S. has, since \n     1981, increased vehicle weight by 24 percent and horsepower \n     by 93 percent, it has essentially improved mileage not at all \n     in that near-quarter century (even though in the 12 years \n     from 1975 to 1987 the U.S. improved the mileage of new \n     vehicles from 15 to 26 mpg).\n     Hybrid Gasoline-Electric\n       Second, hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles now on the market \n     show substantial fuel savings over their conventional \n     counterparts. The National Commission on Energy Policy found \n     that for the four hybrids on the market in December 2004 that \n     had exact counterpart models with conventional gasoline \n     engines, not only were mileage advantages quite significant \n     (10-15 mpg) for the hybrids, but in each case the horsepower \n     of the hybrid was higher than the horsepower of the \n     conventional vehicle. (ETES p. 11) If automobile companies \n     wish to market hybrids by emphasizing hotter performance \n     rather than fuel conservation they can do so, consistent with \n     the facts.\n     Light-Weight Carbon Composite Construction\n       Third, constructing vehicles with inexpensive versions of \n     the carbon fiber composites that have been used for years for \n     aircraft construction can substantially reduce vehicle weight \n     and increase fuel efficiency while at the same time making \n     the vehicle considerably safer than with current construction \n     materials. This is set forth thoroughly in the 2004 report of \n     the Rocky Mountain Institute's Winning the Oil Endgame \n     (``WTOE''). Aerodynamic design can have major importance as \n     well. This breaks the traditional tie between size and \n     safety. Much lighter vehicles, large or small, can be \n     substantially more fuel-efficient and also safer. Such \n     composite use has already been used for automotive \n     construction in Formula 1 race cars and is now being adopted \n     by BMW and other automobile companies. The goal is mass-\n     produced vehicles with 80% of the performance of hand-layup \n     aerospace composites at 20% of the cost. Such construction is \n     expected to approximately double the efficiency of a normal \n     hybrid vehicle without materially affecting manufacturing \n     cost. (WTOE 64-66).\n       2. Encourage the commercialization of alternative \n     transportation fuels that can be available soon, are \n     compatible with existing infrastructure, and can be derived \n     from waste or otherwise produced cheaply.\n     Biomass Ethanol\n       The use of ethanol produced from corn in the U.S. and sugar \n     cane in Brazil has given\n\n[[Page S6626]]\n\n     birth to the commercialization of an alternative fuel that is \n     coming to show substantial promise, particularly as new \n     feedstocks are developed. Some six million vehicles in the \n     U.S. and all vehicles in Brazil other than those that use \n     solely ethanol are capable of using ethanol in mixtures of up \n     to 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline (E-85); these \n     re called Flexible Fuel Vehicles (``FFV'') and require, \n     compared to conventional vehicles, only a somewhat different \n     kind of material for the fuel line and a differently \n     programmed computer chip. The cost of incorporating this \n     feature in new vehicles is trivial. Also, there are no large-\n     scale changes in infrastructure required for ethanol use. It \n     may be shipped in tank cars, and mixing it with gasoline is a \n     simple matter.\n       Although human beings have been producing ethanol, grain \n     alcohol, from sugar and starch for millennia, it is only in \n     recent years that the genetic engineering of biocatalysts has \n     made possible such production from the hemicellulose and \n     cellulose that constitute the substantial majority of the \n     material in most plants. The genetically engineered material \n     is in the biocatalyst only; there is no need for genetically \n     modified plants. Typically the organism that is engineered to \n     digest the C5 sugars freed by the hydrolization of the \n     hemicellulose also produces the enzymes that hydrolyze the \n     cellulose.\n       These developments may be compared in importance to the \n     invention of thermal and catalytic cracking of petroleum in \n     the first decades of the 20th century--processes which made \n     it possible to use a very large share of petroleum to make \n     gasoline rather than the tiny share that was available at the \n     beginning of the century. For example, with such genetically-\n     engineered biocatalysts, it is not only grains of corn but \n     corn cobs and most of the rest of the corn plant that may be \n     used to make ethanol.\n       Such biomass, or cellulosic, ethanol is now likely to see \n     commercial production begin first in a facility of the \n     Canadian company, Iogen, with backing from Shell Oil, at a \n     cost of around $1.30/gallon. The National Renewable Energy \n     Laboratory estimates costs will drop to around $1.07/gallon \n     over the next five years, and the Energy Commission estimates \n     a drop in costs to 67-77 cents/gallon when the process is \n     fully mature (ETES p. 75). The most common feedstocks will \n     likely be agricultural wastes, such as rice straw, or natural \n     grasses such as switchgrass, a variety of prairie grass that \n     is often planted on soil bank land to replenish the soil's \n     fertility. There will be decided financial advantages in \n     using as feedstocks any wastes which carry a tipping fee (a \n     negative cost) to finance disposal: e.g. waste paper, or rice \n     straw, which cannot be left in the fields after harvest \n     because of its silicon content.\n       Old or misstated data are sometimes cited for the \n     proposition that huge amounts of land would have to be \n     introduced into cultivation or taken away from food \n     production in order to have such biomass available for \n     cellulosic ethanol production. This is incorrect. The \n     National Commission on Energy Policy reported in December \n     that, if fleet mileage in the U.S. rises to 40 mpg--somewhat \n     below the current European Union fleet average for new \n     vehicles of 42 mpg and well below the current Japanese \n     average of 47 mpg--then as switchgrass yields improve \n     modestly to around 10 tons/acre it would take only 30 million \n     acres of land to produce sufficient cellulosic ethanol to \n     fuel half the U.S. passenger fleet. (ETES pp. 76-77). By way \n     of calibration, this would essentially eliminate the need for \n     oil import for passenger vehicle fuel and would require only \n     the amount of land now in the soil bank (the Conservation \n     Reserve Program (``CRP'') on which such soil-restoring \n     crops as switchgrass are already being grown. Practically \n     speaking, one would probably use for ethanol production \n     only a little over half of the soil bank lands and add to \n     this some portion of the plants now grown as animal feed \n     crops (for example, on the 70 million acres that now grow \n     soybeans for animal feed). In short, the U.S. and many \n     other countries should easily find sufficient land \n     available for enough energy crop cultivation to make a \n     substantial dent in oil use. (Id.)\n       There is also a common and erroneous impression that \n     ethanol generally requires as much energy to produce as one \n     obtains from using it and that its use does not substantially \n     reduce global warming gas emissions. The production and use \n     of ethanol merely recycles in a different way the \n     CO2 that has been fixed by plants in the \n     photosynthesis process. It does not release carbon that would \n     otherwise stay stored underground, as occurs with fossil fuel \n     use, but when starch, such as corn, is used for ethanol \n     production much energy, including fossil-fuel energy, is \n     consumed in the process of fertilizing, plowing, and \n     harvesting. Even starch-based ethanol, however, does reduce \n     greenhouse gas emissions by around 30 percent. Because so \n     little energy is required to cultivate crops such as \n     switchgrass for cellulosic ethanol production, and because \n     electricity can be co-produced using the residues of such \n     cellulosic fuel production, reductions in green-house gas \n     emissions for cellulosic ethanol when compared to gasoline \n     are greater than 100 percent. The production and use of \n     cellulosic ethanol is, in other words, a carbon sink. (ETES \n     p. 73)\n     Biodiesel\n       The National Commission on Energy Policy pointed out some \n     of the problems with most current biodiesel ``produced from \n     rapeseed, soybean, and other vegetable oils--as well as . . . \n     used cooking oils.'' It said that these are ``unlikely to \n     become economic on a large scale'' and that they could \n     ``cause problems when used in blends higher than 20 percent \n     in older diesel engines''. It added that ``waste oil is \n     likely to contain impurities that give rise of undesirable \n     emissions.'' (ETES p. 75)\n       The Commission notes, however, that biodiesel is generally \n     ``compatible with existing distribution infrastructure'' and \n     outlines the potential of a newer process (``thermal \n     depolymerization'') that produces biodiesel without the above \n     disadvantages from ``animal offal, agricultural residues, \n     municipal solid waste, sewage, and old tires''. It points to \n     the current use of this process at a Conagra turkey \n     processing facility in Carthage, Missouri, where a ``20 \n     million commercial-scale facility'' is beginning to convert \n     turkey offal into ``a variety of useful products, from \n     fertilizer to low-sulfur diesel fuel'' at a potential average \n     cost of ``about 72 cents per gallon.'' (ETES p. 77)\n     Other Alternative Fuels\n       Progress has been made in recent years on utilizing not \n     only coal but slag from strip mines, via gasification, for \n     conversion into diesel fuel using a modern version of the \n     gasified-coal-to-diesel process used in Germany during World \n     War II.\n       Qatar has begun a large-scale process of converting natural \n     gas to diesel fuel.\n       Outside the realm of conventional oil, the tar sands of \n     Alberta and the oil shale of the Western U.S. exist in huge \n     deposits, the exploitation of which is currently costly and \n     accompanied by major environmental difficulties, but both \n     definitely hold promise for a substantial increases in oil \n     supply.\n     Plug-In Hybrids and Battery Improvements\n       A modification to hybrids could permit them to become \n     ``plug-in-hybrids,'' drawing power from the electricity grid \n     at night and using all electricity for short trips. The \n     ``vast majority of the most fuel-hungry trips are under six \n     miles'' and ``well within the range'' of current (nickel-\n     metal hydride) batteries' capacity, according to Huber and \n     Mills (The Bottomless Well, 2005, p. 84). Other experts, \n     however, emphasize that whether with existing battery types \n     (2-5 kwh capacity) or with the emerging (and more capable) \n     lithium batteries, it is important that any battery used in a \n     plug-in hybrid be capable of taking daily charging without \n     being damaged and be capable of powering the vehicle at an \n     adequate speed. By most assessments some battery development \n     will be necessary in order for this to be the case. Such \n     development should have the highest research and development \n     priority because it promises to revolutionize transportation \n     economics and to have a dramatic effect on the problems \n     caused by oil dependence.\n       With a plug-in hybrid vehicle one has the advantage of an \n     electric car, but not the disadvantage. Electric cars cannot \n     be recharged if their batteries run down at some spot away \n     from electric power. But since hybrids have tanks containing \n     liquid fuel (gasoline and/or ethanol, diesel and/or \n     biodiesel) plug-in hybrids have no such disadvantage. \n     Moreover the attractiveness to the consumer of being able to \n     use electricity from overnight charging for a substantial \n     share of the day's driving is stunning. The average \n     residential price of electricity in the U.S. is about 8.5 \n     cents/kwh, one-quarter the cost of $2/gallon gasoline. So \n     powering one's vehicle with electricity purchased at such \n     rates is roughly the equivalent of being able to buy gasoline \n     at 50 cents/gallon instead of the more than $2/gallon that it \n     presently costs in the U.S. Moreover, many utilities sell \n     off-peak power for 2-4 cents/kwh--the equivalent of 12-to-25 \n     cents/gallon gasoline. (Id. p. 83) Given the burdensome cost \n     imposed by current fuel prices on commuters and others who \n     need to drive substantial distances, the possibility of \n     powering one's family vehicle with fuel that can cost as \n     little as one-twentieth of today's gasoline (in the U.S. \n     market) should solve rapidly the question whether there would \n     be public interest in and acceptability of plug-in hybrids.\n       Although the use of off-peak power for plug-in hybrids \n     should not initially require substantial new investments in \n     electricity generation, greater reliance on electricity for \n     transportation should lead us to look particularly to the \n     security of the electricity grid. In the U.S. the 2002 report \n     of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and \n     Medicine (``Making the Nation Safer'') emphasized \n     particularly the need to improve the security of transformers \n     and of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) \n     systems in the face of terrorist threats. The National \n     Commission on Energy Policy has seconded those concerns. With \n     or without the advent of plug-in hybrids, these electricity \n     grid vulnerabilities require urgent attention.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       The dangers from oil dependence in today's world require us \n     both to look to ways to reduce demand for oil and to increase \n     supply of transportation fuel by methods beyond the increase \n     of oil production.\n       The realistic opportunities for reducing demand soon \n     suggest that government policies should encourage hybrid \n     gasoline-electric vehicles, particularly the battery \n     developments needed to bring plug-in versions thereof to the \n     market, and modern diesel technology. The realistic \n     opportunities for increasing supply of transportation fuel \n     soon suggest that government policies should encourage the \n     commercialization of alternative fuels that can be used in \n     the existing\n\n[[Page S6627]]\n\n     infrastructure: cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel. Both of \n     these fuels could be introduced more quickly and efficiently \n     if they achieve cost advantages from the utilization of waste \n     products as feedstocks.\n       The effects of these policies are multiplicative. All \n     should be pursued since it is impossible to predict which \n     will be fully successful or at what pace, even though all are \n     today either beginning commercial production or are nearly to \n     that point. The battery development for plug-in hybrids is of \n     substantial importance and should for the time being replace \n     the current r emphasis on automotive hydrogen fuel cells.\n       If even one of these technologies is moved promptly into \n     the market, the reduction in oil dependence could be \n     substantial. If several begin to be successfully introduced \n     into large-scale use, the reduction could be stunning. For \n     example, a 50-mpg hybrid gasoline/electric vehicle, on the \n     road today, if constructed from carbon composites would \n     achieve around 100 mpg. If it were to operate on 85 percent \n     cellulosic ethanol or a similar proportion of biodiesel fuel, \n     it would be achieving hundreds of miles per gallon of \n     petroleum-derived fuel. If it were a plug-in version \n     operating on upgraded lithium batteries so that 20-30 mile \n     trips could be undertaken on its overnight charge before it \n     began utilizing liquid fuel at all, it could be obtaining in \n     the range of 1000 mpg (of petroleum).\n       A range of important objectives--economic, geopolitical, \n     environmental--would be served by our embarking on such a \n     path. Of greatest importance, we would be substantially more \n     secure.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. There are lots of third parties saying we can achieve \nthis goal. I want to bet on the American ingenuity that is outlined in \nthis bill, and other American ingenuity, that we can achieve what it \ntakes to get there. So I am not afraid of setting this goal. I am glad \nthird parties are validating that we can achieve it.\n  My colleague wants to say this is about putting a man on Mars or \nsomething of that nature. I can tell you, the American people are right \nhere on planet Earth and paying $2.36 or close to it for gasoline in \nSeattle, and that is too high. What Americans want is relief. What they \nknow they will not get is relief from language that says we are going \nto be more dependent in 2015 than we are today. They want us to set a \ngoal to get off that overdependence because, frankly, there is not true \ncompetition on oil prices. That is to say when Americans have no \nalternative fuel at the pump and they have to pay that price, there is \nno true competition. So Americans want to get off that overdependence. \nThat is what the amendment says and that is what we want to achieve by \n2025, 20 years from now.\n  With all the myriad technology in the legislation and all the \ntechnology we can create between now and then, let's reverse the trend \nand be less dependent on foreign oil in 2025 than we are today. That \nseems to be a national goal on which everyone in this body ought to be \nable to agree. We should not be afraid of the underlying bill and the \ngreat work that has been done by my colleagues. I cannot say who the \nultimate winners and losers will be. My colleague has spoken about new \nnuclear technology, he has talked about natural gas--there will be many \nways. But I know if we set this goal and tell the American people they \nare not going to be strangled by high energy costs moving forward maybe \nup to $100 a barrel, then we will actually achieve that goal. But our \nunderlying language right now does not get us there. So I hope we will \nembrace the bipartisan effort that the Senate committee had and work \ntogether on this to set a goal we will be proud of, in the sense of \nreversing the trend so we are not in 2015 being more dependent on \nforeign oil, but in 2025 being less dependent on foreign oil.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me thank my colleague from the State of Washington. I \nthink she has offered an amendment that is worthy of the kind of \nsignificant debate we should be having about energy. I recognize that \ntomorrow's newspapers will not likely include this discussion on the \nfront page. I was watching the television programs last Sunday, \nincluding one with perhaps one of the most esteemed columnists in this \ncountry, one of the best, in my judgment, David Broder. They were \ntalking about the majority party and Democrats and the political \ndifferences. David Broder observed that the Democrats need to come \nforward with a positive agenda--with an agenda. What is their agenda?\n  The fact is, people don't cover positive news. You can be on the \nfloor all day with an agenda and they will not cover it. This will not \nbe on the front page of the paper tomorrow.\n  On the front page today is Michael Jackson. His attorney says he has \nagreed to end the behavior that got him into such trouble.\n  A new ``Batman'' movie, I noticed on the front page.\n  The Lakers have hired a new coach. That is on the front page of the \nnewspaper.\n  I don't think this debate will make the front page and that is \nregrettable, because this is a big issue. This is an important issue. \nThe question is, are we going to set goals as a country and aspire to \nachieve those goals? There is an old saying that if you do not care \nwhere you are going, you are never going to be lost. Where are we going \nwith respect to energy? We know that 60 percent of our oil comes from \noff our shores--60 percent from off our shores.\n  I asked the Energy Department officials one day when they came before \nthe Energy Committee: We talk a lot about 50 years from now, like what \nwill be the consequences of the Social Security financing system 50 \nyears and 75 years from now. Then I asked these officials to tell me \nwhat their plan is 50 years from now with respect to energy usage and \nenergy supply. You would have thought I hit him with a baseball bat. \nThey did not have the foggiest idea. They don't have a 50-year plan for \nenergy. We know that 60 percent of our oil now comes from off our \nshores, much of it from troubled parts of the world. Yet here we are, \nblissfully moving along, buying one big vehicle after another.\n\n  In fact, pull up to the next stoplight and pull beside a humvee; that \nis about 6,500 pounds--I will get a letter from the humvee folks, I \nsuppose--6,000 pounds or so. I am sure it gets single-digit gas \nmileage. I never took Latin, but I think of the Latin term ``totus \nporcus'' whenever I pull up next to a humvee. Someone told me it means \nwhole hog. Here we are, blissfully moving along, driving our humvees, \ndriving our SUVs, understanding that the question of whether we \ncontinue to have an oil and gas supply in this country is not up to us, \nit is up to the generosity of others, their willingness to pump it, \ntheir willingness to sell it, and the question of, at what price do \nthey sell it to this country.\n  I want to tell a story. Late one evening, I was in the old Air Force \nOne, the old 707 used by President George Bush, the first. That plane \nwas retired and is now in a museum. But that old Air Force One is the \nairplane that carried John F. Kennedy's body from Dallas, TX, to \nAndrews Air Force Base the night that he was shot. It is a great old \nairplane. One of the last trips made in that old Air Force One was to \nAsia. I was on that trip. Senator John Glenn was on the trip and about \ntwo or three other Senators. We were going to China and Vietnam and a \ncouple of other places to talk to foreign leaders.\n  Late that night, in the dark, in the front cabin which the President \nwould have used when it was Air Force One, we began talking as we were \nsitting around, as colleagues do. I asked John Glenn about his space \nflight because I was a young boy listening to the radio with rapt \nattention when I heard that John Glenn circled the Earth. I asked him \nquestions about it. What was it like going up in that space capsule and \nbeing the first American to orbit the Earth? He leaned forward, and for \nthe first time he began talking about that flight to us.\n  One of the things he told us I never have forgotten. As he crossed \nfrom the light side of the Earth to the dark side of the Earth--some of \nyou might remember that all of the citizens of Perth, Australia, \ndecided to turn on all of their lights so that when this human being in \nsome small little capsule called Friendship 7 orbited over the dark \nside, Perth, Australia, wanted to shine all their lights up so that \nJohn Glenn could see them. And John Glenn told us that night, sitting \nin that old Air Force One cabin, flying across the Pacific, he told us \nthat he looked down on the dark side, and the only thing he could see \non that path around were the lights of Perth, Australia.\n  Think of that. This big old planet of ours, with 6 billion people, \nthat spins around the Sun, we have a human\n\n[[Page S6628]]\n\nbeing for the first time orbit the Earth. He looked down on the dark \nside and saw the product of the light switches turned on by all those \ncitizens in that community in Australia. The only evidence on the dark \nside of the Earth that John Glenn could see as he orbited the Earth was \nthe product of energy--light.\n  We take energy for granted every single morning. We wake up, we flip \nthe switch on, and it is energy at our fingertips. We put our key in \nthe ignition, we turn the ignition on, and it is energy at our \nfingertips. We turn on the air conditioner or the heater, it is energy \nat our fingertips. We take it for granted. The story John Glenn told \ndescribes that the human condition in this country depends a lot on the \navailability of energy.\n  What has the Senator from Washington said today? She said: Let's have \na big idea. I am pleased to support this amendment and to come over and \nspeak about this amendment because this is a big idea. It says: Let's \nset a goal. Let's set a target, a timetable. I know there will be some, \nand there are some, who say it shouldn't be done, won't be done, can't \nbe done, can't be done, can't be done. I understand these comments. \nThat is always the case.\n\n  In my little old hometown, we had a guy named Grampy. His reaction to \neverything was, it can't be done. He always supported it after it was \ndone, but he always said, it can't be done. While he was saying it \ncan't be done, the other folks in my little hometown were doing it, out \nmaking it happen.\n  This country has a responsibility at this intersection, at this time, \nat this moment, to decide on a different energy future. We cannot hold \nthis country hostage by being dependent on 60 percent of our oil from \ntroubled parts of the world.\n  I talk a lot about trade. In part, this is a trade issue. We use \nnearly 21 million barrels of oil a day. The Saudis suck that oil out of \nthe sands. They are blessed with a lot of oil under their sands. Then \nthe oil comes over here, and we say, well, go ahead and fill her up \nover here and we will just give you a credit card. By the way, our \nfolks will pay for it later. That is exactly what happens because that \nis how we get a $640 billion trade deficit--which, by the way, next \nyear we are on the path--for the first 4 months of this year--we are on \nthe path to exceed $750 billion in trade deficit next year. This is \njust one construct of that transaction, saying: Suck the oil out of the \nsand, send it over here, and we will pay later. It is like going to the \ngas station saying: Fill it up, here is a plastic card. We will not pay \nnow, we will pay later.\n  This cannot continue. What if, God forbid, we woke up and discovered \nour oil supplies from Iraq, from Saudi Arabia, from Kuwait, from \nVenezuela, from any other country around the world, were gone. If that \nhappened, I guarantee this economy will be belly up immediately. We \ncannot exist as a world class economy, we cannot exist, without this \nsupply of energy.\n  What about this energy? We are hopelessly addicted to oil. When you \nhave an addiction, the best way to deal with an addiction is to have an \nintervention. My colleague from Washington is saying let's have an \nintervention. Let's decide the future has to be different from the \npast. She says let's propose a big idea. I support that, as do many of \nmy colleagues. Let's really have a big idea. Let's decide to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil in the next 20 years by 40 percent.\n  Some say it can't be done. Well, we decided to go to the Moon. We did \nit in 10 years. We cannot do this in 20? Don't underestimate the \nAmerican people. Of course, we can do this in 20 years.\n  I will go through a list of technologies, and my colleague from \nTennessee listed some, but there are a lot of hopeful things on the \nhorizon. Those things alone will not solve this issue. We have to be \nmore aggressive, much more aggressive, by setting timetables.\n  Those who are pilots, they understand what I mean when I say you set \nwaypoints when you are in the airplane. You get in the cockpit and \ndecide where you are going to fly and you set waypoints and fly to a \nwaypoint. We need to set targets, waypoints. Where do we want to be? \nHow do you measure where you are if you do not have a discussion about \nwhere you want to be?\n  That is what this amendment is about. It is not about 80-mile-per-\ngallon CAFE standards or 50-mile-per-gallon CAFE standards. It is not \nabout that at all. It is about whether this country collectively will \ndecide that when it is dependent on something, dangerously dependent on \nsomething that it must shed its dependency on, whether we will make the \ndecision to stop that dependency. Will it make a bold decision to stop \nthe direction we are heading, turn it around, and back off?\n  I don't know the answer to that. We will find out at some point. If \nanyone happens to be listening with respect to reporting on positive \nagendas, I would say here is an example of a positive agenda, a \npositive idea, a big idea. Big and bold. Risky? I don't know. I know \nthe riskiest proposition for this country. By far, the riskiest \nproposition for this country is to keep doing what we are doing and be \ndependent and held hostage to 60 percent of our oil coming from outside \nof our country.\n  Those who have studied economics, and I have studied and taught \neconomics--probably not very well--but you will recognize the doctrine \nof comparative advantage. It was a simple doctrine. The doctrine of \ncomparative advantage is, and the example traditionally used is, it is \neasier to produce wool through sheep in England and to grow grapes and \nwine in Portugal. It makes more sense, is more efficient to do both in \nEngland and Portugal, and then the English can ship their wool to \nPortugal, and Portugal can ship their wine to England, and they have \ntraded. They have each produced what is to their advantage. The English \nraise sheep, get the wool; the Portuguese raise grapes, make the wine; \nand you simply trade wool for wine. It is a very simple construct, the \ndoctrine of comparative advantage.\n\n  That is not what this issue is about. The issue of energy has nothing \nto do with the doctrine of comparative advantage. The advantage here is \nnot comparative. The advantage here is that in the Middle East you have \na massive amount of oil under the sands. It is pulled up less \nexpensively there than any place else in the world. A few people sit on \nmassive reserves of oil. And we have become addicted to its supply. As \na result of that, instead of getting ourselves out of a hole, we are \nstill busy with shovels continuing to dig.\n  We need to find a way and develop a goal that says at a certain point \nthis country's future is no longer dependent on someone else providing \nfor us the oil we need. We need to do that. Is it hard? Sure, it is \nhard, absolutely. This is not an easy thing to do. But do we have a \nchoice? I do not think so. I do not believe we have a choice.\n  My colleague described a number of technologies that are being \ndiscussed these days. Let me describe a few of them.\n  Wind. Does anybody here understand how much more efficient the new \nwind turbines are? The new turbines are much more efficient. We are in \na situation where we have the capability of taking energy from the \nwind. You take energy from the wind, a renewable resource, use it to \nproduce electricity, use the electricity in a process called \nelectrolysis, and separate hydrogen from water, and have an \ninexhaustible supply of hydrogen coming from water. Where does that \ncome from? It comes from renewable energy, an inexhaustible supply of \nenergy.\n  We just finished the ethanol title on this piece of legislation \ntoday. What a wonderful thing that is, to grow energy in your farm \nfields. Take a kernel of corn, and from that kernel of corn comes a \ndrop of alcohol and, in addition to the drop of alcohol, you still have \nthe protein feedstock left to give to the cows. It makes a lot of \nsense, doesn't it?\n  I know some oil companies do not like it. When I learned they did not \nlike it, I figured this has to make a lot of sense for our country. So \nwe passed an ethanol title. The renewable part of this legislation \ndealing with wind energy and biodiesel and a range of other strategies \nmakes great sense.\n  I particularly have been interested in helping write the title that \ndeals with hydrogen and fuel cells. Some say: Well, we are not ready \nfor that. You are right, at this point we do not have all the solutions \nof production, storage, transportation, and infrastructure. I \nunderstand that. But we can, and we\n\n[[Page S6629]]\n\nwill, and other countries, particularly in Europe, are moving rapidly \nin this direction. And even as an interim step we are seeing these \nhybrid cars. But we are going to move rapidly toward a different \nconstruct: hydrogen fuel cells--twice the efficiency of power to the \nwheel and water vapor out the tailpipe.\n  What a wonderful thing. Hydrogen is ubiquitous. It is everywhere. \nThere are many strategies to employ to take hydrogen from water, using \nrenewable resources, to extend our country's energy supply in a \ndramatic way and move us toward less dependence and greater \nindependence.\n  The one thing that characterizes this country is how famously wrong \npeople have been in trying to prognosticate the future. There is a \nwhole list of these famous projections. Thomas Watson, in 1943, who was \nthe chairman of IBM, said he thought maybe there was a world market for \nup to five computers. He was the head of IBM in 1943: I think maybe \nthere is a world market for five computers. Sarnoff once said, with \nrespect to the proposal to develop the radio: Well, who on Earth would \npay for a message sent to no one in particular?\n\n  I guess they missed the mark. I could go through a long list. We are \nfamous for not understanding what promise the future holds. This is not \ngoing to the Moon. That is not what this is. But this country does best \nwhen setting goals, such as when John F. Kennedy said, in response to \nSputnik and in response to the race with the Soviets: We are going to \ngo to the Moon by the end of the decade.\n  I have talked to folks at NASA who were around back then, the old \ncodgers, the old-timers. They scratched their heads: How on Earth are \nwe going to get to the Moon? We don't have the technology to get to the \nMoon.\n  Did you know the lunar lander that landed on the Moon with Armstrong \nand Aldrin had less computer power than a current new car has? Let me \nsay that again. The lunar lander, on which Buzz Aldrin and Neil \nArmstrong settled on the surface of the Moon, had less computer power \nthan a new car that you purchase today at the dealership anyplace \naround this country.\n  That is remarkable. But those scientists, those engineers, that \nAmerican ingenuity, that know-how, that spirit said: We are going to do \nthis. We are going to put someone on the Moon in a decade. And guess \nwhat. By the end of the decade, there they were. ``One small step,'' \nyou will recall, when Neil Armstrong planted his foot on the Moon.\n  This country needs to establish goals. This country needs to have \naspirations. All of us need to be a part of something that is bigger \nthan ourselves. We debate so many issues on the floor of the Senate \nthat have so little importance. This issue will determine whether our \nkids and our grandkids and their kids have jobs and opportunities and \nlive in a country that has an economy that expands, that improves the \nstandard and scale of living in the United States. That is what this \namendment is about.\n  Read the history books. Just because we are here on this designated \nspot in America, we think we have some blessing, some right to believe \nthat America will always grow, always expand, always lead the world. \nNot so. It will be the case only if we make good decisions, only if we \nmake the right decisions.\n  This country has a wonderful economy. You can circle the globe in any \nkind of plane you want and you can look down on any spot in the world, \nand you will not find the equivalent of the United States of America--\nnowhere. But we are headed toward some whitewater rapids here in a \nrange of areas. We are spending money we do not have. We have the \nhighest budget deficits in history. We have a trade deficit that is \ngoing to choke this country unless we get it under control. And, I \nthink most importantly, we have an economy that is running on foreign \noil.\n  Sixty percent of that which we use comes from elsewhere. An economy \nthat is hostage to decisions made by OPEC, hostage to decisions that \nmight be made by terrorists, hostage to 60 percent--and going, we \nestimate by the Department of Energy, to 69 percent in a relatively \nshort period of time--of its oil coming from off its shores, is a \ncountry, in my judgment, that is not in control of its own destiny.\n  It falls to us to make the decisions to put this country on track. It \nfalls to us to chart the future with respect to this country's energy. \nWe have an energy bill on the floor. I have complimented Senator \nDomenici and Senator Bingaman. I am pleased this bill was brought to \nthe floor in a bipartisan way. I voted for it out of the committee. I \nhad a hand in a good many of the titles that were written for this \nbill. I could not be more pleased than to be here saying this is a step \nthat is a positive step in the right direction: a bipartisan energy \nbill.\n  My hope is the amendment that has been offered by Senator Cantwell \nwill be embraced on a bipartisan basis as well because there is not a \nRepublican or a Democratic way for this country to go off course. There \nis not a Republican or Democratic way for this country to need energy \nand not have it and, therefore, shrink its economy and shrink \nopportunity for the future.\n  We need to do this together. Together we need to describe a big, new, \nbold idea that charts a new course for this country, a new energy \ncourse that gives us some feeling that we are moving toward \nindependence.\n  There is all this discussion these days about freedom. I am not \ntalking about ``freedom fries'' now, I am talking about freedom and \nindependence. All of that was undergirding the State of the Union \nAddress given to us by President George Bush.\n  Well, in my judgment, the issue of independence related to the word \n``freedom'' these days applies to a lot of things. And it must--it \nmust--apply to the circumstances that this country finds itself in with \nrespect to its dangerous, its hopeless addiction to oil coming from off \nour shores. As I have said previously, we simply cannot hope that in \nthe months and years ahead the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, the Iraqis, the \nVenezuelans, and others, will decide there is enough oil to share with \nus.\n  My colleague from New Mexico, the other day on television, I think, \nactually said--I did not hear him exactly--but there may not be a \ncompletely inexhaustible supply of oil in this world. We act as though \nit is inexhaustible. Every day we wake up in this country and use over \n20 million barrels of oil.\n  We pretend it is inexhaustible. Maybe it is not. If it is not, what \nthen: That is why I believe we ought to set some goals. This has \nnothing to do with politics. The Senator from New Mexico just came on \nthe floor. He missed the credit I have given him and Senator Bingaman. \nI like what we have done. I am going to vote for another energy \nindependence amendment called the renewable portfolio standard, \nrequiring 10 percent of our electricity be made with renewables. We \ndidn't have that in committee because we decided to do it on the floor. \nSome utility companies don't want it. I understand that. There is lots \nof room for debate. Maybe my view isn't the right view. I don't know.\n  I know my view is one I hold passionately. I believe strongly that we \nneed to do what is in this bill because it moves this country forward \nand advances our energy interests. I also believe we ought to do more. \nI believe we should set big, bold goals for America's energy future, \nsee if we can't free ourselves from a hopeless dependence on foreign \noil that is set now to grow and grow. Let's decide to make a U-turn and \nsee if we can't begin to move in a more constructive direction.\n  The Cantwell amendment will improve the legislation. I am going to \nvote for the Energy bill. I voted for it in committee. I am proud to \nvote for it. I am also going to vote for some things that will improve \nit. This positive idea is going to improve the legislation. I am happy \nto be a cosponsor and happy to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor his comments. I wish I could take credit for the bold idea in the \nsense that I am happy to be the sponsor of this amendment, but there \nare many people in America who have been talking about this as an idea.\n  I submit for the record another organization that has supported a \nblueprint for U.S. energy security, the Set America Free Organization, \nwhich is a collective organization of individuals, and they actually \nsubmit information that would be much bolder than a proposal to set a \ngoal in number of barrels that could be saved by 2025.\n\n[[Page S6630]]\n\n  There are a lot of people out there who have their sights set even \nmore dramatically than what we are talking about.\n  Clearly, my colleague outlined that we are talking about something \nthat is technologically agnostic. We are not declaring what technology \nis going to win. There are lots of great solutions that are provided in \nthis bill. But I would like to remind my colleagues that today at 2 \np.m., the price of oil per barrel was up to $56.50. So that is what we \nare dealing with, $56.50.\n  I know my colleagues in the Chamber were involved in getting the \noriginal language of 1 million reduction by 2025. I think that language \nfirst emerged when the Senate was considering previous Energy bills 2 \nyears ago. At the time we originally started thinking about this goal \nof how to get off our foreign oil dependence or to reduce it, we were \ntalking about oil prices that were much lower, maybe as low as $23 a \nbarrel. Now we are looking at $56 a barrel. It is imperative that we be \nmore aggressive by setting this goal and by working together to achieve \nit.\n  The underlying bill is a testament to bipartisan work in saying that \nthere are a variety of ways to reach the goal. Some may ask: Senator \nCantwell, why do you want to set this goal? You might actually find the \nUnited States pursuing more domestic oil supply as a result of this \ngoal.\n  I can't say what is going to happen. I just know I want to get off \nthe foreign dependence that we are at today because our economy cannot \ncontinue to take that risk. With the concentration of oil supply in the \nMiddle East, we are one mishap away from having our economy face a \n$100-a-barrel oil cost in the future. We cannot afford $56 a barrel. \nSome people say: Well, economies adjust to the high cost. I guarantee, \nin the meantime, a lot of people are going to suffer. There is not a \nweek that goes by that I am not on a plane flying back to the west \ncoast, to my home State of Washington, and a transportation worker \ndoesn't come up to talk to me about their pension, the fact that they \nare laid off, the fact that they are losing their job because \ntransportation fuel costs in aviation have not been passed on to the \nconsumer. Consequently, it is being taken out on pensions. So there \nisn't a week that goes by where I don't see somebody who hasn't \nsuffered from the high cost already, at $56 a barrel.\n  We cannot continue this dependency or the race we are going to be in \nwith China on competing for a limited supply.\n  I am confident enough in American ingenuity that I am not even going \nto be prescriptive about how we get there as it relates to whether it \nis nuclear, another supply of oil, biofuels, what is going to win the \nday. I showed a chart because I am a big advocate of biofuels. If you \ncan buy biofuels in Seattle now in the $2.60 range, $2.70 range, I know \nthat we can create more incentive, as we are in this bill, more \nresearch and development to get that cost down. So I know I can get it \ncompetitive to what I think gasoline prices are going to be. I want to \ndo that. I am gung-ho about that.\n  I am gung-ho about what the Brazilians have done because they have \nturned their economy around by becoming almost net exporters of energy \ninstead of net importers. That is an incredible story the United States \nshould learn from.\n  As my colleague from North Dakota said, there are many different \ntechnologies in the bill, but other countries are starting to gain the \nadvantage. If we think about it, we are not the experts on fuel \nefficiency that the Japanese are. We are not the experts on wind energy \nthat some of the Scandinavian countries are. We are not the experts on \nthe production of sugar-based ethanol that the Brazilians are. It \nbothers me that we are losing the technology edge to other countries.\n  I certainly am willing to take the risk of setting a goal of 2025 in \nreducing our foreign oil consumption by 40 percent and saying all the \noptions are on the table. I believe that Senator Domenici and Senator \nBingaman did a good job of putting all those options on the table. I \nbelieve in the underlying bill. What I think we should reflect on is \nthat the underlying bill includes language from a couple of years ago \nthat may not be bold enough in the sense that if it doesn't reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil in 2015, we will be more dependent.\n  We should reflect on that and see if we can get to a point where we \nare endorsing the underlying solutions in this bill and setting a \nhigher goal so that we can say to the American people, we are reversing \nthis trend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington. I thank \nmy kind colleague from Louisiana. I attended a meeting at the White \nHouse and just returned so I only had this time to do it. I appreciate \nthe opportunity to discuss the Cantwell oil savings amendment.\n  Obviously, it sounds good. Anybody who says we are going to save more \noil, it is a good thing. But I urge my colleagues to look at it for \nwhat it really is. This appears to me to be a back-door attempt, \narbitrarily, to increase the corporate average fuel economy or what we \ncall the CAFE standards. Along with my colleague from Michigan, Senator \nLevin, we have been through the CAFE debate in both the 107th and 108th \nCongress. It appears, from all I can tell, that if this amendment \nreally has any teeth, it means we are going to go through it again in \nthis Congress. I am sure there will be other efforts to increase CAFE \nstandards later in the debate.\n  Let me remind my colleagues, we went through extensive debate, and we \ngot signed into law measures saying that we must push the technology to \nincrease fuel economy as fast as we can. We directed the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration to examine the technology and \nincrease the required CAFE standards as quickly as can be done with the \ntechnology available.\n  Now, I believe that after all of our debates on CAFE, the Members of \nthis body understand that corporate average fuel economy is a complex \nissue that requires a lot of thought and scientific analysis. That is \nwhy previous CAFE measures in the last Congress were defeated. Members \nhave come to realize that the massive arbitrary increases in CAFE \nstandards cost lives, jobs, and stifle the ability of consumers to \nchoose the vehicle best for their families.\n  It is wonderful to say we want to make a statement--we are not saying \nhow we want to get there, but we really ought to have a major decrease. \nWell, Mr. President, the effort by Congress initially to establish CAFE \nstandards, without knowing how you are going to get there, wound up \nwith the auto manufacturers being forced to lower the average weight of \ntheir automobiles by about a thousand pounds.\n  As I will be discussing later, we have lost thousands and thousands \nof lives because of unsafe automobiles. Unless you mandate that only \ncertain cars can be sold or you tell people what they have to buy, \npeople may not buy the cars that are made small to conform to the CAFE \nstandards.\n  While I laud my colleagues' desire to conserve oil, the fact is that \nunder this amendment, as best we can determine, the only place oil \nsavings can come from would be a massive increase in CAFE standards. \nThe amendment requires the use of existing authorities to obtain these \nsavings, but they appear to be inadequate to the task required. \nAuthorities to implement the requirement or mandate are very limited.\n  According to a recent Energy Information Association report, by 2025, \noil consumption reductions on the order of 1.3 million barrels per day \nmight be expected using a broad array of incentives and policies, such \nas new appliance efficiency standards, credits for home efficiency \nupgrades, additional tax credits for advanced technologies, energy \nperformance standards for customers of selected utilities, and, of \ncourse, the promotion and use of renewable fuels. Many of these \npolicies are already outside of the scope of existing authorities and \nstill fall short of the goal of this amendment of 7.64 million barrels \nper day.\n  Furthermore, assuming the renewable fuels standard included in the \nbill can be doubled by 2025 to 16 billion gallons per year, which is \nambitious and also beyond existing authorities, it would contribute \nonly 1 million barrels a day of petroleum reduction toward the Cantwell \ngoal. As a result, some 4\n\n[[Page S6631]]\n\nto 5 billion barrels per day would be required, and there is no readily \napparent source to get it from.\n  The Cantwell amendment fails to protect these policies subject to \nexisting authorities from excessive implementation. Existing programs, \nsuch as CAFE, may be called upon to provide contributions toward the \ngoal that are far in excess of the normal implementation of these \nprograms if there are inadequate overall authorities or demand \nreductions to accomplish these goals and other measures. For example, \nthe Energy Information Association analysis referenced above estimates \nthat with a 20-percent increase in CAFE standards by 2012, in \nconjunction with the other policy options analyzed, only a 1.1-percent \ndecrease in the net import share of oil consumption occurs by 2025. The \n40-percent reduction required in the Cantwell amendment is far beyond \nwhat can reasonably be expected, using existing authorities.\n  The proposed amendment assumes that huge, new opportunities exist to \nreduce oil demand, but existing programs will ultimately be held \naccountable. The development of fuel cells and extensive implementation \nof other advanced technologies may contribute significantly to the \naccomplishment of the goal, but the contributions they might make are \nhighly uncertain. If we don't know where they are coming from, the \nconsequences could be something very different than what we bargained \nfor and having the adverse consequences we have seen from other broad \nmandates where Congress assumed that great, good things could be \naccomplished. Those are some of the reasons, frankly, we got into this \nenergy problem, because of some of the ``great'' ideas. I will only \nmention the forcing of electric utilities to burn natural gas, which \nhas caused a great part of the energy problem we have today.\n\n  In addition, since the measures must be defined and implemented \nstarting within a year, existing programs and authorities would have to \nbe relied upon extensively to develop the plan and to make up any \nshortfalls.\n  The Cantwell amendment would push the administration to rely on \ncontributions from programs and activities that are high risk, high \ncost, and the benefits are unknowable at this point. The President is \nallowed 1 whole year under the amendment to develop and implement \nmeasures that will save an amount of oil equivalent to 90 percent of \nthe annual consumption of the current light-duty vehicle fleet. \nHowever, the timing and the level of contributions of programs such as \nfuel cell and hydrogen development can only be guessed at this point, \nand authorities to fully implement them are still being developed. In \nlight of this, my question would be, How can the President obtain the \noil savings required under this amendment?\n  According to the Department of Energy's EIA, the vast majority of \npetroleum consumption in the United States--68 percent in 2002--is in \nthe transportation sector. Any reduction in petroleum consumption will \nimply a substantial contribution from this sector.\n  Under the Cantwell amendment, CAFE standards for cars, light trucks, \nand SUVs will skyrocket. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, in \nits examination of the EIA's assessments on oil savings, projects that \nthe Cantwell amendment will require CAFE standards for passenger cars \nnearly to triple from its current level of 27.5 miles per gallon to \n78.6 miles per gallon by 2025. Anybody for riding a golf cart? \nFurthermore, the CAFE standard for light trucks and SUVs would nearly \ntriple from its current level of 21 miles per gallon to 60.8 miles per \ngallon by 2025.\n  Under the 20-year duration of the proposed amendment, the yearly \npercentage increase for passenger cars and light trucks would be equal \nto a 10-percent rate of increase. According to NHTSA, the ``maximum \nfeasible'' standard for cars and light trucks for the years 2005 to \n2007 is a 2.8-percent rate of increase. To go above that, to have the \n10-percent increase, would not only be technically infeasible, but it \nwould have a devastating effect on employment in the auto industry. If \nthe requirements of the Cantwell amendment are enacted, then we could \nkiss tens of thousands of good, high-paying, American union jobs \ngoodbye. I don't want to do that to the roughly 36,000 hard-working men \nand women who work directly for the automotive industry in Missouri, \nnor am I willing to do that to the over 200,000 men and women who work \nin auto-dependent jobs in my State or those employed directly and \nindirectly throughout this Nation.\n\n  Furthermore, what does the Cantwell amendment mean for the size and \nsafety of our Nation's vehicle fleet? If we force consumers to drive \nsmaller vehicles, which is what will happen under arbitrary CAFE \nincreases, then we can expect a lot more highway fatalities.\n  Yesterday, I received some frightening statistics from NHTSA and the \nNational Center for Statistics and Analysis regarding the small vehicle \nfatality rates. In 2003, over 3,200 fatalities resulted from crashes \ninvolving smaller vehicles. This is anywhere from 2 to 7 times more \nthan the fatality rates for larger, heavier vehicles, depending on \ntheir weight class.\n  As we talked about the last time we debated CAFE, when we take a look \nat it over the years, NHTSA has found that solely as a result of the \nlighter cars made necessary by CAFE standards, between 1,000 and 2,000 \nmore people were killed on the highways than would have been killed if \nthey had larger vehicles. This isn't just on head-to-head, running into \nanother larger car or a larger vehicle; over 40 percent of those were \nsingle-car accidents.\n  The latest figures I have heard is that NHTSA estimates that 1,300 \ndeaths a year occur because of the mandated smaller size cars made \nnecessary by the CAFE standards. Make no mistake, you may call this an \noil savings, but this is CAFE all over again. As I have stated time and \nagain, far-reaching increases to fuel efficiency standards that are not \nbased on sound science are too costly and impractical for us to adopt. \nThe lives and safety of drivers and their passengers, along with the \nlivelihood of men and women in the automotive workforce who manufacture \nthese vehicles, is too much of a price to pay for unthought-out, \nunscientific fuel efficiency standards.\n  And, finally, make no mistake about it, this goes to consumer choice. \nConsumers are making the decision on what kind of vehicles they want to \ndrive. Right now, more and more of them are opting for light trucks. \nAre we going to tell them that we are going to tell them what kind of \nvehicle they can purchase? Are we going to have some Soviet-style czar \nwho says because they have two parents and two children in the family, \nwe will allow them one minicar and one small van? Who is going to \ndecide if we take away from the consumers their right to choose these \nvehicles?\n  If we have fuel standards of 78 miles per gallon, we are not going to \nbe able to buy any of the cars we want. Consumers are not going to have \nchoices. We are going to see people out of work in the auto industry, \nmajor disruptions in the transportation sector, a great inconvenience, \nand increased highway dangers.\n  I urge my colleagues to continue to work for sound, science-based \nways to conserve and produce more energy and to reject a measure that \ndoes not have a good, sound scientific foundation.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will take 1 minute. Before Senator \nBond leaves, I thank him for his statement. I have heard the Senator \neloquently describe this whole situation regarding automobiles in the \nUnited States and CAFE standards, but it seems to me this amendment is \neven way beyond anything we debated before. We are talking about \nchanging by a couple miles, 2 or 3 miles. What we are talking about \nhere would never become law. Let's be serious about it. But if it \nwould, we are talking 3 or 4 times the CAFE standards we have today. \nWhat kind of cars could we build?\n  Mr. BOND. We would have golf carts.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It seems to me the answer is impossible. That is the \nanswer. This is an impossible amendment. People want to dream, but you \ndo not build a country on dreams. Maybe you can dream, wake up and \nthink of something that is quite appropriate for goal achievement. This \nseems like somebody dreamt up something to tell us we ought to save 40 \npercent of crude oil we use in the United States by 2025; is that what \nit sounds like to the Senator?\n\n[[Page S6632]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am happy to answer. Obviously, it is well-\nintentioned, but I agree with the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee who has done an excellent job on this entire bill. I commend \nhim. The chairman and ranking member, our two friends from New Mexico, \nhave done great things in this bill, but I think this kind of amendment \nwould cripple its chance of passage. It does not meet the test of \nscientific reasonableness, sound science that I think we have to follow \nif we are to make some major improvements in the energy situation in \nour country.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor to make a \nfew brief remarks about the overall Energy bill that is before us, \nabout some of the strong points in this bill and how we might be able \nto improve upon it.\n  I would like to briefly mention, along the lines of the discussion \nthat just ensued, importing oil and the challenges that brings to our \nNation. I will submit a few documents for the Record and discuss \ngenerally the situation that we have in Louisiana. Of course, I will \nnot be offering any amendment at this time but just discussing \nsomething I know we will be talking more about as this debate ensues.\n  While I understand the amendment before us is quite an aggressive \namendment--and at this time, I have not made a final decision about \nit--I would like to say something positive about the amendment.\n  One of the points I like about this approach, while it is very \naggressive because it is similar to an approach that Senator Alexander \nand I took 2 years ago on the Energy bill, is the flexibility that it \nprovides to the country to try to make smart strategic choices about \nhow savings can occur and smart strategic choices about lessening our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  Coming from an oil-producing State, I can say that the people in \nLouisiana who produce oil and gas right here at home would like to \nreduce our dependency on foreign sources of oil.\n  The question is--and I think the chairman raises a very excellent \npoint, and it is a real question--can we do that this fast, this \naggressively, and maintain our economic position? We may or may not. \nBut I want to say that anything we can do to reduce our dependency on \nforeign oil, while we recognize that we are just about to open to the \nimports of natural gas because we virtually have no choice--we have to \nbecause we cannot step up domestic production fast enough to meet the \ndemands because China, because India, because our industries--chemical, \npetrochemical, agriculture, and others--are demanding more natural gas. \nWe are about ready to bring in natural gas, where in some ways, while I \nsupport that, it will compound the problem of dependency.\n\n  It really is a dilemma. I say to the Senator from Washington that I \nthink the flexibility of her proposal is very important, and the fact \nthat this amendment does not say we have to conserve, we could, in \nfact, produce more domestic oil and gas which I happen to think would \nbe a great idea. I know the chairman and the ranking member support \nmore domestic drilling of oil and gas.\n  I want to say a word about that for a moment. We do not do anything \nthe same way today that we did in the 1930s. Our telephones do not work \nthe same way. We did not even have computers in the 1930s. Everything \nhas changed. Technology for the large part has made everything better. \nSome people might argue with that statement, but the efficiency, the \nconvenience, the ability to clean up our environment--everything has \nbeen made better in large measure by technology.\n  The oil and gas industry is not what it once was when the men and \nwomen who started it were paddling in a pirogue, a canoe--that is what \nwe call a pirogue in Louisiana. A pirogue is a canoe--in the marsh \npumping the oil out of the ground by hand and digging with shovels and \ncrude instruments. This industry resembles more of the space industry \ntoday. It is run by computer. It is highly technical.\n  The environmental advances are absolutely astonishing. I have taken \nthe chairman down to Louisiana. He has seen this with his own eyes. The \nwells, where they are situated, the offshore platforms, I believe, \nwould make any American proud, even Americans who belong to the \nCalifornia Sierra Club. I absolutely believe they would be proud if \nthey could see the development of this oil and gas industry. In fact, \none of the majors told me--and I do not have any reason to doubt them \nbecause I think independent studies have shown this--that in the Gulf \nof Mexico last year, in the entire Gulf of Mexico, that oil company \ncollected three barrels--three barrels--of spilled oil from its \noperations, and it has billions of dollars invested.\n  That is how good we have gotten. Guess what. We are the best in the \nworld. Instead of bellyaching, we should be proud of that. We should \nsay thank goodness for that old American ingenuity. We did not do it \nvery well in the 1930s, and we did not do it well in the 1940s, but one \ngood thing about America is we never stop trying to be better. It \nseparates us from so many places in the world.\n  Coming from an oil and gas State, I would be the happiest person in \nthe world if we could stop importing oil, drill it at home and explore \nnew places that are appropriate. Some places may need to be off-limits \nbut not everyplace.\n  There is a place that is not off-limits and we are proud of, and that \nis south Louisiana and the work that we have contributed to this \ncountry. I am going to show my colleagues this chart because this is \nwhere all of the drilling off the coast of our country occurs: Texas, \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. We have been producing oil and gas \nand sending $5 billion annually to the Treasury in taxes every year. \nYes, there have been some environmental impacts which I am going to \ntalk about in a moment, but they have been minor compared to the wealth \nthat this industry has created not just for this region but for the \nentire Nation.\n  Does anybody remember we have gone through an industrial revolution? \nDoes anybody remember that everybody moved off the farms and went to \nthe cities? How do people think the cities got lit? It did not wave a \nmagic wand and the lights came on. We have been producing and digging \nfrom coal, oil, and gas. So if anybody wants to say that, oh, well, we \njust do not have to do that any more, heck, the whole country was built \non this contribution. People from Louisiana are darn proud of it.\n  Instead of everybody coming to the floor and saying how we do not \ncare about our land and we do not care about our trees and we do not \ncare about our coast and we do not have anything beautiful to preserve, \nnot only do the people of Louisiana love our land and love our water, \nwe survive on it and in it more than anybody in America. We swim more. \nWe eat more fish. We spend more time in boats. We recreate more on the \nwater than probably anyplace maybe except for a very few. Not only \nwealthy people get to the water, everybody lives by the water. In some \nplaces, one has to have a $5-million house before they can touch the \nwater. In Louisiana, there are people who live in a house not worth \n$25,000, but they have a gorgeous marsh land behind their house, and \nthose kids go fishing.\n  So I do not like to hear anybody come to this floor and say that we \ndo not treasure our land in Louisiana. We are going to continue to \nproduce oil and gas. We are going to continue to be proud of it, and we \nare going to continue to tell the story, whether anybody wants to \nbelieve us or not, that this can be done in a very safe environmental \nway. Why? Because we have good regulation; two, we have courts that \nenforce the regulation; three, we have all kinds of agencies--some \nwould argue too many--that make sure that all of these companies are \ndoing what they are supposed to do.\n  We have a free press, which means a lot because if somebody is doing \nsomething wrong, there is nothing I can do or the Senator from New \nMexico can do to try to stop them from reporting it. So they can report \nanything they want. There is open information. I wish they would really \ntell people what is actually happening.\n  The point I want to make in just a moment is that we are going to \ncontinue to do drilling. I appreciate all the good work of my \ncolleagues to try to\n\n[[Page S6633]]\n\ngive more revenues to the State. We get a little bit, but because we \nare generating so much and helping everybody so much--let me just use \nthis. I wanted to thank my colleagues for their interest in helping us, \nbut this makes my point even better. When the Senator from Washington \nsaid she wants us to be more like Brazil, I am going to learn a little \nbit more about what Brazil has done because I am not quite sure of the \ndetails, but I will tell my colleagues about 11 States in the United \nStates and what they have done. Those States are Utah, Colorado, North \nDakota, Montana, Oklahoma, Kentucky, New Mexico, Alaska, West Virginia, \nLouisiana, and Wyoming. Eleven States out of fifty are the only States \nin the United States that produce more energy than they consume.\n  Let me say that again. There are only 11 States in the United States \nof America that produce more energy than they consume. So if anybody \nwants to give Brazil an award, please give these 11 States an award \nfirst because we have already done that. We produce oil and gas. We are \nnet exporters of energy--well, we produce oil, gas, coal, nuclear. We \ncan produce energy from a lot of different ways. This is not just oil \nand gas production. This includes nuclear. This is from the Energy \nInformation Agency, our own agency, not from Louisiana or Senator \nLandrieu. This is the U.S. Department of Energy Energy Information \nAgency. This includes nuclear, hydro, geothermal, wood, wind, waste, \nsolar, oil, natural gas, and coal.\n\n  As the chairman from New Mexico will say, his goal is to increase the \nchoices of all of these so that more States can begin producing \nsomething. If my colleagues do not want to drill for oil, then drill \nfor gas. If they do not want to do that, put in a nuclear powerplant. \nIf they do not want to do that, put in some wind turbines. If they do \nnot want to do that, dam up some of their rivers and use hydro. Some \npeople will do that; some people will not. But for heaven's sakes, do \nsomething. Do something. If they want to mine for coal, we have given \nthem a lot of money in this bill and they can clean the coal. It can be \nburned and used efficiently. Put in solar panels. Go get waste from the \nagricultural areas of their State. That is the whole point of this \nbill.\n  We have 39 States that need to make some decisions about what they \nare going to produce to be free because 11 of us have already figured \nit out.\n  I do not know these other States as well as I know my State, but in \naddition to being a net exporter of energy, I will also tell the \ncountry that Louisiana probably has the most petrochemical plants per \ncapita than any State in the Union. Those products that are produced in \nmy State are not consumed by my State alone.\n  We make these products and send them all over the country and the \nworld. So not only are we producing enough energy for every single \nperson in Louisiana--the 4.5 million of us--and what we need, but we \nare also fueling every plant, every LNG facility, every petrochemical \nfacility, supplying so much for the Nation and still exporting because \npeople in Louisiana kind of believe in good old-fashioned ``do your \npart'' kind of work.\n  We also conserve. I am so tired of people saying, oh, the Senator \nfrom Louisiana and the people from Louisiana, all they do is waste \nfuel. I do not have the document, but I am going to submit for the \nrecord--I am going to take the last 10 years--the efficiencies that \nLouisiana, through our industry, has achieved. Yes, some of them have \nbeen mandated by this body and they had no choice and they had to do \nit, but some of it is voluntary. We have tried to be more efficient as \nwell and, of course, we have produced this energy.\n  Let me just point out three or four States that are at the top of \nthis list. Actually, I am probably going to do five States.\n  The States that consume more energy than they produce are California \nat the top of the list, New York second, Ohio third, Florida fourth, \nand Michigan fifth.\n  Let me point out one other thing, because you will say, Why isn't \nTexas on the green list. I want to find where Texas is--here it is, 25. \nTexas is not a net exporter, but it is close. The reason it is not is \nbecause, of course, it is a big State, a huge State--20-plus million \npeople, and they also have so much industry that they supply energy \nfor, that helps us all, they don't quite make it. But I have to say \nTexas is doing a great deal. Perhaps they could do more.\n  But the rest of these you can understand. Maybe Hawaii is too small. \nHawaii is not very big, but they are doing a whole heck of a lot better \nthan California.\n  I want to be clear about who is doing what, who is not, and where we \nneed to go and try to help everybody make the choices that work for \ntheir State but that also work for the country. It has to happen.\n  I will stop for a moment on that issue and move to something else.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Just for a few minutes, without losing your right to \nthe floor.\n  I want to say to the Senator, thank you for your discussion, as you \nzero in on what States do and do not do. I will not repeat that. People \nheard it and they ought to heed it. Some of the States you have alluded \nto ought to heed it, too. Some of them are the very ones who do not \nwant to produce anything and have production somewhere else, not there.\n\n  But in passing, the Senator discussed offshore production in her \nState, which she described in terms of new technology that is very \nsafe. There is nothing happening that hurts anybody. There is no \ndegradation of the water, no degradation of the air. I have seen one of \nthe new facilities. I wish everybody who is worried about offshore \ndrilling would take a helicopter and go out there. They are not next \ndoor to your house, they are miles and miles out in the ocean, and they \nare very large. They look like a big battleship out there all lighted \nup, full of technology, with 10 or 12 oil wells you cannot even see, \nproducing natural gas for America, and you don't know where it goes, no \npipes, nothing. Nothing spills, and it is our resource.\n  The Senator knows in this bill one big thing is missing and that is \nwe are not going to do anything significant about letting the United \nStates of America or States make a decision that off their shores they \ncould produce more natural gas or crude oil for this great country. \nThat is because Senators will not vote for it because the Senators with \ncoastlines stand up and talk about what you have been talking about \nhere.\n  ``We need the energy, we need to grow, we are great Americans, we \nhave a lot of plants, we want jobs--but you bring the energy here.'' \nRight?\n  Off our shores, remember--and Americans should remember it well--sits \nthe largest reserve of natural gas that America has today, but for some \nparts of Alaska which are very difficult right now, but we are going to \nbring some down. It is the largest mainland reserve of natural gas we \nare going to have for generations to come.\n  What does it mean that we do nothing about it? Listen well, we are \nnot going to stop using it. Remember how much crude oil we import. It \nwill be 5, 6, 10 years and what will we be importing? The Senator knows \nthe answer: Natural gas. Where from? Not from our seashores 100 miles \naway out there in the ocean where our natural gas is. From thousands of \nmiles away in big, gigantic boats. They are going to come across the \nocean and come over to America. And do what? Pump it into these States \nyou are talking about. Because right here on this floor, if the Senator \nfrom New Mexico and two Senators from Louisiana were to say, just \nsimple: Those States that have moratoriums off their shores where we \ncan't drill, if they would like to let us drill, let's let them say yes \nand then let's pay them a little more royalties than we have been \npaying. Because right now we get no royalties. Give them more than we \nare paying now and let them decide whether they would like to or not.\n  Guess what would happen. I have already been told. The bill, if it \npassed, will die. First of all, it will not pass. Because for all this \nlanguage around here--flexibility, let's do what we can, let's use \nevery avenue for exploration--that is not true. That is not true. \nBecause don't touch this one I have just talked about. Right?\n\n[[Page S6634]]\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Your State has. They have done it, along with Texas and \na couple of other States. Frankly, before we start giving other States \nresources, I wish they would start making decisions and we would start \nmaking them so other States would join. We have to help your State. We \nhave to help you because you are taking the burden, and we are going to \ntry to do something about that.\n  I don't know what we can do because we are stymied by a few things \nthat are intangible, that we don't control--fiscal policy and budget \npolicy and the like. But I want to say it doesn't do very much good to \nadopt resolutions on this floor and proposals such as are pending here \nfrom Senator Cantwell--it doesn't do a bit of good to say these are our \ngoals, let's do them. Flexibility.\n  We don't need that kind of bill if we do what we know we should do. \nWe have not built a nuclear powerplant in two decades plus, while the \nrest of the world built them. We can talk all we want about why did we \nuse so much natural gas in the powerplants of America. We know why. We \ndidn't want to use anything else. Right? So we used natural gas, even \nsome from offshore, some from your State. We piped it all the way over \nand burned it in powerplants as though it were coming out and would be \nhere forever. It starts running out, right? So we are going to import \nit pretty soon.\n  That is the problem. We have been doing that. It is the problem in \nthis bill. We are 90 percent where we ought to go, but the big thing is \nno action with reference to the largest asset we have toward \nindependence, which is natural gas and crude oil hundreds of miles--not \na mile--offshore.\n  There is one thing we are asking in this bill: Let's inventory it. \nRight? We voted in our committee. It was a hard vote. Hard? Just ask \nsomebody to go out and tell America what we own. That natural gas you \nhave been talking about, how much is there? You don't have to disturb \nanything anymore.\n\n  We have been talking about high tech. You don't drill holes to find \nout what is there. We do it by technology, by looking, by checking, by \na new kind of geophysical equipment. Should not we tell America how \nmuch is there?\n  You watch, there will be a motion to strike that here on the floor. \nYou and I will be here saying, What is the matter with that. But we are \napt to lose that. Yet we are talking about some ``pie in the sky,'' \nlet's set a goal 30 years from now to be 40 percent less dependent upon \ncrude oil and we will have all the flexibility in the world. We don't \nneed flexibility of any statute. We need the flexibility of Americans \ndeciding that we have to do what you said.\n  If we have a source of energy, we have to produce it. Do not think we \nare producing ourselves out of existence. This bill conserves more than \nany piece of legislation will ever ask Americans to conserve. But we \ncan't conserve our way out of this dilemma either, right?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We could close up the wells offshore in Louisiana and \nsay, ``Thank you.'' Of course not. We need more--and conservation. But \nI thought, since you raised the subject of offshore, we ought to tell \nthe Senate, tell the few people listening, where the real value in \nAmerica is, that we refuse. We are like ostriches when it comes to \noffshore.\n  People say, it is so pretty here, we don't want to touch it. What \nabout 100 miles out from that shore? You cannot even see it. And people \naround here are crying that you will hurt their States. You could put \nany limitation you would like that is credible and let's go beyond that \nand try to do something with this very important asset--this asset \nfield that is ours.\n  I thank the Senator for her comments and thank her for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the chairman, the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico, because he is absolutely correct. I share his frustration. \nAll I can say is as we proceed, we will continue to talk about these \nissues and educate the American people. People are afraid. They tend to \nbe afraid if they are not sure of the facts. Sometimes people get the \nfacts all confused.\n  But as I hope people understand, as I keep speaking the truth on this \nand people understand there are ways you can do this drilling, \nparticularly for natural gas, that are safe for the environment, that \nmeet every environmental standard we have today, and actually meet the \nclean air standards set out in our own act, we can most certainly \nexplore these opportunities and continue to work on this bill. I thank \nthe Senator for his comments, for his interest and his knowledge of the \nsubject. I can only say I will continue to try to tell the story, and \nas the American people learn more about it, perhaps some of the fear \nwill dissipate, reason will prevail, and we can begin to understand \nthat here at home we have places on our shores and off our shores that \nwe can tap into and minimize our dependency on foreign oil and foreign \ngas.\n\n  For the short term, this bill, and with the support of most of these \nSenators, will begin importing natural gas. We have policies in this \nbill to allow that to happen. It is quite ironic we are setting out in \na bill to import more natural gas, and we will not take opportunities \nto drill for more on our shores. Again, this is a work in progress.\n  Let me share another part of the story that is not just about energy \nproduction. It is the great contribution our coast makes to Louisiana. \nThere is the gold coast, the rocky coast, the cliff coast. We are the \nworking coast. We are proud of it. We are the largest and most \nproductive expanse of coastal wetlands in North America. It is the \nseventh largest delta on Earth. The Mississippi River drains two-thirds \nof the United States. As I said, it is one of the most productive \nenvironments in America.\n  In addition to the energy production I talked about which is right \noff this shore--and we have 20,000 miles of pipeline that can wrap \naround the country 10 times, 2,000 miles each way, miles of pipeline \nthat send oil and gas to Chicago, California and to Washington and New \nYork--in addition to the energy we produce for the Nation, through this \nMississippi River, we drain the mountains in the West and all \nthroughout the Nation; we also have a great nursery for one of the \ngreatest flyways in the world for millions of waterfowl and migratory \nsongbirds.\n  It also is a nursery for the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the seafood in \nthe Gulf of Mexico is produced because this marsh does not exist \nanywhere else in the coastal United States. Again, it is an unusually \nlarge delta created by the Mississippi River. It is unique.\n  In addition to the energy contributions this delta makes, in addition \nto the drainage we contribute by our location for the Nation, in \naddition to the great flyways for migratory birds that this provides, \nand the nursery for all the gulf coast fish and species, it also serves \nas a protection for the two million people that live below I-10. This \nis the main interstate that runs in the southern part of the United \nStates. It goes all the way through Mississippi, to Florida, and all \nthe way through Texas and west. This I-12/I-10 corridor is one of the \nbusiest in the Nation for many reasons. It is a great north-south trade \nRoute.\n  Below this interstate, basically two million people live in \nLouisiana. As the map shows, this land is all marsh and low-lying \nwetlands. The people that live here are in some jeopardy. They are in \nsome danger if this marsh would erode and go away as storms--whether \nthey are hurricanes, floods, or rising tides--continue to pound our \nshore. That, unfortunately, is exactly what is happening today.\n  Yet this wetland that supplies all of this energy, seafood and other \nenvironmental benefits to the Nation, we are losing a football field \nevery 30 minutes. We are losing 25,000 square miles every year. In the \nlast 50 years, we have lost the size of the State of Rhode Island.\n  The red on this map indicates a loss of wetland. This is not caused \nby oil and gas and by fisheries. It is exacerbated by pipeline \nconstruction and some exploration, but it is caused primarily by the \nchannelization of the Mississippi River. This river, for all the things \nI have said it is used for, you could argue the most important thing it \nis used for, for the Nation, is the commerce--500 tons of cargo, the \nlargest port system in the world. When my friends from the Midwest--\nwhether it is Senator Harkin, Senator Conrad, or\n\n[[Page S6635]]\n\nSenator Dorgan and others--want to get grain and corn out of the States \nthey represent, there is not a whole lot of ways to get it out except \nby barge. It comes down the Mississippi River.\n  We are happy for the trade and the traffic. But this river was levied \nto keep the water in, to create this major port system for the Nation, \nand as a result, over decades, the river cannot overflow itself, and it \nthen cannot replenish the marsh. That is what is causing the staggering \nloss of these wetlands. Then, on top of that--which is probably 85 \npercent of the loss of wetlands, say our scientists who have been \nstudying this for many years, the last two decades in particular--when \nthe oil and gas industry came in and some canals had to be put in for \nthe drilling, it exacerbated it by allowing the saltwater from the Gulf \nof Mexico to come into this water. We call it brackish. It is part salt \nand part fresh. It comes into the marsh and kills the marsh grass. The \nsalt is toxic to that particular marsh grass. The marsh grass fades \naway, and before you know it, you are in open water.\n  I have friends that have fished down here for years and old timers I \ntalk to. It is getting scary because it is not even people that are \nthat old any more who are saying: When I was a kid, you could stand \nright here in Terrebonne Bay and look out for miles and see land. I \ntook my little boy down there last week, the same place I used to fish \nwhen I was a kid, and there is no land left.\n  Senator, what is happening? Where is it going? It is eroding. I have \nbeen here for 8 years trying to get this Congress--Senator Breaux \njoined me, Senator Vitter now joins this effort--to try to get this \nSenate and this Congress to understand that this delta is not only \nprecious to Louisiana--it is not even Louisiana's wetlands, it is \nAmerica's wetlands--it deserves our attention.\n  Since we contribute so much toward waterborne commerce, so much to \nthe energy infrastructure and independence of this Nation, we serve as \na nursery for the fisheries industry, for the whole gulf coast of \nMexico, we serve as a flyway for migratory birds which support a whole \nemerging and growing ecotourism industry that affects everyone in a \npositive way, surely we can get a few little dollars to help us save \nour coast.\n  We are only one hurricane away. We had a terrible season last season. \nWe had five or six major storms. Luckily, they did not hit directly. \nUnfortunately, our friends in Mississippi and Mobile were hit. None of \nus along the gulf coast like to get hit. We are in great sympathy and \nempathy with each other because we know what a major hurricane will do. \nMy people are sitting ducks. It is getting worse and worse. We can save \nour coast. But we need to use some of the moneys we can get to invest \nand to do this and we can make progress.\n  The Senator from Washington would like to wrap up on her amendment, \nand so let me conclude in a few moments. I thank the Senator for her \ncourtesy and time.\n  This is a very precious wetland to Louisiana and to America. It is \nsomething that can be saved, must be saved and, if saved, cannot only \ncontribute so much to Louisiana but to the Nation.\n  This issue is not as clearcut as some would like to believe. As I \nsaid, I like some parts of the amendment of the Senator from \nWashington. She has been a tremendous contributor on the Energy bill \nand a tremendous voice for conservation. What I do like about her \namendment is its flexibility. What I do like about her amendment is the \nopportunity to produce more domestically so we do not have to get it \nfrom somebody else, particularly a somebody who does not share our \nvalues, who does not have America's best interests at heart. So I agree \nwith that approach. Again, it may be too aggressive for us. But the \nSenate will decide if that is the case.\n  But I want to say from a State that is producing--and we are going to \ncontinue to produce; we are happy to produce--there are some coastal \nimpacts associated with it. But even if we were not doing any \nproduction off the coast of Louisiana, this loss of wetlands would \nstill be occurring because of the channelization of the Mississippi \nRiver done by the Corps of Engineers, at our request, on behalf of the \nNation. It is time we get some help and some support for fixing this \nwetland.\n  I thank the Senator for her patience and her courtesies, and I wish \nher the best of luck as we continue to work on our bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  The Chair would advise the Senator from Washington that her last \nunanimous consent request for a submission was not made formally. If \nshe would like to resubmit that request at this time, the Chair would \ntake it. It was the last piece of information you submitted.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nfrom Set America Free be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Set America Free\n\n       For decades, the goal of reducing the Nation's dependence \n     upon foreign energy sources has been a matter on which \n     virtually all Americans could agree. Unfortunately, \n     differences about how best to accomplish that goal, with what \n     means, how rapidly and at what cost to taxpayers and \n     consumers have, to date, precluded the sort of progress that \n     might have been expected before now.\n       Today, we can no longer afford to allow such differences to \n     postpone urgent action on national energy independence. After \n     all, we now confront what might be called a ``perfect storm'' \n     of strategic, economic and environmental conditions that, \n     properly understood, demand that we affect over the next four \n     years a dramatic reduction in the quantities of oil imported \n     from unstable and hostile regions of the world.\n       America consumes a quarter of the world's oil supply while \n     holding a mere 3% of global oil reserves. It is therefore \n     forced to import over 60% of its oil, and this dependency is \n     growing. Since most of the world's oil is controlled by \n     countries that are unstable or at odds with the United States \n     this dependency is a matter of national security.\n       At the strategic level, it is dangerous to be buying \n     billions of dollars worth of oil from nations that are \n     sponsors of or allied with radical Islamists who foment \n     hatred against the United States. The petrodollars we provide \n     such nations contribute materially to the terrorist threats \n     we face. In time of war, it is imperative that our national \n     expenditures on energy be redirected away from those who use \n     them against us.\n       Even if the underwriting of terror were not such a concern, \n     our present dependency creates unacceptable vulnerabilities. \n     In Iraq and Saudi Arabia, America's enemies have demonstrated \n     that they can advance their strategic objective of inflicting \n     damage on the United States, its interests and economy simply \n     by attacking critical overseas oil infrastructures and \n     personnel. These targets are readily found not only in the \n     Mideast but in other regions to which Islamists have ready \n     access (e.g., the Caspian Basin and Africa). To date, such \n     attacks have been relatively minor and their damage easily \n     repaired. Over time, they are sure to become more \n     sophisticated and their destructive effects will be far more \n     difficult, costly and time-consuming to undo.\n       Another strategic factor is China's burgeoning demand for \n     oil. Last year, China's oil imports were up 30% from the \n     previous year, making it the world's No. 2 petroleum user \n     after the United States. The bipartisan, congressionally \n     mandated U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission \n     reported that: ``China's large and rapidly growing demand for \n     oil is putting pressure on global oil supplies. This pressure \n     is likely to increase in the future, with serious \n     implications for U.S. oil prices and supplies.''\n       Oil dependence has considerable economic implications. \n     Shrinking supply and rising demand translate into higher \n     costs. Both American consumers and the U.S. economy are \n     already suffering from the cumulative effect of recent \n     increases in gas prices. Even now, fully one-quarter of the \n     U.S. trade deficit is associated with oil imports. By some \n     estimates, we lose 27,000 jobs for every billion dollars of \n     additional oil imports. Serious domestic and global economic \n     dislocation would almost certainly attend still-higher costs \n     for imported petroleum and/or disruption of supply.\n       Finally, environmental considerations argue for action to \n     reduce imports of foreign oil. While experts and policy-\n     makers disagree about the contribution the burning of fossil \n     fuels is making to the planet's temperatures, it is certainly \n     desirable to find ways to obtain energy while minimizing the \n     production of greenhouse gases and other pollutants.\n       The combined effects or this ``perfect storm'' require \n     concerted action, at last, aimed at reducing the Nation's \n     reliance on imported oil from hostile or unstable sources and \n     the world's dependence on oil at large. Fortunately, with \n     appropriate vision and leadership, we can make major strides \n     in this direction by exploiting currently available \n     technologies and infrastructures to greatly diminish oil \n     consumption in the transportation sector, which accounts for \n     two thirds of our oil consumption.\n       The attached Blueprint for Energy Security: ``Set America \n     Free'' spells out practical ways in which real progress on \n     ``fuel choice'' can be made over the next four years and \n     beyond. To be sure, full market transformation\n\n[[Page S6636]]\n\n     will take a longer time. In the case of the transportation \n     sector, it may require 15-20 years. That is why it is \n     imperative to begin the process without delay.\n       We call upon America's leaders to pledge to adopt this \n     Blueprint, and embark, along with our democratic allies, on a \n     multilateral initiative to encourage reduced dependence on \n     petroleum. In so doing, they can reasonably promise to: deny \n     adversaries the wherewithal they use to harm us; protect our \n     quality of life and economy against the effects of cuts in \n     foreign energy supplies and rising costs; and reduce by as \n     much as 50% emissions of undesirable pollutants. In light of \n     the ``perfect storm'' now at hand, we simply can afford to do \n     no less.\n\n\n                              Signatories\n\n       Gary L.

In recent \n     years, the focus has been principally on finding new and \n     larger sources of petroleum globally.\n       Rapidly growing worldwide demand for oil, however, has had \n     the effect of largely neutralizing this initiative, depleting \n     existing reserves faster than new, economically exploitable \n     deposits are being brought on line. Under these \n     circumstances, diversification among such sources is but a \n     stop-gap solution that can, at best, have a temporary effect \n     on oil supply and, hence, on national security. Conservation \n     can help, but with oil consumption expected to grow by 60% \n     over the next 25 years, conservation alone will not be a \n     sufficient solution.\n     The `Set America Free' Project\n       Long-term security and economic prosperity requires the \n     creation of a fourth pillar--technological transformation of \n     the transportation sector through what might be called ``fuel \n     choice.'' By leading a multinational effort rooted in the \n     following principles, the United States can immediately begin \n     to introduce a global economy based on next-generation fuels \n     and vehicles that can utilize them:\n       Fuel diversification: Today, consumers can choose among \n     various octanes of gasoline, which accounts for 45% of U.S. \n     oil consumption, or diesel, which accounts for almost another \n     fifth. To these choices can and should promptly be added \n     other fuels that are domestically produced, where possible \n     from waste products, and that are clean and affordable.\n       Real world solutions: We have no time to wait for \n     commercialization of immature technologies. The United States \n     should implement technologies that exist today and are ready \n     for widespread use.\n       Using existing infrastructure: The focus should be on \n     utilizing competitive technologies that do not require \n     prohibitive or, if possible, even significant investment in \n     changing our transportation sector's infrastructure. Instead, \n     ``fuel choice'' should permit the maximum possible use of the \n     existing refueling and automotive infrastructure.\n       Domestic resource utilization: The United States is no \n     longer rich in oil or natural gas. It has, however, a wealth \n     of other energy sources from which transportation fuel can be \n     safely, affordably and cleanly generated. Among them: \n     hundreds of years worth of coal reserves, 25% of the world's \n     total (especially promising with Integrated Gasification and \n     Combined Cycle technologies); billions of tons a year of \n     biomass, and further billions of tons of agricultural and \n     municipal waste. Vehicles that meet consumer needs (e.g., \n     ``plug-in'' hybrids), can also tap America's electrical grid \n     to supply energy for transportation, making more efficient \n     use of such clean sources of electricity as solar, wind, \n     geothermal, hydroelectric and nuclear power.\n       Environmentally sensible choices: The technologies adopted \n     should improve public safety and respond to the public's \n     environmental and health concerns.\n\n\n             Key Elements of the `Set America Free' Project\n\n     Vehicles\n       Hybrid electric vehicles: There are already thousands of \n     vehicles on America's roads that combine hybrid engines \n     powered in an integrated fashion by liquid fuel-powered \n     motors and battery-powered ones. Such vehicles increase gas-\n     consumption efficiency by 30-40%.\n       Ultralight materials: At least two-thirds of fuel use by a \n     typical consumer vehicle is caused by its weight. Thanks to \n     advances in both metals and plastics, ultralight vehicles can \n     be affordably manufactured with today's technologies and can \n     roughly halve fuel consumption without compromising safety, \n     performance or cost effectiveness.\n       ``Plug-in'' hybrid electric vehicles: Plug-in hybrid \n     electric vehicles are also powered by a combination of \n     electricity and liquid fuel. Unlike standard hybrids, \n     however, plug-ins draw charge not only from the engine and \n     captured braking energy, but also directly from the \n     electrical grid by being plugged into standard electric \n     outlets when not in use. Plug-in hybrids have liquid fuel \n     tanks and internal combustion engines, so they do not face \n     the range limitation posed by electric-only cars. Since \n     fifty-percent of cars on the road in the United States are \n     driven 20 miles a day or less, a plug-in with a 20-mile range \n     battery would reduce fuel consumption by, on average, 85%. \n     Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles can reach fuel economy \n     levels of 100 miles per gallon of gasoline consumed.\n       Flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs): FFVs are designed to bum on \n     alcohol, gasoline, or any mixture of the two. About four \n     million FFV's have been manufactured since 1996. The only \n     difference between a conventional car and a flexible fuel \n     vehicle is that the latter is equipped with a different \n     control chip and some different fittings in the fuel line to \n     accommodate the characteristics of alcohol. The marginal \n     additional cost associated with such FFV-associated changes \n     is currently under $100 per vehicle. That cost would be \n     reduced further as volume of FFVs increases, particularly if \n     flexible fuel designs were to become the industry standard.\n       Flexible fuel/plug-in hybrid electric vehicles: If the two \n     technologies are combined, such vehicles can be powered by \n     blends of alcohol fuels, gasoline, and electricity. If a \n     plug-in vehicle is also a FFV fueled with 80% alcohol and 20% \n     gasoline, fuel economy could reach 500 miles per gallon of \n     gasoline.\n       If by 2025, all cars on the road are hybrids and half are \n     plug-in hybrid vehicles, U.S. oil imports would drop by 8 \n     million barrels per day (mbd). Today, the United States \n     imports 10 mbd and it is projected to import almost 20 mbd by \n     2025. If all of these cars were also flexible fuel vehicles, \n     U.S. oil imports would drop by as much as 12 mbd.\n     Fuels\n       Fuel additives: Fuel additives can enhance combustion \n     efficiency by up to 25%. They can be blended into gasoline, \n     diesel and bunker fuel.\n       Electricity as a fuel: Less than 2% of U.S. electricity is \n     generated from oil, so using electricity as a transportation \n     fuel would greatly reduce dependence on imported petroleum. \n     Plug-in hybrid vehicles would be charged at night in home \n     garages--a time-interval during which electric utilities have \n     significant excess capacity. The Electric Power Research \n     Institute estimates that up to 30% of market penetration for \n     plug-in hybrid electric vehicles with 20-mile electric range \n     can be achieved without a need to install additional \n     electricity-generating capacity.\n       Alcohol fuels: ethanol, methanol and other blends:\n       Ethanol (also known as grain alcohol) is currently produced \n     in the U.S. from corn. The industry currently has a capacity \n     of 3.3 billion gallons a year and has increased on the \n     average of 25% per year over the past three years. Upping \n     production would be achieved by continuing to advance the \n     corn-based ethanol industry and by commercializing the \n     production of ethanol from biomass waste and dedicated energy \n     crops. P-Series fuel (approved by the Department of Energy in \n     1999) is a more energy-efficient blend of ethanol, natural \n     gas liquids and ether made from biomass waste.\n       Methanol (also known as wood alcohol) is today for the most \n     part produced from natural gas. Expanding domestic production \n     can be achieved by producing methanol from coal, a resource \n     with which the U.S. is abundantly endowed. The commercial \n     feasibility of coal-to-methanol technology was demonstrated \n     as part of the DOE's ``clean coal'' technology effort. \n     Currently, methanol is being cleanly produced from coal for \n     under 50 cents a gallon.\n       It only costs about $60,000 to add a fuel pump that serves \n     one of the above fuels to an existing refueling station.\n       Non-oil based diesel: Biodiesel is commercially produced \n     from soybean and other vegetable oils. Diesel can also be \n     made from waste products such as tires and animal byproducts, \n     and is currently commercially produced from turkey offal. \n     Diesel is also commercially produced from coal.\n     Policy Recommendations\n       Provide incentives to auto manufacturers to produce and \n     consumers to purchase, hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrid \n     electric vehicles and FFVs across all vehicle models.\n       Provide incentives for auto manufacturers to increase fuel \n     efficiency of existing, non-FFV auto models.\n       Conduct extensive testing of next-generation fuels across \n     the vehicle spectrum to meet auto warranty and EPA emission \n     standards.\n       Mandate substantial incorporation of plug-ins and FFVs into \n     federal, state, municipal and covered fleets.\n       Provide investment tax incentives for corporate fleets and \n     taxi fleets to switch to plug-ins, hybrids and FFVs.\n\n[[Page S6637]]\n\n       Encourage gasoline distributors to blend combustion \n     enhancers into the fuel.\n       Provide incentives for existing fueling stations to install \n     pumps that serve all liquid fuels that can be used in the \n     existing transportation infrastructure, and mandate that all \n     new gas stations be so equipped.\n       Provide incentives to enable new players, such as \n     utilities, to enter the transportation fuel market, and for \n     the development of environmentally sound exploitation of non-\n     traditional petroleum deposits from stable areas (such as \n     Canadian tar sands).\n       Provide incentives for the construction of plants that \n     generate liquid transportation fuels from domestic energy \n     resources, particularly from waste, that can be used in the \n     existing infrastructure.\n       Allocate funds for commercial scale demonstration plants \n     that produce next-generation transportation fuels, \n     particularly from waste products.\n       Implement federal, state, and local policies to encourage \n     mass transit and reduce vehicle-miles traveled.\n       Work with other oil-consuming countries towards \n     distribution of the above-mentioned technologies and overall \n     reduction of reliance on petroleum, particularly from hostile \n     and potentially unstable regions of the world.\n\n\n                         A New National Project\n\n       In 1942, President Roosevelt launched the Manhattan Project \n     to build an atomic weapon to be ready by 1945 because of \n     threats to America and to explore the future of nuclear \n     fission. The cost in today's prices was $20 billion. The \n     outcome was an end to the war with Japan, and the beginning \n     of a wide new array of nuclear-based technologies in energy, \n     medical treatment, and other fields.\n       In 1962, President Kennedy launched the Man to the Moon \n     Project to be achieved by 1969 because of mounting threats to \n     U.S. and international security posed by Soviet space-\n     dominance and to explore outer space. The cost of the Apollo \n     program in today's prices would be well over $100 billion. \n     The outcome was an extraordinary strategic and technological \n     success for the United States. It engendered a wide array of \n     spin-offs that improved virtually every aspect of modern \n     life, including but not limited to transportation, \n     communications, health care, medical treatment, food \n     production and other fields.\n       The security of the United States, and the world, is no \n     less threatened by oil supply disruptions, price \n     instabilities and shortages. It is imperative that America \n     provide needed leadership by immediately beginning to \n     dramatically reduce its dependence on imported oil. This can \n     be done by embracing the concepts outlined above with a focus \n     on fuel choice, combined with concerted efforts at improving \n     energy efficiency and the increased availability of energy \n     from renewable sources.\n       The estimated cost of the `Set America Free' plan over the \n     next 4 years is $12 billion. This would be applied in the \n     following way: $2 billion for automotive manufacturers to \n     cover one-half the costs of building FFV-capability into \n     their new production cars (i.e., roughly 40 million cars at \n     $50 per unit); $1 billion to pay for at least one out of \n     every four existing gas stations to add at least one pump to \n     supply alcohol fuels (an estimated incentive of $20,000 per \n     pump, new pumps costing approximately $60,000 per unit); $2 \n     billion in consumer tax incentives to procure hybrid cars; $2 \n     billion for automotive manufacturers to commercialize plug-in \n     hybrid electric vehicles; $3 billion to construct commercial-\n     scale demonstration plants to produce non-petroleum based \n     liquid fuels (utilizing public-private cost-sharing \n     partnerships to build roughly 25 plants in order to \n     demonstrate the feasibility of various approaches to perform \n     efficiently at full-scale production); and $2 billion to \n     continue work on commercializing fuel cell technology.\n       Since no major, new scientific advances are necessary to \n     launch this program, such funds can be applied towards \n     increasing the efficiencies of the involved processes. The \n     resulting return-on-investment--in terms of enhanced energy \n     and national security, economic growth, quality of life and \n     environmental protection--should more than pay for the seed \n     money required.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for her comments \nand for her focus on the fact that the amendment is basically agnostic \nabout where we get future supply. You can get it from more domestic \nproduction of oil or natural gas. I have been a big supporter of more \nnatural gas production, particularly from Alaska, because I think it is \nso important to our country moving ahead.\n  I appreciate her chart showing what States are involved in energy \nproduction because we in Washington State are getting 70 percent of our \nelectricity from a hydro system. She mentioned, yes, you can get energy \nfrom damming rivers. Well, that is exactly what we have done in the \nState of Washington and many parts of the Northwest. It has cost our \nenvironment, but yet we get 70 percent of our power from that.\n  We have one nuclear powerplant in our State. We have one coal plant \nin our State. We have a few natural gas-fired plants in our State. We \nhave four major refineries that take crude oil and convert it to \npetroleum products, such as gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, and asphalt. So \nwe in Washington State are involved in all those activities.\n  The fact is, we do not have significant oil and natural gas off the \ncoast of Washington. I know that is something that is being discussed. \nBut the Minerals Management Service Report that was conducted basically \nsays there is not a lot of natural gas off the coast of Washington. So \nI am not in the same position as the Senator from Louisiana.\n  I think you have to take into consideration in this debate what some \nof my staff call the ``accidents of geology;'' that is, that Saudi \nArabia happens to sit on 25 percent of the world's oil reserves, and we \nin the United States only sit on 3 percent. That is a fact of geology.\n  So the fact that Louisiana has oil and gas and Washington does not is \nanother fact of geology. But I tell you that we do play our role in \nWashington State. We help keep the lights on in California. We were \nforced to do so by emergency order by the U.S. Government during a \ndrought, at a cost to ratepayers in Washington State. So we do play our \npart in providing energy supplies around the region.\n  But this is an issue about regional diversity and about getting off \nour overdependence on foreign oil. I think the Senator correctly \narticulated what this amendment does; and that is, it basically sets a \ngoal and says it is most important to get off the foreign dependence, \nto start reducing it. I appreciate that because she came up with the \noriginal language and I think is concerned that we do set goals. So I \nappreciate her comments.\n  I would like to add to the record, if I could--I know my colleagues \nfrom Colorado and Illinois are on the floor and want to speak. But we \nhave had questions about whether we can get a supply of biofuels. I \nknow a lot of my Midwestern colleagues believe in the biofuel section \nof this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Executive Summary of the USDA and Department of Energy report \nentitled ``Biomass as Feedstock for a Bioenergy and Bioproducts \nIndustry: The Technical Feasibility of a Billion-Ton Annual Supply.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Biomass as Feedstock for a Bioenergy and Bioproducts Industry: The \n          Technical Feasibility of a Billion-Ton Annual Supply\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n       The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U.S. Department \n     of Agriculture (USDA) are both strongly committed to \n     expanding the role of biomass as an energy source. In \n     particular, they support biomass fuels and products as a way \n     to reduce the need for oil and gas imports; to support the \n     growth of agriculture, forestry, and rural economies; and to \n     foster major new domestic industries--biorefineries--making a \n     variety of fuels, chemicals, and other products. As part of \n     this effort, the Biomass R Technical Advisory Committee, a \n     panel established by the Congress to guide the future \n     direction of federally funded biomass R, envisioned a 30 \n     percent replacement of the current U.S. petroleum consumption \n     with biofuels by 2030.\n       Biomass--all plant and plant-derived materials including \n     animal manure, not just starch, sugar, oil crops already used \n     for food and energy--has great potential to provide renewable \n     energy for America's future. Biomass recently surpassed \n     hydropower as the largest domestic source of renewable energy \n     and currently provides over 3 percent of the total energy \n     consumption in the United States. In addition to the many \n     benefits common to renewable energy, biomass is particularly \n     attractive because it is the only current renewable source of \n     liquid transportation fuel. This, of course, makes it \n     invaluable in reducing oil imports--one of our most pressing \n     energy needs. A key question, however, is how large a role \n     could biomass play in responding to the nation's energy \n     demands. Assuming that economic and financial policies and \n     advances in conversion technologies make biomass fuels and \n     products more economically viable, could the biorefinery \n     industry be large enough to have a significant impact on \n     energy supply and oil imports? Any and all contributions are \n     certainly needed, but would the biomass potential be \n     sufficiently large to justify the necessary capital \n     replacements in the fuels and automobile sectors?\n       The purpose of this report is to determine whether the land \n     resources of the United States are capable of producing a \n     sustainable supply of biomass sufficient to displace 30 \n     percent or more of the country's present petroleum \n     consumption--the goal set by the\n\n[[Page S6638]]\n\n     Advisory Committee in their vision for biomass technologies. \n     Accomplishing this goal would require approximately 1 billion \n     dry tons of biomass feedstock per year.\n       The short answer to the question of whether that much \n     biomass feedstock can be produced is yes. Looking at just \n     forestland and agricultural land, the two largest potential \n     biomass sources, this study found over 1.3 billion dry tons \n     per year of biomass potential (Figure 1)--enough to produce \n     biofuels to meet more than one-third of the current demand \n     for transportation fuels. The full resource potential could \n     be available roughly around mid-21st century when large-scale \n     bioenergy and biorefinery industries are likely to exist. \n     This annual potential is based on a more than seven-fold \n     increase in production from the amount of biomass currently \n     consumed for bioenergy and biobased products. About 368 \n     million dry tons of sustainably removable biomass could be \n     produced on forestlands, and about 998 million dry tons could \n     come from agricultural lands.\n       Forestlands in the contiguous United States can produce 368 \n     million dry tons annually. This projection includes 52 \n     million dry tons of fuelwood harvested from forests, 145 \n     million dry tons of residues from wood processing mills and \n     pulp and paper mills, 47 million dry tons of urban wood \n     residues including construction and demolition debris, 64 \n     million dry tons of residues from logging and site clearing \n     operations, and 60 million dry tons of biomass from fuel \n     treatment operations to reduce fire hazards. All of these \n     forest resources are sustainably available on an annual \n     basis. For estimating the residue tonnage from logging and \n     site clearing operations and fuel treatment thinnings, a \n     number of important assumptions were made: all forestland \n     areas not currently accessible by roads were excluded; all \n     environmentally sensitive areas were excluded; equipment \n     recovery limitations were considered; and recoverable biomass \n     was allocated into two utilization groups--conventional \n     forest products and biomass for bioenergy and biobased \n     products.\n       From agricultural lands, the United States can produce \n     nearly 1 billion dry tons of biomass annually and still \n     continue to meet food, feed, and export demands. This \n     projection includes 428 million dry tons of annual crop \n     residues, 377 million dry tons of perennial crops, 87 million \n     dry tons of grains used for biofuels, and 106 million dry \n     tons of animal manures, process residues, and other \n     miscellaneous feedstocks. Important assumptions that were \n     made include the following: yields of corn, wheat, and other \n     small grains were increased by 50 percent; the residue-to-\n     grain ratio for soybeans was increased to 2:1; harvest \n     technology was capable of recovering 75 percent of annual \n     crop residues (when removal is sustainable); all cropland was \n     managed with no-till methods; 55 million acres of cropland, \n     idle cropland, and cropland pasture were dedicated to the \n     production of perennial bioenergy crops; all manure in excess \n     of that which can be applied on-farm for soil improvement \n     under anticipated EPA restrictions was used for biofuel; and \n     all other available residues were utilized.\n       The biomass resource potential identified in this report \n     can be produced with relatively modest changes in land use, \n     and agricultural and forestry practices. This potential, \n     however, should not be thought of as an upper limit. It is \n     just one scenario based on a set of reasonable assumptions. \n     Scientists in the Departments of Energy and Agriculture will \n     explore more advanced scenarios that could further increase \n     the amount of biomass available for bioenergy and biobased \n     products.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The reason I am asking to do that is because this \nreport, which was done by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the \nTennessee research facility that is part of our national lab system, \nhas said we currently have enough forestland and agriculture land in \nour country to produce biofuels to meet more than one-third of our \ncurrent transportation demand. We are already doing research at these \nlabs. They are already calculating the numbers. They are already saying \nwe have enough forestland and timberland in our country to produce one-\nthird of our current demand for transportation fuels. So I think this \nreport is very telling that we can and are on our way. It is a matter \nof us setting the goal.\n  I know my colleagues talked earlier a lot about CAFE standards. One \nof the charts that was presented was supposedly information from the \nEnergy Information Administration about CAFE standards. The Energy \nInformation Administration does not have any idea where those numbers \ncame from, and they understand this amendment does not say anything \nabout CAFE standards. It says basically we ought to set a national \ngoal.\n  It is important to set the national goal to get off our \noverdependence of foreign oil because this is who owns the foreign oil. \nThese are the state-owned facilities. These are the countries: Saudi \nArabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Venezuela, Libya. These are the places that \nhave the majority of the world's oil reserves. So our policies for the \nfuture are going to be subject to factors involving these countries, so \nlong as we are so dependent on foreign oil.\n  Now, it is in our economic and security interests to diversify. I \nthink the underlying bill gives us lots of tools to do that, but it \ndoes not set a goal to reduce the amount we are dependent on foreign \noil.\n  My amendment would say, let's reduce the amount so that in future \nyears we actually have a reduction--not the 58 percent we are importing \ntoday, and not the 68 percent of foreign fuel we are going to import in \n25 years, but actually reduce that down to 56 percent so that the trend \nline is going in the other direction. Let's become less dependent on \nforeign oil than we are today. That is the goal of my amendment.\n  I appreciate that my colleagues from Colorado and Illinois are also \nhere to speak on that, so I yield to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, at the outset of my statement on this \nenergy legislation, I want to provide my laudatory comments to the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Domenici, and the ranking member, \nJeff Bingaman, for their great work in pulling together what is a great \npiece of legislation. I also want to say thank you to Alex Flint, Lisa \nEpifani, Sam Fowler, and Bob Simon for their good work as staff members \non the committee.\n  I believe the Energy legislation is a very good first step, and I \nthink the bipartisan nature in which that committee considered the \nlegislation is a good template for other work this Senate Chamber \nengages in. I believe the keystones of energy conservation, renewable \nenergy, new technologies, and balanced development are all very \nimportant parts of this legislation. It is my hope this Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives are able to deliver energy legislation to the \nPresident for his signature in the near future.\n  I will speak more broadly about the Energy bill and its importance to \nAmerica because I do think it is one of the two most important things \nwe are working on on behalf of our Nation today.\n  I believe the energy challenge we face in America and the health care \nchallenge that is bankrupting America's families and businesses are the \ntwo most important things we could be working on as a Senate. But \ntoday, and for at least the week, perhaps several weeks ahead, Senators \nDomenici and Bingaman will lead us through the discussion on what we \nare going to do with respect to the energy imperative.\n  I rise this evening to specifically address the amendment that has \nbeen offered by the Senator from Washington to establish a goal to \nreduce by 40 percent the amount of oil the United States is projected \nto import in 2025. This amendment requests an annual report be \ncompleted that provides information about the progress the United \nStates has made in achieving the goal.\n  When this goal is met, the United States would be positioned to \nreduce imports by 1.5 million barrels per day compared to 2005 import \nnumbers. Those savings would be equivalent to the amount of oil the \nUnited States is currently importing from Saudi Arabia. Section 151 of \nthe Senate Energy bill as written contains an oil savings provision. \nThat provision would direct the President to implement measures \nsufficient to reduce by 2015 the country's projected demand for oil by \n1 million barrels a day.\n  Assuming that all those savings came from import reductions, the \nUnited States would still be importing 14.4 million barrels a day. That \nis over a million barrels a day more than we import today. It strikes \nme as odd to be importing more oil and calling it oil savings. It \nsounds a bit like Washington doublespeak.\n  We need to work toward real energy independence, not away from it. We \nneed to import less oil, not more. We have to stop putting so much \nmoney in the hands of regimes hostile to the United States in the most \nunstable regions of the world. We have to do everything we can to set \nAmerica free from our overdependence on foreign oil.\n  I rise in support of this amendment because it truly represents oil \nsavings. The amendment would reduce our oil imports by 1.5 million \nbarrels per day less than we are importing right now. This is progress. \nThis is the right kind\n\n[[Page S6639]]\n\nof vision for America's future, a vision of energy independence, a \nvision of an America free of foreign oil. These oil savings can be \neasily achieved if we have the vision and the courage to do it. More \nuse of renewable fuels, more efficient vehicles, and the intent to \nactually do something are substantial keys to setting America free \nthrough this energy legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to adopt the Cantwell amendment to \nthe energy legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Cantwell \namendment and ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cantwell for her \nleadership on this amendment. It is going to precipitate a debate which \nshows the difference in outlook between the two political parties. The \ngoal that Senator Cantwell has spelled out is to reduce America's \ndependence on foreign oil. She believes that we are capable as a \nnation, through our innovation, through hard work and bipartisanship, \nto come up with ways to conserve energy, to find alternative fuels, to \nfind environmentally responsible places to seek new oil sources in the \nUnited States; that it is possible for us to lessen dramatically our \ndependence on foreign oil, 40 percent in the next 20 years. That is her \nvision.\n  Does it mean changing the way we live? Slightly. Of course, it does. \nBut it is not too great a sacrifice. Senator Cantwell's vision looks to \nan America that is no longer going hat-in-hand to OPEC saying: Please \ngive us your oil. We cannot survive without it. Understanding that at \nany given moment they can cut off oil supplies and we could watch \nprices skyrocket as they recently have. That is her vision. It is one I \nshare. It is a vision that challenges America to look forward in a \npositive way, look forward to change which lessens our dependence on \noil-producing countries around the world.\n  In 1973, we imported 28 percent of the oil we used. Today, we are up \nto 58 percent. If we don't change our ways in the next 20 years, we \nwill be up to 68 percent. When we are so dependent on foreign oil, we \ngive up our freedom. We allow other governments that provide the oil to \ntax our economy, tax our businesses, tax our lives. We give up our \nfreedom to those who turn on and off this energy spigot and make a \ndifference.\n  When I was a little boy, years and years ago, growing up in East St. \nLouis, IL, I had a great aunt. She was a wonderful lady who, when I \nknew her, was very old. She used to tell us stories about growing up in \nher lifetime. It was Aunt Mame. I always thought it was curious, as a \nlittle boy, that she never referred to the vehicles in the driveway as \ncars or automobiles. She always called them machines. I thought, who in \nthe world would call that a machine? She explained to me that in her \nlifetime, these machines had appeared out of nowhere, taking the place \nof horses and buggies. Getting into a car, which she called a machine, \nwas a big deal for Aunt Mame. I used to laugh, after I left her, with \nmy cousins and say: Can you believe she calls those machines? It \nreflected her mindset. To her, the concept of a car would always be \nsomething new and foreign.\n  I listened today while Republican Senators, such as the Senator from \nMissouri, came to the floor and said they cannot visualize or imagine a \ndifferent kind of car in the future that would be more fuel efficient. \nThey just can't see it. In fact, the Senator from Missouri, when asked \nwhat that car would look like, said it would look like a golf cart. \nThat doesn't demonstrate the same kind of vision of our future.\n  We hear from the other side that the idea of reducing our dependence \non foreign oil is a bad idea. They are wedded to the concept that we \nwill continue to be dependent on foreign oil. The idea of challenging \nAmerica to come up with more fuel-efficient cars and with other ways to \nsave oil is something they don't believe in. They just don't have \nconfidence that American creativity and ingenuity can rise to that \nchallenge. It is a negative and dismal outlook, and they also believe \nthat American drivers and consumers are so selfish they would never \nconsider giving up their Hummers, or their huge cars, if it meant less \ndependence on foreign oil.\n\n  I see the world a lot differently. This Nation comes together time \nand again, sending our best and brightest and bravest over to fight in \nwars, rallying around the war on terrorism after 9/11. We do rise to \nthe challenge. That is what we are all about. The Cantwell amendment \nlays down that challenge.\n  In the underlying bill, almost 800 pages long, section 151 states:\n\n       The President shall develop and implement measures to \n     conserve petroleum and end uses throughout the economy of the \n     United States sufficient to reduce total demand for petroleum \n     in the United States by 1 million barrels per day in the \n     amount projected for calendar 2015.\n\n  This is not a new provision. It is a good one, but it is not a new \none. It was offered by Senator Landrieu of Louisiana the last time we \nhad an energy bill. It passed 99 to 1. Only one Senator thought this \nwas a bad idea. Ninety-nine Senators believed reducing our dependence \non foreign oil was a good idea. This amendment was an important first \nstep.\n  But if the United States reached the savings included in this \nprovision of the bill, we would still be importing 14.4 million barrels \nper day to sustain the economy. That is over 1 million barrels a day \nmore than we import today, allowing America's foreign oil dependence to \ncontinue to grow. We can do better. We can slow our growth in demands \non foreign oil. We can reduce America's use of foreign oil.\n  First, we have to agree on a national goal. That is what the Cantwell \namendment is all about, a goal that recognizes our national security, \nour economic prosperity, our environmental integrity, and makes sure \nthat Americans have good jobs. Those are our high priorities. We must \nagree that sending billions of dollars annually to foreign governments \nto feed our thirst for energy instead of reinvesting that money in the \nUnited States shortchanges our own economy and our future. We must \nagree that sending our daughters and sons, sisters and brothers, \nfathers, uncles, mothers, and aunts into regions of the world, whether \nto establish a national presence or to advance freedom or for the sake \nof securing our future energy supply can be shortsighted and wrong.\n  To be drawn into a war to protect a foreign source of oil is to say \nit is too much to ask someone to change the car they drive, but not too \nmuch to ask them to send their son into combat. I, frankly, think that \nis an easy choice. I believe it is wrong for us to see the world in \nthose terms, that we accept this dependence on foreign oil. That is why \nI strongly support this amendment.\n  This amendment seeks to establish a goal to reduce our projected \nforeign imports by 40 percent over the next 20 years, and 7.6 million \nbarrels a day would be saved. Do you know where that gets us? If we \nmeet that goal in 2025 and reduce foreign imports, we will just begin \nto reduce our foreign imports overall. Today, the United States imports \nover 13 million barrels per day of foreign petroleum. That is the 4-\nmonth average for this year.\n  In 2025, after reaching this goal, we will import 11.8 million \nbarrels per day, a decrease of only 1.5 million barrels per day of our \ncurrent imports.\n  Energy independence is about reducing imports of foreign oil, not \nslowing the growth of our dependence or toeing the line. As long as oil \nremains the sole major fuel source for the American economy, dependence \non foreign imports will remain a geologic and economic fact of life.\n  Last year, I participated in a discussion entitled ``New Energy for \nAmerica, Jobs, Security and Prosperity for the 21st Century.'' The \ndiscussion focused on the need to move America in a direction toward \nmore jobs, security, and prosperity. The speakers included labor \nleaders, business leaders, lawmakers--all with a different message, but \nbasically saying the same thing: We need to move America in a new \ndirection.\n  I have been encouraged by new coalitions, such as Set America Free, \nthe Energy Futures Coalition, and the Apollo Alliance, which \nincorporate unique bedfellows into the same common goals. In a \nbipartisan nature, these groups have shared resources and\n\n[[Page S6640]]\n\nideas because they share the same values: Put America first. Make \nAmerica secure and less dependent upon foreign oil.\n  I appreciate the bipartisan fashion in which Senator Domenici and \nSenator Bingaman and the members of the committee crafted this bill, \nand I hope this amendment becomes a bipartisan amendment.\n  I want to note there are a couple provisions in the bill that take \nsmall steps in the right direction, such as the renewable fuels title \nand the provision to increase the efficiency of heavy-duty trucks by \nreducing the use of diesel power during idling. These are all good \nthings. But we can do more.\n  I will offer an amendment on CAFE standards at a later point. That is \nnot what the Cantwell amendment is about. I have heard the argument \nthat the amendment is a backdoor way to increase CAFE, that that is \nwhere the Cantwell amendment is headed. But it is not. It is about \nsetting a goal, without a prescribed recipe, understanding that we all \nmay believe there are different means by which America can best meet \nthis goal. We all understand it must be our goal.\n  How can we be stronger as a Nation while being dependent upon foreign \noil? How can we talk about growing our economy if we have to beg the \nOPEC cartel for the oil we need? It is a fact of life. If you look at \nthe oil resources that are available around the world, it is pretty \nobvious. Look at this chart. North America. When you look at 2002, we \nhave about 4 percent of the global reserves when it comes to oil. By \n2020, it is going to be 1 percent. The lion's share of the global \nresources is not in America, it is in the Middle East and North Africa. \nSo even if we use all of the current available resources and can bring \nthem forward in an environmentally sensible way, we could not get close \nto our energy demands. We are always going to be dependent on some \nother source from some other part of the world. That is why I think we \nhave to move toward those developments in the use of energy which \nreduce our dependence.\n  Also, let me say this about China. You cannot talk about the world \neconomy and ignore China. You don't see China on this list of \nproducers. It happens to have a growing economy that also is dependent \non foreign oil. But China gets it and the United States does not. Let's \ntake one example. Fuel efficiency in cars. Today, China has higher fuel \nefficiency in cars and trucks than the United States. They get it. They \nunderstand it. If they are dependent on foreign oil, they are going to \nput vehicles on the road that are more fuel efficient. The United \nStates does not. Why? It is worth a moment's discussion.\n  I listened to the Senator from Missouri speak earlier about the \nautomobile industry opposing fuel efficiency, opposing this idea of \nlessening our dependence on foreign oil. There was a time in my \nlifetime when American automobile manufacturers led the world--not only \nin inventing the earliest vehicles, but in developing them, setting the \nstandard for the world. Sadly, that is not the case today. Just a week \nor so ago, General Motors announced 25,000 employees were being laid \noff. Last quarter, General Motors lost a billion dollars. When you look \nat the legacy cost to General Motors, there is a serious concern about \nwhether this former automobile giant can survive. When you also \nconsider the fact that Toyota announced last week that it would raise \nthe prices of cars in the United States so as to allow General Motors \nto raise its prices and stay in business--think of it, the Japanese \nautomobile manufacturer is going to come to the rescue of General \nMotors for fear they would go out of business. You wonder why.\n\n  How can a country that is so good, with an industry that once led the \nworld, be in such bad shape? I think the answer is fairly clear. \nDetroit and the automobile manufacturers of our country focus on making \nmore cars this year of the same kind they made last year. They lack the \nvision to look to the future of what we could do, in terms of making a \nnew generation of automobiles and trucks to serve America's economic \nand family needs, without sacrificing safety. They think it is an \nimpossible dream. While they sit and puzzle over the future, lamenting \nthe possibility of change, sadly, other automobile manufacturers are \ndoing much more.\n  My wife and I decided to buy a new car a few months ago. I wanted to \nbuy an American car. We decided we didn't need a big SUV. We joke in \nour house that if you want to drive a Hummer, you ought to join the \nArmy. We decided to get a modest size car to fit our family needs. We \nwanted it to be fuel efficient. Do you know what? The choices are \npretty limited. There are not many American-made cars that fit the \nstandard. We heard about the Ford Escape hybrid and bought one. It is \ngood, but it is not great. I am glad we are doing a little bit to try \nto reduce our dependence on gasoline in our family and on oil imports \nas a Nation. That hybrid was introduced in the market 2 years after the \nJapanese came out with their car.\n  At a time when there is overwhelming demand for Japanese hybrid \nautomobiles, Detroit still doesn't get it. They are not building that \nsame type of vehicle to compete. I don't understand it. They seem to \nalways miss the new trend and try to convince us to stick with the old \nmodel cars that used to be sold.\n  One of the aspects about this whole debate is security. In a paper \nthat former CIA Director James Woolsey gave to me at a press conference \na day or two ago, he identified six technologies that, with vigorous \nGovernment support, could dramatically change the nature of our fuel \nuse in America over the next 20 years. I will not go through the list, \nbut they are things that are already available. So when some Senators \ncome to the floor and say we cannot imagine how we lessen dependence on \nforeign oil without dramatically tripling the fuel efficiency of cars, \nthey haven't taken the time to do the research. If they did, they would \nunderstand there are plenty of technologies available today to reach \nthose goals. ``I am not sure every one of these is going to be \nimplemented,'' Mr. Woolsey advised, but at least it gives a starting \npoint to make the changes.\n  The right mix and standards and incentives are out there. I believe \nwe can find the right set of financial incentives and standards that \nmeet our goal. There are a lot of cynics. They probably had a lot \naround when Henry Ford said you don't need a horse to get around. But \nthe fact is we know we can rise to this challenge as a nation.\n  I fully appreciate that in 10 years we may make technological \nadvances we cannot fathom today. I didn't think I would be driving a \nhybrid vehicle a few years ago or carrying around 2,300 songs on an \nIPOD in my pocket. You cannot think small in America. You have to think \nbig. Sadly, the naysayers and negative voices on the other side of the \naisle cannot envision America growing with this technology and becoming \nmore fuel efficient. I think there are creative and visionary people on \nboth sides of the aisle. I hope they will support this amendment.\n  We can test the innovation of America, and I know we can rise to that \nchallenge. We burn 10,000 gallons of oil per second today in the United \nStates--10,000 gallons per second. We use four times more oil than any \nother Nation, even though we know that the United States contains just \n3 percent of the world's proven oil reserves.\n  Two-thirds of the world reserves are located in the Persian Gulf \nregion. In fact, the Saudi state-run oil company alone has 30 times the \nreserves of ExxonMobil, the largest American company. Today, nine out \nof ten reserve-richest companies in the world are owned by foreign \ngovernments.\n  Do you understand how that makes the United States subservient to \nthese governments when it comes to our economic future? They own the \noil we need to exist, and unless we start weaning ourselves from this \ndependence on foreign oil, it will just get worse.\n  A study published by the Rocky Mountain Institute found that in 2000, \noil imports cost $109 billion and comprised 24 percent of that year's \ngoods and services trade deficit. In 2003, that figure rose to $10 \nbillion a month, $120 billion. What could we do with $10 billion fed \ninto the U.S. economy instead of into these oil-rich nations around the \nworld?\n  On the Web site for the Set America Free Coalition, there is a link \ncalled, ``The True Cost of Oil.'' This is often a\n\n[[Page S6641]]\n\nsensitive subject. Whenever externalities are calculated into the \noverall cost, there is often wiggle room for debate. However, on this \nWeb site, Set America Free has a link to the National Defense Council \nFoundation's summary of the hidden cost of imported oil.\n  The report finds that the economic impact of U.S. dependence on \nimported oil includes almost $49 billion in annual defense outlays to \nmaintain the capability to defend the flow of Persian Gulf oil, the \nequivalent of $1.17 to the price of every gallon of gasoline; the loss \nof 828,000 jobs in the U.S. economy because we are depending on foreign \noil; and the loss of $159 billion in GNP, not to mention $13.4 billion \nin Federal and State revenues. Total economic penalties from our \nimportation of oil, $297 billion to $304 billion every year. And the \nvoices on the other side objecting to this Cantwell amendment are \ncontent to let those figures grow. I think that is just plain wrong.\n  One final striking figure is the cost of periodic oil shocks the U.S. \neconomy has experienced over the last three decades. They estimate they \nhave cost us $2.2 trillion to $2.5 trillion.\n  Today, vulnerabilities in oil infrastructure could easily send oil \nprices skyrocketing.\n  We all know about terrorism and terrorism in the Middle East. \nUnstable governments in Iraq and Saudi Arabia can certainly threaten \nthe U.S. supply, not to mention Iran.\n  Finally, I would like to note that the money we spend annually in the \nMiddle East to feed our oil thirst goes directly to the production of \nhate literature throughout the region. So today, while American men and \nwomen are fighting in Iraq, the U.S. consumers continue to send \nbillions of dollars overseas funneled off to support operations that \ncompletely undermine our service men and women overseas.\n  Can we not see the connection here, that in this same Middle East, \nwhere we are sacrificing and have lost 1,700 American lives in combat, \nour enemies are being fed by our dependence on foreign oil?\n  We have seen the dramatic surge in Chinese economic growth at a rate \nof 7 percent a year. This week's U.S. News & World Report cover story \nis, ``The China Challenge: What the Awakening Giant will Mean for \nAmerica.'' China is the world's most populated country, with 1.2 \nbillion. In 2003, China overtook Japan as the second largest oil-\nconsuming nation in the world, and projections are that the Chinese \ndemand for oil will double by 2025.\n  Mr. President, I see that the majority leader is on the floor. He has \nasked to be recognized. I yield the floor to the majority leader for \nwhatever purpose and then reclaim my time after he is finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I apologize for the interruption. A number \nof people have called asking for the schedule for tonight in terms of \nvoting.

BERNANKE TO BE A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC \n                                ADVISERS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to consideration of Calendar No. 151.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Ben S. Bernanke, of New \nJersey, to be a member of the Council of Economic Advisers.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to state my opposition to \nthe nomination Dr. Ben S. Bernanke to be a member of the President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisors.\n  Mr. Bernanke is a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve, and he has previously come before the Senate Banking \nCommittee. I voted for his nomination in committee and on the Senate \nfloor to become member of the Board of Governors. I supported him based \non our conversation in a private meeting we had in my office. As \nMembers of the Senate and those who follow the Senate know, I have had \nsome concerns about the Federal Reserve.\n  One of my biggest concerns is that the Federal Open Market \nCommittee--FOMC--suffers from group think which seems to have no cure--\nbecause it seems to me that no one ever challenges Chairman Alan \nGreenspan.\n  I think for the FOMC to function properly, members must be true to \ntheir convictions and challenge the chairman. No chairman should be \nable to dominate without dissent. There must be intellectual sparring \nso all of the committee members are heard and the FOMC can come up with \nthe best decision for our country. The FOMC needs independent voices.\n  Governor Bernanke promised me he would be an independent voice. He \npromised me he would stand up to the chairman if the thought he was \nwrong or was being rolled. He promised that he would be that \nindependent voice on the FOMC that would challenge the chairman if he \nthought he was wrong.\n  Sadly, I have not seen very much evidence of his independence--or \nanyone else's independence for that matter. I have not seen him ever \nvote against the chairman. I have not seen him use his bully pulpit to \nchallenge the chairman. As far as I can tell, they have not had a major \ndisagreement. I find it hard to believe that he and Chairman Greenspan \nthink exactly the same about all of these diverse and important \nopinions within the FOMC.\n  I As important as I think it is for a member of the FOMC to be \nindependent, it is more important for the head of the President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisors--CEA--to be independent. The chairman of \nthe CEA must stand up to the President when he believes the President \nis wrong. He must challenge him. And based on his performance at the \nFOMC, I am not convinced that Mr. Bernanke will do that.\n  Because he has not convinced this Senator that he will be an \nindependent voice, I regretfully cannot support his nomination.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I know of no further debate on this \nnomination, and we are ready for the Chair to put the question. \nHowever, I note for the Record that Senator Bunning is opposed to this \nnomination and would have voted in the negative. We appreciate him \nallowing us to go forward and duly note his opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Ben S. Bernanke, of New Jersey, to be a \nmember of the Council of Economic Advisers?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. FRIST. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the President \nbe immediately notified of the Senate's actions and that the Senate \nthen return to legislative session.\n\n[[Page S6642]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Kansas waiting \npatiently. I do not want him to sit here and miss the picnic. I will \njust speak for a few minutes more.\n  The point I was trying to make when I yielded to the majority leader \nis there is dramatic growth in the Chinese economy, and with that \ngrowth, there will be an increase in their demand for oil. They will be \ncompeting with the United States around the world.\n  We will find the old laws of supply and demand will not work. \nIncreased demand without increasing supply means higher prices. So we \nwill be in competition for this foreign oil, paying more for it, \nwatching our economy strangled by this dependence on foreign oil.\n  Obviously, there are some who say that is fine, that is the way life \nis, get ready for it. We do not see it that way. On the Democratic side \nof the aisle, the Cantwell amendment sets a goal of reducing this \ndependence on foreign oil by 40 percent over the next 20 years. It is \nan achievable goal. People who follow this closely will tell you there \nare variety of ways to achieve it. The measures that can be used, short \nof changing CAFE standards, which I support personally--but if you do \nnot want to change CAFE standards, there is market growth in hybrid \nvehicles, industrial, residential, and aviation efficiency, heavy-duty \ntruck efficiency gains, replacement tires--that sounds like a small \nthing but it turns out to be a large element in increasing fuel \nefficiency--transportation choices, such as mass transit and growth in \nbiofuels.\n  All of these are here. The National Commission on Energy Policy has \ncome up with these recommendations and have given us things we can \npoint to, to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle just do not want to concede this \npoint. They are obviously prepared to accept this indefinitely, that \nour dependence on foreign oil will grow. But how can that make us \nstronger as a Nation, how can that make us more secure? It moves us in \nthe wrong direction.\n  There may be some who profit from our dependence on foreign oil, but \nit is not the American economy, and it is certainly not the American \ntaxpayers, nor the sons and daughters who are serving overseas \ndefending America's interests.\n  Furthermore, unstable governments, in Iraq, in Saudi Arabia also \nthreaten U.S. supply.\n  Finally, I would like to note that the money that we spend annually \nin the Middle East to feed our oil thirst, goes directly to the \nproduction of hate literature throughout the region. So today, while \nAmerican men and women are fighting in Iraq, the U.S. continues to send \nbillions of dollars overseas that are funneled off to support \noperations that completely undermine our service people's efforts \nthere.\n  In the past few years we have witnessed China's surging economic \ngrowth. China's real gross domestic product is growing at a rate of 7 \npercent a year. In the U.S. News and World Report this week, the cover \nstory is, ``The China Challenge, What the awakening giant will mean for \nAmerica.''\n  China is the world's most populated country with 1.2 billion people.\n  In 2003, China overtook Japan as the second largest oil consuming \nnation in the world and projections are that Chinese demand for oil \nwill double by 2025, nearly meeting current U.S. imports. The US News \nreports notes that China's economy is expected to surpass Japan's by \n2020, making it the second largest in the world.\n  Recent data indicates that the number of automobiles in China has \ngrown 19 percent annually, surpassing Germany with the number of cars \nthey have on their roads. By the year 2010 China is expected to have 90 \ntimes more cars than in 1990. Consequently, China could surpass the \ntotal number of cars in the U.S. by 2030.\n  China's oil consumption has grown by 7.5 percent per year reaching a \ncurrent daily demand of about 6.4 million barrels a day, yet China's \noil production is flat at around 3.4 million barrels per day.\n  Currently, 58 percent of China's oil imports come from the Middle \nEast and it is projected that by 2015, the share of Middle East oil \nwill reach 70 percent.\n  With projected growth in automobiles, projected oil demand in China \ncould increase to 15 million barrels a day by 2020.\n  This growth in demand will increase global competition for oil \nresources, likely to increase, not decrease the price of crude oil.\n  While China is attempting to diversity its oil interests, like the \nUnited States, China recognizes that the world's most substantial oil \nreserves are in the Middle East.\n  If we look at this chart, we can clearly see that in 2020, 83 percent \nof projected global reserves based on current production rates will be \nin the Middle East. The United States and China will be in very similar \npositions with regard to domestic oil reserves.\n  A story last week's Washington Post reported that nationally, daily \nproduction of oil and natural gas liquids dropped last year to an \naverage of 7.2 million barrels a day, a 36 percent decrease since \npeaking in 1970. And at Prudhoe Bay, average daily production last year \nwas about 450,000 barrels a day, a 72 percent drop from its peak, and \nproduction is expected to continue to drop.\n  What does this mean for the U.S.? Our increasing decline in domestic \nproduction and growing global demand on Middle East oil supply could \nhave serious implications on foreign policy. A report by the U.S.-China \nSecurity Review Commission, a group created by Congress, warned:\n\n       A key driver in China's relations with terrorist-sponsoring \n     governments is its dependence on foreign oil to fuel its \n     economic development. This dependency is expected to increase \n     over the coming decade.\n\n  China is already competing with us for world supply, and this \ncompetition is--not may--is going to increase.\n  It is very clear from China's economic growth, with India emerging as \nwell, that the United States, if it continues on the current course, \nfeeding its thirst for energy using foreign oil, will face increasing \npressures caused by increasing demand and tightening supply.\n  Inevitably the production decisions of foreign nations and \norganizations like OPEC, will determine the price of our energy, and in \nturn control of our economy and America's national security.\n  Earlier this year, in April, the price of a barrel of oil rose above \n$55, today it is hovering around $53. With the increase in crude prices \nin the spring, gas prices jumped too, increasing 40 or more cents per \ngallon in many parts of the country since that time last year. While we \nhave witnessed a slow drop in gas prices, they still remain over $2 per \ngallon in much of the country.\n  An AP report noted yesterday that oil prices rose yesterday on news \nthat OPEC may increase production quotas, and that oil prices will \nremain high well into 2006, even if the production ceiling is raised.\n  In this same report, a group of finance ministers from the Group of \nEight industrialized nations, over the weekend, called for greater \ninvestment in increased energy efficiency and alternative sources of \nenergy. They noted that sustained high energy prices ``are of \nsignificant concern since they hamper global economic growth.''\n  Not only do high oil prices hamper global economic growth, they \nhamper America's economic growth.\n  Back when oil was $43 per barrel, the International Air Transport \nAssociation estimated that the airlines would lose $5.5 billion. \nYesterday's oil price, however was $10 higher than this, $53.47\n\n[[Page S6643]]\n\nper barrel, pushing this overall figure even higher. Fuel costs are the \nsecond biggest cost for our nation's airlines.\n  The chief of the IATA said that each dollar rise in the cost of oil \nboosts the industry's total fuel costs by about a billion dollars \nannually.\n  Airlines, many on the verge of bankruptcy like United Airlines in my \nState, cannot afford this. Workers and retirees are impacted with wage \nand benefits cuts. United Airlines reported that their fuel costs \nsoared $200 million in just the first quarter of 2005.\n  And in this industry, where fuel makes up such a large portion on the \ncompanies operating budget, fuel efficiency is leading purchase \ndecisions.\n  For instance, the next Boeing jetliner, the 787, is projected to be \n20 percent more fuel efficient than its predecessors, key factor being \ncited by airlines like Air Canada and others who have placed orders for \nthe new model.\n  The economic toll that rising energy costs has on the industrial \nsector is also large. For instance a $1 increase in the price of oil \ncosts U.S. companies and consumers about $828 million in trucking costs \neach year.\n  And families are impacted too, making hard decisions as the money \ngasoline they pump into their gas tanks eats at a bigger portion of \ntheir paycheck.\n  I raise these issues because I think we can help move America in a \ndirection whereby reducing demand will help to insulate our economy, \nour jobs and our national security from oil prices spikes brought on by \neither production quotas, infrastructure delivery implications or \ninstability in foreign countries.\n  There is potential job growth if America embraces a new vision. For \ninstance, a report completed by the Renewable Fuels Association \nestimated that doubling the production of ethanol could create 234,840 \nnew jobs in all sectors of the U.S. economy--help communities grow and \nrejuvenate cities.\n  Advancing technological innovation can encourage our traditionally \nrobust manufacturing sectors provide new parts and products that we \nwill need to meet our goals. Cynics point to what we know, increasing \nfuel economy standards, visionaries embrace new ideas, advancing \nengineering design, alternative fuels, hybrids, hydrogen--and who knows \nwhat next.\n  Building new infrastructure or retooling factories are jobs that will \nbe in America--not oversees. These jobs will provide stronger markets \nfor goods and labor--reinvigorating some cities across the U.S.\n  Yesterday, Mr. Woolsey noted in our press conference that the U.S. \nborrows $4 billion annually to buy foreign oil. If each billion spent \nabroad were spent in the United States, we could create 10,000-20,000 \nAmerican jobs, many in rural communities.\n  Technological change and advancement has always been a recipe for \nsuccess for America. From the Wright brother's flier to the creation of \nthe personal computer, we have created ways to advance and provide jobs \nfor Americans while doing so.\n  But America needs to agree that we have to move in this direction. \nThe Cantwell ``40 in 20'' Amendment establishes the goal that moves the \nU.S. forward.\n  Earlier on the floor today, I heard one of my colleagues say that it \nis not possible to reach the goal established by this amendment. First, \nhow do we know if we do not try. Second, I challenge American's to do \nso--because it is our Nation's best interest.\n  The AP story yesterday noted that an energy analyst cautioned that, \nwhat is the so-called ``global depletion midpoint''--the point at which \nroughly half of oil reserves have been tapped and production can no \nlonger be increased--could come by the end of the decade.\n  For me, I believe that we have no choice but to turn around before \nit's too late.\n  In May 1961, President John F. Kennedy set the goal of landing an \nAmerican on the moon. He did not prescribe to scientists how to get an \nAmerican to the Moon; he set the goal, and provided the resources to \nmeet that goal. Only nine years later, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin \nmade the first human steps on the Moon. I know there were skeptics at \nthe time--I wasn't one of them, but there were--thinking a man couldn't \nwalk on the Moon. But we did, and we've done so much more since.\n  When American's are challenged they have proven that they can and \nwill rise to the occasion.\n  I encourage each one of my colleagues to think long and hard about \nthis amendment and what vision they have for America.\n  If you want an America whose economy is strapped to the whims of \nforeign governments and supply shocks of foreign oil, then vote no on \nthis amendment.\n  If you believe that America's great thinkers, innovators, scientists \nand businesses cannot create the solutions that we need to reach this \ngoal then you should vote no on this amendment.\n  If you believe that we cannot create more jobs by increasing \ndomestically produced fuels, then you should vote no on this amendment.\n  But if you want a different America, one where your children or \ngrandchildren can don a lab-coat instead of a flack-jacket; where \nenergy solutions can create jobs, protect the environment and safeguard \npublic health and believe that America's economic prosperity and \nnational security are our highest priority, I encourage you to vote yes \non the Cantwell energy security amendment.\n  In keeping with the bipartisan nature of this bill to date, I \nencourage all my colleagues to pass this amendment and move America \ntoward an energy independent future.\n  The Cantwell amendment moves us in the right direction, reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil and reducing our dependence on the nations \nthat supply that oil.\n  Critics have come to the Senate floor and said: Well, she does not \nspell out how to do it. This bill spells out many ways that we could \nmove toward less dependence on foreign oil, and because it is a good \nbipartisan bill, I am looking forward to supporting it.\n  These things which I have noted are already existing technology that \ncan be used to move us toward this goal. For those of us who have a \npositive, optimistic view of the creativity and freedom in America, the \nCantwell amendment sets us on a goal that America should achieve on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in \nsupporting the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, during Senate vote No. 139, pertaining to \namendment No. 779, I was necessarily absent. Had I been present, I \nintended to vote ``yes.''

Mr. President, I rise today in an attempt once again to \nresolve an intelligence-related issue with regard to the nomination of \nUnder Secretary John Bolton to be the U.S. Representative to the United \nNations. As my colleagues are probably aware, for some time I have been \nengaged in an effort to assist my colleagues on the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee with some concerns they have with regard to Mr. \nBolton and his request for U.S. person identities that are contained in \ncertain intelligence reports.\n  The last time I came to the floor of the Senate, I spoke at length \nabout Mr. Bolton's requests. After reviewing the actual reports and \nexamining the process whereby he was provided the information that he \nsought, it was apparent to me that Mr. Bolton's requests were not only \nappropriate but very routine. As far as I was concerned, that was the \nend of the matter, and I so indicated in my response to the chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar, in a letter.\n  Based on statements by some of my colleagues, concerns about Mr. \nBolton's requests for identities have apparently expanded to include \nwhether the Under Secretary sought these identities to exert some form \nof retribution against certain Government officials. Although the \nForeign Relations Committee's minority views and statements made by \nminority members seem to indicate that the universe of these officials, \nor their concerns about\n\n[[Page S6644]]\n\nthese officials, is very small, it is now very clear that this universe \nis indeed expanding, if not exploding. In fact, in a response I \nreceived from the distinguished ranking member, Senator Biden, and \nSenator Dodd, we have gone from the innermost planets in our solar \nsystem of their concern to include the entire Milky Way. I have \ninformed my colleagues that I could not support such a request because \nit appears to be more of an effort to preserve this issue, this \nstalemate, this what some people call a filibuster, than an effort to \nresolve it.\n  I also informed Senators Biden and Dodd, however, that I could \nrecommend a more focused request that is consistent with their public \nstatements in their minority views. I believe that such a request could \nbe a basis for moving this process forward, a goal I hoped we all \nshared to get the process moving.\n  In the interest of moving forward, I urged my colleagues to \nreconsider the scope of their request. The response quite frankly was, \nno, thank you. That is probably the nicest way I can put it. I believe \ntheir bottom line is now: Give us all of the names we have now put in \nplay or no deal.\n  As members of the legislative branch, we have all been in the \nposition of requesting information from the executive branch and being \ntold no. That is not pleasant. That is not what we would like to hear \nfrom the executive branch. But we do understand--I think, I hope--that \nthere are limits to what we can demand and expect to receive. That is \njust a fact of life as we negotiate the separation of powers between \nthe two branches of Government.\n  My colleagues know full well that an absolutist will inevitably lead \nto a stalemate, and that is what has happened. That is why we tried to \nwork in good faith to address our concerns while recognizing each \nbranch's responsibility and their prerogatives.\n  In my experience, a middle ground is usually achievable. It may take \ntime, but usually we can achieve it. In this case, I believe the \nadministration was willing to meet my colleagues halfway. In other \nwords, if they would provide a reasonable list of names based on actual \nfindings by the committee, perhaps they could be assured that those \nnames were not contained in the reports and their concerns would be \nsimply allayed, while at the same time it would permit the executive to \npreserve its prerogative to control the dissemination of very sensitive \ninformation.\n  Let me just say that signals intelligence and intercepts is in the \nhighest compartmented criteria in regards to intelligence information. \nSo this is very sensitive.\n  Once again, I think that the middle ground, unfortunately, proved \nvery elusive. I am sympathetic to my colleagues' desire to see \ninformation they deem necessary to their consideration of Mr. Bolton's \nnomination. I do not believe, however, that they should be imposing \ntheir standard on the entire Senate. The last cloture vote clearly \ndemonstrated that a clear majority believes that the Senate does \npossess the sufficient information to vote on Mr. Bolton's nomination, \nand vote we should.\n  With that said, I am prepared to go one step further, in one last \ngood-faith effort, to try to alleviate the concerns expressed by my \ncolleagues across the aisle. Because my colleagues would not share \ntheir list of names with me, I have taken what may be viewed as the \nsomewhat unorthodox step of compiling a list of names that I believe do \nactually reflect the universe of individuals who fall within the \nparameters set by my colleagues' public statements and their minority \nviews.\n  I am not doing this with temerity. I am trying to make a good-faith \neffort, and I hope people appreciate my intent in the doing of this. I \nwant my colleagues to know that I have done this in a sincere effort to \nmove this process forward. I do not in any way wish to substitute my \njudgment for my colleagues', but I do hope we can reach some sort of an \naccommodation. So I have submitted my list of names to the Director of \nNational Intelligence, John Negroponte, and he has assured me that none \nof them are among the names requested by Under Secretary Bolton.\n  The names I submitted included Carl Ford, Assistant Secretary of \nState for Intelligence and Research, his name is not in the intercepts; \nChristian Westermann of the INR, State Department intelligence branch, \nnot in the intercepts; the individual known as Mr. Smith, not in the \nintercepts; Rexon Ryu, State Department official, not in the \nintercepts; Charles L. Pritchard, special envoy for negotiations with \nNorth Korea, not in the intercepts.\n  There were two other individuals referenced in the minority views \nwhose names have not been made public, and I will not do so now. \nHowever, I did submit their names, and they were not in the intercepts. \nI am more than willing to share the two names with my colleagues on the \nForeign Relations Committee, but I will not discuss them publicly.\n  Finally, the Foreign Relations Committee's minority views also \nreferenced two other unnamed individuals. I understand, however, that \nthe committee itself is not aware of who these people are, and \ntherefore it is highly unlikely that those names would be part of \nanybody's list. They were certainly not on mine.\n  I strongly believe this compromise represents the best middle ground \nand should more than satisfy the concerns of my colleagues. These are \nthe names that were mentioned in the minority views. These are the \nnames that were mentioned in regard to the people who were interviewed. \nThese are the names that have been referred to in the press and the \nmedia over and over again. That is what this universe is about.\n  I am very hopeful that this should more than satisfy the concerns of \nmy colleagues, unless, of course, they are not interested in being \nsatisfied, and if that is the case, there is really nothing further \nanybody can do to move this process forward.\n  I believe it is high time that we vote on this nomination, up or \ndown, whichever way the chips fall. I urge my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to take the next step, whether they are in favor of Mr. \nBolton's nomination or not, whether they are for him or they are \nopposed. We have made some strides recently, it seems to me, in moving \nnominations to a vote. It seems to me we should continue that trend \nwith Mr. Bolton's nomination and get on with the business of the \nSenate.\n  I hope I have been helpful. I hope people do not take my actions in \nthe wrong way. I am acting in good faith in the very best way I know \nhow to reach a compromise to alleviate the concerns of my friends \nacross the aisle. I hope that has been the case in regards to my \nremarks this evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, with the passing of former Senator \nJim Exon on Friday, a giant oak in the forest of public service has \nfallen. Political historians will remember him as a dominant force in \nNebraska politics across nearly 3 decades, serving two terms as \nGovernor and three as Senator. Those of us who were privileged to be \nhis friend remember him, first and foremost, as a man of enormous \ndecency, integrity, and common sense. We remember his quick mind; his \nslow, gravelly voice; his Midwestern directness and unpretentiousness.\n  Here on the Senate floor, I am privileged to sit at the same desk \nthat Senator Exon used during the last of his 18 years in the Senate. I \ninherited it upon his retirement in 1996, and I have always considered \nit a special honor to carry on where he left off.\n  Of course, for people in Iowa, Jim Exon was a next-door neighbor. \nOver the years, Iowans got to know him well\n\n[[Page S6645]]\n\nas a stalwart friend of family farmers; as a tireless promoter of rural \neconomic development; and, a time when the bioeconomy was in its \ninfancy, as a true believer in the future of ethanol and other home-\ngrown, renewable sources of energy.\n  Jim Exon was not just present at the creation of the ethanol \nindustry, he was an important midwife of that industry. He took office \nas Governor in 1970, and in 1971 he created the Nebraska Ethanol Board. \nIn the ensuing years of ethanol's infancy, it was Nebraska and Iowa \nthat led the way in establishing this industry. At every step, Jim Exon \nwas there as an advocate and champion.\n  I will always remember my partnership with Senator Exon and Senator \nJohn Melcher of Montana on the 1985 farm bill. We fought long and hard \nto fend off attacks on safety-net programs for family farmers. Night \nafter night, we kept the Senate in session into the early hours of the \nmorning. And, thanks to Jim's leadership and sheer relentlessness, we \ncarried the day.\n  Throughout his political career, Jim Exon prided himself on reaching \nacross party lines and forging bipartisan consensus. This is very much \na Nebraska tradition, going back to the legendary George Norris, who \nfounded the State's unicameral Legislature. Jim succeeded as a Democrat \nin an overwhelmingly Republican State because he knew how to reach out, \nhow to unite people around shared interests. Senator Ben Nelson, a \nlong-time friend and protege of Jim Exon, prides himself on continuing \nthis tradition of bipartisanship and bridge-building.\n  They didn't call him Big Jim for nothing. He was big physically, tall \nand imposing. He was big politically--the only Nebraskan since George \nNorris to win five consecutive statewide elections. And Jim was big-\nhearted, a tough, relentless man, but also a compassionate person who \ncared deeply about other people and their wellbeing.\n  As a public official, he was an old- fashioned fiscal conservative. \nHe railed against what he called ``wild-eyed spenders.'' As Governor, \nhe repeatedly vetoed the Legislature's spending bills, 141 vetoes in \nall. And, here in the Senate, he took on Republicans and Democrats \nalike who, in his eyes, were being reckless with the taxpayer's dollar.\n  Senator Jim Exon has been lying in state in the Rotunda of the \nNebraska Capitol. Funeral services will be held this afternoon at the \nsame location. So, today, the Senate says farewell to a truly \ndistinguished former member. Jim was a good friend to me, and he was \nmuch beloved in this body. Today, our thoughts are with him, his \nfamily, and the people of Nebraska. May Jim rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/15/senate-section/article/S6645-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6645-S6647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            AGAINST RACE-BASED GOVERNMENT IN HAWAII, PART II\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to ask unanimous consent that \nthe following analysis of S. 147, the Native Hawaiian Government \nReorganization Act, prepared by constitutional scholar Bruce Fein, be \nentered into the Record following my present remarks.\n  Mr. Fein's analysis of the act builds on his analysis of the 1993 \napology resolution, which was printed in the Record yesterday. Mr. \nFein's present analysis ably demonstrates why the Native Hawaiian \nGovernment Act is at war with the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of \nrights and its limits on governmental power. The bill is particularly \noffensive to the fundamental principle of equal protection of the laws. \nI commend Mr. Fein's analysis of the act to my colleagues.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         [From the Grassroot Institute of Hawaii June 1, 2005]\n\n                            (By Bruce Fein)\n\n Hawaii Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand--An Analysis of the Akaka \n                                  Bill\n\n       The Akaka Bill pivots generally on the same falsehoods and \n     mischaracterizations as the Apology. It further celebrates a \n     race-based government entity in flagrant violation of the \n     non-discrimination mandates of the Fifth, Fourteenth and \n     Fifteenth Amendments.\n       Section 1 misleads by naming the Act the ``Native Hawaiian \n     Government Reorganization Act of 2005.'' As amplified above, \n     there has never been a government in Hawaii for Native \n     Hawaiians alone since Kamehameha established the Kingdom in \n     1810. Something that has never been cannot be reorganized.\n       Section 2 makes twenty-three findings that are either false \n     or misleading.\n       Finding (1) asserts that Congress enjoys constitutional \n     authority to address the conditions of the indigenous, native \n     people of the United States. But the finding fails to \n     identify the constitutional source of that power, or how it \n     differs from the power of Congress to address the conditions \n     of every American citizen. Congress does not find that Native \n     Hawaiians were ever subjugated or victimized by racial \n     discrimination or prevented from maintaining and celebrating \n     a unique culture. Moreover, the United States Supreme Court \n     explicitly repudiated congressional power to arbitrarily \n     designate a body of people as an Indian tribe in United \n     States v. Sandoval 231 U.S. 28, 45 (1913). As Alice Thurston \n     unequivocally stated arguing for Interior Secretary Babbitt \n     in Connecticut v. Babbitt 228 F.3d, 82 (2nd Cir. 2000) ``When \n     the Department of the Interior recognizes a tribe, it is not \n     saying, `You are now a tribe.' It is saying, `We recognize \n     that your sovereignty exists.' We don't create tribes out of \n     thin air.'' [Footnote: Jeff Benedict, Without Reservation \n     (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 2000) 349.]\n       Finding (2) asserts that Native Hawaiians are indigenous, \n     native people of the United States. The finding is dubious. \n     Native Hawaiians probably migrated to the Islands from other \n     lands and remained as interlopers.\n       Finding (3) falsely asserts that the United States ``has a \n     special political and legal responsibility to promote the \n     welfare of the native people of the United States, including \n     Native Hawaiians.'' No such responsibility is imposed by the \n     Constitution or laws of the United States. No decision of the \n     United States Supreme Court has ever recognized such a \n     responsibility. Indeed, Congress would be acting \n     constitutionally if it abolished all tribal sovereignty that \n     it has extended by unilateral legislation.\n       Finding (4) recites various treaties between the Kingdom of \n     Hawaii and the United States from 1826 to 1893. The finding \n     is as irrelevant to the proposed legislation as the \n     heliocentric theory of the universe.\n       Finding (5) falsely declares that the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act (HHCA) set aside approximately 203,500 acres \n     of land to address the conditions of Native Hawaiians in the \n     then federal territory. In fact, the HHCA established a \n     homesteading program for only a small segment of a racially \n     defined class of Hawaii's citizens. Its intended \n     beneficiaries were not and are not now ``Native Hawaiians'' \n     as defined in the Akaka bill (i.e., those with any degree of \n     Hawaiian ancestry, no matter how attenuated), but exclusively \n     those with 50 percent or more Hawaiian ``blood''--a \n     limitation which still applies with some exceptions for \n     children of homesteaders who may inherit a homestead lease if \n     the child has at least 25 percent Hawaiian ``blood.''\n       The HHCA was enacted by Congress in 1921 based on \n     stereotyping of ``native Hawaiians'' (50% blood quantum) as \n     characteristic of ``peoples raised under a communist or \n     feudal system'' needing to ``be protected against their own \n     thriftlessness''. The racism of Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 US \n     537, (1896) was then in its heyday. If that derogatory \n     stereotyping were ever a legitimate basis for Federal \n     legislation, Adarand Constructors v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200 \n     (1995) and a simple regard for the truth deprive it of any \n     validity today.\n       Finding (6) asserts that the land set aside assists Native \n     Hawaiians in maintaining distinct race-based settlements, an \n     illicit constitutional objective under Buchanan and \n     indistinguishable in principle from South Africa's execrated \n     Bantustans.\n       Finding (7) notes that approximately 6,800 Native Hawaiian \n     families reside on the set aside Home Lands and an additional \n     18,000 are on the race-based waiting list. These racial \n     preferences in housing are not remedial. They do not rest on \n     proof of past discrimination (which does not exist). The \n     preferences are thus flagrantly unconstitutional. See \n     Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469 (1989); Adarand \n     Constructors, supra.\n       Finding (8) notes that the statehood compact included a \n     ceded lands trust for five purposes, one of which is the \n     betterment of Native Hawaiians. As elaborated above, the 20 \n     percent racial set aside enacted in the 1978 statue violates \n     the general color-blindness mandate of the Constitution.\n       Finding (9) asserts that Native Hawaiians have continuously \n     sought access to the ceded lands to establish and maintain \n     native settlements and distinct native communities throughout \n     the State. Those objectives are constitutionally \n     indistinguishable from the objectives of whites during the \n     ugly decades of Jim Crow to promote an exclusive white \n     culture exemplified in Gone with the Wind or The Invisible \n     Man. The United States Constitution protects all cultures, \n     except for those rooted in racial discrimination or \n     hierarchies.\n       Finding (10) asserts that the Home Lands and other ceded \n     lands are instrumental in the ability of the Native Hawaiian \n     community to celebrate Native Hawaiian culture and to \n     survive. That finding is generally false. The United States \n     Constitution fastidiously safeguards Native Hawaiians like \n     all other groups in their cultural distinctiveness or \n     otherwise. There is but one exception. A culture that \n     demands racial discrimination against outsiders is \n     unconstitutional and is not worth preserving. Further, as \n     Senator Inouye himself has proclaimed, Native Hawaiians \n     and other citizens are thriving in harmony as a model for \n     other racially diverse communities under the banner of the \n     United States Constitution.\n\n[[Page S6646]]\n\n       Finding (11) asserts that Native Hawaiians continue to \n     maintain other distinctively native areas in Hawaii. Racial \n     discrimination in housing, however, is illegal under the Fair \n     Housing Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1871, and the Equal \n     Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if state action \n     is implicated.\n       Finding (12) notes the enactment of the Apology Resolution, \n     which is riddled with falsehoods and mischaracterizations as \n     amplified above.\n       Finding (13) repeats falsehoods in the Apology Resolution. \n     Contrary to its assertions, the Monarchy was overthrown \n     without the collusion of the United States or its agents; the \n     Native Hawaiian people enjoyed no more inherent sovereignty \n     under the kingdom than did non-Native Hawaiians; in any \n     event, sovereignty at the time of the overthrow rested with \n     Queen Lilioukalani, not the people; the public lands of \n     Hawaii belonged no more to Native Hawaiians than to non-\n     Native Hawaiians; and, there was never a legal or moral \n     obligation of the United States or the Provisional Government \n     after the overthrow to obtain the consent of Native Hawaiians \n     to receive control over government or crown lands. No Native \n     Hawaiian lost a square inch of land by the overthrow.\n       Finding (14) repeats the Apology Resolution's nonsense of a \n     need to reconcile with Native Hawaiians when there has never \n     been an estrangement, as testified to by the 1994 remarks of \n     Senator Inouye.\n       Finding (15) corroborates the obvious: namely, that the \n     United States Constitution fully protects Native Hawaiians in \n     celebrating their culture, just as it does the Amish or any \n     other group desiring to depart from the mainstream.\n       Findings (16), (17), and (18) similarly corroborates that \n     the United States Constitution guarantees religious or \n     cultural freedom to Native Hawaiians as it does for any other \n     distinctive group. On the other hand, the finding falsely \n     asserts that Native Hawaiians enjoy a right to self-\n     determination, i.e., a right to establish an independent \n     race-based nation or sovereignty. The Civil War definitively \n     established that no individual or group in the United States \n     enjoys a right to secede from the Union, including Native \n     American Indian tribes.\n       Finding (19) falsely asserts that Native Hawaiians enjoy an \n     ``inherent right'' to reorganize a Native Hawaiian governing \n     entity to honor their right to self-determination. The \n     Constitution denies such a right of self-determination. A \n     Native Hawaiian's lawsuit to enforce such a right would be \n     dismissed as frivolous. Further, there has never been a race-\n     based Native Hawaiian governing entity. An attempt to \n     reorganize something that never existed would be an exercise \n     in futility, or folly, or both.\n       Finding (20) falsely insinuates that Congress is saddled \n     with a greater responsibility for the welfare of Native \n     Hawaiians than for non-Native Hawaiians. The Constitution \n     imposes an equal responsibility on Congress. Race-based \n     distinctions in the exercise of congressional power are \n     flagrantly unconstitutional. See Adarand Constructors, supra.\n       Finding (21) repeats the false insinuation that the United \n     States is permitted under the Constitution to create a racial \n     quota in the administration of public lands, contrary to \n     Adarand Constructors, supra.\n       Finding (22) also brims with falsehoods. Subsection (A) \n     falsely asserts that sovereignty in the Hawaiian Islands \n     rested with aboriginal peoples that pre-dated Native \n     Hawaiians, i.e. that the aboriginals were practicing and \n     preaching government by the consent of the governed long \n     before Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence. But \n     there is not a crumb of evidence anywhere in the world that \n     any aboriginals believed in popular sovereignty, no more so \n     than King Kamehameha I who founded the Kingdom of Hawaii by \n     force, not by plebiscite.\n       Subsection (B) falsely insinuates that Native Hawaiians as \n     opposed to non-Native Hawaiians enjoyed sovereignty or \n     possessed sovereign lands. The two were uniformly equal under \n     the law. In any event, sovereignty until the 1893 overthrow \n     rested with the Monarch. Sovereign lands were employed \n     equally for the benefit of Native Hawaiians and non-Native \n     Hawaiians. [See Appendix page 3 paragraphs 3, 4]\n       Subsection (C) falsely asserts that the United States \n     extends services to Native Hawaiians because of their unique \n     status as an indigenous, native people. The services are \n     extended because Native Hawaiians are United States citizens \n     and entitled to the equal protection of the laws. The \n     subsection also falsely insinuates that Hawaii previously \n     featured a race-based government.\n       Subsection (D) falsely asserts a special trust relationship \n     of American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians \n     with the United States arising out of their status as \n     aboriginal, indigenous, native people of the United States. \n     The United States has accorded American Indians and Alaska \n     Natives a trust relation in recognition of existing sovereign \n     entities and a past history of oppression and subjugation. \n     The trust relationship, however, is voluntary and could be \n     ended unilaterally by Congress at any time. Native Hawaiians, \n     in contrast, have never featured a race-based government \n     entity. They have never suffered discrimination. They voted \n     overwhelmingly for statehood. And they have flourished since \n     annexation in 1898, as Senator Inouye confirms. If Native \n     Hawaiians alleged a constitutional right to a trust \n     relationship, they would be laughed out of court.\n       Finding (23) falsely insinuates that a majority of \n     Hawaiians support the Akaka Bill based on politically correct \n     stances of the state legislature and the governor. The best \n     polling barometers indicate that Hawaiian citizens oppose \n     creating a race-based governing entity with unknown powers. \n     If the proponents of the Akaka Bill genuinely believed \n     Finding (23), they would readily accede to holding hearings \n     and a plebiscite in Hawaii as a condition of its \n     effectiveness on the model of the statehood plebiscite. But \n     they are adamantly opposed because they fear defeat.\n       Section 3's definition of ``Native Hawaiian'' in subsection \n     (8)(A) falsely insinuates that Native Hawaiians exercised \n     popular sovereignty in Hawaii on or before 1893. Sovereignty \n     rested with the Monarch; and, Native Hawaiians never operated \n     a race-based government.\n       Section 4 is replete with falsehoods. Subsections (a)(1) \n     and (2) falsely maintain that the United States has a special \n     political and legal relationship with Native Hawaiians. No \n     such special relationship is recognized in the United States \n     Constitution, which requires equality among citizens. \n     Subsection (a)(3) falsely maintains that the congressional \n     power to regulate commerce ``with the Indian Tribes'' \n     empowers Congress to create a race-based government for \n     Native Hawaiians. Creating a race-based government is not a \n     regulation of commerce; and, Native Hawaiians, unlike Indian \n     Tribes, never organized a government exclusively for Native \n     Hawaiians. No court has ever sanctioned the subsection's far-\n     fetched interpretation of the Indian Commerce Clause. Article \n     IV of the Constitution provided the congressional authority \n     for the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 and for \n     Hawaiian statehood. The many several federal laws addressing \n     the conditions of Native Hawaiians are not based on the \n     Indian Commerce Clause. To the extent they embrace racial \n     distinctions, they are unconstitutional.\n       Subsection (a)(4) falsely asserts that Native Hawaiians \n     sport an inherent right to autonomy in their internal \n     affairs; an inherent right to self-determination and self-\n     governance; the right to reorganize a Native Hawaiian \n     governing entity; and, a right to become economically self-\n     sufficient. None of these asserted rights is recognized by \n     the Constitution or federal statutes. All have been concocted \n     by proponents of the Akaka Bill with no more legitimacy than \n     the right of the Confederacy to secede from the Union.\n       Subsection (b) falsely asserts that the purpose of the \n     Akaka Bill is to provide a process for the ``reorganization'' \n     of the Native Hawaiian governing entity. As explained above, \n     there has never been a race-based Native Hawaiian governing \n     entity. Something that has never been cannot be reorganized.\n       Section 7 is flagrantly unconstitutional in its erection of \n     a race-based government in violation of the non-\n     discrimination mandates of the Fifth, Fourteenth and \n     Fifteenth Amendments. It directs the Secretary of Interior to \n     appoint nine Native Hawaiian Commissioners to prepare and \n     maintain a roll of Native Hawaiians to participate in the \n     bogus ``reorganization'' of a Native Hawaiian government. The \n     race-based appointments violate the equal protection \n     component of the Fifth Amendment. Preparing and maintaining a \n     race-based electoral roll violates the same equal protection \n     command. See Rice v. Cayetano, supra.. As Justice Anthony \n     Kennedy explained in that case:\n       ``The ancestral inquiry mandated by [Hawaii] is forbidden \n     by the Fifteenth Amendment for the further reason that the \n     use of racial classifications is corruptive of the whole \n     legal order democratic elections seek to preserve. The law \n     itself may not become the instrument for generating the \n     prejudice and hostility all too often directed against \n     persons whose particular ancestry is disclosed by their \n     ethnic characteristics and cultural traditions. `Distinctions \n     between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by \n     their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions \n     are founded upon the doctrine of equality.' Hirabayashi v. \n     United States, 320 U.S. 81 (1943). Ancestral tracing of this \n     sort achieves its purpose by creating a legal category which \n     employs the same mechanisms, and causes the same injuries, as \n     laws or statutes that use race by name.'' Cayetano, at 517.\n       Under Section 7, the enrolled race-based members are \n     empowered to elect an Interim Governing Council from one of \n     their own, another race-based voting distinction that \n     violates the Fifteenth Amendment and equal protection. The \n     Fifteenth Amendment (which promises the right to vote shall \n     not be denied on account of race) includes any election in \n     which public issues are decided or public officials selected. \n     The Council establishes race-based criteria for citizenship \n     in the Native Hawaiian governing entity, subject to a race-\n     based plebiscite, and otherwise cobbles together an organic \n     governing document. The Secretary of Interior then certifies \n     the organic race-based charter under which race-based \n     elections are held to the Native Hawaiian governing entity. \n     That certification would violate the Secretary's solemn oath \n     to protect and defend the Constitution without mental \n     reservation. It seems highly improbable that the Native \n     Hawaiian commissioners would allow an electoral role for non-\n     native Hawaiians. The bill itself anticipates a ``native \n     Hawaiian governing entity' which would be a misnomer if non-\n     native Hawaiians were included.\n       Section 8 establishes an open-ended negotiating agenda \n     between the United States, the\n\n[[Page S6647]]\n\n     State of Hawaii, and the unconstitutional Native Hawaiian \n     governing entity to fix the powers and immunities of the \n     latter. Nothing is excluded. For example, the Native Hawaiian \n     entity might exercise criminal and civil jurisdiction over \n     non-Native Hawaiians. It might be exempt from all federal, \n     state, and local taxes. It might be shielded from all \n     federal, state, and local regulatory, health, welfare, labor, \n     zoning, and environmental laws. It might be free of \n     restraints imposed by the United States Constitution, and \n     violate freedom of speech, press, religion, or association \n     with impunity. It might be empowered to exercise eminent \n     domain over land both within and without its geographical \n     boundaries. It might be authorized to exempt Native Hawaiians \n     from military service and to evict the United States Navy and \n     Army from their current Hawaiian bases. Proponents of the \n     Akaka Bill adamantly refuse to exclude these horrors by \n     explicit language.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/15/senate-section/article/S6647-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                CHARLES TAYLOR AND NIGERIAN DEBT RELIEF\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to call attention to an important, \nyet often overlooked, provision of law that governs the relationship of \nthe United States with nations that harbor individuals who have been \nindicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone or the International \nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda. This provision, section 585 of the \nForeign Operations Appropriations Act, which was signed into law by \nPresident Bush in January 2004 and reauthorized about a year later, \nmakes it clear that the Unites States stands for the rule of law in \nAfrica. This is not a partisan issue. Democrats and Republicans \nunderstand the importance of the rule of law, which is a cornerstone \nfor peace, democracy, justice and development in Africa--and around the \nworld. In fact, Senator Judd Gregg, a Republican from New Hampshire, \nco-authored this provision with me.\n  I see my friend from Illinois, Senator Obama, on the floor and am \nwondering if he agrees.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I agree with the senior Senator from Vermont about the \nimportance of upholding the rule of law in Africa and around the world. \nI would also like to add my support for the efforts of the Special \nCourt for Sierra Leone to bring to justice some of the worst war \ncriminals of the 20th century. While the Special Court has not been \nperfect, there is no question that the Court is doing vitally important \nwork of promoting peace and reconciliation, increasing accountability, \nand strengthening the rule of law throughout West Africa. I also want \nto discuss a related issue--the case of Charles Taylor. I know the \nSenator from Vermont has been working for years on this issue.\n  I will simply say that Charles Taylor is an indicted war criminal, \nand he needs to be transferred to the Special Court to stand trial as \nsoon as possible. The Government of Nigeria has allowed Charles Taylor \nto live in exile, within its borders, with the support of the \ninternational community, including the United States, since August \n2003. While we owe Nigeria a debt of gratitude for helping prevent \nfurther bloodshed in Liberia, it is time for Mr. Taylor to be \ntransferred to the Special Court.\n  No nation should be permitted to willfully ignore an indictment \nissued by this tribunal. Moreover, there are credible reports that Mr. \nTaylor has broken the terms of his exile, is a threat to the Liberian \npeace process, and continues to meddle in the internal affairs of \nLiberia--just a few months before the Liberian elections.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Vermont shares my views?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I absolutely share the Senator's views of the situation. \nCharles Taylor's actions are a breach of his promises to Nigerian \nPresident Obasanjo. And, I believe that if Nigeria does not hand over \nCharles Taylor for trial, it could constitute a threat to Liberian \npeace, justice in Sierra Leone, and the rule of law throughout West \nAfrica. This is why the provision of law that I mentioned earlier is so \nimportant. It is the law of the United States that there shall be no \nassistance to the central government--including debt relief--for \ncountries harboring fugitives from the Special Court for Sierra Leone. \nThere is strong bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress to reauthorize \nthis provision in fiscal year 2006, which means that unless President \nBush issues a waiver, Nigeria will not be eligible for U.S. debt relief \nor military assistance, or any other assistance to the central \ngovernment, until it sends Charles Taylor to the Special Court for \ntrial.\n  I would point out that President Bush can exercise the waiver \nauthority in the law by simply submitting a plan in writing on how the \nAdministration will get Mr. Taylor to the Special Court to stand trial.\n  Mr. President, it is not in the interests of the people of West \nAfrica, including Nigeria, or the United States, to continue to shelter \nCharles Taylor from justice. As a strong supporter of debt relief, I \nbelieve there is a strong case to be made that Nigeria's debt should be \nforgiven--but not until President Obasanjo again demonstrates \nleadership and hands over Charles Taylor for trial. At that point, I \nwill strongly support debt relief for Nigeria and actively lobby the \nadministration and Congress to make it a reality.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I thank the Senator from Vermont, the ranking member of \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, because \nhe makes a crucial point. Debt relief from the United States is not \nautomatic. In the past, debt relief has come with conditions, including \nmaking progress in fighting corruption and on economic reform, to \nensure that this relief achieves the maximum results.\n  For Nigeria, this means turning over Charles Taylor--an indicted war \ncriminal who has the blood of thousands on his hands and threatens, \nonce again, to destabilize the region--to the Special Court. Like the \nSenator from Vermont, I strongly believe that Nigeria is a worthy \ncandidate for debt relief and a key U.S. partner in West Africa. When \nCharles Taylor is turned over, there is no doubt in my mind that I will \nbe a forceful advocate for debt relief for Nigeria. I would also like \nto praise the Government of Nigeria for its leadership on other issues, \nespecially their efforts to lead the African Union force in Darfur. I \nwant nothing more than to see the Taylor issue successfully resolved so \nwe can focus our attention on other important issues with the \nNigerians.\n  I would also reiterate what the Senator said about the waiver \nauthority contained in section 585. The President can waive these \nrestrictions, including those pertaining to Nigerian debt relief, by \nformulating a plan to get Mr. Taylor to the Court.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from Illinois and refer all Senators \nto section 585, entitled ``War Crimes in Africa,'' of Public Law 108-\n447, the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, 2005. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/15/senate-section/article/S6647-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6647-S6648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL HISTORY DAY\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to recognize June 15, 2005 as \nNational History Day. The National History Day Program is an annual \ncelebration to recognize the importance of a strong history curriculum \nin schools in Missouri and across the country. This celebration is also \na showcase for students across the Nation to present their knowledge \nand interest in particular events in history through performances, \ndocumentaries, and exhibits.\n  This year, Missouri has 5 exemplary students selected from a group \n2,000 finalists to perform and present their projects at the \nSmithsonian American Art Museum. Kate LaRose, a student at Jefferson \nJunior High School in Columbia, MO, was recognized for her project \n``Martha Graham: The Power of Communication through Dance.'' Robert \nAdams, Raeed Chowdhury, Rui Du, and Yun-Han Huang, all students at \nRolla High School in Rolla, MO, were also recognized for their exhibit \ntitled ``Controversial Art: Thomas Hart Benton's Communication Tool.''\n  I congratulate Katie, Robert, Raeed, Rui, and Yun-Hun for this honor \nand commended them for their dedication, commitment, and hard \nwork.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to take note of the 25th annual \nNational History Day and express my strong support for the goals of the \nNational History Day program. A basic knowledge of history is essential \nfor our Nation's children to become informed participants in our \ndemocracy. National History Day promotes history education in \nConnecticut and throughout the Nation.\n  The National History Day Program encourages students to think \ncritically\n\n[[Page S6648]]\n\nand create dramatic performances, exhibits, documentaries, and research \npapers by exploring a variety of resources beyond classroom textbooks. \nStudents in grades 6-12 engage in this challenging year-long program in \norder to gain a better understanding of the importance of studying \nhistory. I believe that a fundamental understanding of history is \nimperative in order to appreciate the present world situation. Fifty \nstudents from Connecticut have demonstrated their proficiency in the \nsubject area by having been selected as National History Day finalists \nfrom our State.\n  As a Senator from the State of Connecticut, I am pleased to \ncongratulate the students from Connecticut who have been selected to \nrepresent our State at this year's National History Day competition. It \nalso gives me great pleasure to pay special tribute to Sadie Hartell \nand Elizabeth Kelly. Sadie Hartell and Elizabeth Kelly, both students \nat Hall Memorial School in Willington, CT, were among the 19 students \nchosen out of more than half a million across America to display and \npresent their history projects at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. \nSadie's project is titled ``The Beatles: Communicating to their \nGeneration.'' Elizabeth's project is titled ``The Second American \nRevolution: Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her Fight.''\n  I applaud all 50 delegates from the State of Connecticut for having \nbeen selected to represent our State as finalists in the National \nHistory Day competition and commend these students for their diligence \nand creativity. I join with the citizens of the State of Connecticut in \nwishing them well in all their future endeavors.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I am delighted to come to the floor today \nto congratulate Nathan Przestrzelski of Swannanoa, NC and Stephen \nGordon of Fletcher, NC on being selected to present their award-winning \nhistory projects at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History \nand the Smithsonian American Art Museum in celebration of National \nHistory Day.\n  For 25 years the National History Day Program has brought history to \nlife for students across our country. By combining creativity with \nscholarship, students are finding a new appreciation for the past while \ndeveloping valuable skills in writing and analytical reasoning. Most \nimportantly, this program focuses on inspiring each child to reach his \nor her full potential, and in doing so provides a great service by \nincreasing their confidence and ability to succeed.\n  This year the National History Day Program asked students to present \nprojects on the theme ``Communication in History: the Key to \nUnderstanding.'' Students were asked to explore the role communication \nplays in history and its significance in helping shape how historical \nchanges have been understood.\n  Let me share with you the two wonderful projects Nathan and Stephen \npresented.\n  Nathan presented his exhibit entitled, ``The History of Spring \nTraining: Communication is the Key to Understanding the Merger of \nAthletic Preparation with Market Magic.'' His project explores how \nbaseball's spring training has grown from traditionally being a means \nfor athletic preparation to today becoming a multi-million dollar \nindustry expressed through business marketing. Nathan was able to \nincorporate his love of sports, his interest in business, and his \nappreciation of history to better understand how this tradition evolved \nover time.\n  Stephen also presented his project, a documentary entitled, ``Telling \nTales: The Appalachian Oral Tradition.'' His work depicts how the \npeople of Appalachia have communicated ideas, history, heritage, and \nvalues through the use of nothing more than oral tradition. Stephen was \nable to trace stories from the mountains of North Carolina back over \nhundreds of years and show how fundamental concepts were passed from \ngeneration to generation.\n  Through their hard work and dedication, these young historians show \nthat discovering, understanding, and interpreting history is not only \nimportant, but exciting.\n  Today is a proud day for Nathan, Stephen, and their families. We are \nproud of these student's hard work, dedication, and tremendous \nachievements. I believe passionately that education is the foundation \nfor success, and I am encouraged to see students so active in the \nlearning process. I hope Nathan and Stephen have enjoyed this \nexperience and I wish them continued success in the years ahead.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the importance of learning and \nappreciating history cannot be understated. Men and women--young and \nold--benefit from learning about the past as a way to shape the future. \nToday, the National History Day Program is honoring students from \naround our Nation who have displayed excellence in the study of \nhistory, and I am pleased to recognize five students from my home State \nof Ohio who are participating in this important program.\n  The National History Day Program actually originated in Ohio at Case \nWestern Reserve University in Cleveland. The National History Day \nProgram allows students to create exhibits, documentaries, and \nperformances by using their critical thinking and research skills in \nthe subject of history. This year is a special year, as the National \nHistory Day organization is celebrating its 25th Anniversary of \ntraining students and teachers to incorporate libraries, museums, and \narchives into their learning plans.\n  I would like to take a moment to recognize the Ohioans who are \nparticipating this year. Megan Daines, a student at Hannan Trace \nElementary in Crown City, OH, presented her project, titled ``The \nUnderground Railroad: Communication between Two Worlds,'' at the \nSmithsonian National Museum of American History. Holly Anderson, a \nstudent at Canton County Day School in Massillon, OH, was one of 19 \nstudents chosen from over 2,000 finalists to perform her original work, \n``All of a Flutter: The Secret Language of the Fan,'' in the Grand \nSalon in the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum.\n  Ian Shaw of Sylvania, Michael Kreuz of Swanton, and Ben Spang of \nToledo are three Ohio home-schooled students, who have been selected to \npresent their project at the National Museum of Health and Medicine. \nIan, Michael, and Ben joined Isaac Skaggs of Michigan to complete a \ndocumentary titled, ``A Voice in the Darkness: Dr. Jonathan Mann, \nUniting the World Against AIDS.''\n  I congratulate all of these students for their presentations and \nperformances. Their dedication to the pursuit of excellence in the \nstudy of history sets a great example for our Nation's youth. I join \nall Ohioans in wishing them all the best in their future endeavors.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Michael Walsh of \nOmaha, NE, an outstanding student and young history scholar whose \nNational History Day project has been chosen out of half a million in \nAmerica to be presented today at the White House Visitor Center. \nMichael's documentary, ``Let the Word Go Forth: JFK's New Frontier,'' \nhighlights President Kennedy's unique ability to communicate \neffectively with both Americans and leaders throughout the world, \nespecially during the Cuban missile crisis, a critical time in \nAmerica's history. His project shows that young Americans can take \nimportant historical events and share them with us in an interesting \nand educational way. Michael is a student at Lewis and Clark Middle \nSchool in Omaha.\n  National History Day is a unique approach to teaching and learning \nhistory in our Nation's classrooms. It allows students to create \nexhibits, documentaries and performances by using their critical \nthinking and research skills in the subject of history. This year marks \nthe 25th anniversary of the National History Day organization.\n  All of Nebraska is proud of Michael's commitment to scholarship. This \nyoung Nebraskan understands that history shapes our future and \ninfluences the world we live in today. I ask my colleagues to join me \nand all Americans in honoring Michael Walsh and all students who \nparticipated in National History Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/15/senate-section/article/S6648-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6648-S6649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n Mr. SMITH.

I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/15/senate-section/article/S6649-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE FIFTY CALIBER SNIPER WEAPON REGULATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in recent years, there has been numerous \nreports regarding .50-caliber sniper rifles and the danger they pose to \nour communities and homeland security. It is important that we take \naction to prevent potential terrorists and violent criminals from \nhaving easy access to these dangerous weapons.\n  The .50-caliber sniper rifle is a favorite weapon of militaries \naround the world. According to a report released by the Violence Policy \nCenter last year, a .50-caliber sniper rifle is capable of accurately \nhitting a target over 1,500 yards away, and the ammunition available \nfor the rifle includes armor-piercing, incendiary, and explosive \nbullets. The report also cites the U.S. Army's manual on urban combat, \nwhich states that .50-caliber sniper rifles are designed to attack bulk \nfuel tanks and other high-value targets from a distance using ``their \nability to break through all but the thickest shielding material.'' \nAccording to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, one of the \nleading manufacturers of the .50-caliber sniper rifle has also promoted \ntheir rifle's ability to destroy ``multimillion dollar aircraft with a \nsingle hit delivered to a vital area.''\n  While these capabilities may be desirable for military purposes, the \n.50-caliber sniper rifle provides the same capabilities to terrorists \nwho may use them to bring down civilian aircraft, attack critical \ninfrastructure, or kill innocent Americans. Currently, these powerful \nweapons are subject to only minimal Federal regulation and are treated \nthe same as other long rifles including shotguns, hunting rifles, and \nsmaller target rifles. A loophole in the law, commonly known as the \n``gun show loophole,'' also allows for .50-caliber sniper rifles to be \npurchased without even a minimum background check.\n  I have cosponsored the Fifty-Caliber Sniper Weapon Regulation Act \nintroduced by Senator Feinstein. This bill would reclassify .50-caliber \nrifles under the National Firearms Act, NFA, treating them the same as \nother high-powered or especially lethal firearms like machine guns and \nsawed off shotguns.\n  Among other things, reclassification of .50-caliber sniper rifles \nunder the NFA would subject them to new registration requirements. \nFuture transfers or sales of .50-caliber sniper rifles would have to be \nconducted through a licensed dealer with an accompanying background \ncheck. In addition, the rifle being sold would have to be registered \nwith Federal authorities. The additional requirements would help ensure \nthat these dangerous weapons do not fall into the hands of potential \nterrorists or violent criminals.\n  We should recognize the extraordinary capabilities of .50-caliber \nsniper rifles and the danger they pose to our homeland security. I urge \nmy colleagues to take up and pass the Fifty-Caliber Sniper Weapon \nRegulation Act to help protect our Nation from those who may wish to do \nus harm.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/15/senate-section/article/S6649-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6649-S6650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CHUCK LUDLAM\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my gratitude and, \ntruly, this country's gratitude, to Chuck Ludlam of my staff, for his \n33-year career in government service and public policy. He's retiring \non June 24, 40 years to the month after his first job on Capitol Hill \nas a ``Stanford in Government'' intern in the House of Representatives.\n  Thomas Jefferson once asked the question: What duty does a citizen \nowe to the government that secures the society in which he lives?\n  Answering his own question, Jefferson said: ``A nation that rests on \nthe will of the people must also depend on individuals to support its \ninstitutions if it is to flourish. Persons qualified for public service \nshould feel an obligation to make that contribution.''\n  Chuck has answered that call--a call as old as our Republic--with \ndedicated service to our Nation and continued service to our world.\n  Chuck began his public service as a Peace Corps volunteer in Nepal in \n1968-1970. After his Senate retirement, he and his wife, Paula \nHirschoff, also a 1960's Peace Corps volunteer, in Kenya, will serve \nagain as Peace Corps volunteers, in Senegal. This full circle expresses \nwell their commitment to service.\n  The professionalism and accomplishments of congressional staff are \noften unsung and even unappreciated. While it is difficult to summarize \na career as varied and distinguished as Chuck's, let me touch on a few \nhighlights.\n  I have known Chuck since I arrived in the Senate in 1989, and he has \nserved as my economic counsel since 2001. Following the anthrax attack \non the Senate in October 2001, Chuck went to work on biodefense and \ninfectious disease policy issues. BioShield I, enacted last July, was \nin significant part due to his work, and he has now helped Senator \nHatch, Senator Brownback, and me fashion BioShield II, S. 975, a \nvisionary tour de force on the full range of issues we must address to \nprepare for a bioterror attack or infectious disease outbreak. This \nbill provides a prescription for how to prepare ourselves for these \nthreats to our national health and well being. Now it is incumbent on \nus to enact it. It is hard to describe the importance to our country of \nmoving this legislation. It is an area of extreme future risk not only \nfor ourselves but for all nations. Chuck developed a profound view of \nwhat must be done to deter this nightmare, a nightmare not only of bio \nattacks but of infectious disease in general, and has been relentlessly \npressing this problem and its solutions onto our national policy agenda \nsince 2001. It has been an exceptionally dedicated and unique \nlegislative effort and it underscores the kind of remarkable role \ntalented and driven Senate staff like Chuck can play assisting Senator \npolicymakers.\n  Chuck had a long and very special working education that has enabled \nhim to serve in this Senate policy-developer role. Before his service \nin my office, Chuck served as chief tax counsel on the Senate Small \nBusiness Committee, 1985-1993, with Senator Dale Bumpers; as legal \ncounsel on the Joint Economic Committee, 1982-1985, with Congressman \nGillis Long; as legal counsel on the Carter White House Domestic Policy \nStaff, 1979-1981, working with Si Lazarus and Stu Eizenstat; as counsel \nto the Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Subcommittee on \nSeparation of Powers of the Senate Judiciary Committee, 1975-1979, with \nSenator James Abourezk; and as a trial attorney in the Bureau of \nConsumer Protection of the Federal Trade Commission, 1972-1975. In \naddition, he served as vice president for Government Relations, \nBiotechnology Industry Organization, 1993-2000, and Counsel, Musick, \nPeeler and Garrett, 1981-1982).\n\n  During his long career on Capitol Hill, Chuck has brought his strong \ntalents to bear on a wide range of legislative issues. While on my \nstaff, these ranged from Federal fiscal responsibility and honest \ngovernment accounting, S. 1915; to building assets for the poor, S. \n476; to promoting U.S.-China educational and cultural engagement; S. \n1117; to U.S. economic competitiveness policy, S. 2747; and, as I \nmentioned, to enacting Project BioShield, Public Law 108-276.\n  Long before joining me, Chuck worked to establish the Office of \nSenate Legal Counsel, Public Law 95-521; to defeat problematic Airline \nNoise legislation in 1978; to enact the first law on the subject of \norganizational conflict of interest, Public Law 95-70; to enact the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act, Public law 96-354; to save the tax \nexemption for the bonds for non-profit hospitals and schools, Public \nLaw 97-248; enact the Patent Reform Act of 1999, Public Law 106-113; to \nenact the first law banning genetic discrimination, Public Law 104-191; \nto make permanent the Orphan Drug Tax Credit, Public Law 104-188 and \n105-34; and to\n\n[[Page S6650]]\n\ndefeat attempts to criminalize some stem cell research in 1997-1998.\n  We know Chuck to be a passionate and tenacious advocate, a dedicated \nmentor to the talented legislative fellows who have worked for him, an \nadventurer who continues to trek over some of the most forbidding and \nfascinating parts of the planet, a loyal friend to many in our office, \nsomeone who is always searching for the ``big idea-big picture'' as a \nvisionary policy developer, and a generous human being with a sense of \nhumor. As a Congressional Staffer, he has always kept his focus on the \npublic interest, undistracted by partisan concerns, and I found I could \nalways count on hearing his frank and perceptive perspective on what \nwould be the right policy for the country.\n  Chuck is completing an oral history of his unusual and remarkable \nSenate career, based on interviews with the Office of the Senate \nHistorian, which has been transcribed and will be available on line. \nThis history describes the challenges, skills and tactics of a Capitol \nHill staffer who has fought in the political trenches over forty years.\n  Chuck hopes that this history will encourage young people to consider \ncareers in public service. He's served as the principal advisor and \nmentor for 25 years to the ``Stanford in Government'' program. He was \none of 100 alumni awarded medallions to honor their service to Stanford \nUniversity during centennial celebrations of the University's founding \nin 1991; the headquarters for ``Stanford in Government'' at the Haas \nCenter for Public Service is named after him.\n  We wish Chuck and Paula well in their venture in Africa. We will miss \nChuck in the office but we know that he's following one of his great \ndreams, and starting on a remarkable and courageous new round of public \nservice. My office and I are grateful for his dedicated service to our \noffice, to the Senate, and to our Nation, as well as for his \nfriendship.\n  Somewhere right now Jefferson and our Founding Fathers are looking \ndown and smiling proud that our Nation still produces men and women \nlike Chuck and Paula.\n  Congratulations Chuck. Keep in touch and keep teaching us. We eagerly \nawait your reports from Africa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/15/senate-section/article/S6650-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                NEW MEXICO JUNIOR COLLEGE BASEBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN.

This is a tournament that \ninvolves baseball teams from junior colleges across the United States. \nThe Thunderbirds swept to the national title with a perfect record of \n5-0 in tournament play.

Mr. President, today I honor a community in North \nDakota that is celebrating its 100th anniversary. On June 26, the \nresidents of Tolley, ND, will celebrate a proud history.\n  Tolley is a small town in the northwest part of the State, with a \npopulation of 41. Despite its size, Tolley holds an important place in \nNorth Dakota's history. It was founded in 1905 by Eli C. Tolley, a \nprominent developer and official with the Soo Line Railroad Company. As \none report from the period indicates, people were so excited to start \nthe town that they moved in 15 buildings without even having purchased \nlots on which to place them. Soon after, rail lines were laid through \nTolley, and the town began to prosper. Within a year and a half, the \nresidents of Tolley had built general stores, blacksmiths, restaurants, \nhotels, churches, and hardware stores.\n  Through the years, Tolley has exemplified true North Dakota \nperseverance. Despite suffering from a scarcity of water, countless \nfires, and outbreaks of smallpox and the Spanish flu, the people of \nTolley have always remained loyal to this great community. During World \nWar I, many of the men left their families and farms to fight for our \ncountry. Sadly, many did not return, yet the community remained strong. \nIn 1920, the boys high school basketball team held its first practice, \nand in 1921 the homes and businesses in Tolley were lit by electricity \nfor the first time. In 1951, through the generous efforts of local \nresidents, the first organized fire department began serving the \ncommunity. These stories from the history of Tolley serve as a \nremarkable example of ingenuity and perseverance for all of us.\n  I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Tolley, ND, and \nits residents on their first 100 years and in wishing them well through \nthe next century. By honoring Tolley and all the other historic small \ntowns of North Dakota, we keep the pioneering frontier spirit alive for \nfuture generations. It is places such as Tolley that have helped to \nshape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine \ncommunity is deserving of our recognition.\n  Tolley has had a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/15/senate-section/article/S6650-4", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6650-S6651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               125TH ANNIVERSARY OF AMENIA, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I honor a community in North \nDakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. On June 10 and 11, \nthe residents of Amenia, ND, celebrated their community's founding.\n  Amenia is a small town in the eastern part of North Dakota, with a \npopulation just under 100. Despite its size, Amenia holds an important \nplace in the State's history. Amenia in 1880 when the Northern Pacific \nRailroad established a station and a settlement grew around it. Eban \nChaffee of the Amenia Sharon Land Co., on whose home the station was \nactually built, called the new settlement Amenia.\n  The post office was established on January 20, 1880, and Edwin McNeil \nbecame the first postmaster of the newly\n\n[[Page S6651]]\n\nformed community. At a special election held December 27, 1927, the \nvillage of Amenia was incorporated by a vote of 14 to 1. The Amenia \nSharon Land Co. rigidly controlled Amenia until it disbanded in 1928 \nand as a result the townsite was not platted until late in 1928. In \n1967, Amenia officially became a city.\n  The word Amenia comes from the Latin word meaning pleasant and today \nthat is more appropriate than ever. Amenia now has a city park, a bar \nand grill, a city beauty shop and an elevator. Under the leadership of \nMayor Donna Myers, Amenia remains a delightful community in which to \nlive and work.\n  I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Amenia, ND, and \nits residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well in the \nfuture. By honoring Amenia and all the other historic small towns of \nNorth Dakota, we keep the great tradition of the pioneering frontier \nspirit alive for future generations.

Mr President, today I honor a community in North \nDakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. On June 16-19, 2005, \nthe residents of Lisbon, ND will celebrate its history and founding.\n  Lisbon is a small town in the southeast part of North Dakota, with a \npopulation of about 2,500. Lisbon's history began in 1880 when Joseph \nL. Colton founded the town-site. Colton selected land here in 1878 and \nbuilt a flourmill. The new town-site was platted on both sides of the \nbeautiful Sheyenne River at the foot of its bordering hills. In \nSeptember 1880, he laid out the official town-site and appointed the \nfirst postmaster, George Murray on January 23, 1880. His wife, Diana \nRobinson was from Lisbon Center, NY, and the city was named for that.\n  Lisbon became the county seat in 1881, and the Northern Pacific \nRailroad reached the site in 1882. It was incorporated as a city in \n1883, and G.B. Green was appointed the first mayor of the new budding \ncommunity. Less than a decade later, in 1891, the North Dakota Soldiers \nHome was built in Lisbon. Throughout the following years, Lisbon \nmaintained steady growth developing into the delightful community that \nit is today.\n  Today, Mayor Morris Saxerud leads this enthusiastic community. The \ncitizens of Lisbon enjoy fine recreation including an exceptional nine-\nhole golf course, a beautiful park with tennis courts, a ball park, an \nRV park, a gazebo, swings for youngsters and even a swimming pool. The \nLisbon elementary, middle and high school system maintain a high \nacademic program with outstanding teachers, administrators and support \nstaff for approximately 750 students. The city has clearly flourished \nthroughout the past 125 years!\n  I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Lisbon, ND, and \nits residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well through \nthe next century.

BRANNON, UNITED STATES AIR FORCE \n             NURSE CORPS, ON THE OCCASION OF HER RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a great \nAmerican and a true military heroine who has honorably served our \ncountry for over 30 years in the U.S. Air Force Nurse Corps: MG Barbara \nC. Brannon. Major General Brannon began her career as a staff nurse in \nthe Intensive and Coronary Care Unit at Malcolm Grow Medical Center, \nAndrews Air Force Base, MD, and subsequently served throughout the \nworld in Nebraska, California, Texas, Florida, Alabama, England, \nWyoming, Oklahoma, Italy, and the District of Columbia.\n  In each assignment, General Brannon excelled and overcame every \nchallenge, accompanied by reward with greater responsibilities and \nopportunities. An expert educator and clinician, she assumed instructor \nand coordinator positions at the School of Health Care Sciences and in \naeromedical evacuation, and served as assistant chief nurse, quality \nassurance coordinator, and director of ambulatory services at Tyndall \nAFB, FL. Serving as a nurse executive management fellow at Air \nUniversity Regional Hospital, Maxwell AFB, AL, prepared her to lead the \n7520th Air Base Squadron Medical Aid Station in Wycombe, England. \nAnother unmatched performance led to her competitive selection as the \nnursing executive management fellow for the Office of the Surgeon, \nStrategic Air Command, Offutt AFB, NE, and was followed by her \nselection as the chief nurse executive, 90th Medical Group, Francis E. \nWarren AFB, WY.\n  Below-the-zone promotions to both lieutenant colonel and colonel \nilluminated her path to command the 382nd Technical Training Squadron, \nSheppard AFB, TX, the 71st Medical Group, Vance AFB, OK and the 31st \nMedical Group, Aviano Air Base, Italy. She was later appointed as the \ndirector, Air Force Medical Readiness and Nursing Services, Office of \nthe Surgeon General, Bolling AFB, DC. Serving briefly in this capacity, \nshe returned to Andrews AFB where she became the first Nurse Corps \nofficer to command the 89th Medical Group, concurrently served as the \nAssistant Air Force Surgeon General for Nursing, and became the first \nAir Force nurse promoted to major general in 2003.\n  Her career culminates in a dual role as Assistant Air Force Surgeon \nGeneral, Medical Force Development and Assistant Air Force Surgeon \nGeneral for Nursing, through which she established and appraised \npersonnel policy and force development actions for over 40,000 active \nduty officer, enlisted, and civilian medical personnel. I extend my \ndeepest appreciation to Major General Brannon for her 30-plus years of \ndedicated military service and offer her my congratulations on a \nphenomenal and inspirational career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/15/senate-section/article/S6651-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6651-S6652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING THE COMMUNITY OF BRIDGEWATER, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and publicly \nrecognize the 125th anniversary of the founding of the city of \nBridgewater, SD. In addition to celebrating our nation's independence, \nwe are called today to commemorate 125 years of Bridegewater's proud \nhistory.\n  Like many towns in South Dakota, the railroad played an influential \nrole in the founding of Bridgewater. In early 1880, Bridgewater \nreceived its original name, Nation City, from the first settlers and \ntownsite owners, Robert and John B. Nation. In late November of that \nyear, however, the town's first train depot was built to accommodate \nthe Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad, and the town's name \nchanged from Nation City to Bridgewater. In fact, it was the rail \nworkers who ultimately renamed the city, having been forced to carry \ntheir drinking water across a bridge near town.\n  One of early Bridgewater's unique traditions was the chatauqua, a \nsummer festival under a tent loaded with singers, bands, orchestras, \nlectures, and plays. Adults paid $2 and children $1.10 for an entire \nweek of star-studded, cultural entertainment. While this yearly ritual \nwas a town favorite, it quickly lost popularity once roads and cars \nwere improved and movies became more accessible. Unfortunately, \nBridgewater's last chatauqua ended prematurely, as a cyclone hit and \ninterrupted the festivities.\n  Bridgewater's first newspaper, the Times, was established in 1880 by \nAdin F. Terrill. The publication lasted for about 10 years, until it \nmerged with the Bridgewater Brieflet in 1890 and was renamed the \nBridgewater Tribune, which still exists to this day.\n  One of Bridgewater's notable landmarks is the city park. Created in \n1960 with the help of the Green Thumb organization, the park came to \nfruition following the purchase of four acres of\n\n[[Page S6652]]\n\nJ.J. Bollinger's property. This community park, a cherished Bridgewater \namenity, is host to countless family picnics and outdoor activities.\n  In the twelve and a half decades since its founding, Bridgewater has \nprovided its citizens with a rich and diverse atmosphere. Bridgewater's \n600 proud residents will celebrate the town's 125th anniversary on July \n4, 2005, and it is with great honor that I share with my colleagues \nthis community's unique past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/15/senate-section/article/S6652-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING THE CITY OF SALEM, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and publicly \nrecognize the 125th anniversary of the city of Salem, SD. I would like \nto recognize this outstanding prairie community as an example of the \nextraordinary work ethic and perseverance of the remarkable people all \nacross the state of South Dakota.\n  Salem, the county seat of McCook County in southeastern South Dakota, \nwas named by Oliver S. Pendar. Pendar, the town's first postmaster, \nnamed the town for his former home of Salem, Massachusetts. Pendar \nfirst moved to McCook County in 1878 and eventually settled in Salem in \n1880. Platted in July of that year, Salem's location was chosen by the \nrailroad companies, as it provided an excellent spot for trains to stop \nand reload supplies as they made their way west. The town was \nincorporated in 1885, which is the same year residents chose W.D. \nRoberts as Salem's first mayor.\n  Early Salem experienced a great deal of economic prosperity during \nthe peak railroad years of the late nineteenth century. The town grew \nrapidly in its first decade and boasted a number of businesses, \nincluding several hotels, a lumberyard, a furniture store, several \nbanks, real estate brokers, livery barns, and other services vital to a \ngrowing community on the frontier.\n  At its zenith, Salem was home to five fine hotels, including the \nLewis House, the Commercial Hotel, the Irish House of Parliament, the \nDepot Hotel, and the Lucerne, all of which flourished during the \nrailroad years. Sadly, many of these hotels have come and gone, but \ntheir legacy remains.\n  Salem's first school, a two-story frame building located on the site \nof the present high school, was built by J.E. Miller in 1881 and opened \nin 1882. The first floor consisted of county administrative offices and \nclassrooms. The building's second floor accommodated church services, a \ncourthouse, and a public hall.\n  Since its founding, Salem has been home to three newspapers, the \nfirst of which was the Pioneer Register, started by Mr. Jonas Rutan in \n1880. In 1883, Mr. C.F.M. Schenckler established Salem's second paper, \nthe McCook County News, which Mr. J.E. Patten purchased three years \nlater and renamed the Salem Special. This semi-weekly paper, published \non Wednesdays and Saturdays, kept the community informed of important \nevents in the area.\n  Through the years, the residents of Salem have demonstrated great \nflexibility and perseverance in their ability to flourish despite \noverwhelming heartbreak. Since Salem's founding in the late nineteenth \ncentury, the town experienced several destructive fires and floods, \ndestroying grain elevators, hundreds of homes, and numerous businesses. \nStill, this resilient community always managed to recover, rebuild and \nprosper.\n  The pioneer men and women of early Salem also exhibited a remarkable \npropensity for using the resources and riches of the frontier to make a \nwonderful life for themselves on the plains of the Dakotas. Richard F. \nKneip was a local milk equipment businessman who went on to serve as \nGovernor of South Dakota, and later as Ambassador to Singapore. The \nsense of community, moral fortitude, perseverance, and enduring work \nethic that is evident in the people and the history of Salem, stands as \na testament to the integrity of South Dakotans. It is my honor to \nacknowledge the proud residents of Salem, SD as they celebrate 125 \nyears of vibrant history on July 2-4, 2005.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/15/senate-section/article/S6652-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ANTHONY ATHANAS\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I recognize and celebrate the \nlife of a great American and a gracious host to all who crossed his \nthreshold, Mr. Anthony Athanas. Everyone in Massachusetts, along with \nrestaurateurs and past patrons across the country, was saddened to \nlearn of his passing earlier this month.\n  Today, however, I am honored to join with the countless people who \nwere touched by his graciousness and charm in celebrating Anthony's \nunique American journey. Anthony Athanas came to the United States in \n1915 to pursue a dream and through hard work and perseverance, along \nwith his instinctual hospitality and keen business sense; Anthony came \nto embody that dream.\n  His entry into the world of restaurants was by way of working on \nlighting and the maintenance of stoves. With a rapidly growing love of \nthe pace and hustle of the hospitality business, Anthony opened his \nfirst restaurant, ``Anthony of Hawthorn,'' in Lynn, MA, in 1937. This \nendeavor was quickly followed by four more restaurants; Hawthorne by \nthe Sea, General Glover House, Anthony's Cummaquid Inn and Pier 4. Of \nthe 5, Anthony's Pier 4, opened in 1963, would be his most famous and \nenduring.\n  Anthony's Pier 4 became famous for serving quality New England \nseafood to visitors from all over the world and by the late-1960's \nAnthony's Pier 4 was the port of call for movie stars, signers, \nperformers of all sorts and athletes. Irrespective of name recognition \nor social standing, every guest received the same gracious reception \nfrom Anthony. To walk in his door was to be regarded and treated as \nsomeone special. This hospitable approach had practical applications as \nwell, proven by the restaurant's ranking as the fifth most successful \nrestaurant in the country in 1984.\n  The embrace he received from his peers in the restaurant community \nwas complete and sustained. He received the Silver Plate Award from the \nInternational Foodservice Manufacturers Association, the Ivy Award of \nDistinction from Institutions/VFM Magazine, the Golden Door Award from \nthe International Institute of Boston, the Restaurant of the Year Award \nin 1976 from the National Restaurant Association amongst many others.\n  The best business leaders in our country are people who not only \nexcel in commerce but also embrace the larger needs of their community. \nAnthony embraced this notion with the same passion and determination \nthat defined his professional life. He contributed time, energy and \nresources to preserving our national history at the USS Constitution \nMuseum Foundation, reached out to other entrepreneurs through the \nGreater Boston Chamber of Commerce, brought comfort to suffering \nfamilies through his work with the American Cancer Society, and helped \ncreate the next generation of restaurateurs through his support of the \nAmerican Institute of Food and Wine.\n  Anthony breathed real life and meaning into the American Dream by not \nonly maximizing its possibilities for him and his family but by \nexpanding those very same opportunities for others.\n  The last time I walked into Anthony's Pier 4 I was greeted in the \nsame way I have been for years; with a smile and handshake from a true \ngentleman. Anthony Athanas was a great man, one who sought the American \nDream and through hard work and his love of people ended up defining \nit. We mourn his passing, but we are deeply grateful for his time on \nearth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/15/senate-section/article/S6652-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6652-S6653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ARIZONA STUDENT'S HISTORY PROJECT CHOSEN FOR WHITE HOUSE VISITOR'S \n                                DISPLAY\n\n Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. \nAndrew Ivy, an exceptional history teacher and role model from \nKirkland, WA. Mr. Ivy has been named Teacher of the Year by the Richard \nT. Farrell Teacher of Merit Award for outstanding success in teaching \nhistory. This national award is presented every year to an educator who \ndevelops and uses innovative and creative teaching methods that \ninterest students in history and help them make exciting discoveries \nabout the past. As a teacher at International Community School in \nKirkland, WA, Mr. Ivy has shown exemplary commitment to making history \neducation engaging and exciting, while involving his students in the \nNational History Day Program.\n  National History Day is a yearlong program in which students explore \nhistorical topics related to an annual theme. Participants qualify for \nnational competition after competing in several local and State \ncompetitions. In preparing his students for the program, Mr. Ivy's work \nethic and research skills provided students with the tools necessary to \nbe successful in competition.\n  Teachers like Mr. Ivy play an important role in education. By \nteaching about the nations past they keep our history a part of our \ncurrent lives. When children question, and discuss our history, \nteachers are doing something profoundly patriotic; they are helping \nstudents understand who we are as a nation--the importance of our \ncommon heritage and the values that make us unique.\n  Andrew Ivy has proven exceptional. His drive to offer his students \nthe best education possible has led him to invest a great deal of \npersonal study in his curriculum. He regularly attends training classes \nto ensure that the material he teaches is accurate and current. \nAdditionally, Mr. Ivy often tries new approaches to his teaching method \nin order to keep his classroom interested and challenged. His \ncurriculum often changes to meet his very own high standards and his \nstudents greatly benefit from all of his efforts.\n  Mr. President, I find it heartening that there are educators in this \ncountry who devote so much time and effort to shaping the minds of our \nyoung people. I hope you and our colleagues will join me in recognizing \nMr. Andrew Ivy for his dedication to educating the potential leaders of \ntomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/15/senate-section/article/S6653-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      AMERICAN AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION STAR OF LIFE AWARD RECIPIENTS\n\n Mr. SMITH.

A bill to require the Secretary of Education to rebate the \namount of Federal Pell Grant aid lost as a result of the update to the \ntables for State and other taxes used in the Federal student aid need \nanalysis for award year 2005-2006; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I join with Senator Kennedy and others \ntoday in introducing an urgent and critical piece of legislation, the \nStudent Fairness Act.\n  This bill would provide rebates to the many college students who will \nbe receiving a dramatic reduction in their Federal financial aid come \nthe return of classes this September. Due to an obscure change made in \nDecember of 2004 to a complicated and little-known formula used by the \nDepartment of Education to determine Pell Grant eligibility and \nallotment, many students will see a surprising increase in their \nexpected family contribution, EFC, and a decrease in their Pell Grants. \nWe must act now to prevent these decreases in aid from pricing our \nstudents out of college, forcing them to postpone their education and \nput their career goals on hold.\n  These changes to the tax tables, at the behest of the Administration, \nhave the effect of cutting $300 million from the successful Pell grant \nprogram, upon which more than 5 million students nationwide rely. It is \nprojected that, as a result of these cuts, 1.3 million students will \nsee a reduction in their Pell grants and a projected 90,000 more will \nbecome ineligible entirely for Pell grant assistance. According to a \nsurvey performed by the New York Times, some students could lose up to \n$6,000 in financial aid and the average family will have to pay an \nextra $1,700 before clearing the eligibility bar.\n  Although the situation is imminent, this is not the first time the \nSenate has acted to block such changes to the Pell Grant award formula. \nI successfully secured language in the FY04 Onmibus Appropriations bill \nthat blocked the administration from carrying out a similar plan for \nthe 2004-2005 school year. The same provision, however, was dropped \nduring the conference deliberations of the FY05 Omnibus Appropriations \nbill. In response, I, along with 31 of my Senate colleagues, introduced \nS. 187, the Ensuring College Access for All Americans Act, which would \nhave prevented the new calculations from reducing Pell Grants for the \n2005-2006 academic year. Alas, the Senate has not acted with enough \nhaste, and by now many financial aid departments have already \ndetermined their student aid packages based on the new figures. \nStudents are beginning to realize the harsh reality of rising college \ntuitions matched by a government unwilling to support its own future \nleaders. Our only remaining option is to provide these students with \nthese rebates so that they will not lose their financial aid for the \ncoming school year.\n  This bill calls on the Secretary of Education to calculate the \nincrease in a student's expected family contribution due to the tax \ntable modifications and then provides each such student with a rebate \nequal to that increase. The legislation would hold harmless any student \nwhose expected family contribution decreased or stayed the same as a \nresult of the changes. Furthermore, the rebate would be treated in the \nsame manner as other financial assistance for tax purposes and would \nnot affect future Pell Grant eligibility.\n\n[[Page S6661]]\n\n  In addition, our bill has recently received the endorsement of the \nCampaign for America's Future, an organization that has been a great \nadvocate for students and has been actively collecting stories from \nAmerican students about the incredible impact of financial aid on their \nlives.\n  I thank the National Association of Student Financial Aid \nAdministrators for their help in crafting this bill and their support \nin helping students receive the financial aid they deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass the Student Fairness Act immediately to \nprevent any student from putting off college because their financial \naid has suddenly and mysteriously disappeared.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1249\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I join Senators Corzine, Clinton, \nand Reed to introduce legislation to ease the harsh effects of the \nimplementation of changes in the State and local tax tables on college \nstudents receiving need-based financial aid.\n  When a decision is made by any administration that affects what \nfamilies pay for college, it is important for Congress to understand \nthe factors that led to the decision and the impact of the decision on \nthe Nation's families.\n  In light of the slumping economy, State budget crises, and rising \ncollege costs, the Department's proposed changes come at a very \ndifficult time for students and their families. Raising the cost of \ntuition by a few hundred dollars may force a student to leave school, \nand it is our responsibility to ensure that these changes are being \nmade for sound reasons.\n  The Department is authorized to make annual revisions in the State \nand local tax tables, but for years the lag in the data has made \nadministrations reconsider making changes. We need to look for better \nways to make sure that the data reflect the taxes that are currently \nbeing paid by families before we adjust the tables.\n  I urge the Department of Education to work with Congress to decide if \nthese data are indeed the best information that we have. We can use the \nopportunity of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act this \nyear to find a data source that provides timely, accurate information. \nUntil we have done so, I urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy-\nCorzine bill, so that thousands of students who are harmed by these \nchanges can retain their grants of aid and continue their college \neducation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Chafee)):\n  S. 1250. A bill to reauthorize the Great Ape Conservation Act of \n2000; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Great Ape \nConservation Reauthorization Act of 2005. Over the past decade I have \nsponsored legislation to establish and reauthorize programs designated \nfor the conservation of several multinational species including African \nelephants, Asian elephants, rhinoceros and tigers, and marine turtles.\n  Throughout my years in Congress, endangered species conservation has \nbeen among my highest priorities, but the recent birth of my first \ngrandson lends new strength to my commitment to preserve the natural \nworld for future generations.\n  The great apes--chimpanzees, gorillas, bonobos, orangutans, and \ngibbons--constitute a group of 14 primate species that share a high \npercentage of genetic characteristics with human beings. Among them, \ncertain species have demonstrated the ability to learn human behaviors. \nLeft unharmed, they may live for 30 to 50 years and form complex social \nrelationships. As Dr. Jane Goodall said in a BBC News article in 2002, \n``All [great ape species] have minds that can solve simple problems and \nall have feelings. So it's a moral responsibility to save them from \nextinction.''\n  The United Nations Environment Programme estimates that fewer than \n100,000 Western lowland gorillas currently remain worldwide. Only \n30,000 orangutans remain in Southeast Asia. According to the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service, whereas more than one million chimpanzees \npopulated the dense forests of Africa in 1960, fewer than 200,000 \nsurvive in the wild today.\n  In regions of Western and Central Africa and Southeast Asia, where \npopulations of these captivating creatures still remain, the continued \nexistence of great ape species will depend upon finding solutions to \nvarious complicated threats including habitat destruction, disease, and \npoaching.\n  One problem of elevated concern for scientists is the alarming number \nof new outbreaks of the ebola virus in Africa. As we have become \nincreasingly aware of the substantial risk to human life that ebola and \nsimilar viruses pose\n\n[[Page S6662]]\n\nin parts of Central and Western Africa, few understand the serious \nimpact that these diseases have on great ape populations. A study \npublished in the journal Nature in 2003 reports that when an ebola \noutbreak affects a given area, more than 80 percent of all great apes \nliving in that area will die of the disease.\n  In August 2004, the International Primatological Society released \npreliminary evidence that suggests that as many as 20,000 Western \nlowland gorillas may be at risk as the result of a new outbreak of the \nebola virus in the Republic of Congo.\n  Developing vaccines and techniques to prevent the decimation of great \nape populations as a result of ebola will require a coordinated effort \namong conservationists, wildlife biologists, and those responding to \nhuman outbreaks. Supported in part by the Great Ape Conservation Fund, \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recently convened a meeting of \nexperts to begin the process of developing a research and intervention \nplan. This meeting typifies this kind of collaborative conservation \neffort that the Great Ape Conservation program was designed to \nundertake.\n  The Great Ape Conservation Fund has also played an invaluable role in \nprotecting habitat. One of the first such projects to receive support \nfrom the Fund, the Goualougo Triangle Chimp Project in the Republic of \nCongo, is a success story that stands out among what can often be \ndisheartening news from the frontlines of chimpanzee conservation.\n  In 1993, scientists first discovered a small population of \nchimpanzees in the Goualougo Triangle that had never been hunted and \nwere therefore not afraid of humans. The presence of such chimps is \nextraordinary given that their habitat coincides with a region that is \nrife with logging and bushmeat hunting.\n  With help from the Great Ape program, scientists from the Wildlife \nConservation Society produced scientific evidence to document 272 \nindividual chimps and acquired rare video footage of their social \ninteractions. As a result of this study, conservationists convinced the \ngovernment of Congo to protect the Goualougo chimps and their habitat \nfrom the eminent threat of logging and hunting and to cede the \nGoualougo Triangle to a national park.\n  Over the course of merely 5 years, the Great Ape Conservation Fund \nhas provided financial assistance for 94 research and restoration \nprojects in 22 countries and leveraged millions of dollars in \nadditional matching and in-kind funds.\n  My legislation reauthorizes the Great Ape Conservation Fund, which \nreceives its annual appropriation through the Multinational Species \nConservation Fund, for 5 years and gradually raises the funding \nauthorization from $5 million for each year to $7 million for fiscal \nyear 2008 and $10 million for fiscal years 2009 and 2010. The bill \nraises the top threshold cap on administrative expenses from $80,000 to \n$150,000, though I should note that over the past five years, Federal \nappropriations have yet to bring the cap on administrative expenses to \nthe top threshold amount.\n  Additional provisions of the bill will expand the variety of \nconservation projects eligible for assistance to include those that \naddress the root causes of threats to great apes in range states, \nincluding the illegal bushmeat trade, diseases, lack of regional or \nlocal capacity for conservation and habitat loss due to natural \ndisasters.\n  The bill also amends an existing requirement in the law that requires \nthat the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service annually convene a panel of \nexperts. My bill exempts expert panels under this law from the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act and provide the administrator with greater \nflexibility to determine when it is appropriate to convene an expert \npanel.\n  I remain hopeful that despite the overwhelming challenges that \njeopardize the continued survival of great apes, we can do our part to \nsustain efforts to halt their unnecessary extinction.\n  Federal assistance for the conservation of rare, threatened and \nendangered international species through the use of species \nconservation funds has received bipartisan support from Congress for \nnearly 15 years. I ask you to please join me in maintaining this \nlongstanding commitment to wildlife protection.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                S. 1250\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Con. Res. 42\n\n       Whereas news of the end of slavery did not reach frontier \n     areas of the United States, and in particular the \n     Southwestern States, for more than 2 years after President \n     Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863, and \n     months after the conclusion of the Civil War;\n       Whereas on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers led by Major \n     General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news \n     that the Civil War had ended and that the enslaved were free;\n       Whereas African Americans who had been slaves in the \n     Southwest celebrated June 19, commonly known as Juneteenth \n     Independence Day, as the anniversary of their emancipation;\n       Whereas African Americans from the Southwest continue the \n     tradition of Juneteenth Independence Day as inspiration and \n     encouragement for future generations;\n       Whereas for more than 135 years, Juneteenth Independence \n     Day celebrations have been held to honor African American \n     freedom while encouraging self-development and respect for \n     all cultures;\n       Whereas although Juneteenth Independence Day is beginning \n     to be recognized as a national, and even global, event, the \n     history behind the celebration should not be forgotten; and\n       Whereas the faith and strength of character demonstrated by \n     former slaves remains an example for all people of the United \n     States, regardless of background, religion, or race: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) Congress--\n       (A) recognizes the historical significance of Juneteenth \n     Independence Day to the Nation;\n       (B) supports the continued celebration of Juneteenth \n     Independence Day to provide an opportunity for the people of \n     the United States to learn more about the past and to better \n     understand the experiences that have shaped the Nation; and\n       (C) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     Juneteenth Independence Day with appropriate ceremonies, \n     activities, and programs; and\n       (2) it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) history should be regarded as a means for understanding \n     the past and solving the challenges of the future; and\n       (B) the celebration of the end of slavery is an important \n     and enriching part of the history and heritage of the United \n     States.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this week there will be celebrations in \nobservance of the date upon which slavery finally came to an end in the \nUnited States, June 19, 1865, also known as ``Juneteenth Independence \nDay.'' It was on this date that slaves in the Southwest finally learned \nof the end of slavery. Although passage of the 13th amendment in \nJanuary 1863, legally abolished slavery, many African Americans \nremained in servitude due to the slow dissemination of this news across \nthe country. Since that time, over 130 years ago, the descendants of \nslaves have observed this anniversary of emancipation as a remembrance \nof one of the most tragic periods of our nation's history. The \nsuffering, degradation and brutality of slavery cannot be repaired, but \nthe memory can serve to ensure that no such inhumanity is ever \nperpetrated again on American soil.\n  Throughout the Nation, we also celebrate the many important \nachievements of former slaves and their descendants. We do so because \nin 1926, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, son of former slaves, proposed such a \nrecognition as a way of preserving the history of African Americans and \nrecognizing the enormous contributions of a people of great strength, \ndignity, faith and conviction--a people who rendered their achievements \nfor the betterment and advancement of a Nation once lacking in humanity \ntowards them. Every February, nationwide, we celebrate African American \nHistory Month. And, every year on June 19 we celebrate ``Juneteenth \nIndependence Day.''\n  I am happy to join with my colleague, Senator Barack Obama, in \ncommemorating Juneteenth Independence Day with the submission of S. \nCon. Res. 42, in recognition of the end of slavery and to never forget \neven the worst aspects of our Nation's history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/15/senate-section/article/S6664-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 784.

REDUCTION OF DEPENDENCE ON IMPORTED PETROLEUM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) based on the reports of the Energy Information \n     Administration entitled ``Annual Energy Outlook 2005'' and \n     ``May 2005 Monthly Energy Review''--\n       (A) during the period beginning January 1, 2005, and ending \n     April 30, 2005, the United States imported an estimated \n     average of 13,056,000 barrels of oil per day; and\n       (B) the United States is projected to import 19,110,000 \n     barrels of oil per day in 2025;\n       (2) technology solutions already exist to dramatically \n     increase the productivity of the United States energy supply;\n       (3) energy efficiency and conservation measures can improve \n     the economic competitiveness of the United States and lessen \n     energy costs for families in the United States;\n       (4) United States dependence on foreign energy imports \n     leaves the United States vulnerable to energy supply shocks \n     and reliant on the willingness of other countries to provide \n     sufficient supplies of oil;\n       (5) while only 3 percent of proven oil reserves are located \n     in territory controlled by the United States, advances in \n     fossil fuel extraction techniques and technologies could \n     increase United States energy supplies;

GARZA AND FILEMON B. VELA UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE\n\n  The bill (H.R. 483) to designate a United States courthouse in \nBrownsville, TX, as the ``Reynaldo G. Garza and Filemon B. Vela United \nStates Courthouse,'' was considered, read the third time, and passed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am pleased that the Senate today has taken action on \nH.R. 483, a bill that designates a courthouse in Brownsville, TX, as \nthe ``Reynaldo G. Garza and Filemon B. Vela United States Courthouse'' \nin honor of these two judges, including the first Mexican-American \nnamed to a Federal judge. Unfortunately, the Senate has repeatedly \ndelayed action on this bill. Congressman Solomon P. Ortiz first \nintroduced a similar bill honoring these judges in 1998. It is now 7 \nyears later and months after both these Judges' deaths in 2004.\n  Both this Congress and last, I have introduced a companion bill with \nCongresswoman Norton that designates the new annex to the E. Barrett \nPrettyman United States Courthouse in Washington, DC, the ``William B. \nBryant Annex.'' This historic figure should be honored, and that honor \nshould occur during his lifetime. Regrettably, the Senate has yet to \nact on this bill, S. 478, which I introduced on March 1, 2005.\n  In order to prevent repeating the regrettable timing of the Judge \nGarza and Vela Courthouse naming, I urge that the Senate move ahead on \nthis worthy commendation of Judge Bryant's lifetime of public service.\n  Judge Bryant continues to perform his duties as a senior Federal \njudge at the age of 93. His commitment to ending racial segregation and \nhis belief in public service and the law has carried him through a \nhistoric career. He was the first African-American Chief Judge for the \nUnited States District Court in DC. The current Chief Judge Thomas F. \nHogan and all of Judge Bryant's fellow judges recognize his truly \nremarkable lifetime achievements and have unanimously requested naming \nthe newly constructed annex in his honor.\n  Naming the new annex to the E. Barret Prettyman Courthouse after \nJudge Bryant is long overdue. I urge the Senate to take this action \nwithout further delay and allow Judge Bryant the commendation he \ndeserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/15/senate-section/article/S6667-5", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JUNE 16, 2005\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
